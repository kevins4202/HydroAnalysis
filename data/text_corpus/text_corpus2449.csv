depth reported in the literature for the basin simulation results from this study suggest an annual average recharge of almost 0 530 mm over the basin while simulations show a range of 1300 m in summer to 1400 m in autumn for groundwater table elevation annual and seasonal analysis show high spatial variability in both water table and recharge annual recharge along the limpopo main river and at the outlet of the basin was high compared to other locations in the basin groundwater table appears generally shallow in the rainy east region and along the limpopo river network summer months have the highest groundwater recharge with an average of 147 mm year over the basin followed by autumn with an average of 27 mm year spring with 3 2 mm year and winter having the lowest seasonal recharge of 0 3 mm year during the 30 year study period the simulations also suggest high spatial variability in groundwater surface water interactions in the basin s rivers rivers in the southern region show

depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater using a network of monitoring wells each of these datasets was customized from various sources into a geospatial database for the lrb 2 4 model set up and application to the study area the swat model used for this study was calibrated and evaluated for monthly streamflow in the lrb over the 1979 to 2013 period mosase et al 2019 the first five years i e 1979 1984 were used as a warm up simulation period the lrb was discretized into 871 subbasins and 13 059 hrus this calibrated model was adopted to simulate groundwater flow and land surface processes for 30 years january 1984 to december 2013 with swat modflow calibration and evaluation of the lrb swat model for streamflow simulation was performed at monthly time step at five locations throughout the basin detailed description of the calibration and evaluation approach and procedure are provided in mosase et al 2019 a total of 179 250 2000 2000 m modflow grid cells 375 rows and 478 columns was constructed for the basin extend fig 2 a of which 104 491 cells were classified as active and the remaining cells usually cells outside the river basin were categorized as inactive fig 2b an inactive cell in swat modflow is a cell that is not part of the computational domain and hence excluded from results cells overlying areas of the basin that have visible exposure of bedrock known as rock outcrops were set as inactive because these areas do not support water fluxes that would take place in non rock outcrop areas the rock outcrop constraint layer was created in arcgis fig 2b and c prior to importing files into the model modelmuse version 3 10 0 0 was used to create all input files for modflow modelmuse is a graphical user interface gui created for modflow for the creation of model input files winston 2009 the created grid for the basin i e 375 rows and 478 columns was imported into modelmuse which was used to create a two layered modflow model the top surface of the upper layer was set to coincide with groundwater surface elevation while the bottom of the lower layer was set to coincide with bedrock elevation the values assigned to the layers were calculated with inverse distance interpolation method based on dem and depth to bedrock information fig 2d and e table 1 the stress period i e period of time over which groundwater stresses remain constant was set to monthly with daily time steps for interaction with swat the basin geological information was used to determine and assign values for hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in modelmuse fig 2f the linkage files for swat modflow were created using routines in arcmap specifically the swat hru shape file was intersected with the modflow grid to allow passing of hru data to the grid cells and the swat subbasin shape file was intersected with set of modflow river cells to determine the group of river cell contained within each swat subbasin and thereby allow modflow to pass groundwater surface water flow exchange rates to swat for streamflow routing swat modflow was then run at a monthly time step for a period of 30 years 1984 2013 while swat was calibrated and evaluated for monthly streamflow swat modflow was not calibrated for groundwater fluxes due to lack of reliable field measurement for groundwater data in the basin to assess accuracy of the model with respect to water table depth the simulated water table values were compared instead with estimates of water table depth reported in other studies e g glowasis see table 1 in addition the simulated recharge was characterized as potential recharge in this study to acknowledge this issue and other uncertainties that may be associated with the results 3 results 3 1 swat modflow evaluation based on the evaluation of lrb swat as mentioned above the model was deemed performant for the present study table 2 for the calibration period all r2 are greater than 0 60 and nse values are greater than 0 50 except at gauge station 534 for the five streamflow gauge stations used for model calibration table 2 the model evaluation period suggests a stronger model performance ability with the lowest nse and r2 values being 0 57 and 0 67 respectively at gauge station 861 the most downstream gauge station these performance statistics indicate that the calibrated lrb swat model as set up for the scope of this project was able to generate streamflow prediction time series that resemble the observed data series more information about the calibrated lrb swat model is provided in mosase et al 2019 the calibrated lrb swat provided recharge data for groundwater simulations with modflow while modflow was not calibrated for the groundwater component of this project the simulated groundwater elevation is arguably comparable to water table depth reported by fan et al 2013 fig 3 fan et al 2013 generated predictions for global groundwater table depth this study created water table depth for the lrb from the global data published by fan et al 2013 which were treated as benchmark data and compared to the simulated groundwater table elevation because water table depth and groundwater elevation are different in magnitude the comparison focused on spatial patterns and trends across the five gauge stations used for swat model calibration the spatial comparison between the two datasets indicates that swat modflow is able to capture groundwater resources and flow patterns in the lrb assessment of the simulated groundwater elevation at the outlet of the five subwatersheds used for model calibration and evaluation table 2 also show comparable patterns to data obtained from fan et al 2013 fig 4 gauge station 853 has the highest groundwater table elevation followed by stations 861 207 329 and 534 fig 4 table 2 mosase et al 2019 in general upstream gauge stations located in high altitude areas show higher groundwater table elevation than their downstream counterparts which are in low altitude areas fig 4 table 2 mosase et al 2019 the uncalibrated modflow was used in this study to provide insight into potential recharge from natural precipitation in the basin 3 2 groundwater recharge simulations suggest that average annual recharge from 1984 to 2013 fig 5 likely vary between almost 0 mm probably in urban areas to 530 mm forestland with an average of 44 3 mm over the basin although there is no clear spatial pattern the simulations suggest high recharge amounts at the outlet of the basin which is south east and along the limpopo river main channel fig 5a generally the results show low recharge basinwide with more than 3 4 of the basin recharge in the range of 0 120 mm seasonal analysis of groundwater recharge shows a distinct variation between the seasons during the 30 year study period fig 6 a groundwater recharge ranges from a minimum of 0 mm in winter to a maximum of 825 mm in summer the highest groundwater recharge occurred during summer months followed by autumn spring and winter seasons this is understandable because 95 of rainfall in the basin occurs between october and april autumn recharge ranged from 0 to 296 mm year with an average of 27 mm year over the basin a range of 0 35 8 mm year with an average of 3 2 mm year over the basin was simulated for spring while winter recharge varied between 0 and 13 mm year with an average of 0 3 mm during the study period as mentioned earlier seasonal recharge follows rainfall patterns with increased recharge attributable to high rainfall events during summer and autumn months compared to low recharge associated with minimal rainfall events during winter and spring seasons results also suggest that high recharge in the east and south regions of the basin during winter and spring coincide with rainfall events in these areas during those seasons 3 3 groundwater table elevation average annual water table elevation i e elevation measured from average sea level for the lrb range from 2 m to 2800 m water table elevation was high for high terrain areas which is in the north of the basin and the drakensberg mountains located in the south while water table elevation is low along the limpopo river network and east of the basin figs 5b and 6b shallow groundwater depth coincides with these low water table elevation areas especially along the limpopo river network fig 6b similarly groundwater table elevation is low at the outlet of the basin in autumn water table elevation generally increases thus resulting in shallow water table followed by spring winter and summer months fig 6b due to the temporal patterns of recharge even though summer appears to have the highest recharge see section 3 1 fig 6a water table elevation during summer months is generally lower than that of other seasons fig 7 3 4 groundwater surface water interactions monthly time series between 1984 and 2013 of representative locations of the basin are shown in fig 8 negative values indicate seepage from the streams to the underlying aquifer while positive values indicate discharge from the aquifer to the streams annual discharge varies from 0 to 0 06 m3 s with an average of 0 01 m3 s over the whole basin whereas seepage ranges from 0 to 1 15 m3 s with an average of 0 003 m3 s for the basin the simulation results show high seepage rates in east of the basin with an exception of the basin outlet while the model suggests minimal seepage in the west fig 8 of all the 13 selected locations three locations two in south and one in north of the basin display show groundwater discharge into the streams all other locations show seepage to groundwater due to low water table elevation 4 discussion this study used swat modflow to simulate water table elevation recharge and groundwater surface water exchange rates for the lrb the results are comparable to groundwater recharge published by other researchers for the region for instance xu and beekman 2003 reported annual average recharge of 10 50 mm year for the western part of the basin while a recharge of 2 4 mm year to 69 mm year for the southern region of the basin these estimated recharge values represent 0 4 and 14 of the average annual rainfall over the basin baqa 2017 groundwater recharge does not show any specific spatial pattern however there are some locations in the eastern region and along the limpopo river network that constantly show high recharge on an annual and seasonal basis figs 5a and 6a recharge is rather localized throughout the basin figs 5a and 6a this study indicates that groundwater recharge is greater in the summer months and much less during the winter suggesting that recharge in the basin is highly dependent on rainfall manning et al 2013 petrie et al 2014 snyder 2008 xu and beekman 2003 majority of the rainfall events in the basin occur during summer months compared to other seasons lbptc 2010 mosase and ahiablame 2018 petrie et al 2014 explained that typically only large rainfall events contribute significantly to recharge in southern africa regions while recharge in the basin is mostly influenced by rainfall it does not follow the spatial pattern of rainfall where east of the basin receives more rainfall compared to the west figs 5a and 6a recharge is also affected by evapotranspiration et losses discharge losses into the streams soil properties and topographic features as well as geological characteristics of a region xu and beekman 2003 minimal recharge can still occur under heavy rainfall events if for example the underlying geological formations have a low storativity and a shallow aquifer abiye et al 2018 le maitre and colvin 2008 the simulation results show water elevation of the lrb is high in high terrain areas like north of the basin and the drakensburg mountain in the south east of the basin and vicinity of the limpopo river and its tributaries appear to have a shallow groundwater table this pattern compares well with findings from other researchers fan et al 2013 reported shallow groundwater depths for low elevation areas in the east and along the streams while the researchers reported high and deep groundwater levels in the high terrain areas of the lrb snyder 2008 also noticed the same similarities in water table elevation and surface elevation in portland oregon where shallow water table is found in low terrain areas and deep water table is found in high elevation areas groundwater table fluctuates continuously in response to changes in recharge or discharge from the underlying aquifer seasonal fluctuations of the water table elevation in the lrb are related to seasonal changes in groundwater recharge due rainfall irrigation for recharge evapotranspiration and pumping of boreholes for discharge abiye et al 2018 snyder 2008 xu and beekman 2003 groundwater level in the basin is shallower during autumn following the rainy summer period while groundwater level decreases during the summer months in response to groundwater over pumping during winter surface water groundwater interactions assessment shows that the underlying aquifers are often partially fed by seepage from streams in the lrb this could be attributed to low rainfall occurrences in the basin causing insufficient recharge to foster sustained groundwater discharge into the streams hassan et al 2014 le maitre and colvin 2008 xu and beekman 2003 additionally aquifer discharge to river systems depends on aquifer storativity and transmissivity that influence water table and groundwater discharge zones le maitre and colvin 2008 most aquifers in the lrb are shallow but due to low rainfall and high et mosase et al 2019 mosase and ahiablame 2018 discharge is rarely experienced few locations in the south of the basin seem to foster groundwater discharge into the rivers this could be due to irrigation practices water storage in dams and waste water releases into the rivers as well as natural rainfall events abiye et al 2018 these activities can result in high recharge which in turn could result in increased water table and discharge into the rivers although most streams in the basin support groundwater through seepage groundwater replenishment in the lrb is not proportional to water demand which is further compromised by et losses the lack of observed groundwater table data for model performance evaluation was a challenge to ascertain that simulated groundwater table elevation closely matches observed values however a comparison of the simulations to groundwater table depth estimated by fan et al 2013 shows similar patterns spatially and at the outlet of five subwatersheds used for model calibration and evaluation for the lrb study figs 3 and 4 where there is no data to calibrate the model researchers have often used soft data for instance seibert and mcdonnell 2002 used soft data to calibrate a three box lumped conceptual model for the maimai catchment in new zealand and found that the inclusion of the soft data led to better overall model performance and reduction of parameter uncertainty by 60 the researchers also argued that the use of soft dataset is better than the alternative of neglecting it and only using hard data in the calibration process the simulated groundwater elevations for the lrb compared to the patterns in groundwater depth give a clear indication that groundwater flow processes were somewhat correctly estimated thus it is hoped that the information presented in this study would contribute to the openly accessible information system of groundwater resources in the lrb by providing opportunities to future studies for comparison and discussion 5 summary and conclusion this study used swat modflow to characterise the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal groundwater recharge groundwater level and groundwater surface water interactions in the lrb from 1984 to 2013 the findings of this study are as follows annual average groundwater recharge groundwater table elevation and groundwater exchange rate over the entire basin are 44 mm 1406 m and 0 04 m3 s respectively groundwater recharge does not show any specific spatial pattern although some locations in east and along the limpopo river network consistently show high recharge groundwater level is shallow in the eastern region and along the streams network analysis of water fluxes between groundwater and surface water reveals seepage in most of the 13 groundwater surface interaction locations examined except three locations where groundwater discharge occurred during the simulation period seasonal assessment shows limited recharge and limited water exchange between groundwater and surface water in winter the simulation results reveal more recharge and more groundwater surface water exchanges in summer compared to autumn followed by spring and winter months results from this study provide an insight about groundwater recharge in the lrb the recharge of 150 mm year simulated in this study over the basin corresponds approximately to 15 of annual rainfall in addition most of the streams in the lrb seep to groundwater indicating that natural replenishment of groundwater resources is not proportional to water demand and et losses in the basin this provides an opportunity for implementation of infiltration practices such as recharge ponds and green infrastructure practices in the basin acknowledgments

input files winston 2009 the created grid for the basin i e 375 rows and 478 columns was imported into modelmuse which was used to create a two layered modflow model the top surface of the upper layer was set to coincide with groundwater surface elevation while the bottom of the lower layer was set to coincide with bedrock elevation the values assigned to the layers were calculated with inverse distance interpolation method based on dem and depth to bedrock information fig 2d and e table 1 the stress period i e period of time over which groundwater stresses remain constant was set to monthly with daily time steps for interaction with swat the basin geological information was used to determine and assign values for hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in modelmuse fig 2f the linkage files for swat modflow were created using routines in arcmap specifically the swat hru shape file was intersected with the modflow grid to allow passing of hru data to the grid cells and the swat subbasin shape file was intersected with set of modflow river cells to determine the group of river cell contained within each swat subbasin and thereby allow modflow to pass groundwater surface water flow exchange rates to swat for streamflow routing swat modflow was then run at a monthly time step for a period of 30 years 1984 2013 while swat was calibrated and evaluated for monthly streamflow swat modflow was not calibrated for groundwater fluxes due to lack of reliable field measurement for groundwater data in the basin to assess accuracy of the model with respect to water table depth the simulated water table values were compared instead with estimates of water table depth reported in other studies e g glowasis see table 1 in addition the simulated recharge was characterized as potential recharge in this study to acknowledge this issue and other uncertainties that may be associated with the results 3 results 3 1 swat modflow evaluation based on the evaluation of lrb swat as mentioned above the model was deemed performant for the present study table 2 for the calibration period all r2 are greater than 0 60 and nse values are greater than 0 50 except at gauge station 534 for the five streamflow gauge stations used for model calibration table 2 the model evaluation period suggests a stronger model performance ability with the lowest nse and r2 values being 0 57 and 0 67 respectively at gauge station 861 the most downstream gauge station these performance statistics indicate that the calibrated lrb swat model as set up for the scope of this project was able to generate streamflow prediction time series that resemble the observed data series more information about the calibrated lrb swat model is provided in mosase et al 2019 the calibrated lrb swat provided recharge data for groundwater simulations with modflow while modflow was not calibrated for the groundwater component of this project the simulated groundwater elevation is arguably comparable to water table depth reported by fan et al 2013 fig 3 fan et al 2013 generated predictions for global groundwater table depth this study created water table depth for the lrb from the global data published by fan et al 2013 which were treated as benchmark data and compared to the simulated groundwater table elevation because water table depth and groundwater elevation are different in magnitude the comparison focused on spatial patterns and trends across the five gauge stations used for swat model calibration the spatial comparison between the two datasets indicates that swat modflow is able to capture groundwater resources and flow patterns in the lrb assessment of the simulated groundwater elevation at the outlet of the five subwatersheds used for model calibration and evaluation table 2 also show comparable patterns to data obtained from fan et al 2013 fig 4 gauge station 853 has the highest groundwater table elevation followed by stations 861 207 329 and 534 fig 4 table 2 mosase et al 2019 in general upstream gauge stations located in high altitude areas show higher groundwater table elevation than their downstream counterparts which are in low altitude areas fig 4 table 2 mosase et al 2019 the uncalibrated modflow was used in this study to provide insight into potential recharge from natural precipitation in the basin 3 2 groundwater recharge simulations suggest that average annual recharge from 1984 to 2013 fig 5 likely vary between almost 0 mm probably in urban areas to 530 mm forestland with an average of 44 3 mm over the basin although there is no clear spatial pattern the simulations suggest high recharge amounts at the outlet of the basin which is south east and along the limpopo river main channel fig 5a generally the results show low recharge basinwide with more than 3 4 of the basin recharge in the range of 0 120 mm seasonal analysis of groundwater recharge shows a distinct variation between the seasons during the 30 year study period fig 6 a groundwater recharge ranges from a minimum of 0 mm in winter to a maximum of 825 mm in summer the highest groundwater recharge occurred during summer months followed by autumn spring and winter seasons this is understandable because 95 of rainfall in the basin occurs between october and april autumn recharge ranged from 0 to 296 mm year with an average of 27 mm year over the basin a range of 0 35 8 mm year with an average of 3 2 mm year over the basin was simulated for spring while winter recharge varied between 0 and 13 mm year with an average of 0 3 mm during the study period as mentioned earlier seasonal recharge follows rainfall patterns with increased recharge attributable to high rainfall events during summer and autumn months compared to low recharge associated with minimal rainfall events during winter and spring seasons results also suggest that high recharge in the east and south regions of the basin during winter and spring coincide with rainfall events in these areas during those seasons 3 3 groundwater table elevation average annual water table elevation i e elevation measured from average sea level for the lrb range from 2 m to 2800 m water table elevation was high for high terrain areas which is in the north of the basin and the drakensberg mountains located in the south while water table elevation is low along the limpopo river network and east of the basin figs 5b and 6b shallow groundwater depth coincides with these low water table elevation areas especially along the limpopo river network fig 6b similarly groundwater table elevation is low at the outlet of the basin in autumn water table elevation generally increases thus resulting in shallow water table followed by spring winter and summer months fig 6b due to the temporal patterns of recharge even though summer appears to have the highest recharge see section 3 1 fig 6a water table elevation during summer months is generally lower than that of other seasons fig 7 3 4 groundwater surface water interactions monthly time series between 1984 and 2013 of representative locations of the basin are shown in fig 8 negative values indicate seepage from the streams to the underlying aquifer while positive values indicate discharge from the aquifer to the streams annual discharge varies from 0 to 0 06 m3 s with an average of 0 01 m3 s over the whole basin whereas seepage ranges from 0 to 1 15 m3 s with an average of 0 003 m3 s for the basin the simulation results show high seepage rates in east of the basin with an exception of the basin outlet while the model suggests minimal seepage in the west fig 8 of all the 13 selected locations three locations two in south and one in north of the basin display show groundwater discharge into the streams all other locations show seepage to groundwater due to low water table elevation 4 discussion this study used swat modflow to simulate water table elevation recharge and groundwater surface water exchange rates for the lrb the results are comparable to groundwater recharge published by other researchers for the region for instance xu and beekman 2003 reported annual average recharge of 10 50 mm year for the western part of the basin while a recharge of 2 4 mm year to 69 mm year for the southern region of the basin these estimated recharge values represent 0 4 and 14 of the average annual rainfall over the basin baqa 2017 groundwater recharge does not show any specific spatial pattern however there are some locations in the eastern region and along the limpopo river network that constantly show high recharge on an annual and seasonal basis figs 5a and 6a recharge is rather localized throughout the basin figs 5a and 6a this study indicates that groundwater recharge is greater in the summer months and much less during the winter suggesting that recharge in the basin is highly dependent on rainfall manning et al 2013 petrie et al 2014 snyder 2008 xu and beekman 2003 majority of the rainfall events in the basin occur during summer months compared to other seasons lbptc 2010 mosase and ahiablame 2018 petrie et al 2014 explained that typically only large rainfall events contribute significantly to recharge in southern africa regions while recharge in the basin is mostly influenced by rainfall it does not follow the spatial pattern of rainfall where east of the basin receives more rainfall compared to the west figs 5a and 6a recharge is also affected by evapotranspiration et losses discharge losses into the streams soil properties and topographic features as well as geological characteristics of a region xu and beekman 2003 minimal recharge can still occur under heavy rainfall events if for example the underlying geological formations have a low storativity and a shallow aquifer abiye et al 2018 le maitre and colvin 2008 the simulation results show water elevation of the lrb is high in high terrain areas like north of the basin and the drakensburg mountain in the south east of the basin and vicinity of the limpopo river and its tributaries appear to have a shallow groundwater table this pattern compares well with findings from other researchers fan et al 2013 reported shallow groundwater depths for low elevation areas in the east and along the streams while the researchers reported high and deep groundwater levels in the high terrain areas of the lrb snyder 2008 also noticed the same similarities in water table elevation and surface elevation in portland oregon where shallow water table is found in low terrain areas and deep water table is found in high elevation areas groundwater table fluctuates continuously in response to changes in recharge or discharge from the underlying aquifer seasonal fluctuations of the water table elevation in the lrb are related to seasonal changes in groundwater recharge due rainfall irrigation for recharge evapotranspiration and pumping of boreholes for discharge abiye et al 2018 snyder 2008 xu and beekman 2003 groundwater level in the basin is shallower during autumn following the rainy summer period while groundwater level decreases during the summer months in response to groundwater over pumping during winter surface water groundwater interactions assessment shows that the underlying aquifers are often partially fed by seepage from streams in the lrb this could be attributed to low rainfall occurrences in the basin causing insufficient recharge to foster sustained groundwater discharge into the streams hassan et al 2014 le maitre and colvin 2008 xu and beekman 2003 additionally aquifer discharge to river systems depends on aquifer storativity and transmissivity that influence water table and groundwater discharge zones le maitre and colvin 2008 most aquifers in the lrb are shallow but due to low rainfall and high et mosase et al 2019 mosase and ahiablame 2018 discharge is rarely experienced few locations in the south of the basin seem to foster groundwater discharge into the rivers this could be due to irrigation practices water storage in dams and waste water releases into the rivers as well as natural rainfall events abiye et al 2018 these activities can result in high recharge which in turn could result in increased water table and discharge into the rivers although most streams in the basin support groundwater through seepage groundwater replenishment in the lrb is not proportional to water demand which is further compromised by et losses the lack of observed groundwater table data for model performance evaluation was a challenge to ascertain that simulated groundwater table elevation closely matches observed values however a comparison of the simulations to groundwater table depth estimated by fan et al 2013 shows similar patterns spatially and at the outlet of five subwatersheds used for model calibration and evaluation for the lrb study figs 3 and 4 where there is no data to calibrate the model researchers have often used soft data for instance seibert and mcdonnell 2002 used soft data to calibrate a three box lumped conceptual model for the maimai catchment in new zealand and found that the inclusion of the soft data led to better overall model performance and reduction of parameter uncertainty by 60 the researchers also argued that the use of soft dataset is better than the alternative of neglecting it and only using hard data in the calibration process the simulated groundwater elevations for the lrb compared to the patterns in groundwater depth give a clear indication that groundwater flow processes were somewhat correctly estimated thus it is hoped that the information presented in this study would contribute to the openly accessible information system of groundwater resources in the lrb by providing opportunities to future studies for comparison and discussion 5 summary and conclusion this study used swat modflow to characterise the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal groundwater recharge groundwater level and groundwater surface water interactions in the lrb from 1984 to 2013 the findings of this study are as follows annual average groundwater recharge groundwater table elevation and groundwater exchange rate over the entire basin are 44 mm 1406 m and 0 04 m3 s respectively groundwater recharge does not show any specific spatial pattern although some locations in east and along the limpopo river network consistently show high recharge groundwater level is shallow in the eastern region and along the streams network analysis of water fluxes between groundwater and surface water reveals seepage in most of the 13 groundwater surface interaction locations examined except three locations where groundwater discharge occurred during the simulation period seasonal assessment shows limited recharge and limited water exchange between groundwater and surface water in winter the simulation results reveal more recharge and more groundwater surface water exchanges in summer compared to autumn followed by spring and winter months results from this study provide an insight about groundwater recharge in the lrb the recharge of 150 mm year simulated in this study over the basin corresponds approximately to 15 of annual rainfall in addition most of the streams in the lrb seep to groundwater indicating that natural replenishment of groundwater resources is not proportional to water demand and et losses in the basin this provides an opportunity for implementation of infiltration practices such as recharge ponds and green infrastructure practices in the basin acknowledgments

12246,arsenic as is a naturally occurring metalloid which has been recognized as a class 1 carcinogen by the international agency of research on cancer iarc the metalloid finds its way into the food chain through natural and anthropogenic processes human activities especially farming practices is a major contributor of as buildup in agricultural soils arsenic taken up by the plant roots negatively affect plant productivity by disturbing various metabolic processes such as adenosine triphosphate atp formation and enzyme activation in plants managing as contaminated water reduces the health risks associated with as contaminated food the purpose of this review is to focus on the information regarding the metalloid build up especially in the soil plant system and ground water consider the various approaches investigated to decrease its contents and consequences on the human food chain a critical review of the literature suggests that the contamination of the human food chain can be controlled through careful selection and application of water purification techniques with other agronomic practices graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic metalloid food chain water treatment 1 introduction arsenic as is the 20th most abundant element in the earth s crust some evidence indicates that as was utilized as an energy resource by some initial inhabitants and was available in the plentiful amount on the primordial earth s surface roy and mcdonald 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 natural processes such as volcanic eruptions geological dissolution of these minerals with the water cause these elements to surface again and increase the exposure of life on planet in addition anthropogenic activities such as pesticides containing as and mining also contributed to building up of its concentration in some soils khan and umar 2019 prathap and chakraborty 2019 abedin et al 2002a higher as concentration in soil has been documented in argentina china chile taiwan mexico south africa bangladesh india and pakistan ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 kumar et al 2019 mushtaq et al 2018 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 litter et al 2019 severe as contamination has been found in the bengal basin india and bangladesh where millions of the people are threatened to as poisoning due to the consumption of unsafe tube wells water containing as higher than 10 μg l saha et al 2018 ahsan and del valls 2011 zhao et al 2010 inorganic as species as iii and as v have a strong cytotoxic effect to both macrophages and lymphocytes in human beings consequently as toxicity leads to hypersensitivity responses impairment of function and loss of adhesion moreover as prompts the overexpression of keratinocyte derived growth factors that lead to as induced skin cancer and hyperkeratosis islam 2015 in light of the present scenario of as contamination its dietary intake is causing serious concerns due to its higher potential for bio accumulation zhao et al 2010 the majority of the recent reported literature focuses on toxicity crisis originating due to consuming as polluted ground water chakraborti et al 2018 shahid et al 2018 ahmad et al 2018a b mandal 2017 shahid et al 2015 in this review we review not only the sources of as in soil and plants but also discussed the ways and means by which as buildup in food chain can be minimized 2 arsenic in soil plant systems 2 1 sources of arsenic in soil in lithosphere as concentration ranges between 1 5 and 2 mg kg adriano 2001 it is constituent of more than 245 minerals including arsenates 60 compounds silicates 20 and sulfides and sulfosalts 20 mandal and suzuki 2002 there are many sources of as in the environment which includes natural and anthropogenic sources volcanic eruptions rocks mineralization and forest fires release a large amount of as into the environment are the natural sources zheng et al 2011 o reilly et al 2010 while the use of pesticides insecticides phosphate containing fertilizers pulp for paper production fossil fuel mining and smelting industrial processes are the major anthropogenic sources of as in the environment bundschuh et al 2011 mondal et al 2006 matschullat 2000 an elevated concentration of as up to 3 as in the soil is present in the adjacent areas of as deposits and its concentration decreases as the distance increase from the source sites zhang and selim 2008 industrial activities are also a source of as for example in the early 20th century glass industries disposed of rich as wastes madejón and lepp 2007 soil parent material is also a contributory factor for as in the soil garcia sanchez and alvarez ayuso 2003 mining activities enhances its occurrence in natural environments ore deposits with sulfide with few other rocks such as sandstones shales and phosphate rocks also have to some hundreds of mg kg of as baur and onishi 1978 arsenic is mobilized by weathering processes and microbial activities in addition to parent material soil conditions and properties may also affect the weathering processes and release as into the soil ramos miras et al 2014 observed that the total as content in soils was related with parent material while iron aluminum clay content soil organic matter soil ph were the main regulatory factors of as in the soil tabassum et al 2019 in addition to all these sources residual presence of organic dimethylarsinic acid used in past as a pesticide still acts as a source of as in the environment arsenic contaminated soils are also a growing concern in recreational lands that were previously used as an agricultural land time is an important factor for controlling the degree and strength of as retention in the soil a study conducted to evaluate the effect of soil aging on as fractionation in the soil the results showed that at the start of the experiment maximum as was present as soluble fraction and with the passage of time the soluble fraction changed into insoluble fraction quazi et al 2010 furthermore the soil depth also has an effect on the distribution pattern of as in soil the soil of the upper horizons has a maximum dtpa extractable as fraction as compared to the lower horizons the concentrations of as ranging from 10 to 40 mg kg in soil is found with no known natural sources of contamination fitz and wenzel 2002 mandal and suzuki 2002 long term use of phosphatic fertilizers also acts as a source of as in soil now a day the quantity of as is very low in phosphate fertilizers but historically higher amounts of as were present in these fertilizers soil fertilized with phosphate fertilizers since 1856 showed a higher concentration of as in soils even after many years hartley et al 2013 another source of as in the soil is organo arsenic feed additives widely used in the world liu et al 2015 due to concentrated animal feeding operations and animal waste application to the soil may results in a higher concentration of as contamination in these soils sarwar et al 2019 groundwater contamination with as depends on its mobilization in the environment under natural conditions the geology morphology and hydrology of a geological location are also important for the presence of higher amounts of as in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2007 arsenic concentration in groundwater reaches 1000 μg l in different places around the world table 1 tuli et al 2010 survey of rice fields showed higher as levels in areas where as contaminated groundwater has been used for irrigation purpose moreover a significant positive correlation between soils as level with tube well age has been found arsenic levels in the highly contaminated zone were 46 μg g dry soils compared to 10 μg g in areas with low levels of as in the groundwater meharg and rahman 2003 the occurrence of as in groundwater is natural table 1 and it depends on the geology ph elevation of the area soil organic matter and soil iron contents hossain and piantanakulchai 2013 al mamun et al 2019 bedrocks of the area primarily controls the concentration of as in groundwater bondu et al 2017 geochemical conditions of subsurface aquifers may also have an effect on the release of as in groundwater reducing conditions of aquifers promote the dissolution and desorption of as in the groundwater anawar et al 2003 in dry climate the total concentration of as is contributed by evaporative concentration tisserand et al 2014 in deep aquifers sorption of as on iron aluminum and manganese minerals restrict its leaching in the groundwater but in shallow aquifers leaching occurs due to high ph and bicarbonates concentrations under these geochemical circumstances desorption of above mentioned anions and oxyanions act as a key process for as mobilization annaduzzaman et al 2018 han et al 2013 nicolli et al 2010 volcanic materials are also a reason for high as concentrations in shallow groundwater aquifers in addition to bulk rock geochemistry composition of the groundwater e g ph carbonate or other anions microbial populations and physical parameters also control the as in groundwater lima et al 2019 shahid et al 2018 muñoz et al 2016 das et al 2015 2 2 factors affecting arsenic mobilization and availability in soil soil characteristics affect the speciation pattern and form inorganic vs organic of as species in soil soil aeration affects the solubility and mobility of as in soil beesley et al 2010 arsenic is less soluble in well aerated soils than other trace elements yamane et al 1976 under well aerated conditions as concentration remains 50 nm in non contaminated soil solutions while in contaminated soils the concentration may reach up to 2 μm moreno jiménez et al 2010 wenzel et al 2002 in contrast soil anaerobic conditions promote the reduction of the as v to as iii with increased toxicity solubility and plant availability xu et al 2008 takahashi et al 2004 arsenic speciation changes according to changes in conditions or handling of soil carbonell barrachina et al 1999 dissolution of fe hydroxides is one reason for rapid mobility of as iii under reducing conditions gräfe and sparks 2006 takahashi et al 2004 and microbial processes may also transform as v to as iii islam et al 2004 however as may co precipitate with iron sulfur in highly reducing conditions and compounds such as arsenopyrite or arsenic sulfides ass as2s3 may form soil properties such as soil texture influences as mobility owing to differences of charges on the soil surface that controls the adsorption and desorption processes in soil soils rich in clay and fe oxides have a higher as retention potential in comparison to coarse textured soils heikens et al 2007 heikens et al 2007 fitz and wenzel 2002 the phytotoxicity of as is five times less in clayey soil than loamy and sandy soils sheppard 1992 higher as uptake and concentrations in plants were observed in plants grown in the loamy sand than silty clay loam soils o neill 1995 similarly as adsorption desorption processes are also affected by some other soil properties especially ph quazi et al 2011 fitz and wenzel 2002 different inorganic soil components such as monodentate bidentate mononuclear and bidentate binuclear complexes and as form surface complexes depending upon the ph o reilly et al 2001 fendorf et al 1997 it is evident from several studies that as v is sorbed more than as iii in a wide range of ph in contrast the sorption of as v is less than as iii on ferrihydrite violante et al 2010 studies suggest that low ph ph 5 increases as mobility and solubility signes pastor et al 2007 marin et al 1993 which results in the increased concentration of as in plants tu and ma 2003 at higher soil ph the uptake of as is also improved due to increase in ph dependent charges that may increase as desorption from iron oxides hence enhance its concentration in root vicinity streat et al 2008 fitz and wenzel 2002 campbell 1985 soil organic matter om forms soluble and insoluble complexes with as therefore it can have a significant effect on as mobility in the soil organic matter can influence as mobility and phyto availability by changing redox potential providing adsorption sites and by forming aqueous complexes soluble organic compounds play an important role in soluble adsorbed as distribution in agricultural soils by using the metal bridging mechanism organic matter metal complexes may strongly bind as in this way the soluble organic complex formation can reduce as availability to crops lin et al 2004 paikaray et al 2005 reported that formation of as complex with om greatly reduces the as availability to plants and consequently its accumulation in edible plant parts i e rice grains fu et al 2011 rahman and hasegawa 2011 wuana and okieimen 2011 on contrary om may also results in mobilization of as that may results in contamination of groundwater a study conducted to investigate the role of om in the mobilization of as showed that om change the solubility and mobility of as in groundwater through redox reactions an increment in as mobility was reported in agricultural soils with the use of cow dung urunmatsoma et al 2010 it was supported by another study where the use of olive mill waste compost significantly increased the as solubility and its mobility in agricultural soils moreno jiménez et al 2013 metal transformation through microbes is generally divided into two major categories which include conversions of inorganic to organic form and vice versa and redox conversions of metals from oxidized to reduced conditions microbes are able to attain energy through oxidation of fe sulfur mn and as santini et al 2000 tebo et al 1997 for instance a pseudomonas strain can produce energy for metabolic processes from the as iii oxidation ilyaletdinov and abdrashitova 1981 microbes mediate the transformation of organic as to inorganic and between as v to as iii zhao et al 2013 oremland and stolz 2003 meharg and hartley whitaker 2002 microbes generally involved in the redox cycling of elemental sulfur to sulfate and to sulfide wainwright 1984 sulfate reducing bacteria reduce so4 2 to s 2 which immediately reacts with fe2 generally present at reduction sites to form fes murase and kimura 1997 it has been proved that the formation of sulfide through microbes in as ferrihydrite systems leads to transformation and dissolution of the as bearing ferrihydrite arsenite rapidly oxidize to as v by thermus thermophiles and thermus aquaticus but they were not capable to grow with as iii as an energy source through dissimilatory reduction as v can be reduced to as iii as the result of as v usage by microorganisms during anaerobic respiration for instance certain bacteria staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli have detoxifying reductase arsc enzyme a plasmid encoded that reduces as v to as iii for its rapid extrusion from the cell ji et al 1994 2 3 arsenic transfer from soil to plants and its toxicity in plants plants acquisition of minerals is through root uptake from soils uzu et al 2009 sharma and dubey 2005 various factors control the dynamics of as in the rhizosphere such as the formation of iron plaque phosphate status soil oxidation reduction status inter conversion between organic and inorganic as species also affects the transportation of as across the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells furthermore soil parent material and clay contents type play a vital role in the regulation of as in soil solution because of its role in precipitation and binding of poorly soluble as minerals meharg 2004 the concentration of as in plants depends on its ability to uptake and transport as from soil to root and shoots the uptake ability of as by plants varies from species to species among cultivated crops rice is efficient in as uptake bhattacharya et al 2009 further speciation pattern of different as species also contribute in as accumulation by the plants arsenate is a chemical analog to inorganic phosphate and is efficiently taken up by the plant roots through inorganic phosphate transporter wu et al 2011 the amount of as in plants can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the inorganic phosphate or by suppressing the inorganic phosphate transporters or by its activity at the plasma membrane through genetic means catarecha et al 2007 shin et al 2004 once as v uptake into plant root through different inorganic phosphate transporters it moves easily from one cell to the other arsenate is uploaded to the xylem vessels through inorganic phosphate transport proteins mendoza cózatl et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 while as non hyperaccumulators retained the majority of as v into the plant s roots ma et al 2008 meharg and jardine 2003 on the other hand in rice plants nodulin 26 like plasma membrane proteins lsi1 and lsi2 are also responsible for as iii uptake and transport lsi1 is entry path and its mutation results in a significant decrease in as iii uptake while lsi2 helps to mediate as iii loading to xylem a significant decrease in as accumulation was reported in plants after lsi2 mutation these transporters are able to uptake both as iii and silicic acid as these both have similar chemical properties although there are other transporters which are also involved in the transport of as iii however lsi1 and lsi2 are considered as the major as iii transporters in rice due to their higher expression in the roots ma et al 2008 in soil stoma water anaerobic conditions submerged are responsible for the release of the adsorbed as v and reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides khan et al 2010 in rice anaerobic conditions cause reduction of as v to as iii which enhances the as level in plants takahashi et al 2004 marin et al 1993 arsenate reduction to as iii and its subsequent sequestration into the vacuole in plant roots is considered as major as detoxification mechanism pickering et al 2000 the reduction of as v follows enzymatic and non enzymatic pathways the non enzymatic reduction of as v require two glutathione molecules delnomdedieu et al 1994 while enzymatic pathway is triggered by as v reductase which is much speedy processes duan et al 2007 bleeker et al 2006 in addition to as reductase enzymes the enzymes from other systems also have the ability to reduce as v i e glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and f1fo atp synthase in the mitochondria németi et al 2010 gregus and németi 2002 moreover instead of inorganic phosphate these enzymes incorporate as v into the biological molecules and forms an arseno esters although inorganic as species are less mobile within the plant the presence of as in shoots and grains shows its limited mobility raab et al 2007 a study demonstrated that 90 of the as in the roots and shoots was in the form of as iii xu et al 2008 dhankher et al 2002 pickering et al 2000 in addition cultivation condition favoring oxidized as form results in a marked decline in as accumulation in the rice spanu et al 2012 somenahally et al 2011 li et al 2009 therefore water management can be a promising strategy to decrease the as bioavailability in soils and its subsequent uptake by the plants hu et al 2013 rahman and hasegawa 2011 arao et al 2009 the world health organization food and agriculture organization who fao permit a conditional tolerable weekly intake of inorganic as less than 15 μg kg body weight kohlmeyer et al 2003 however an adult with 60 kg body weight consuming 450 g of rice rice grain containing as 0 11 mg kg and 4 l of water containing as 10 μg l per day exceeds the fao and who dietary intake limits of 130 μg as per day duxbury and zavala 2005 the toxicity of as is influenced by its oxidation state and chemical form generally in comparison to organic as species the inorganic form is more toxic sun et al 2014 these inorganic as species as iii and as v are the most poisonous forms of as to living organisms it is projected that more than 100 million people mostly in developing countries are at risk of being poisoned by as table 2 sharma et al 2014 arsenic accumulation in plants depends upon its concentration ph and redox conditions of the growing medium various hydroponic experiments have proved that in addition to above mentioned factors exposure time and as chemical species are also a contributory factor in its uptake and translocation in plants abbas and meharg 2008 marin et al 1992 results of different hydroponic studies on 46 various plant species indicated that plants as uptake follows the order as as iii as v mma v dma v while the translocation order from root to shoot was dma v mma v as v as iii raab et al 2007 higher concentration of as may be lethal for the plants as it interacts with metabolic processes in plants mostly plants are able to restrict as accumulation in shoots but some specific species such as rice is able to translocate as in above ground plant parts in usa and australia straight head a disease name because empty panicles and another name parrot beak due to misshaped grains is a sign of as toxicity in plants williams et al 1999 hewitt 1912 reported straight head disease which was dramatically affecting grain yield in the us the first time it was reported by collier 1912 in the early 1900s the straight head disease was responsible to reduce rice grain yield up to 12 15 that was approximately 20 of the us rice acreage later the straight head disease was also reported in different countries like portugal called branca japan thailand australia and argentina dunn et al 2006 weerapat and promchainan 1980 plant physiological processes are affected by as in plants arsenic stress leads to the over production of reactive oxidation species ros that leads to peroxidation of membrane lipids and damage to amino acids purine nucleoids and nucleic acids and protein in plants may occur symptoms of as toxicity in rice includes delayed seed germination chlorosis and necrosis in leaves reduced plant growth and decreased grain yields rai et al 2011 huq et al 2006 gulz et al 2005 reduction in growth photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content are considered the most damaging effects of as stoeva et al 2005 disorder in miotic index dna fragmentation and mitotic arrays of microtubules were also observed in roots of pisum sativum upon as exposure faria and navarro 2010 morphological changes decreased plant biomass less fruit yield under as treatment are reported in different plants shaibur et al 2008 hartley whitaker 2001 arsenate replaces phosphate moiety and interferes in oxidative phosphorylation by forming as v adduct and atp synthesis in mitochondria wickes et al 1976 formation of arsenate adp ester bond leads to its auto hydrolysis in a futile cycle and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation it decreases the ability of cells to produce atp to carry out normal metabolic process in the cell finnegan and chen 2012 arsenate also seems to disturb the assimilation of nitrogen soil provides nitrogen to non legumes mainly in the form of nitrate or ammonium glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase play critical role during the assimilation of nitrogen into glutamate that acts as precursor of all the amino acids foyer and shigeoka 2011 rice roots treated with as v has lower transcripts for ammonium and nitrate transporters norton et al 2008 in addition as v may also interact with thiol and sulfhydryl groups of proteins and cysteine and different antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase gsh and superoxide dismutase sod foyer and shigeoka 2011 furthermore as v affect abscisic acid metabolism primary and secondary cell wall metabolism in a similar way as iii binds to sulfhydryl groups and effects protein functioning zhao et al 2010 a sharp decline in total protein content was observed in rice as compared to control when the plants were treated with as iii upadhyay et al 2016 the decline in plant growth parameters was in parallel with ros production in arabidopsis plants gupta et al 2013 oxidative damage due to overproduction of ros after as stress was reported in many plants like pteris vitata sundaram et al 2008 oryza sativa shri et al 2009 vicia faba lin and liao 2008 and pteris ensiformis and phseolus singh et al 2007 in the terrestrial environment methylated forms of as v are common and are reduced into more cytotoxic methylated as iii forms so these are of concern as they have the potential to disrupt plant metabolism more strongly even at a lower concentration than the inorganic species however the uptake of methylated as species is less than inorganic as species abbas and meharg 2008 abedin et al 2002b although the translocation of these species is significantly greater within the plants than as iii and as v carey et al 2011 li et al 2009 marin et al 1992 3 remedies for arsenic buildup in soil plant systems 3 1 arsenic removal technologies from the ground water the most commonly used method for the removal of as from the water includes adsorption lime treatment precipitation co precipitation oxidation reduction filtration ion exchange resin and membrane technology ahmad et al 2017 litter et al 2010 ravenscroft et al 2009 sharma and sohn 2009 each method with deficiencies and shortcoming are already presented in detail by ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2017 and litter et al 2010 here below each methodology its mechanism for as removal and their efficiencies are presented table 3 and discussed 3 1 1 oxidation and titanium dioxide based technology generally the methods which are designed for removing iron and manganese from water are referred to as oxidation and filtration barloková and ilavský 2010 nicomel et al 2015 the main objective of oxidation is the conversion of soluble as iii to as v which eventually co precipitated with the iron oxyhydroxides guan et al 2009 oxidation is a compulsory step as as iii is the major form of as in groundwater under anoxic conditions maity et al 2017 sorg et al 2014 kim et al 2002 traditional chemical oxidants such as ozone hydrogen peroxide chlorine chlorine dioxide ferrate and permanganate have been reported for the oxidation of as iii to as v ahmad et al 2018a b podder and majumder 2016 mondal et al 2013 guan et al 2009 sharma et al 2007 vasudevan et al 2006 ghurye and clifford 2004 bissen and frimmel 2003b lee et al 2003 johnston et al 2001 emett and khoe 2001 manganese oxide minerals mn oxides are cheap easily available and efficient oxidizing agents that may be employed in redox processes of as ahmad et al 2019 liu et al 2005 studies the kmno4 as an oxidizer of as iii and the author found that at the optimum concentration of kmno4 fe iii competing ions and ph paly critical role in oxidation processes guan et al 2009 similarly conversion of about 54 57 as iii to as v in polluted groundwater by using pure oxygen has been reported by kim and nriagu 2000 however the reaction rate for oxidation of as iii to as v can be increased by using chlorine ozone and permanganate in comparison to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and nh2cl ghurye and clifford 2004 lee et al 2003 hydrogen peroxide and nh2cl require hours to oxidize as iii while the other oxidants for example chlorine ozone and permanganate only need millisecond time scale for such oxidation reaction sorlini and gialdini 2010 but the presence of scavenger substances may influence the fast kinetics of oxidation processes such as feo4 2 if present in water however selection of specific oxidants for the specific reaction can lessen the effect of scavengers on the activity of oxidants ozonation is a better procedure for as removal from water samples than chlorination as it contains ammonia and ozone has a slow reaction with ammonia rather than with chlorine uv irradiation may be used for increasing the oxidation rate of as iii in water in the presence of oxygen moreover by photolysis of iron species solar light uv can also be helpful for hydroxyl radical production that may lead to increase oxidation rate sharma et al 2007 yoon and lee 2005 photo catalytic oxidation is one of the efficient methods for the oxidation of as iii to as v as reported in different studies miller et al 2011 miller and zimmerman 2010 ferguson and hering 2006 pena et al 2005 2006 bang et al 2005b dutta et al 2004 bissen et al 2001 in the past anodic oxidation has been used as an environment friendly technology for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants zhao et al 2009 vaghela et al 2005 vlyssides et al 2004 bunce et al 1997 it was reported that the as iii oxidation on a commercial dimensional stable anode dsa by using the process of electrocoagulation can enhance the removal of as iii zhao et al 2010 at large current densities das can oxidize the as iii completely lacasa et al 2012 titanium dioxide tio2 is known as one of the efficient materials for the removal of as from water due to its least toxicity chemical and physical stability corrosion resistivity high affinity to as and easy preparation nabi et al 2009 balaji and matsunaga 2002 it serves as adsorbent for the as v from the water jézéquel and chu 2006 pena et al 2005 dutta et al 2004 there are two aspects of tio2 application for the removal of as in the presence of sunlight radiation or uv light it can work as a photocatalyst as well as an adsorbent but in the absence of irradiation it only works as an adsorbent guan et al 2012 different tio2 types i e nano crystalline tio2 particles hydrous tio2 titanate nanotubes and granular tio2 have been reported in the literature guan et al 2012 bang et al 2005a concluded that the granular tio2 had a lot of adsorption capacity at neutral ph for as iii and as v while the kinetics of adsorption for as v was faster than as iii however some other studies reported that the tio2 based adsorbent has the same removal capacities for both as v and as iii or even may have higher capacities for as iii at acidic or at neutral conditions pirilä et al 2011 jegadeesan et al 2010 pena et al 2005 in various experiments 100 oxidation of as iii has been reported by the process of photo oxidation and by using tio2 as a catalyst tsimas et al 2009 ferguson et al 2005 dutta et al 2005 lee and choi 2002 yang et al 1999 by using a solar simulator which emit visible and ultraviolet radiations bissen et al 2001 increased photo oxidation activity tio2 for the oxidation of as iii to as v in aqueous tio2 suspensions a first order kinetics reported in this study shows that as iii completely oxidized into as v within minutes and an exponential decline in as concentration was recorded a highly efficient oxidation of as iii to as v was recorded in tio2 suspension by illuminating with uv in the presence of dissolved oxygen it was noted that the initial photocatalytic oxidation rate was faster for as iii at ph 9 and ph 3 lee and choi 2002 in the biogeochemical cycling of as microbial oxidation of as is widely accepted by researchers microbes involved in as oxidation includes bacteria and archaea bacterial oxidation of as can be categorized into autotrophic as iii oxidation and heterotrophic as iii oxidation oremland and stolz 2003 bacterial oxidation of as iii involves a key enzyme as iii oxidase lett et al 2012 the expression of as iii oxidase enzyme is regulated by as concentration katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2006 bacterial species and strains with higher expression level of as iii oxidase can be screened and employed for the efficient oxidation of as iii and its subsequent removal through employing different techniques 3 1 2 coagulation and electrocoagulation in the process of coagulation metal based coagulants e g ferric chloride are added to as contaminated water in water ferric chloride converts into positively charged ferric hydroxide for the effective removal of as it must be oxidized from as iii to as v sancha 2006 precipitation of as in the form of calcium arsenate as adsorbed to fe oxide surfaces are the most commonly used method for the removal of as it is possible to remove about 90 of as by coagulation choong et al 2007 for the formation of as v adsorption on the iron surface ferric salts are added to as contaminated water höll 2010 for the removal of as iii peroxidation is required by using sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide for the conversion of as iii to as v aluminum sulfate has also been reported as an efficient coagulant by bilici baskan and pala 2010 fe iii is a powerful non toxic coagulant which is a by product of fe vi yngard et al 2008 sharma et al 2005 sharma 2004 2002 and it is very suitable for removing as v from water sharma et al 2007 lee et al 2003 with an optimum ph range 6 8 in new zealand three potable water treatment units were examined to find out the efficiency of aluminum based coagulants with reference to different forms and as concentrations gregor 2001 while after precipitation it was essential to filter samples arsenic reduction was only 30 without filtration but the reduction reaches up to 96 when the filter of about 0 1 or 1 mm was used litter et al 2010 choong et al 2007 reported 99 removal efficiency of as by the process of coagulation coagulation process by using coarse calcite and fe 3 and following by normal filtration was found to achieve about 99 arsenic removal from wastewater of mine having a higher concentration of as 5 mg l song et al 2006 however a huge quantity of sludge is produced in this technique which is disposed off to landfills litter et al 2010 a three step advanced oxidation coagulation filtration technique aocf has been devised to attain as concentration less than 1 μg l through a series of three step processes initially aocf convert as iii to as v with the help of potassium permanganate kmno4 and subsequently its sorption onto fe oh 3 and finally removal of floc through double layer filtration ahmad et al 2004 electrocoagulation ec using iron electrodes is a promising arsenic removal strategy for groundwater drinking supplies this technique is based on the rapid in situ dissolution of a sacrificial fe 0 anode to produce iron precipitates with a high arsenic sorption affinity van genuchten et al 2012 ec is based on applying an electric current to a sacrificial fe 0 anode to form fe ions the fe ions generated during ec polymerize rapidly forming precipitates in situ with a high arsenic sorption affinity the arsenic laden precipitates can then be separated from treated water by gravitational settling and or filtration ec removes both as iii and as v from drinking water and wastewater of varying chemical characteristics and ph lakshmanan et al 2010 martínez villafañe et al 2009 kumar et al 2004 ec method used electric current and alter more harmful as iii into less toxic and easily removable as v by the process of oxidation van genuchten et al 2012 2014a b jadhav et al 2015 electrocoagulation process is effective to lower the concentration of as less than 10 μg l kobya et al 2011 for removal of as electrodes of al were found more efficient with 95 7 removal efficiency than the fe electrodes 93 5 removal efficiency there are several advantages of ec such as easy operation higher removal efficiency feasible cost and possible automation of the complete process small size system need of little maintenance and the less amount of sludge production no need of any chemical addition make it a promising technology as compared to other techniques emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 mollah et al 2004 rajeshwar et al 1994 vik et al 1984 for different types of water wastewater ground and surface water up to 99 as removal efficiency has been attained kobya et al 2013 vasudevan et al 2010 in situ metal hydroxide generation works as a coagulant during ec the summary of electrochemical reactions through using aluminum al as an electrode is given below kobya et al 2011 2al al3 3e at anode 2h2o 2e h2 2oh at cathode al3 3oh al oh 3 s in aqueous solution this al oh 3 complex is believed to serve as an adsorbent for as kobya et al 2011 flores et al 2013 al oh 3 s haso2 4 al oh 3 haso2 4 s in the process of coagulation ph is considered one of the important parameters for the removal of as initial ph and elevation of ph both control the as removal during the process of coagulation normally an aqueous solution has as iii in form of h3aso3 h2aso 3 and haso2 3 redox potential and ph alters the as speciation in the solution in the same manner the metal ion speciation also changes with the ph of the solution so the removal of as changes with changing ph during the process of electrocoagulation an increase of ph from acidic ph 3 to a neutral ph 7 increases the percentage removal of as from 93 61 to 98 43 while after ph 7 there was no significant change in the removal efficiency current density is another important parameter for as removal during ec it finds the coagulant dosage production of bubbles floc size and growth which affect the removal efficiency during ec higher removal was observed at the higher applied current densities a current density of 60 a m2 was found to remove a maximum of 99 47 as from water thakur and mondal 2017 while a decrease in as concentration below to who standards 10 μgl 1 was achieved by using aluminum as an anode with current densities of 4 ma m2 in a continuous filter reactor with flow velocities of 1 82 cm s guzmán et al 2016 there are many studies which highlight the removal of as by using electrocoagulation process song et al 2014 flores et al 2013 ali et al 2012 lacasa et al 2011 use of iron is much efficient as it is co precipitated in the presence of as roberts et al 2004 fuller et al 1993 for high as removal efficiency oxidation of fe ii generated during ec with respect to total iron dose is very essential dissolution of fe ii by oxidation from the anode finds out the oxidation of as iii to as v in ec if the oxidation is fast which mostly occurs at higher ph than the oxidation of as iii is lower an optimum ph for the removal of as iii is reported as 7 banerji and chaudhari 2016 iron plates are capable to remove more than 95 of as from potable contaminated water and for making it suitable for drinking purposes by lowering the value of as below 10 μg l 3 1 3 adsorption adsorption is emerging as a frontline technology for the removal of pollutants from water there is an increasing trend for the use of mineral oxides biological materials polymer resins and activated carbons as an adsorbent dambies et al 2002 adsorption technique is widely used due to a number of characteristics such as easy operation high removal efficiency low cost and sludge free processes a number of studies has reported the use of novel materials to adsorb as from water which include activated carbon zhang et al 2007 oliveira et al 2009 alumina han et al 2013 zeolites swarnkar and tomar 2012 clays anjum et al 2011 and iron oxides sun et al 2013 in addition use of activated alumina li et al 2011 goethite tang et al 2010 layered double hydroxides dadwhal et al 2011 delorme et al 2007 volcanic ash chen et al 2011 ferric hydroxides streat et al 2008 modified cellulose tian et al 2011 feal doped polymers kumar et al 2011 inorganic ion exchange adsorbents chubar 2011 and cheap materials such as goethite coated sand hematite coated sand and bone char mlilo et al 2010 brunson and sabatini 2009 has been used for water treatment with higher concentrations of as brunson and sabatini 2009 commercially available activated carbons have also been widely applied for the adsorption of as v and as iii from water navarro and alguacil 2002 several forms of activated carbon have been synthesized for the treatment of water and wastewater nagarnaik et al 2003 reed et al 2000 periasamy and namasivayam 1995 a coconut husk carbon was synthesized and optimum as iii removal was obtained by adsorption on this activated carbon at ph 12 0 manju et al 1998 similarly mondal et al 2006 used the fe3 impregnated granular activated carbon for the removal of as from virtual polluted groundwater and a higher sorption capacity on this commercial carbon was obtained in the presence of fe2 fe3 and mn2 some metallic impregnated silver and copper activated carbons were applied for the remediation of as rajakovic 1992a activated carbon with different ash contents e g a coal based carbon with 5 6 ash peat based extruded carbon with 5 ash and coconut shell carbon with 3 ash showed that the activated carbon with more ash content was more effective to remove as v lorenzen et al 1995 moreover a combination of carbon steel wool and granular activated carbon was also very effective to remove as from water campos 2002 some metal oxides are very effective to absorb and to remove as conventional alumina adsorption capacity and its rate to remove as is relatively slow and low lin and wu 2001 aluminum hydroxide also showed ph dependency when it is tested for the adsorption of as anderson et al 1976 and ph value of 9 was considered optimum for the immobilization of as by aluminum hydroxide kosmulski 2009 the granulated iron oxide formulated for the removal of both as iii and as v contain binary oxides of silica and amorphous iron in which complexes of as with silica and amorphous iron oxide in situ may be formed preventing from disintegration this binary granulated adsorbent has the ability to remove both as v as well as as iii zeng 2004 quintinite mg4al2 oh 12co3 3h2o a layered double hydroxide through mild thermal treatment showed a100 as removal efficiency when the initial concentration of as was 16 mg l delorme et al 2007 3 1 4 membrane technology and reverse osmosis one of the promising technologies for the removal of as from groundwater and for purification of drinking water includes the membrane processes mondal et al 2013 besides removing turbidity and coloring compounds membrane separation processes are an absolute barrier for viruses and bacteria so it is cited as a suitable technology for treating water tam et al 2007 microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes have the ability to remove as in particulate forms from water because their typical pore size i e 0 1 1 μm and 0 01 0 1 μm respectively are not small enough for removing as in dissolved form mondal et al 2013 dutta et al 2012 a driving force such as a pressure difference across the membrane is required for the movement of molecules for the removal of as different types of membrane technologies such as ultrafiltration nanofiltration microfiltration and reverse osmosis are employed gonzalez et al 2019 uddin et al 2007 pal et al 2014 reported 98 removal efficiency for as v by using nanofiltration for 0 18 mg l feed concentration at ph 7 2 however the removal efficiency at the higher feed of as iii is very low which does not match the permissible limits so there is a need for pre oxidation of as iii to as v uddin et al 2007 groundwater as may be removed up to 80 by using iron for co precipitation and then the following filtration by using granular media filter schmidt et al 2016 reverse osmosis ro is also a successful option for the treatment of water for as removal abejón et al 2015 walker et al 2008 for water desalination this technology has been used successfully employed for many years this process is automated and can be controlled and often very high elimination almost 100 of low molecular mass ions and compounds a removal of about 99 of as iii was reported when synthetic brackish water was treated at ph 7 5 9 6 and 24 40 bar feed with 49 5 μg l of as iii teychene et al 2013 a household ro unit reported an average 80 2 28 1 removal of as iii for a maximum feed of 180 μg l concentration walker et al 2008 a pilot trial by using the sand filter as a granular media filter and reverse osmosis treatment have shown up to 80 of as removal while the concentration of as varies between 230 μg l and 780 μg l schmidt et al 2016 removal of as may be facilitated due to the natural occurrence of iron concentration in water by the process of co precipitation berg and hallmann 2006 a molar ratio of fe as as 4 10 in reverse osmosis concentrate provides 80 as removal by using fecl3 as a coagulant mercer and tobiason 2008 in recent years membranes based on polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and its copolymers have attracted a large interest in the treatment of water the reason for this much interest and attention is the outstanding properties such as good chemical and mechanical resistance and thermal and hydrolytic stability liu et al 2014 kang et al 2014 3 2 bio phytoremediation technologies worldwide attention has been drawn by as pollution and becomes a global concern due to many injurious health effects shah et al 2019 singh and taylor 2019 tirkey et al 2017 hue 2013 casentini et al 2011 bissen and frimmel 2003a b microbe forms the majority of life on planet earth which comprises bacteria eukaryotes viruses and archaea in the presence of as survival strategies of microbes are through sequestration reduction oxidation methylation reactions and extrusion from or within or outside the cytosol the complex role of microbes in a geochemical cycle of as can be found in various review articles tsai et al 2009 stolz et al 2006 oremland and stolz 2003 mukhopadhyay et al 2002 broadly depending on whether microbes drain energy or gain energy it can be divided into two groups for their as association kulp et al 2008 hoeft et al 2004 santini and vanden hoven 2004 oremland et al 2002 heterotrophic bacteria do not gain any energy but drains energy whether by respiring or detoxification of as two type of heterotrophic bacteria are identified arsenite as iii oxidizing bacteria and arsenate as v reducing bacteria heterotrophic as v reducing bacteria are further two types respiratory as v reducing bacteria and cytoplasmic as v reducing bacteria at the beginning of the respiratory chain heterotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria use as iii as an electron donor the symbiotic relationship between crop plant species and fungi is widespread arbuscular mycorrhizae symbiosis with plants is a key component that helps the plants to tolerate the water shortage ruiz lozano and aroca 2010 and nutrient deficiencies arbuscular mycorrhizae association increases the as tolerance by improving the plant growth that reduces the concentration of the metalloid per unit plant biomass similarly this interaction changes the expression of the high affinity phosphate transporter within plant roots burleigh 2001 and reduces the as v uptake through these pathways chen et al 2007 moreover mycorrhizae association changes the speciation pattern of the different as species in plant tissues highly toxic inorganic species are converted to less toxic organic as species within the plants shoots zhang et al 2015 in addition to this arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization increases the ratio of as iii as v zhang et al 2015 as this form readily complexes with phytochelatins and compartmentalized to the vacuole duan et al 2007 under as contaminations plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizae could improve phosphorus nutrition and growth resulting in the dilution effect on as in the plant tissues xu et al 2008 chen et al 2007 xia et al 2007 more importantly gonzalez chavez et al 2002 found that arbuscular mycorrhizae could reduce the as v influx into the excised roots of holcus lanatus it is reported by christophersen et al 2009 that arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization reduced the uptake of as v in barley via down regulation of the high affinity pi transports in plant roots that also absorb as v moreover arbuscular mycorrhizae association with plant may contribute to as exclusion involving reduction of as v to the as iii and the exclusion of as iii out of fungal cells gonzález chávezdel et al 2011 in addition arbuscular mycorrhizae symbiosis could alleviate toxicity of as v by mitigating the oxidative stress garg and singla 2012 and changing the distribution of as in plants chen et al 2012a b studies showed that arbuscular mycorrhizas occur naturally in as contaminated soils smith et al 2010 and tolerance of maize is improved by mycorrhizal inoculation bai et al 2008 plantain orłowska et al 2012 tomato liu et al 2005 white clover ryegrass dong et al 2008 and chinese brake fern leung et al 2013 arsenic resistant plants tolerant accumulator and hyper accumulator can accumulate and tolerate moderate to high concentration of as in different plants parts without displaying toxic symptoms of as arsenic accumulators plants accumulate low to moderate as concentration in the root and the hyper accumulator plants accumulate high as concentration in the above ground parts uptake as but resist from causing the toxic effect producing food crops free from as especially in areas with higher levels of as in soil and groundwater is of primary importance hyper accumulators plants mainly pteris spp remediate as contaminated soils by the maximum containment method by storing it in different above and below ground parts without damaging itself these plants also remediate contaminated sites by preventing as leaching and stabilizing the as in soil by storing in roots however as species bioavailability and bio accessibility are the most important factors contributing to the efficacy of the plant in phytoremediation processes wyke et al 2014 3 3 agronomic practices irrigation practices and nutrients management provide important strategies in plant adaptation to tolerate as toxicity these practices trigger various mechanisms in soil plant systems that are helpful in reducing as uptake and translocation arsenic toxicity risks are related to its availability in term of the total amount as well as its concentration in soil solution that is governed by soil physical and chemical characteristics and environmental conditions in the rhizosphere soil abiotic factors such as redox potential and ph and biotic factors i e microorganisms play role in the interconversion of various as species and consequently its accumulation in plants banerji et al 2019 nearing et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 one of the best ways for a sustainable and immediate solution is the management of irrigation water to reduce as in agricultural practices a significant effect of deficit irrigation has been observed with decreased as contents in rice arao et al 2009 deficit irrigation generally creates an oxidized condition that hinders the reduction of as v to as iii which prominently increased plant availability higher solubility and toxicity takahashi et al 2004 arsenic has similarity to soil mineral nutrients so its interaction with such minerals may decrease as uptake in plants while under a continuous supply of water as uptake is increased because of high concentration of fe reducing bacterias xu et al 2008 takahashi et al 2004 meanwhile it also improves as bioavailability and solubility through fe oxyhydroxides reduction that predominate in root plaques kim et al 2009 horneman et al 2004 islam et al 2004 and reduction of methyl as and as v species to more soluble as iii species in grains an intermittent flooding condition reduces the concentration of as in comparison with continuous flooding horneman et al 2004 in comparison with aerobic conditions anaerobic conditions resulted in 3 16 folds higher as accumulation in rice plant while aerobic conditions reduced total as availability 10 to 100 times mainly due to its reduction in as v hu et al 2015 hence agronomic practices may be employed to mitigate as build up in the human food chain arsenic uptake varies from plant species to species generally its uptake is low in cereals such as barley and wheat in comparison to rice su et al 2010 signes pastor et al 2007 williams et al 2007 therefore under specified as contaminated conditions crop plant selection is also critical mineral nutrients play an important role in the development and growth of plants and as antagonistically affect the uptake and transport of various minerals and vice versa adrees et al 2015 among the mineral nutrients silicon has been observed to reduce the uptake and toxic effect of as in plants zia et al 2017 keller et al 2015 shen et al 2014 chen et al 2000 it is also observed that a significant negative correlation exists between as iii or as v and si uptake and concentration in rice seedlings tripathi et al 2013 hu et al 2013 guo et al 2007 similarly si application in soil silica gel 10 g kg 1 of soil reduced the as concentration in flag leaf straw grains and husk of rice plants fleck et al 2013 in the vicinity of the endoderm the physical barrier formed by the si deposition may reduce the cell wall porosity of inner root tissues thus decreasing the metal concentration in xylem keller et al 2015 wu et al 2015 also suggested that si nutrition was a central player to restrict the as accumulation in shoots and roots of six genotypes of rice silicon nutrition efficiently limited the accumulation of as in tomato marmiroli et al 2014 among other plant mineral nutrients iron fe has a strong affinity towards as and may reduce as absorption in rice nath et al 2014 liu et al 2004 soil iron hydr oxides are known as important solid phases that are responsible for as mobilization immobilization in sediments and soils frommer et al 2011 daus et al 1998 iron hydr oxides can oxidize as iii when they are catalyzed or induced for instance by fe ii or light it was reported that the amorphous fe reacts as a sink of as in soil the bioavailability and mobility of as are significantly affected b fe redox cycling significant correlations was observed in 73 rice genotypes and soil which indicates that iron redox cycling directly affect as fractionation in soil and affected the bioavailability of as indirectly liu et al 2015 in soil the increasing concentration of free fe oxide in the soil also decrease as uptake by promoting the formation of fe plaques on and around the surface of the root iron plaques are usually formed on surfaces of roots in aquatic plants including rice armstrong 1964 liu et al 2004 indicated that fe plaques had a high affinity to as v and affect the uptake of as v by rice seedlings fe plaque may thus also play a role in decreasing the uptake of as in soil plant systems these findings also specify that fe plaques might sequester as thus reducing the translocation of as from roots to shoots sulfur was found to stimulate iron plaque on the roots of rice plants the rate of formation of the iron plaque was increased with increased concentration of sulfur sulfur treated rice plants decreased as concentration so sulfur fertilization can be used as a developmental approach for the reduction of as in rice plants hu et al 2007 moreover the thiol groups of cysteine cys and glutathione gsh are often involved in redox cycles consisting of thiol disulfide conversions saito 2004 phytochelatins pc and reduced glutathione gsh are essential for the plants to counter oxidative stress plants belonging to the poaceae family has12 of the total sulfates in the form of gsh grill et al 2001 the toxicity of as is due to its propensity to bind to sulfhydryl groups and consequently it is detrimental to general protein functioning the nucleophilicity of the thiol group and especially those of gsh and pcs phytochelatins play important roles in the detoxification of heavy metals by direct conjugation with the sulfhydryl group tripathi et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 reported that rice plants pretreated with low amounts of s accumulated less as iii in the detoxification process of as when as v is converted into as iii sulfhydryl groups of gsh and pc provide binding sites for the as iii phosphorus is one of the 17 essential elements for plants and a most limiting element for growth and development it rapidly transforms into insoluble complexes with cations particularly with iron and aluminum under acid conditions vance et al 2003 arsenic and p compete in the plant at uptake site biswas et al 2018 stoeva and bineva 2003 and p addition in rooting medium usually suppress as uptake gunes et al 2009 rahman et al 2008 4 conclusion arsenic mobilization in groundwater aquifers leads its way to the water systems used for irrigation as well as for human and animal consumption it is logical to establish and use novel as removal technologies which are sustainable and enough efficient to tackle this increasing as pollution in soil plant food chain continuum the issue requires much attention due to water scarcity and climate change a number of conventional water treatment technologies based on physicochemical principles such as softening and the addition of lime coagulation and filtration with an average efficiency less than 90 must be replaced by more advanced technologies such as adsorption use of aluminum and membrane technologies for physical separation there are some factors which contribute for the successful application of arsenic removal technologies which include the concentration of arsenic in raw water a parametric value for achievement and existing scheme of treatment the source of water and lithography of the region in addition to water treatment water management practices in agricultural system may also provide a way to tackle arsenic buildup in the human food chain a remarkable effect of rice cultivation with less water has been proved much effective in decreasing plant arsenic accumulation and toxicity careful microbiological techniques with fertilizers management of iron sulfur phosphorus and silicon may also result in an antagonistic effect on as uptake by crop plants further to fulfill human food and water demands in coming decades detailed biochemical and physiological studies should continue for sustainable ways to remediate arsenic polluted soils and water appendix a supplementary data the

12246,arsenic as is a naturally occurring metalloid which has been recognized as a class 1 carcinogen by the international agency of research on cancer iarc the metalloid finds its way into the food chain through natural and anthropogenic processes human activities especially farming practices is a major contributor of as buildup in agricultural soils arsenic taken up by the plant roots negatively affect plant productivity by disturbing various metabolic processes such as adenosine triphosphate atp formation and enzyme activation in plants managing as contaminated water reduces the health risks associated with as contaminated food the purpose of this review is to focus on the information regarding the metalloid build up especially in the soil plant system and ground water consider the various approaches investigated to decrease its contents and consequences on the human food chain a critical review of the literature suggests that the contamination of the human food chain can be controlled through careful selection and application of water purification techniques with other agronomic practices graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic metalloid food chain water treatment 1 introduction arsenic as is the 20th most abundant element in the earth s crust some evidence indicates that as was utilized as an energy resource by some initial inhabitants and was available in the plentiful amount on the primordial earth s surface roy and mcdonald 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 natural processes such as volcanic eruptions geological dissolution of these minerals with the water cause these elements to surface again and increase the exposure of life on planet in addition anthropogenic activities such as pesticides containing as and mining also contributed to building up of its concentration in some soils khan and umar 2019 prathap and chakraborty 2019 abedin et al 2002a higher as concentration in soil has been documented in argentina china chile taiwan mexico south africa bangladesh india and pakistan ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 kumar et al 2019 mushtaq et al 2018 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 litter et al 2019 severe as contamination has been found in the bengal basin india and bangladesh where millions of the people are threatened to as poisoning due to the consumption of unsafe tube wells water containing as higher than 10 μg l saha et al 2018 ahsan and del valls 2011 zhao et al 2010 inorganic as species as iii and as v have a strong cytotoxic effect to both macrophages and lymphocytes in human beings consequently as toxicity leads to hypersensitivity responses impairment of function and loss of adhesion moreover as prompts the overexpression of keratinocyte derived growth factors that lead to as induced skin cancer and hyperkeratosis islam 2015 in light of the present scenario of as contamination its dietary intake is causing serious concerns due to its higher potential for bio accumulation zhao et al 2010 the majority of the recent reported literature focuses on toxicity crisis originating due to consuming as polluted ground water chakraborti et al 2018 shahid et al 2018 ahmad et al 2018a b mandal 2017 shahid et al 2015 in this review we review not only the sources of as in soil and plants but also discussed the ways and means by which as buildup in food chain can be minimized 2 arsenic in soil plant systems 2 1 sources of arsenic in soil in lithosphere as concentration ranges between 1 5 and 2 mg kg adriano 2001 it is constituent of more than 245 minerals including arsenates 60 compounds silicates 20 and sulfides and sulfosalts 20 mandal and suzuki 2002 there are many sources of as in the environment which includes natural and anthropogenic sources volcanic eruptions rocks mineralization and forest fires release a large amount of as into the environment are the natural sources zheng et al 2011 o reilly et al 2010 while the use of pesticides insecticides phosphate containing fertilizers pulp for paper production fossil fuel mining and smelting industrial processes are the major anthropogenic sources of as in the environment bundschuh et al 2011 mondal et al 2006 matschullat 2000 an elevated concentration of as up to 3 as in the soil is present in the adjacent areas of as deposits and its concentration decreases as the distance increase from the source sites zhang and selim 2008 industrial activities are also a source of as for example in the early 20th century glass industries disposed of rich as wastes madejón and lepp 2007 soil parent material is also a contributory factor for as in the soil garcia sanchez and alvarez ayuso 2003 mining activities enhances its occurrence in natural environments ore deposits with sulfide with few other rocks such as sandstones shales and phosphate rocks also have to some hundreds of mg kg of as baur and onishi 1978 arsenic is mobilized by weathering processes and microbial activities in addition to parent material soil conditions and properties may also affect the weathering processes and release as into the soil ramos miras et al 2014 observed that the total as content in soils was related with parent material while iron aluminum clay content soil organic matter soil ph were the main regulatory factors of as in the soil tabassum et al 2019 in addition to all these sources residual presence of organic dimethylarsinic acid used in past as a pesticide still acts as a source of as in the environment arsenic contaminated soils are also a growing concern in recreational lands that were previously used as an agricultural land time is an important factor for controlling the degree and strength of as retention in the soil a study conducted to evaluate the effect of soil aging on as fractionation in the soil the results showed that at the start of the experiment maximum as was present as soluble fraction and with the passage of time the soluble fraction changed into insoluble fraction quazi et al 2010 furthermore the soil depth also has an effect on the distribution pattern of as in soil the soil of the upper horizons has a maximum dtpa extractable as fraction as compared to the lower horizons the concentrations of as ranging from 10 to 40 mg kg in soil is found with no known natural sources of contamination fitz and wenzel 2002 mandal and suzuki 2002 long term use of phosphatic fertilizers also acts as a source of as in soil now a day the quantity of as is very low in phosphate fertilizers but historically higher amounts of as were present in these fertilizers soil fertilized with phosphate fertilizers since 1856 showed a higher concentration of as in soils even after many years hartley et al 2013 another source of as in the soil is organo arsenic feed additives widely used in the world liu et al 2015 due to concentrated animal feeding operations and animal waste application to the soil may results in a higher concentration of as contamination in these soils sarwar et al 2019 groundwater contamination with as depends on its mobilization in the environment under natural conditions the geology morphology and hydrology of a geological location are also important for the presence of higher amounts of as in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2007 arsenic concentration in groundwater reaches 1000 μg l in different places around the world table 1 tuli et al 2010 survey of rice fields showed higher as levels in areas where as contaminated groundwater has been used for irrigation purpose moreover a significant positive correlation between soils as level with tube well age has been found arsenic levels in the highly contaminated zone were 46 μg g dry soils compared to 10 μg g in areas with low levels of as in the groundwater meharg and rahman 2003 the occurrence of as in groundwater is natural table 1 and it depends on the geology ph elevation of the area soil organic matter and soil iron contents hossain and piantanakulchai 2013 al mamun et al 2019 bedrocks of the area primarily controls the concentration of as in groundwater bondu et al 2017 geochemical conditions of subsurface aquifers may also have an effect on the release of as in groundwater reducing conditions of aquifers promote the dissolution and desorption of as in the groundwater anawar et al 2003 in dry climate the total concentration of as is contributed by evaporative concentration tisserand et al 2014 in deep aquifers sorption of as on iron aluminum and manganese minerals restrict its leaching in the groundwater but in shallow aquifers leaching occurs due to high ph and bicarbonates concentrations under these geochemical circumstances desorption of above mentioned anions and oxyanions act as a key process for as mobilization annaduzzaman et al 2018 han et al 2013 nicolli et al 2010 volcanic materials are also a reason for high as concentrations in shallow groundwater aquifers in addition to bulk rock geochemistry composition of the groundwater e g ph carbonate or other anions microbial populations and physical parameters also control the as in groundwater lima et al 2019 shahid et al 2018 muñoz et al 2016 das et al 2015 2 2 factors affecting arsenic mobilization and availability in soil soil characteristics affect the speciation pattern and form inorganic vs organic of as species in soil soil aeration affects the solubility and mobility of as in soil beesley et al 2010 arsenic is less soluble in well aerated soils than other trace elements yamane et al 1976 under well aerated conditions as concentration remains 50 nm in non contaminated soil solutions while in contaminated soils the concentration may reach up to 2 μm moreno jiménez et al 2010 wenzel et al 2002 in contrast soil anaerobic conditions promote the reduction of the as v to as iii with increased toxicity solubility and plant availability xu et al 2008 takahashi et al 2004 arsenic speciation changes according to changes in conditions or handling of soil carbonell barrachina et al 1999 dissolution of fe hydroxides is one reason for rapid mobility of as iii under reducing conditions gräfe and sparks 2006 takahashi et al 2004 and microbial processes may also transform as v to as iii islam et al 2004 however as may co precipitate with iron sulfur in highly reducing conditions and compounds such as arsenopyrite or arsenic sulfides ass as2s3 may form soil properties such as soil texture influences as mobility owing to differences of charges on the soil surface that controls the adsorption and desorption processes in soil soils rich in clay and fe oxides have a higher as retention potential in comparison to coarse textured soils heikens et al 2007 heikens et al 2007 fitz and wenzel 2002 the phytotoxicity of as is five times less in clayey soil than loamy and sandy soils sheppard 1992 higher as uptake and concentrations in plants were observed in plants grown in the loamy sand than silty clay loam soils o neill 1995 similarly as adsorption desorption processes are also affected by some other soil properties especially ph quazi et al 2011 fitz and wenzel 2002 different inorganic soil components such as monodentate bidentate mononuclear and bidentate binuclear complexes and as form surface complexes depending upon the ph o reilly et al 2001 fendorf et al 1997 it is evident from several studies that as v is sorbed more than as iii in a wide range of ph in contrast the sorption of as v is less than as iii on ferrihydrite violante et al 2010 studies suggest that low ph ph 5 increases as mobility and solubility signes pastor et al 2007 marin et al 1993 which results in the increased concentration of as in plants tu and ma 2003 at higher soil ph the uptake of as is also improved due to increase in ph dependent charges that may increase as desorption from iron oxides hence enhance its concentration in root vicinity streat et al 2008 fitz and wenzel 2002 campbell 1985 soil organic matter om forms soluble and insoluble complexes with as therefore it can have a significant effect on as mobility in the soil organic matter can influence as mobility and phyto availability by changing redox potential providing adsorption sites and by forming aqueous complexes soluble organic compounds play an important role in soluble adsorbed as distribution in agricultural soils by using the metal bridging mechanism organic matter metal complexes may strongly bind as in this way the soluble organic complex formation can reduce as availability to crops lin et al 2004 paikaray et al 2005 reported that formation of as complex with om greatly reduces the as availability to plants and consequently its accumulation in edible plant parts i e rice grains fu et al 2011 rahman and hasegawa 2011 wuana and okieimen 2011 on contrary om may also results in mobilization of as that may results in contamination of groundwater a study conducted to investigate the role of om in the mobilization of as showed that om change the solubility and mobility of as in groundwater through redox reactions an increment in as mobility was reported in agricultural soils with the use of cow dung urunmatsoma et al 2010 it was supported by another study where the use of olive mill waste compost significantly increased the as solubility and its mobility in agricultural soils moreno jiménez et al 2013 metal transformation through microbes is generally divided into two major categories which include conversions of inorganic to organic form and vice versa and redox conversions of metals from oxidized to reduced conditions microbes are able to attain energy through oxidation of fe sulfur mn and as santini et al 2000 tebo et al 1997 for instance a pseudomonas strain can produce energy for metabolic processes from the as iii oxidation ilyaletdinov and abdrashitova 1981 microbes mediate the transformation of organic as to inorganic and between as v to as iii zhao et al 2013 oremland and stolz 2003 meharg and hartley whitaker 2002 microbes generally involved in the redox cycling of elemental sulfur to sulfate and to sulfide wainwright 1984 sulfate reducing bacteria reduce so4 2 to s 2 which immediately reacts with fe2 generally present at reduction sites to form fes murase and kimura 1997 it has been proved that the formation of sulfide through microbes in as ferrihydrite systems leads to transformation and dissolution of the as bearing ferrihydrite arsenite rapidly oxidize to as v by thermus thermophiles and thermus aquaticus but they were not capable to grow with as iii as an energy source through dissimilatory reduction as v can be reduced to as iii as the result of as v usage by microorganisms during anaerobic respiration for instance certain bacteria staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli have detoxifying reductase arsc enzyme a plasmid encoded that reduces as v to as iii for its rapid extrusion from the cell ji et al 1994 2 3 arsenic transfer from soil to plants and its toxicity in plants plants acquisition of minerals is through root uptake from soils uzu et al 2009 sharma and dubey 2005 various factors control the dynamics of as in the rhizosphere such as the formation of iron plaque phosphate status soil oxidation reduction status inter conversion between organic and inorganic as species also affects the transportation of as across the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells furthermore soil parent material and clay contents type play a vital role in the regulation of as in soil solution because of its role in precipitation and binding of poorly soluble as minerals meharg 2004 the concentration of as in plants depends on its ability to uptake and transport as from soil to root and shoots the uptake ability of as by plants varies from species to species among cultivated crops rice is efficient in as uptake bhattacharya et al 2009 further speciation pattern of different as species also contribute in as accumulation by the plants arsenate is a chemical analog to inorganic phosphate and is efficiently taken up by the plant roots through inorganic phosphate transporter wu et al 2011 the amount of as in plants can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the inorganic phosphate or by suppressing the inorganic phosphate transporters or by its activity at the plasma membrane through genetic means catarecha et al 2007 shin et al 2004 once as v uptake into plant root through different inorganic phosphate transporters it moves easily from one cell to the other arsenate is uploaded to the xylem vessels through inorganic phosphate transport proteins mendoza cózatl et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 while as non hyperaccumulators retained the majority of as v into the plant s roots ma et al 2008 meharg and jardine 2003 on the other hand in rice plants nodulin 26 like plasma membrane proteins lsi1 and lsi2 are also responsible for as iii uptake and transport lsi1 is entry path and its mutation results in a significant decrease in as iii uptake while lsi2 helps to mediate as iii loading to xylem a significant decrease in as accumulation was reported in plants after lsi2 mutation these transporters are able to uptake both as iii and silicic acid as these both have similar chemical properties although there are other transporters which are also involved in the transport of as iii however lsi1 and lsi2 are considered as the major as iii transporters in rice due to their higher expression in the roots ma et al 2008 in soil stoma water anaerobic conditions submerged are responsible for the release of the adsorbed as v and reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides khan et al 2010 in rice anaerobic conditions cause reduction of as v to as iii which enhances the as level in plants takahashi et al 2004 marin et al 1993 arsenate reduction to as iii and its subsequent sequestration into the vacuole in plant roots is considered as major as detoxification mechanism pickering et al 2000 the reduction of as v follows enzymatic and non enzymatic pathways the non enzymatic reduction of as v require two glutathione molecules delnomdedieu et al 1994 while enzymatic pathway is triggered by as v reductase which is much speedy processes duan et al 2007 bleeker et al 2006 in addition to as reductase enzymes the enzymes from other systems also have the ability to reduce as v i e glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and f1fo atp synthase in the mitochondria németi et al 2010 gregus and németi 2002 moreover instead of inorganic phosphate these enzymes incorporate as v into the biological molecules and forms an arseno esters although inorganic as species are less mobile within the plant the presence of as in shoots and grains shows its limited mobility raab et al 2007 a study demonstrated that 90 of the as in the roots and shoots was in the form of as iii xu et al 2008 dhankher et al 2002 pickering et al 2000 in addition cultivation condition favoring oxidized as form results in a marked decline in as accumulation in the rice spanu et al 2012 somenahally et al 2011 li et al 2009 therefore water management can be a promising strategy to decrease the as bioavailability in soils and its subsequent uptake by the plants hu et al 2013 rahman and hasegawa 2011 arao et al 2009 the world health organization food and agriculture organization who fao permit a conditional tolerable weekly intake of inorganic as less than 15 μg kg body weight kohlmeyer et al 2003 however an adult with 60 kg body weight consuming 450 g of rice rice grain containing as 0 11 mg kg and 4 l of water containing as 10 μg l per day exceeds the fao and who dietary intake limits of 130 μg as per day duxbury and zavala 2005 the toxicity of as is influenced by its oxidation state and chemical form generally in comparison to organic as species the inorganic form is more toxic sun et al 2014 these inorganic as species as iii and as v are the most poisonous forms of as to living organisms it is projected that more than 100 million people mostly in developing countries are at risk of being poisoned by as table 2 sharma et al 2014 arsenic accumulation in plants depends upon its concentration ph and redox conditions of the growing medium various hydroponic experiments have proved that in addition to above mentioned factors exposure time and as chemical species are also a contributory factor in its uptake and translocation in plants abbas and meharg 2008 marin et al 1992 results of different hydroponic studies on 46 various plant species indicated that plants as uptake follows the order as as iii as v mma v dma v while the translocation order from root to shoot was dma v mma v as v as iii raab et al 2007 higher concentration of as may be lethal for the plants as it interacts with metabolic processes in plants mostly plants are able to restrict as accumulation in shoots but some specific species such as rice is able to translocate as in above ground plant parts in usa and australia straight head a disease name because empty panicles and another name parrot beak due to misshaped grains is a sign of as toxicity in plants williams et al 1999 hewitt 1912 reported straight head disease which was dramatically affecting grain yield in the us the first time it was reported by collier 1912 in the early 1900s the straight head disease was responsible to reduce rice grain yield up to 12 15 that was approximately 20 of the us rice acreage later the straight head disease was also reported in different countries like portugal called branca japan thailand australia and argentina dunn et al 2006 weerapat and promchainan 1980 plant physiological processes are affected by as in plants arsenic stress leads to the over production of reactive oxidation species ros that leads to peroxidation of membrane lipids and damage to amino acids purine nucleoids and nucleic acids and protein in plants may occur symptoms of as toxicity in rice includes delayed seed germination chlorosis and necrosis in leaves reduced plant growth and decreased grain yields rai et al 2011 huq et al 2006 gulz et al 2005 reduction in growth photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content are considered the most damaging effects of as stoeva et al 2005 disorder in miotic index dna fragmentation and mitotic arrays of microtubules were also observed in roots of pisum sativum upon as exposure faria and navarro 2010 morphological changes decreased plant biomass less fruit yield under as treatment are reported in different plants shaibur et al 2008 hartley whitaker 2001 arsenate replaces phosphate moiety and interferes in oxidative phosphorylation by forming as v adduct and atp synthesis in mitochondria wickes et al 1976 formation of arsenate adp ester bond leads to its auto hydrolysis in a futile cycle and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation it decreases the ability of cells to produce atp to carry out normal metabolic process in the cell finnegan and chen 2012 arsenate also seems to disturb the assimilation of nitrogen soil provides nitrogen to non legumes mainly in the form of nitrate or ammonium glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase play critical role during the assimilation of nitrogen into glutamate that acts as precursor of all the amino acids foyer and shigeoka 2011 rice roots treated with as v has lower transcripts for ammonium and nitrate transporters norton et al 2008 in addition as v may also interact with thiol and sulfhydryl groups of proteins and cysteine and different antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase gsh and superoxide dismutase sod foyer and shigeoka 2011 furthermore as v affect abscisic acid metabolism primary and secondary cell wall metabolism in a similar way as iii binds to sulfhydryl groups and effects protein functioning zhao et al 2010 a sharp decline in total protein content was observed in rice as compared to control when the plants were treated with as iii upadhyay et al 2016 the decline in plant growth parameters was in parallel with ros production in arabidopsis plants gupta et al 2013 oxidative damage due to overproduction of ros after as stress was reported in many plants like pteris vitata sundaram et al 2008 oryza sativa shri et al 2009 vicia faba lin and liao 2008 and pteris ensiformis and phseolus singh et al 2007 in the terrestrial environment methylated forms of as v are common and are reduced into more cytotoxic methylated as iii forms so these are of concern as they have the potential to disrupt plant metabolism more strongly even at a lower concentration than the inorganic species however the uptake of methylated as species is less than inorganic as species abbas and meharg 2008 abedin et al 2002b although the translocation of these species is significantly greater within the plants than as iii and as v carey et al 2011 li et al 2009 marin et al 1992 3 remedies for arsenic buildup in soil plant systems 3 1 arsenic removal technologies from the ground water the most commonly used method for the removal of as from the water includes adsorption lime treatment precipitation co precipitation oxidation reduction filtration ion exchange resin and membrane technology ahmad et al 2017 litter et al 2010 ravenscroft et al 2009 sharma and sohn 2009 each method with deficiencies and shortcoming are already presented in detail by ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2017 and litter et al 2010 here below each methodology its mechanism for as removal and their efficiencies are presented table 3 and discussed 3 1 1 oxidation and titanium dioxide based technology generally the methods which are designed for removing iron and manganese from water are referred to as oxidation and filtration barloková and ilavský 2010 nicomel et al 2015 the main objective of oxidation is the conversion of soluble as iii to as v which eventually co precipitated with the iron oxyhydroxides guan et al 2009 oxidation is a compulsory step as as iii is the major form of as in groundwater under anoxic conditions maity et al 2017 sorg et al 2014 kim et al 2002 traditional chemical oxidants such as ozone hydrogen peroxide chlorine chlorine dioxide ferrate and permanganate have been reported for the oxidation of as iii to as v ahmad et al 2018a b podder and majumder 2016 mondal et al 2013 guan et al 2009 sharma et al 2007 vasudevan et al 2006 ghurye and clifford 2004 bissen and frimmel 2003b lee et al 2003 johnston et al 2001 emett and khoe 2001 manganese oxide minerals mn oxides are cheap easily available and efficient oxidizing agents that may be employed in redox processes of as ahmad et al 2019 liu et al 2005 studies the kmno4 as an oxidizer of as iii and the author found that at the optimum concentration of kmno4 fe iii competing ions and ph paly critical role in oxidation processes guan et al 2009 similarly conversion of about 54 57 as iii to as v in polluted groundwater by using pure oxygen has been reported by kim and nriagu 2000 however the reaction rate for oxidation of as iii to as v can be increased by using chlorine ozone and permanganate in comparison to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and nh2cl ghurye and clifford 2004 lee et al 2003 hydrogen peroxide and nh2cl require hours to oxidize as iii while the other oxidants for example chlorine ozone and permanganate only need millisecond time scale for such oxidation reaction sorlini and gialdini 2010 but the presence of scavenger substances may influence the fast kinetics of oxidation processes such as feo4 2 if present in water however selection of specific oxidants for the specific reaction can lessen the effect of scavengers on the activity of oxidants ozonation is a better procedure for as removal from water samples than chlorination as it contains ammonia and ozone has a slow reaction with ammonia rather than with chlorine uv irradiation may be used for increasing the oxidation rate of as iii in water in the presence of oxygen moreover by photolysis of iron species solar light uv can also be helpful for hydroxyl radical production that may lead to increase oxidation rate sharma et al 2007 yoon and lee 2005 photo catalytic oxidation is one of the efficient methods for the oxidation of as iii to as v as reported in different studies miller et al 2011 miller and zimmerman 2010 ferguson and hering 2006 pena et al 2005 2006 bang et al 2005b dutta et al 2004 bissen et al 2001 in the past anodic oxidation has been used as an environment friendly technology for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants zhao et al 2009 vaghela et al 2005 vlyssides et al 2004 bunce et al 1997 it was reported that the as iii oxidation on a commercial dimensional stable anode dsa by using the process of electrocoagulation can enhance the removal of as iii zhao et al 2010 at large current densities das can oxidize the as iii completely lacasa et al 2012 titanium dioxide tio2 is known as one of the efficient materials for the removal of as from water due to its least toxicity chemical and physical stability corrosion resistivity high affinity to as and easy preparation nabi et al 2009 balaji and matsunaga 2002 it serves as adsorbent for the as v from the water jézéquel and chu 2006 pena et al 2005 dutta et al 2004 there are two aspects of tio2 application for the removal of as in the presence of sunlight radiation or uv light it can work as a photocatalyst as well as an adsorbent but in the absence of irradiation it only works as an adsorbent guan et al 2012 different tio2 types i e nano crystalline tio2 particles hydrous tio2 titanate nanotubes and granular tio2 have been reported in the literature guan et al 2012 bang et al 2005a concluded that the granular tio2 had a lot of adsorption capacity at neutral ph for as iii and as v while the kinetics of adsorption for as v was faster than as iii however some other studies reported that the tio2 based adsorbent has the same removal capacities for both as v and as iii or even may have higher capacities for as iii at acidic or at neutral conditions pirilä et al 2011 jegadeesan et al 2010 pena et al 2005 in various experiments 100 oxidation of as iii has been reported by the process of photo oxidation and by using tio2 as a catalyst tsimas et al 2009 ferguson et al 2005 dutta et al 2005 lee and choi 2002 yang et al 1999 by using a solar simulator which emit visible and ultraviolet radiations bissen et al 2001 increased photo oxidation activity tio2 for the oxidation of as iii to as v in aqueous tio2 suspensions a first order kinetics reported in this study shows that as iii completely oxidized into as v within minutes and an exponential decline in as concentration was recorded a highly efficient oxidation of as iii to as v was recorded in tio2 suspension by illuminating with uv in the presence of dissolved oxygen it was noted that the initial photocatalytic oxidation rate was faster for as iii at ph 9 and ph 3 lee and choi 2002 in the biogeochemical cycling of as microbial oxidation of as is widely accepted by researchers microbes involved in as oxidation includes bacteria and archaea bacterial oxidation of as can be categorized into autotrophic as iii oxidation and heterotrophic as iii oxidation oremland and stolz 2003 bacterial oxidation of as iii involves a key enzyme as iii oxidase lett et al 2012 the expression of as iii oxidase enzyme is regulated by as concentration katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2006 bacterial species and strains with higher expression level of as iii oxidase can be screened and employed for the efficient oxidation of as iii and its subsequent removal through employing different techniques 3 1 2 coagulation and electrocoagulation in the process of coagulation metal based coagulants e g ferric chloride are added to as contaminated water in water ferric chloride converts into positively charged ferric hydroxide for the effective removal of as it must be oxidized from as iii to as v sancha 2006 precipitation of as in the form of calcium arsenate as adsorbed to fe oxide surfaces are the most commonly used method for the removal of as it is possible to remove about 90 of as by coagulation choong et al 2007 for the formation of as v adsorption on the iron surface ferric salts are added to as contaminated water höll 2010 for the removal of as iii peroxidation is required by using sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide for the conversion of as iii to as v aluminum sulfate has also been reported as an efficient coagulant by bilici baskan and pala 2010 fe iii is a powerful non toxic coagulant which is a by product of fe vi yngard et al 2008 sharma et al 2005 sharma 2004 2002 and it is very suitable for removing as v from water sharma et al 2007 lee et al 2003 with an optimum ph range 6 8 in new zealand three potable water treatment units were examined to find out the efficiency of aluminum based coagulants with reference to different forms and as concentrations gregor 2001 while after precipitation it was essential to filter samples arsenic reduction was only 30 without filtration but the reduction reaches up to 96 when the filter of about 0 1 or 1 mm was used litter et al 2010 choong et al 2007 reported 99 removal efficiency of as by the process of coagulation coagulation process by using coarse calcite and fe 3 and following by normal filtration was found to achieve about 99 arsenic removal from wastewater of mine having a higher concentration of as 5 mg l song et al 2006 however a huge quantity of sludge is produced in this technique which is disposed off to landfills litter et al 2010 a three step advanced oxidation coagulation filtration technique aocf has been devised to attain as concentration less than 1 μg l through a series of three step processes initially aocf convert as iii to as v with the help of potassium permanganate kmno4 and subsequently its sorption onto fe oh 3 and finally removal of floc through double layer filtration ahmad et al 2004 electrocoagulation ec using iron electrodes is a promising arsenic removal strategy for groundwater drinking supplies this technique is based on the rapid in situ dissolution of a sacrificial fe 0 anode to produce iron precipitates with a high arsenic sorption affinity van genuchten et al 2012 ec is based on applying an electric current to a sacrificial fe 0 anode to form fe ions the fe ions generated during ec polymerize rapidly forming precipitates in situ with a high arsenic sorption affinity the arsenic laden precipitates can then be separated from treated water by gravitational settling and or filtration ec removes both as iii and as v from drinking water and wastewater of varying chemical characteristics and ph lakshmanan et al 2010 martínez villafañe et al 2009 kumar et al 2004 ec method used electric current and alter more harmful as iii into less toxic and easily removable as v by the process of oxidation van genuchten et al 2012 2014a b jadhav et al 2015 electrocoagulation process is effective to lower the concentration of as less than 10 μg l kobya et al 2011 for removal of as electrodes of al were found more efficient with 95 7 removal efficiency than the fe electrodes 93 5 removal efficiency there are several advantages of ec such as easy operation higher removal efficiency feasible cost and possible automation of the complete process small size system need of little maintenance and the less amount of sludge production no need of any chemical addition make it a promising technology as compared to other techniques emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 mollah et al 2004 rajeshwar et al 1994 vik et al 1984 for different types of water wastewater ground and surface water up to 99 as removal efficiency has been attained kobya et al 2013 vasudevan et al 2010 in situ metal hydroxide generation works as a coagulant during ec the summary of electrochemical reactions through using aluminum al as an electrode is given below kobya et al 2011 2al al3 3e at anode 2h2o 2e h2 2oh at cathode al3 3oh al oh 3 s in aqueous solution this al oh 3 complex is believed to serve as an adsorbent for as kobya et al 2011 flores et al 2013 al oh 3 s haso2 4 al oh 3 haso2 4 s in the process of coagulation ph is considered one of the important parameters for the removal of as initial ph and elevation of ph both control the as removal during the process of coagulation normally an aqueous solution has as iii in form of h3aso3 h2aso 3 and haso2 3 redox potential and ph alters the as speciation in the solution in the same manner the metal ion speciation also changes with the ph of the solution so the removal of as changes with changing ph during the process of electrocoagulation an increase of ph from acidic ph 3 to a neutral ph 7 increases the percentage removal of as from 93 61 to 98 43 while after ph 7 there was no significant change in the removal efficiency current density is another important parameter for as removal during ec it finds the coagulant dosage production of bubbles floc size and growth which affect the removal efficiency during ec higher removal was observed at the higher applied current densities a current density of 60 a m2 was found to remove a maximum of 99 47 as from water thakur and mondal 2017 while a decrease in as concentration below to who standards 10 μgl 1 was achieved by using aluminum as an anode with current densities of 4 ma m2 in a continuous filter reactor with flow velocities of 1 82 cm s guzmán et al 2016 there are many studies which highlight the removal of as by using electrocoagulation process song et al 2014 flores et al 2013 ali et al 2012 lacasa et al 2011 use of iron is much efficient as it is co precipitated in the presence of as roberts et al 2004 fuller et al 1993 for high as removal efficiency oxidation of fe ii generated during ec with respect to total iron dose is very essential dissolution of fe ii by oxidation from the anode finds out the oxidation of as iii to as v in ec if the oxidation is fast which mostly occurs at higher ph than the oxidation of as iii is lower an optimum ph for the removal of as iii is reported as 7 banerji and chaudhari 2016 iron plates are capable to remove more than 95 of as from potable contaminated water and for making it suitable for drinking purposes by lowering the value of as below 10 μg l 3 1 3 adsorption adsorption is emerging as a frontline technology for the removal of pollutants from water there is an increasing trend for the use of mineral oxides biological materials polymer resins and activated carbons as an adsorbent dambies et al 2002 adsorption technique is widely used due to a number of characteristics such as easy operation high removal efficiency low cost and sludge free processes a number of studies has reported the use of novel materials to adsorb as from water which include activated carbon zhang et al 2007 oliveira et al 2009 alumina han et al 2013 zeolites swarnkar and tomar 2012 clays anjum et al 2011 and iron oxides sun et al 2013 in addition use of activated alumina li et al 2011 goethite tang et al 2010 layered double hydroxides dadwhal et al 2011 delorme et al 2007 volcanic ash chen et al 2011 ferric hydroxides streat et al 2008 modified cellulose tian et al 2011 feal doped polymers kumar et al 2011 inorganic ion exchange adsorbents chubar 2011 and cheap materials such as goethite coated sand hematite coated sand and bone char mlilo et al 2010 brunson and sabatini 2009 has been used for water treatment with higher concentrations of as brunson and sabatini 2009 commercially available activated carbons have also been widely applied for the adsorption of as v and as iii from water navarro and alguacil 2002 several forms of activated carbon have been synthesized for the treatment of water and wastewater nagarnaik et al 2003 reed et al 2000 periasamy and namasivayam 1995 a coconut husk carbon was synthesized and optimum as iii removal was obtained by adsorption on this activated carbon at ph 12 0 manju et al 1998 similarly mondal et al 2006 used the fe3 impregnated granular activated carbon for the removal of as from virtual polluted groundwater and a higher sorption capacity on this commercial carbon was obtained in the presence of fe2 fe3 and mn2 some metallic impregnated silver and copper activated carbons were applied for the remediation of as rajakovic 1992a activated carbon with different ash contents e g a coal based carbon with 5 6 ash peat based extruded carbon with 5 ash and coconut shell carbon with 3 ash showed that the activated carbon with more ash content was more effective to remove as v lorenzen et al 1995 moreover a combination of carbon steel wool and granular activated carbon was also very effective to remove as from water campos 2002 some metal oxides are very effective to absorb and to remove as conventional alumina adsorption capacity and its rate to remove as is relatively slow and low lin and wu 2001 aluminum hydroxide also showed ph dependency when it is tested for the adsorption of as anderson et al 1976 and ph value of 9 was considered optimum for the immobilization of as by aluminum hydroxide kosmulski 2009 the granulated iron oxide formulated for the removal of both as iii and as v contain binary oxides of silica and amorphous iron in which complexes of as with silica and amorphous iron oxide in situ may be formed preventing from disintegration this binary granulated adsorbent has the ability to remove both as v as well as as iii zeng 2004 quintinite mg4al2 oh 12co3 3h2o a layered double hydroxide through mild thermal treatment showed a100 as removal efficiency when the initial concentration of as was 16 mg l delorme et al 2007 3 1 4 membrane technology and reverse osmosis one of the promising technologies for the removal of as from groundwater and for purification of drinking water includes the membrane processes mondal et al 2013 besides removing turbidity and coloring compounds membrane separation processes are an absolute barrier for viruses and bacteria so it is cited as a suitable technology for treating water tam et al 2007 microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes have the ability to remove as in particulate forms from water because their typical pore size i e 0 1 1 μm and 0 01 0 1 μm respectively are not small enough for removing as in dissolved form mondal et al 2013 dutta et al 2012 a driving force such as a pressure difference across the membrane is required for the movement of molecules for the removal of as different types of membrane technologies such as ultrafiltration nanofiltration microfiltration and reverse osmosis are employed gonzalez et al 2019 uddin et al 2007 pal et al 2014 reported 98 removal efficiency for as v by using nanofiltration for 0 18 mg l feed concentration at ph 7 2 however the removal efficiency at the higher feed of as iii is very low which does not match the permissible limits so there is a need for pre oxidation of as iii to as v uddin et al 2007 groundwater as may be removed up to 80 by using iron for co precipitation and then the following filtration by using granular media filter schmidt et al 2016 reverse osmosis ro is also a successful option for the treatment of water for as removal abejón et al 2015 walker et al 2008 for water desalination this technology has been used successfully employed for many years this process is automated and can be controlled and often very high elimination almost 100 of low molecular mass ions and compounds a removal of about 99 of as iii was reported when synthetic brackish water was treated at ph 7 5 9 6 and 24 40 bar feed with 49 5 μg l of as iii teychene et al 2013 a household ro unit reported an average 80 2 28 1 removal of as iii for a maximum feed of 180 μg l concentration walker et al 2008 a pilot trial by using the sand filter as a granular media filter and reverse osmosis treatment have shown up to 80 of as removal while the concentration of as varies between 230 μg l and 780 μg l schmidt et al 2016 removal of as may be facilitated due to the natural occurrence of iron concentration in water by the process of co precipitation berg and hallmann 2006 a molar ratio of fe as as 4 10 in reverse osmosis concentrate provides 80 as removal by using fecl3 as a coagulant mercer and tobiason 2008 in recent years membranes based on polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and its copolymers have attracted a large interest in the treatment of water the reason for this much interest and attention is the outstanding properties such as good chemical and mechanical resistance and thermal and hydrolytic stability liu et al 2014 kang et al 2014 3 2 bio phytoremediation technologies worldwide attention has been drawn by as pollution and becomes a global concern due to many injurious health effects shah et al 2019 singh and taylor 2019 tirkey et al 2017 hue 2013 casentini et al 2011 bissen and frimmel 2003a b microbe forms the majority of life on planet earth which comprises bacteria eukaryotes viruses and archaea in the presence of as survival strategies of microbes are through sequestration reduction oxidation methylation reactions and extrusion from or within or outside the cytosol the complex role of microbes in a geochemical cycle of as can be found in various review articles tsai et al 2009 stolz et al 2006 oremland and stolz 2003 mukhopadhyay et al 2002 broadly depending on whether microbes drain energy or gain energy it can be divided into two groups for their as association kulp et al 2008 hoeft et al 2004 santini and vanden hoven 2004 oremland et al 2002 heterotrophic bacteria do not gain any energy but drains energy whether by respiring or detoxification of as two type of heterotrophic bacteria are identified arsenite as iii oxidizing bacteria and arsenate as v reducing bacteria heterotrophic as v reducing bacteria are further two types respiratory as v reducing bacteria and cytoplasmic as v reducing bacteria at the beginning of the respiratory chain heterotrophic as iii oxidizing bacteria use as iii as an electron donor the symbiotic relationship between crop plant species and fungi is widespread arbuscular mycorrhizae symbiosis with plants is a key component that helps the plants to tolerate the water shortage ruiz lozano and aroca 2010 and nutrient deficiencies arbuscular mycorrhizae association increases the as tolerance by improving the plant growth that reduces the concentration of the metalloid per unit plant biomass similarly this interaction changes the expression of the high affinity phosphate transporter within plant roots burleigh 2001 and reduces the as v uptake through these pathways chen et al 2007 moreover mycorrhizae association changes the speciation pattern of the different as species in plant tissues highly toxic inorganic species are converted to less toxic organic as species within the plants shoots zhang et al 2015 in addition to this arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization increases the ratio of as iii as v zhang et al 2015 as this form readily complexes with phytochelatins and compartmentalized to the vacuole duan et al 2007 under as contaminations plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizae could improve phosphorus nutrition and growth resulting in the dilution effect on as in the plant tissues xu et al 2008 chen et al 2007 xia et al 2007 more importantly gonzalez chavez et al 2002 found that arbuscular mycorrhizae could reduce the as v influx into the excised roots of holcus lanatus it is reported by christophersen et al 2009 that arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization reduced the uptake of as v in barley via down regulation of the high affinity pi transports in plant roots that also absorb as v moreover arbuscular mycorrhizae association with plant may contribute to as exclusion involving reduction of as v to the as iii and the exclusion of as iii out of fungal cells gonzález chávezdel et al 2011 in addition arbuscular mycorrhizae symbiosis could alleviate toxicity of as v by mitigating the oxidative stress garg and singla 2012 and changing the distribution of as in plants chen et al 2012a b studies showed that arbuscular mycorrhizas occur naturally in as contaminated soils smith et al 2010 and tolerance of maize is improved by mycorrhizal inoculation bai et al 2008 plantain orłowska et al 2012 tomato liu et al 2005 white clover ryegrass dong et al 2008 and chinese brake fern leung et al 2013 arsenic resistant plants tolerant accumulator and hyper accumulator can accumulate and tolerate moderate to high concentration of as in different plants parts without displaying toxic symptoms of as arsenic accumulators plants accumulate low to moderate as concentration in the root and the hyper accumulator plants accumulate high as concentration in the above ground parts uptake as but resist from causing the toxic effect producing food crops free from as especially in areas with higher levels of as in soil and groundwater is of primary importance hyper accumulators plants mainly pteris spp remediate as contaminated soils by the maximum containment method by storing it in different above and below ground parts without damaging itself these plants also remediate contaminated sites by preventing as leaching and stabilizing the as in soil by storing in roots however as species bioavailability and bio accessibility are the most important factors contributing to the efficacy of the plant in phytoremediation processes wyke et al 2014 3 3 agronomic practices irrigation practices and nutrients management provide important strategies in plant adaptation to tolerate as toxicity these practices trigger various mechanisms in soil plant systems that are helpful in reducing as uptake and translocation arsenic toxicity risks are related to its availability in term of the total amount as well as its concentration in soil solution that is governed by soil physical and chemical characteristics and environmental conditions in the rhizosphere soil abiotic factors such as redox potential and ph and biotic factors i e microorganisms play role in the interconversion of various as species and consequently its accumulation in plants banerji et al 2019 nearing et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 one of the best ways for a sustainable and immediate solution is the management of irrigation water to reduce as in agricultural practices a significant effect of deficit irrigation has been observed with decreased as contents in rice arao et al 2009 deficit irrigation generally creates an oxidized condition that hinders the reduction of as v to as iii which prominently increased plant availability higher solubility and toxicity takahashi et al 2004 arsenic has similarity to soil mineral nutrients so its interaction with such minerals may decrease as uptake in plants while under a continuous supply of water as uptake is increased because of high concentration of fe reducing bacterias xu et al 2008 takahashi et al 2004 meanwhile it also improves as bioavailability and solubility through fe oxyhydroxides reduction that predominate in root plaques kim et al 2009 horneman et al 2004 islam et al 2004 and reduction of methyl as and as v species to more soluble as iii species in grains an intermittent flooding condition reduces the concentration of as in comparison with continuous flooding horneman et al 2004 in comparison with aerobic conditions anaerobic conditions resulted in 3 16 folds higher as accumulation in rice plant while aerobic conditions reduced total as availability 10 to 100 times mainly due to its reduction in as v hu et al 2015 hence agronomic practices may be employed to mitigate as build up in the human food chain arsenic uptake varies from plant species to species generally its uptake is low in cereals such as barley and wheat in comparison to rice su et al 2010 signes pastor et al 2007 williams et al 2007 therefore under specified as contaminated conditions crop plant selection is also critical mineral nutrients play an important role in the development and growth of plants and as antagonistically affect the uptake and transport of various minerals and vice versa adrees et al 2015 among the mineral nutrients silicon has been observed to reduce the uptake and toxic effect of as in plants zia et al 2017 keller et al 2015 shen et al 2014 chen et al 2000 it is also observed that a significant negative correlation exists between as iii or as v and si uptake and concentration in rice seedlings tripathi et al 2013 hu et al 2013 guo et al 2007 similarly si application in soil silica gel 10 g kg 1 of soil reduced the as concentration in flag leaf straw grains and husk of rice plants fleck et al 2013 in the vicinity of the endoderm the physical barrier formed by the si deposition may reduce the cell wall porosity of inner root tissues thus decreasing the metal concentration in xylem keller et al 2015 wu et al 2015 also suggested that si nutrition was a central player to restrict the as accumulation in shoots and roots of six genotypes of rice silicon nutrition efficiently limited the accumulation of as in tomato marmiroli et al 2014 among other plant mineral nutrients iron fe has a strong affinity towards as and may reduce as absorption in rice nath et al 2014 liu et al 2004 soil iron hydr oxides are known as important solid phases that are responsible for as mobilization immobilization in sediments and soils frommer et al 2011 daus et al 1998 iron hydr oxides can oxidize as iii when they are catalyzed or induced for instance by fe ii or light it was reported that the amorphous fe reacts as a sink of as in soil the bioavailability and mobility of as are significantly affected b fe redox cycling significant correlations was observed in 73 rice genotypes and soil which indicates that iron redox cycling directly affect as fractionation in soil and affected the bioavailability of as indirectly liu et al 2015 in soil the increasing concentration of free fe oxide in the soil also decrease as uptake by promoting the formation of fe plaques on and around the surface of the root iron plaques are usually formed on surfaces of roots in aquatic plants including rice armstrong 1964 liu et al 2004 indicated that fe plaques had a high affinity to as v and affect the uptake of as v by rice seedlings fe plaque may thus also play a role in decreasing the uptake of as in soil plant systems these findings also specify that fe plaques might sequester as thus reducing the translocation of as from roots to shoots sulfur was found to stimulate iron plaque on the roots of rice plants the rate of formation of the iron plaque was increased with increased concentration of sulfur sulfur treated rice plants decreased as concentration so sulfur fertilization can be used as a developmental approach for the reduction of as in rice plants hu et al 2007 moreover the thiol groups of cysteine cys and glutathione gsh are often involved in redox cycles consisting of thiol disulfide conversions saito 2004 phytochelatins pc and reduced glutathione gsh are essential for the plants to counter oxidative stress plants belonging to the poaceae family has12 of the total sulfates in the form of gsh grill et al 2001 the toxicity of as is due to its propensity to bind to sulfhydryl groups and consequently it is detrimental to general protein functioning the nucleophilicity of the thiol group and especially those of gsh and pcs phytochelatins play important roles in the detoxification of heavy metals by direct conjugation with the sulfhydryl group tripathi et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 reported that rice plants pretreated with low amounts of s accumulated less as iii in the detoxification process of as when as v is converted into as iii sulfhydryl groups of gsh and pc provide binding sites for the as iii phosphorus is one of the 17 essential elements for plants and a most limiting element for growth and development it rapidly transforms into insoluble complexes with cations particularly with iron and aluminum under acid conditions vance et al 2003 arsenic and p compete in the plant at uptake site biswas et al 2018 stoeva and bineva 2003 and p addition in rooting medium usually suppress as uptake gunes et al 2009 rahman et al 2008 4 conclusion arsenic mobilization in groundwater aquifers leads its way to the water systems used for irrigation as well as for human and animal consumption it is logical to establish and use novel as removal technologies which are sustainable and enough efficient to tackle this increasing as pollution in soil plant food chain continuum the issue requires much attention due to water scarcity and climate change a number of conventional water treatment technologies based on physicochemical principles such as softening and the addition of lime coagulation and filtration with an average efficiency less than 90 must be replaced by more advanced technologies such as adsorption use of aluminum and membrane technologies for physical separation there are some factors which contribute for the successful application of arsenic removal technologies which include the concentration of arsenic in raw water a parametric value for achievement and existing scheme of treatment the source of water and lithography of the region in addition to water treatment water management practices in agricultural system may also provide a way to tackle arsenic buildup in the human food chain a remarkable effect of rice cultivation with less water has been proved much effective in decreasing plant arsenic accumulation and toxicity careful microbiological techniques with fertilizers management of iron sulfur phosphorus and silicon may also result in an antagonistic effect on as uptake by crop plants further to fulfill human food and water demands in coming decades detailed biochemical and physiological studies should continue for sustainable ways to remediate arsenic polluted soils and water appendix a supplementary data the

12247,this study aims to investigate the groundwater potential of coastal plain sands area of ado odo ota within dahomey basin using the integration of aeromagnetic method and electrical resistivity imaging the aeromagnetic method is applied to reveal the possible hydrogeological structures such as lineament or fracture buried in the subsurface the lineaments which are interconnected are observed in the eastern part of the study area while the western part is void of the interconnectivity of lineaments resistivity technique is applied in regions where there are interconnectivity and non interconnectivity of lineament to delineate occurrence of groundwater about the observed lineament the depths to magnetic sources range between 102 6 and 1965 2 m furthermore the result of resistivity technique shows that the depth to aquifer ranges from 40 to 100 m with corresponding resistivity values that range between 150 0 and 350 0 ωm in the region of the interconnectivity of lineament which is the eastern part of the study area igboloye covenant university area and had high groundwater potential the western part which is void of the interconnectivity of lineaments alapoti area ranges from 80 to 130 m with resistivity values that range between 250 0 and 450 0 ωm suggesting that the area has low groundwater potential the study therefore shows that the occurrence of groundwater in ado odo ota community is a function of hydrogeological structures such as lineaments or fractures and as a result this information could serve as guide for borehole drillers civil engineers and resident of the study area for proper planning before siting borehole either for domestic or industrial use graphical abstract result of resistivity technique taken in the western part of the study area image 1 keywords groundwater potential aeromagnetic technique sedimentary rock borehole drillers electrical resistivity imaging nigeria 1 introduction it has been confirmed that groundwater exists in the three main rocks types that are found in the earth crust namely the igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and each of these rocks that host the groundwater needs to be carefully studied to derive maximum benefit vouillamoz et al 2015 exploration of groundwater is usually a hydrogeological and hydro geophysical inference operation and depends on the analysis of the hydrological indicators and assurance anthony 2012 as a result groundwater has been adjudged to offer an abundance of water to a man olasehinde 2010 omole 2013 omole and ndambuki 2014 adagunodo et al 2018a which is a reliable and most constant source of water supply in terms of quantity and quality due to its invisibility on the earth subsurface and probable misinformation about its existence many have not placed value on groundwater as the only source of sustainable water supply however the occurrence of groundwater in any part of the surface of the earth is not a matter of chance but as a result of the interaction of physiographical ecological hydrological geological and climatic factors biswas et al 2012 mclachlan et al 2017 therefore exploring groundwater resource requires the use of certain geophysical techniques to derive its benefits various geophysical methods have been employed in exploring groundwater resources ranging from traditional methods such as fracture trace method to sophisticated ones which include electrical electromagnetic seismic methods etc however recently it has been observed that using any geophysical techniques alone for groundwater investigation might not yield desired result omole 2013 descloitres et al 2013 ojo et al 2015 and this is due to the heterogeneous nature of the subsurface it is often possible to determine the depth to basement and under the favourable situation quantitatively map basement structures such as host blocks and faults prieto and morton 2003 barbara et al 2016 using the magnetic technique after all structure in the shallower segment often lies comfortably atop the basement at minimal depth furthermore faulting in the shallower segment is often dominated through the revival of basement faults it is often feasible to discern formation favourable to groundwater occurrence from the interpretation of basement goussev et al 2003 while the use of electrical resistivity method can estimate the contents of groundwater host by hydrogeological structure the state water corporations make use of some rivers in ogun state as a means of water supply to the populace this water is insufficient for domestic uses to let alone its availability for industrial uses groundwater has been the only source of water for all activities in the study area the reconnaissance survey revealed some failed hand dug wells in the study area which has been as a result of inadequate use of the proper geophysical tool s to explore the promising aquiferous zones in the subsurface therefore this research aims to investigate the potential assessment of groundwater in coastal plain sand area of ado odo ota using the integration of aeromagnetic and electrical resistivity imaging in order to ascertain the level of availability of this resource in ado odo ota being an industrialized environment which has impact on the population growth in the study area also due to the insufficient geophysical information and topographic nature of the subsurface of the area access to groundwater for the domestic purpose has been problematic 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ado odo ota area fig 1 is within the dahomey basin which is one of the sedimentary terrains of nigeria and located at the southern part of ogun state sharing boundary with lagos state and is characterised by lowlands valleys and hills undulating terrain the pattern of drainage of the study area is dendritic the area drained by iju river river imede river isaku river ogbe river owuru river ore river imojiba and other tributaries it has an area of 878 km2 and a population of about 526 565 at the 2006 census the distance between the study area and lagos lagoon is about 121 km while the mean elevation is about 200 m above the sea level generally arabian and african continent is made up of a precambrian basement of crystalline meta sedimentary igneous and meta igneous rocks adagunodo et al 2018b this crystalline basement is overlain by a series of geological settings ranging from volcanic and sedimentary sequences to unconsolidated cenozoic sediments adagunodo et al 2018c adewoyin et al 2017 nigeria is on the pan african mobile belt which separates the congo cratons and the west african craton the two major geological formations that spread in equal proportion in nigeria are the sedimentary basins upper cretaceous in age and basement rocks precambrian in age adagunodo et al 2018c adewoyin et al 2017 the local geology of the study area is made up of sedimentary rock sequence of dahomey basin fig 2 which extends from the eastern part of ghana through togo and benin republic to the western margin of the niger delta the geological succession in the basin is as follows the structure of the basin is a simple monocline against the basement which underlies the sedimentary rocks at varying depths the dips are reportedly 1 or less to the south and southwest jones and hockey 1964 the sequence of the rocks underlying the study area is as follows abeokuta formation which is cretaceous in age senonia and this formation lies conformably on the basement complex in the north and ewekoro formation in the north east it is the oldest sedimentary formation having a thickness of 250 300 m reyment 1965 offodile 2002 it consists of arkosic sandstones and grits tending to be carbonaceous towards the base offodile 2002 overlying the abeokuta formation is ewekoro oshosun akinbo formation which is paleocene the formation consists of a series of sandstone shales limestones and clays varying between 100 and 300 m in thickness this formation overlaid by ilaro formation tertiary age eocene it consists of fine to coarse sands alternating with shales and clays offodile 2002 ilaro formation is overlaid by coastal plain sands pliocene and recent alluvium quaternary age of benin formation which is the youngest the formation comprises of sandstones and shales of upper ilaro formation the sequence of predominant continental sands and some lenses of shales and clays which is about 107 7 m thick reyment 1965 offodile 2002 2 2 aeromagnetic method the aeromagnetic method involves the use of aircraft to conduct a magnetic survey to investigate the subsurface this technique makes use of variation in the earth magnetic field as the detecting tool adagunodo et al 2017 magnetic field variations often used as diagnostics of minerals and regional structures in magnetic prospecting the main target of the application is the primary field which varies slowly and is of internal origin small field this varies rapidly and originates outside the earth and spatial variations of the main field which are smaller compared to main field telford et al 1990 these parameters are usually constant with time and place and is caused by local magnetic anomalies in the near surface of the crust of the earth telford et al 1990 2 2 1 description of an analytical signal analytical signal as is known as total gradient and defined as the square root of the sum of vertical derivatives of total magnetic field intensity in the x y and z directions analytical signal requires the horizontal x y derivatives of the total magnetic field of the first order vertical derivative z roest et al 1992 and macleod et al 1993 described that analytical signal could be computed in 3d format from three orthogonal derivatives of the total magnetic field intensity using the expression 1 a s i g x y x f x y 2 y f x y 2 z f x y 2 1 2 where asig is analytical signal and f is observed total magnetic field at x y space domain analysis using splines are used in horizontal derivatives computation and wavenumber domain using fast fourier transform are used for vertical gradient computation al garni 2010 2 2 2 tilt derivative analysis

sq km was acquired from nigeria geological survey agency ngsa which was collected between 2006 and 2009 and covered the study area the mean terrain clearance mtc used during the acquisition is 80 m the equipment used for the acquisition of the data by the ngsa is 3 scintrex cesium vapour magnetometers mounted in about 7 cessna caravan fixed wing aircraft the data recording interval was 0 1 s or less than 7 m and flight line spacing of 500 m projection method used in processing the data was the universal transverse mercator utm and the wgs 84 as a datum the spheroid model used was the clarke 1880 modified 33 e central meridian a scaling factor of 0 9996 a 500 000 m x bias a 0 m y bias and 50 m grid mesh size were the plotting specification and igrf 2005 model was used for the calculation

montaj software version 6 4 fig 3 the second step involved analytical studies which were carried out using interpretation techniques the interpretation techniques used include analytical signal tilt derivative analysis and source parameter imaging the procedure is described in section 2 1 1 2 1 3 using version 6 4 of oasis montaj software 2 4 electrical resistivity principle one of the new developments in recent years is the use of 2 d electrical imaging tomography surveys to map subsurface geology adagunodo et al 2015 such surveys are usually carried out using a large number of electrodes 25 or more connected to a multi core cable a laptop microcomputer together with an electronic switching unit is used to select the relevant four electrodes for each measurement automatically at present field techniques and equipment to carry out 2 d resistivity surveys are fairly well developed the necessary field equipment is commercially available from several international companies adagunodo et al 2015 in electrical resistivity technique two pairs of electrodes are used for the fieldwork the outer two electrodes are typically the current source electrodes and the inner two electrodes are the potential receiver sink electrodes the array spacing expands about the array midpoint while maintaining an equivalent spacing between each electrode keller and frischknecht 1966 the resistivity measurements are usually made by injecting current into the ground through two electrodes and measuring the resulting voltage difference at two potential electrodes from the current i and voltage v values an apparent resistivity ρa value can be estimated as shown in eq 9 wenner array with multi electrodes is usually adopted for 2 d imaging adagunodo et al 2015 this array is suitable to map the lateral subsurface variations within the investigated region 9 ρ a 2 π a v i where the ρa is measured in ω m v is measured in volt i is measured in ampere a is the electrode spacing in meter while 2πa is known as the geometric factor the advantages of the wenner array are that the apparent resistivity can be calculated quickly in the field and the instrument sensitivity is not as crucial as with other array geometries relatively small current magnitudes are needed to produce measurable potential differences epa 1993 the disadvantages are that for each sounding all of the electrodes have to be moved to a new position imaging deep into the earth it is necessary to use longer current cables handling the cables and electrodes between each measurement can be cumbersome especially in steep terrain the wenner array is also very sensitive to near surface inhomogeneity which may skew more in depth electrical responses 2 5 electrical resistivity data acquisition in this research 2d resistivity profiling using wenner configuration fig 2 was adopted with the aid of the abem terrameter sas 1000 series in obtaining the resistivity data the arrangement of profiling used for the acquisition of resistivity data in this work is wenner array with the profiles length of 400 m and 1200 m respectively the 2d resistivity data was interpreted using diprofwin software version 4 the absolute error rms of 0 58 was achieved at five 5 iterations other materials used are four 4 hammers two 2 current cables and two 2 potential cables which are the connecting

responses of aeromagnetic data fig 3 shows the total magnetic intensity of over ado odo ota the first magnetic anomaly of interest was the high magnetic value ranging between 68 2 and 80 0 nt these are found trending in the eastern southern and north west part respectively the second magnetic anomaly had high magnetic intensity value ranging between 58 2 and 66 4 nt the third magnetic anomaly represented semi intermediate magnetic anomalies ranging between 55 4 and 57 8 nt the fourth anomaly had magnetic intensity values that ranged between 47 0 and 55 1 nt the fifth magnetic anomaly has tmi values that range between 4 8 and 45 5 nt geologically the first second third and fourth magnetic anomalies represented shallow basement complex rocks judging from the high magnetic intensity value observed which is a reflection of typical igneous and metamorphic rocks while the fifth magnetic anomalies represent sedimentary terrain in terms of rock types first second and third magnetic anomalies indicated the presence of igneous rock the fourth magnetic anomalies represent metamorphic rock and the fifth magnetic anomalies represent sedimentary rock the observed geological variations that existed in the area are essential in understanding the hydrogeological situation of the study area particularly in terms of groundwater potential 3 2 analytical signal of aeromagnetic data the advantage of this interpretation technique is that its shape is independent of the direction of magnetisation of the source body and the ambient field as well roest et al 1992 macleod et al 1993 as a result of this the analytical signal is beneficial at low magnetic latitude ridges or peaks in analytical signal total magnetic intensity anomaly map occur mostly on geological targets such as faults volcanic plugs dykes shear zones lithological contacts discrete bodies and their edges magnetisation s directions notwithstanding roest et al 1992 wijns et al 2005 anudu et al 2014 the analytical signal map of ilaro sheet 279 shows some anomalies bodies in the area fig 4 analytical signal map of the aeromagnetic data of the study area confirms that the anomalies peaks exist over the causative bodies this is shown in fig 4 using dash line circle as a demarcation which can be as a result of thick sediment underlying the sedimentary formation in the study area the probable causative bodies scattered within the central part of the study area towards the east and south were observed moreover this depicts the structural elements that can control the groundwater occurrence in the southern and eastern part of the study area 3 3 tilt derivative of aeromagnetic data tilt derivative analysis map is shown in fig 5 and this described the presence of lineaments in the study area and concentrated in the eastern part of the study area the lineaments pattern is a northwest southeast and northeast southwest structural trend two geological environments shallow basement complex and sedimentary terrain were indicated in fig 5 however shallow basement rock sources dominated the north east and south east region and partly the southern region however the sedimentary terrain was deep seated and shallow basement sources occurring at a depth ranging between 102 6 m and 663 0 m this was inferred using source parameter imaging as shown in fig 6 this indicates that in the north east and south east regions there are linear structures which are probably fractures which are pronounced in the region compared to the western part of the study area furthermore it is also implied that in eastern region groundwater could be as a result of fracturing and not thick sedimentary cover the presence of lineaments in the study area could be as a result of shallow basement rock intruded into the basin these lineaments may likely be groundwater channels which might serve as groundwater aquifer 3 4 source parameter imaging source parameter imaging spi is used mostly for determining the depth to magnetic sources when interpreting aeromagnetic data over an area and this was used to determine the thickness of the basin that overlies the basement complex the western part of the study area is shown as deep seated sources and the eastern area is shallow source area fig 6 the western area has the depth to magnetic sources greater than 500 m the intermediate magnetic sources have a depth ranging between 200 m and 500 m while shallow sources on the eastern side have depths less than 200 m the shallow sources originated from shallow basement complex rocks and it has a thickness of about 200 m this is pronounced in the eastern south eastern and partly south however the thickness of sedimentary rock that covers the underground basement rock of the basin ranged from 710 2 m to 1965 2 m and is pronounced in the north western part in the study area the first layer which is recent alluvium varied from 824 m to 1952 m with a thickness of 1128 m a colour indication of light blue to pure blue it was observed that the first layer at alapoti could be cross bedded sand of benin formation which is greenish and could underlay the topsoil the thickness ranged between 413 m and 763 m and the minimum thickness of about 350 m it is clearer from fig 6 that alapoti area with thick overburden and substantial intercalation of sand and silt could be viable for groundwater potential the extension towards the eastern part of alapoti area is igboloye where covenant university ota and its environs are situated on the southern part of the study area it can be seen that the recent alluvium formed in the area is about 61 m thick with the depth that ranged from 763 m to 824 m the benin formation depicted in green colour and ilaro ewekoro oshosun akinbo formation coupled with abeokuta formation and shallow basement complex which are depicted red and pink varied in depths from 386 m to 763 m with a thickness of about 377 m the depth of ilaro formation yellowish at igboloye area varied from 246 m to 362 m with a thickness of about 116 m this igboloye area however could be weathered with fissures that may serve as water bearing conduits the basement depth ranged from 102 m to 231 m with a mean value of 129 m thick 4 electrical resistivity of alapoti area electrical resistivity imaging was carried out at alapoti and igboloye areas figs 7 and 8 where covenant university is situated alapoti is on the western edge and situated where the magnetic intensity is low while covenant university is situated on the high magnetic intensity region as revealed in fig 3 the source parameter imaging reveals that alapoti area has a deep seated source while the covenant university depicts shallow magnetic source depths figs 7 and 8 are composed of three images each the first imaging is the display of the measured apparent resistivity on the field as plotted by diprofwin software the second imaging is the analytical data which compares the standard model with the field data image matching technique adagunodo et al 2015 the third imaging is the 2 d resistivity map that gives the final model of the subsurface the 2 d resistivity map is used to assess the lithologic variations within the subsurface aizebeokhai et al 2016 in the post precambrian settings that is consolidated sedimentary rocks aizebeokhai et al 2016 oyeyemi et al 2018 prolific groundwater could be explored within sandstones or limestones strata oyeyemi et al 2018 the result of 2 dimensional resistivity profiling taking from alapoti indicates that the aquifer sandstones resistivity ranged between 250 0 and 450 0 ωm at a depth of 80 130 m fig 7 while that of igboloye area where covenant university is situated ranged between 150 0 and 350 0 ωm at the depth to the aquiferous unit sandstones which varied between 40 and 70 m the depth to aquiferous strata delineated using 2 d resistivity profiling in covenant university ota agrees with the results of oyeyemi et al 2018 who reported that depth to aquiferous units varied between 34 0 and 77 0 m in iyana iyesi ota using vertical electrical sounding in addition when the depth to aquiferous zones obtained from this present study were compared with the results of oyeyemi et al 2018 and joel et al 2016 that were obtained in the proximity of this present study it was observed that the delineated aquifer s depths in this study were in agreement with those results 5 conclusions the potential groundwater assessments in coastal plain sands area of ado odo ota have been made using the integration of aeromagnetic and electrical resistivity imaging the aeromagnetic method reveals that hydrogeological structures such as lineament or fracture are buried in the subsurface of the study area resistivity technique has been applied in regions where there are interconnectivity and non interconnectivity of lineament to delineate occurrence of groundwater concerning the observed lineament furthermore the study shows there are presences of lineaments that are interconnected which host groundwater in the southern and eastern part of the study area as observed from tilt derivative map the area of high magnetic anomalies has the shallow depth that ranges between 102 6 and 169 1 m while the area of low magnetic anomalies western part of the study area has a deeper depth of about 710 2 to approximately 2000 m the result of resistivity technique shows that the depth to aquifer ranges from 40 to 100 m with corresponding resistivity values that range between 150 0 and 350 0 ωm in the eastern part of the study area igboloye covenant university area this part of the study area had high groundwater potential while the western part which is void of the interconnectivity of lineaments alapoti area ranges from 80 to 130 m with resistivity values that range between 250 0 and 450 0 ωm the study therefore showed that the occurrence of groundwater in the eastern part of ado odo ota is primarily controlled by lineaments fractures while the existence of lineaments in western part suggests depth at which borehole should be drilled to avoid waste of money and energy in drilling abortive boreholes

12247,this study aims to investigate the groundwater potential of coastal plain sands area of ado odo ota within dahomey basin using the integration of aeromagnetic method and electrical resistivity imaging the aeromagnetic method is applied to reveal the possible hydrogeological structures such as lineament or fracture buried in the subsurface the lineaments which are interconnected are observed in the eastern part of the study area while the western part is void of the interconnectivity of lineaments resistivity technique is applied in regions where there are interconnectivity and non interconnectivity of lineament to delineate occurrence of groundwater about the observed lineament the depths to magnetic sources range between 102 6 and 1965 2 m furthermore the result of resistivity technique shows that the depth to aquifer ranges from 40 to 100 m with corresponding resistivity values that range between 150 0 and 350 0 ωm in the region of the interconnectivity of lineament which is the eastern part of the study area igboloye covenant university area and had high groundwater potential the western part which is void of the interconnectivity of lineaments alapoti area ranges from 80 to 130 m with resistivity values that range between 250 0 and 450 0 ωm suggesting that the area has low groundwater potential the study therefore shows that the occurrence of groundwater in ado odo ota community is a function of hydrogeological structures such as lineaments or fractures and as a result this information could serve as guide for borehole drillers civil engineers and resident of the study area for proper planning before siting borehole either for domestic or industrial use graphical abstract result of resistivity technique taken in the western part of the study area image 1 keywords groundwater potential aeromagnetic technique sedimentary rock borehole drillers electrical resistivity imaging nigeria 1 introduction it has been confirmed that groundwater exists in the three main rocks types that are found in the earth crust namely the igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and each of these rocks that host the groundwater needs to be carefully studied to derive maximum benefit vouillamoz et al 2015 exploration of groundwater is usually a hydrogeological and hydro geophysical inference operation and depends on the analysis of the hydrological indicators and assurance anthony 2012 as a result groundwater has been adjudged to offer an abundance of water to a man olasehinde 2010 omole 2013 omole and ndambuki 2014 adagunodo et al 2018a which is a reliable and most constant source of water supply in terms of quantity and quality due to its invisibility on the earth subsurface and probable misinformation about its existence many have not placed value on groundwater as the only source of sustainable water supply however the occurrence of groundwater in any part of the surface of the earth is not a matter of chance but as a result of the interaction of physiographical ecological hydrological geological and climatic factors biswas et al 2012 mclachlan et al 2017 therefore exploring groundwater resource requires the use of certain geophysical techniques to derive its benefits various geophysical methods have been employed in exploring groundwater resources ranging from traditional methods such as fracture trace method to sophisticated ones which include electrical electromagnetic seismic methods etc however recently it has been observed that using any geophysical techniques alone for groundwater investigation might not yield desired result omole 2013 descloitres et al 2013 ojo et al 2015 and this is due to the heterogeneous nature of the subsurface it is often possible to determine the depth to basement and under the favourable situation quantitatively map basement structures such as host blocks and faults prieto and morton 2003 barbara et al 2016 using the magnetic technique after all structure in the shallower segment often lies comfortably atop the basement at minimal depth furthermore faulting in the shallower segment is often dominated through the revival of basement faults it is often feasible to discern formation favourable to groundwater occurrence from the interpretation of basement goussev et al 2003 while the use of electrical resistivity method can estimate the contents of groundwater host by hydrogeological structure the state water corporations make use of some rivers in ogun state as a means of water supply to the populace this water is insufficient for domestic uses to let alone its availability for industrial uses groundwater has been the only source of water for all activities in the study area the reconnaissance survey revealed some failed hand dug wells in the study area which has been as a result of inadequate use of the proper geophysical tool s to explore the promising aquiferous zones in the subsurface therefore this research aims to investigate the potential assessment of groundwater in coastal plain sand area of ado odo ota using the integration of aeromagnetic and electrical resistivity imaging in order to ascertain the level of availability of this resource in ado odo ota being an industrialized environment which has impact on the population growth in the study area also due to the insufficient geophysical information and topographic nature of the subsurface of the area access to groundwater for the domestic purpose has been problematic 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ado odo ota area fig 1 is within the dahomey basin which is one of the sedimentary terrains of nigeria and located at the southern part of ogun state sharing boundary with lagos state and is characterised by lowlands valleys and hills undulating terrain the pattern of drainage of the study area is dendritic the area drained by iju river river imede river isaku river ogbe river owuru river ore river imojiba and other tributaries it has an area of 878 km2 and a population of about 526 565 at the 2006 census the distance between the study area and lagos lagoon is about 121 km while the mean elevation is about 200 m above the sea level generally arabian and african continent is made up of a precambrian basement of crystalline meta sedimentary igneous and meta igneous rocks adagunodo et al 2018b this crystalline basement is overlain by a series of geological settings ranging from volcanic and sedimentary sequences to unconsolidated cenozoic sediments adagunodo et al 2018c adewoyin et al 2017 nigeria is on the pan african mobile belt which separates the congo cratons and the west african craton the two major geological formations that spread in equal proportion in nigeria are the sedimentary basins upper cretaceous in age and basement rocks precambrian in age adagunodo et al 2018c adewoyin et al 2017 the local geology of the study area is made up of sedimentary rock sequence of dahomey basin fig 2 which extends from the eastern part of ghana through togo and benin republic to the western margin of the niger delta the geological succession in the basin is as follows the structure of the basin is a simple monocline against the basement which underlies the sedimentary rocks at varying depths the dips are reportedly 1 or less to the south and southwest jones and hockey 1964 the sequence of the rocks underlying the study area is as follows abeokuta formation which is cretaceous in age senonia and this formation lies conformably on the basement complex in the north and ewekoro formation in the north east it is the oldest sedimentary formation having a thickness of 250 300 m reyment 1965 offodile 2002 it consists of arkosic sandstones and grits tending to be carbonaceous towards the base offodile 2002 overlying the abeokuta formation is ewekoro oshosun akinbo formation which is paleocene the formation consists of a series of sandstone shales limestones and clays varying between 100 and 300 m in thickness this formation overlaid by ilaro formation tertiary age eocene it consists of fine to coarse sands alternating with shales and clays offodile 2002 ilaro formation is overlaid by coastal plain sands pliocene and recent alluvium quaternary age of benin formation which is the youngest the formation comprises of sandstones and shales of upper ilaro formation the sequence of predominant continental sands and some lenses of shales and clays which is about 107 7 m thick reyment 1965 offodile 2002 2 2 aeromagnetic method the aeromagnetic method involves the use of aircraft to conduct a magnetic survey to investigate the subsurface this technique makes use of variation in the earth magnetic field as the detecting tool adagunodo et al 2017 magnetic field variations often used as diagnostics of minerals and regional structures in magnetic prospecting the main target of the application is the primary field which varies slowly and is of internal origin small field this varies rapidly and originates outside the earth and spatial variations of the main field which are smaller compared to main field telford et al 1990 these parameters are usually constant with time and place and is caused by local magnetic anomalies in the near surface of the crust of the earth telford et al 1990 2 2 1 description of an analytical signal analytical signal as is known as total gradient and defined as the square root of the sum of vertical derivatives of total magnetic field intensity in the x y and z directions analytical signal requires the horizontal x y derivatives of the total magnetic field of the first order vertical derivative z roest et al 1992 and macleod et al 1993 described that analytical signal could be computed in 3d format from three orthogonal derivatives of the total magnetic field intensity using the expression 1 a s i g x y x f x y 2 y f x y 2 z f x y 2 1 2 where asig is analytical signal and f is observed total magnetic field at x y space domain analysis using splines are used in horizontal derivatives computation and wavenumber domain using fast fourier transform are used for vertical gradient computation al garni 2010 2 2 2 tilt derivative analysis tilt derivative also is known as tilt angle derivative miller and singh 1994 verduzco et al 2004 is defined as 2 θ f z f h where 3 f h f x 2 f y 2 and f x f y and f z are the derivatives of the magnetic field h in the x y and z direction salem et al 2007 defined the rate of change of the tilt angle derivative ɵ concerning the x y and z directions as the wave numbers 4 k x θ x 1 a 2 f h 2 f x

depth to magnetic sources when interpreting aeromagnetic data over an area and this was used to determine the thickness of the basin that overlies the basement complex the western part of the study area is shown as deep seated sources and the eastern area is shallow source area fig 6 the western area has the depth to magnetic sources greater than 500 m the intermediate magnetic sources have a depth ranging between 200 m and 500 m while shallow sources on the eastern side have depths less than 200 m the shallow sources originated from shallow basement complex rocks and it has a thickness of about 200 m this is pronounced in the eastern south eastern and partly south however the thickness of sedimentary rock that covers the underground basement rock of the basin ranged from 710 2 m to 1965 2 m and is pronounced in the north western part in the study area the first layer which is recent alluvium varied from 824 m to 1952 m with a thickness of 1128 m a colour indication of light blue to pure blue it was observed that the first layer at alapoti could be cross bedded sand of benin formation which is greenish and could underlay the topsoil the thickness ranged between 413 m and 763 m and the minimum thickness of about 350 m it is clearer from fig 6 that alapoti area with thick overburden and substantial intercalation of sand and silt could be viable for groundwater potential the extension towards the eastern part of alapoti area is igboloye where covenant university ota and its environs are situated on the southern part of the study area it can be seen that the recent alluvium formed in the area is about 61 m thick with the depth that ranged from 763 m to 824 m the benin formation depicted in green colour and ilaro ewekoro oshosun akinbo formation coupled with abeokuta formation and shallow basement complex which are depicted red and pink varied in depths from 386 m to 763 m with a thickness of about 377 m the depth of ilaro formation yellowish at igboloye area varied from 246 m to 362 m with a thickness of about 116 m this igboloye area however could be weathered with fissures that may serve as water bearing conduits the basement depth ranged from 102 m to 231 m with a mean value of 129 m thick 4 electrical resistivity of alapoti area electrical resistivity imaging was carried out at alapoti and igboloye areas figs 7 and 8 where covenant university is situated alapoti is on the western edge and situated where the magnetic intensity is low while covenant university is situated on the high magnetic intensity region as revealed in fig 3 the source parameter imaging reveals that alapoti area has a deep seated source while the covenant university depicts shallow magnetic source depths figs 7 and 8 are composed of three images each the first imaging is the display of the measured apparent resistivity on the field as plotted by diprofwin software the second imaging is the analytical data which compares the standard model with the field data image matching technique adagunodo et al 2015 the third imaging is the 2 d resistivity map that gives the final model of the subsurface the 2 d resistivity map is used to assess the lithologic variations within the subsurface aizebeokhai et al 2016 in the post precambrian settings that is consolidated sedimentary rocks aizebeokhai et al 2016 oyeyemi et al 2018 prolific groundwater could be explored within sandstones or limestones strata oyeyemi et al 2018 the result of 2 dimensional resistivity profiling taking from alapoti indicates that the aquifer sandstones resistivity ranged between 250 0 and 450 0 ωm at a depth of 80 130 m fig 7 while that of igboloye area where covenant university is situated ranged between 150 0 and 350 0 ωm at the depth to the aquiferous unit sandstones which varied between 40 and 70 m the depth to aquiferous strata delineated using 2 d resistivity profiling in covenant university ota agrees with the results of oyeyemi et al 2018 who reported that depth to aquiferous units varied between 34 0 and 77 0 m in iyana iyesi ota using vertical electrical sounding in addition when the depth to aquiferous zones obtained from this present study were compared with the results of oyeyemi et al 2018 and joel et al 2016 that were obtained in the proximity of this present study it was observed that the delineated aquifer s depths in this study were in agreement with those results 5 conclusions the potential groundwater assessments in coastal plain sands area of ado odo ota have been made using the integration of aeromagnetic and electrical resistivity imaging the aeromagnetic method reveals that hydrogeological structures such as lineament or fracture are buried in the subsurface of the study area resistivity technique has been applied in regions where there are interconnectivity and non interconnectivity of lineament to delineate occurrence of groundwater concerning the observed lineament furthermore the study shows there are presences of lineaments that are interconnected which host groundwater in the southern and eastern part of the study area as observed from tilt derivative map the area of high magnetic anomalies has the shallow depth that ranges between 102 6 and 169 1 m while the area of low magnetic anomalies western part of the study area has a deeper depth of about 710 2 to approximately 2000 m the result of resistivity technique shows that the depth to aquifer ranges from 40 to 100 m with corresponding resistivity values that range between 150 0 and 350 0 ωm in the eastern part of the study area igboloye covenant university area this part of the study area had high groundwater potential while the western part which is void of the interconnectivity of lineaments alapoti area ranges from 80 to 130 m with resistivity values that range between 250 0 and 450 0 ωm the study therefore showed that the occurrence of groundwater in the eastern part of ado odo ota is primarily controlled by lineaments fractures while the existence of lineaments in western part suggests depth at which borehole should be drilled to avoid waste of money and energy in drilling abortive boreholes

12248,present study aims to aid for sustainable management plan of the study area by assessing the potentiality of integrated water resource management iwrm following bangladesh water act bwa 2013 and implementing its pilot model through rain water harvesting rwh technique as a scientific outcome the livelihood in the area is at high risk due to drought situation and expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture over the last decade the stream network and watersheds have been delineated for assessing the potentiality of surface water conservation the implemented rwh process includes technologically modified dug well recharge and recharge well runoff water conservation in re excavated ponds kharies along with constructed check dam and beels the annual bimodal distribution of rainfall has high harvesting potentiality during rainy season along with direct runoff amount of 1215 mm the total harvested amount of rainfall from rooftop settlement area and cultivated area are 9670869 m3 145329128 m3 and 730431628 m3 respectively with total amount of 885431625 m3 the total harvested amount of rainfall and runoff water can fulfill 71 of the total water demand of household and agriculture after implementation of mar technique situation started to reverse that is gwt started rising in response to the augmented groundwater recharge artificially analyzed physical chemical and bacteriological parameters of groundwater quality for pre and post mar technique application stages found suitable for drinking purpose before implementation of surface water management scheme water was available for three to five months but after implementation it is round the year moreover the implemented rwh schemes and cross dam reduce pressure on groundwater withdrawal and provide benefits to farmers particularly women for domestic uses pisciculture duck rearing etc pinpoint 4r principles of iwrm beneficiaries are happy about the inclusiveness and sustainability of schemes with most positive attitude for iwrm practice in study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated water resource management iwrm rainwater harvesting rwh managed aquifer recharge mar barind tract bangladesh 1 introduction bangladesh is one of the most disaster prone countries in the world world bank 2018 almost every year the country experiences disasters of one kind another or a cruel combination of extremes like floods droughts tropical cyclones etc the extreme weather events along with high population density social inequity inadequate financial resources etc have made the country highly vulnerable to disaster since independence in 1971 the country has suffered nine droughts of major magnitude as well as floods or cyclones paul 1998 the national water management plan national water management plan 2000 in the country considers drought as a major water deficiency issue in water scarce and agro based present study area popularly known as barind tract where the agricultural water demand needs to be balanced with drinking water for the livelihood and environment brammer 1996 alexander 1995 the study area in the tract includes godagari and tanore upazilas of rajshahi district and nachole and gomastapur upazilas of chapai nawabganj district that include a total of 34 unions district upazila and unions are the second third and lowest tiers of the administrative unit in bangladesh having population of 944704 covering an area of 1942 km2 fig 1 the tract is characterized typically as highly elevated 11 47 m above mean sea level rahaman et al 2018 dome shaped undulatory land mass and rain water does not conserve adequately and losses as runoff water and ultimately flow mainly into major rivers like the padma mohananda and purnabhaba and barnai at the southern western and eastern parts respectively the area enjoys sub tropical monsoon climate with seasons like winter nov feb pre monsoon or dry summer march may and monsoon or rainy june sept rahman et al 2016a the area has the focus of strong agricultural development over last 30 years with increasing agricultural productivity the barind multipurpose development authority bmda under the ministry of agriculture moa government of bangladesh gob plays a central role in the area for water resource management for agriculture and domestic use agricultural practice cover 77 of the area but only 7 covers surface water bodies which mostly dries up during summer seasons islam 2017 the cropping pattern is dominated by rice boro aman and aus where rain fed aman covers maximum area followed by boro dry season variety other crops like wheat oilseed pulse fruit and maize have 1 9 share in cropping pattern islam 2017 the area indicate that only 4 48 km2 of the total area has very good that of 13 170 km2 25 342 km2 30 405 km2 and 28 379 km2 have good moderate poor and very poor class of groundwater potentiality respectively rahaman et al 2018 the poor to very poor groundwater potential zones 58 with highly irregular to irregular topography high drainage density less rainfall and low top soil cover barind clay of pleistocene age of low infiltration capacity 2 3 mm day jahan et al 2010a to recharge groundwater has effect on its potentiality jahan et al 2007 2015 simultaneously due to excessive withdrawal of groundwater extension of irrigated agriculture groundwater table gwt has been declining at an alarming rate since beginning of last decades which undermines the water availability and put threat on sustainability jahan et al 2010b rahman et al 2016a 2016b 2017 but the irrigation demand is increasing day by day so implementation of rwh techniques with 4r principles of iwrm approach is a demand of time there is hardly no any dedicated policy related to water resource management in bangladesh the recently enacted bwa 2013 provides framework to address holistically the institutional challenges associated with resource management and establishes the authority and responsibility of government to regulate its abstraction and usage with the explicit purpose of ensuring sufficient allocation to all sectors in all places at all times the new ordinance in bengali named krishi kaje bhugorvostho pani bebosthapona ain 2017 groundwater management law in agriculture 2017 has adopted by the gob in 2018 and framed the bwr 2018 under bwa 2103 to implement the clauses and sub clauses through iwrm at grass root level with an aim to provide safe drinking and adequate irrigation water for the people especially the disadvantaged and underprivileged in bangladesh water resource management remains fragmented as it leads to be supply led sector focused technically driven and top down approach focusing high economic social and ecological cost but enabling sufficient and safe access to water for drinking purpose food productivity etc is not a sub sectoral service provision challenge for the water resources sector but rather should be a cross sectoral regulatory and management approach nwmp 2000 moreover iwrm is step by step open ended process of water management jonch clausen 2004 the sustainable paradigm shift from the sub sectoral management of water resources in the study area to a cross sectoral water management regime includes enabling environment i e provision of legal aspects like acts rules policies etc establishing the relationships of the different entities or the local govt institutions lgis like union and upazila administration working for demand supply license arbitrate etc finally the management instruments that include practices technologies and processes islam 2017 different government organisations in the country have taken efforts to improve iwrm for people food nature and industry but unfortunately these have been insufficiently coordinated among different actors and are primarily concerned with their own specific business and provides a legal framework islam 2017 in the concept of iwrm has been developed by researchers hooper 2005 bandaragoda 2006 adeel 2004 biswas 2004 jonch clausen 2004 anderson et al 2008 policymakers falkenmark et al 2004 schulze et al 2004 swatuk 2005 international organization global water partnership gwp the international water association iwa world water council wwc international network of basin organisations inbo the international american canadian water resources associations iacwra the stockholm water symposium sws and the world water price wwp and aid agencies at the same time it is argued that the concept is poorly articulated by epistemic communities conca 2006 and is a nirvana discourse that can scarcely be implemented molle 2008 several practices around the world have been implemented like as iwrm for balancing views and improving practice like iwrm grigg 2008 in developing countries in ghana agyenim and gupta 2012 contrasting principles policy and practice at awash river basin in ethiopia mersha et al 2015 moreover so far no study has carried out to establish the sustainable iwrm practices in water stressed barind tract considering water as a finite and vulnerable resource in present study technical aspects of iwrm are practiced that includes rwh i e re use capture of rainwater or runoff water i e recycle enhanced groundwater resource recharge and ultimately restoration of resource from further depletion through groundwater recharge i e the 4r recharge re use recycle and restore moreover the piloted model of rwh technique is an integral scientific outcome of the present research work along with the study of impact assessment of practiced technologies in order to improve well being of people 2 concepts and methods iwrm is a logical and intuitively appealing concept seeks to manage the water resources in a comprehensive and holistic way capnet 1999 it is intended to improve well being of people through coordinated and equitability way for promoting sustainable water resource management framework in barind tract including both physical demand for drinking water and socio economic components demand for food its three basic pillars are enabling environment of appropriate policies and laws institutional roles and framework and management instruments to apply on a daily basis the iwrm and its linkage to the sub sectors gwp 2000 is shown in fig 2 the various wings of iwrm and its linkage to the other sub sectors gwp 2000 is shown in fig 3 in the present study two major sectors of iwrm are considered as availability of fresh water of appropriate quality includes investigation on climate or rainfall pattern availability of runoff water geology vegetation or cropping pattern topography fresh water of appropriate quality etc and human water need involves components like technology science based decision making aspects and basin level management activities these study considers only the scientific consideration of iwrm so the legal aspects and social considerations are kept outside purposefully in this context rwh technique as a part of iwrm prinz 2003 has adopted as noble approach for collecting concentrating and conserving rain and runoff water from various sources at the simplest level rwh techniques as adopted in present study are divided into two groups cse 2003 rooftop and non rooftop i e settlement and agriculture land areas the long term rainfall data and groundwater table gwt for the period of 1980 2017 are collected from rain gauge stations rgs and permanent hydrograph stations phs from four upazilas the bangladesh water development board

schemes adaptation governance issues and initialization of iwrm process for improved water related services by the lgis in the area 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainwater harvesting potentiality in the study area the number of hh varies from 32922 to 72186 with daily demand of water ranges from 183 to 419 l hh the amount of water needed for drinking and cooking purposes day hh are only 19 l and 23 l respectively while that of for domestic purposes e g cleaning washing bathing toileting etc consume 224 l hh day so that daily monthly and yearly total hh water demand range from 11479 to 14018 344376 420545 and 4132519 5046545 m3 respectively where the share stands for 7 9 and 84 respectively the total agriculture water demand of the major crops as obtained from farmers experience research field experience and water footprint study vary from 264906890 to 589883365 m3 211236841 473809866 m3 and 178745805 328814110 m3 respectively the upazila wise i e godagari tanore gomastapur and nachole average values of water demand for agriculture stands are 464169120 311464155 218296512 and 396848227 m3 with a total agriculture demand of 1390778014 m3 the mean annual rainfall amount of godagari tanore gomastapur and nachole upazilas are 1359 mm 1999 mm 1368 mm and 1399 mm respectively monthly distribution of rainfall of different upazilas fig 6 show that the maximum rainfall occur in july the total rainfall amount is more than 500 mm during rainy season june september the intra annual variability in godagari tanore gomastapur and nachole upazilas range between 0 38 and 3 61 0 44 3 56 0 35 3 18 and 0 45 and 2 79 respectively whereas respective inter annual variability are 0 83 0 76 0 62 and 0 52 these variability reveals that there is high variability in distributions in rainfall with low variability over the years the rainfall patterns of different upazilas fig 4 show bimodal pattern with the long term variation in the annual rainfall depth fig 5 on the other hand the calculated values of runoff q using the scs cn method is 1215 mm in the rainy seasons june september the upazila wise total harvested amount of rainwater from the rooftop and non rooftop area settlement and cultivated area and water demand of major crops in study area has shown in table 2 the total harvested amount of rainfall from rooftop settlement area and cultivated area are 9670869 m3 145329128 m3 and 730431628 m3 respectively with total amount of 885431625 m3 on the other hand the total water demand for hh and agriculture are 18909103 m3 and 1390778014 m3 respectively with a total amount of 1409687117 m3 so the harvested amount of rainwater that can fulfill 71 of the total water demand with respective values of 58 48 and 52 deficit for godagari tanore and nachole upazilas and rest 32 surplus for gomostapur upazila in this context of high rainwater and runoff harvesting potentiality in the area artificial process of groundwater recharge like well and dug well recharge structures using mar technique and water conservation structure like recharge pond check cross dam etc are suggested as adoptive measure for sustainable use of water resource identification of appropriate potential sites for implementation of harvesting and conservation structures are made considering parameters like rainfall amount and pattern drainage network watershed area slope lithology with permeability attribute lineament land use and runoff coefficient along with factors like groundwater level effective storage seepage loss permeability of foundation and abutment permeability lund 2006 lee and farmer 1990 are considered as criteria in selecting suitable sites for harvesting structures padmavathy et al 1993 imsd 1995 el awar et al 2000 de villiers 2001 rao and satish kumar 2004 and is given in fig 7 3 2 rainwater harvesting practice rooftop rwh practice the schematic diagram of the mar technique through well recharge well is shown in fig 7 and the technique is implemented in 2014 in hh level in villages mallikpur and ganoir nachole upazila and in office building in mondumala tanore upazila see fig 8 the monitoring and impact assessment of rwh using mar technique on gwt in the villages mallikpur and ganoir in nachole upazila the seasonality of gwt shows a decreasing over the years up to 2004 the gwt almost regained its original level but after that it has a declining trend and not returning the fluctuation of gwt started rising due to inadequate recharge after implementation of mar technique situation started to reverse that is gwt started rising in response to the augmented groundwater recharge artificially the hydrograph of gwt before and after implementation of mar technique are shown in fig 9 moreover the analyzed physical ph ec and temperature chemical fetotal so4 2 po4 no3 an as and bacteriological fecal coliform parameters of groundwater samples in the area for pre and post mar technique application stages found suitable ecr 1997 bdws 2005 and who 2004 for drinking purpose and free from arsenic toxicity and fecal coliform bacteria contamination the rwh technique has implemented through mar technique using technologically modified dug well recharge in auditorium building village kakonhat and at hh level village kadipur in godagari upazila the roof area of auditorium has area of 692 m2 with respective harvested amount of rainwater are 765 m3 recharge dug well diameter 1 m schematic diagram of rwh through recharge well and dug well recharge models using mar technique are shown in fig 10 and implemented models in villages kakonhat and kadipur in godagari upazila in the study area the relationship between rainfall trends and depth of gwt and sub surface lithology from geoelectric sections of different ves stations in village kakonhat in godagari upazila fig 11 shows that the rainfall amount is decreasing with declining trend of gwt the top clay layer barind clay of thickness 14 m having low permeability and overlies the main aquifer of thickness 34 m has hydrological importance of harvesting rainwater the average depth of gwt from ground surface in the area was 9 44 m 1980 and 21 19 m 2017 i e the area has potentiality of vertically 11 75 m vacuum space which can be filled up by rain water through mar technique so the rwh potentiality of the area is very high during rainy season and the annual as well as monthly harvested and storage amount of rainwater is enough to ensure sustainability in water supply for domestic and irrigation uses runoff water conservation the stream network is very much important for surface water management according to the stream network map only the 3rd order streams are suitable for constructing a cross dam in the study area the re excavated kharies along with constructed cross dam for runoff water conservation is shown in plate 1 the runoff water in the study area is also conserved in re excavated ponds which act as infiltration tank and helps peoples especially women in domestic use cultivation of vegetables of at least 2 5 hectors of land from each pond fisheries and duck rearing plate 2 before re excavation pond water was available for only for four five months during and after rainy seasons and in rest of time of the year the ponds remained dry so inhabitants severely faced water scarcity for domestic use at the same time huge amount of the runoff water is also conserved in re excavated beels viz lakrakuri beel rohonpur union and joshoil beel radhanagar union in gomastapur upazila with re enforced embankments in the area to provide irrigation in paddy and vegetables fields before re excavation and construction of embankments water was available for only for three five months during and after rainy seasons impact assessment of rwh technique the opinion of beneficiaries about the impact of implemented rwh schemes reveals that before implementing the schemes of surface water was available mostly for three to five months in the area now the scenario has changed completely and irrigation coverage substantially has increased with diversified cropping pattern in the command areas and the withdrawal of groundwater has substantially decreased after implementation of the mar technologies the situation is totally reversed and 100 inhabitants get access to drinking round the year and reported that gwl has been increasing moreover the rain water and run off water harvesting and conservation opportunities has created new employment opportunities through increasing agricultural activities like crop production pisciculture duck rearing etc reduce cost of crop production brought financial benefit with average by 60us considering 1us 80 bdt profit per bigha per year along with about their inclusiveness during planning and implementation process of the schemes they asserted their collective responsibility to look after and maintenance and recurring cost of the schemes and mostly satisfied about the transparency and accountability of the schemes works at implementation stages based on the results of the data collected from interview of beneficiaries the implemented scheme were socially financially and environmentally acceptable to the beneficiaries through their inclusiveness 4 conclusion the iwrm approach is considered to play an important role for improving the well being of people through sustainable management of water resources following bwa 2013 with an aim to practice 4r principles in the barind tract the assessment include the annual average rainfall and seasonal rainfall pattern for planning rainwater harvesting the groundwater potentiality and subsurface lithological condition have been considered for abstraction plan of groundwater in the study area present study covers the implemented models of management instruments of iwrm like rwh technique for surface and groundwater augmentation and conservation the livelihood here is at high risk due to meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts the situation is becoming worsen due to expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture over last nearly three decades which all together put stress on sustainability of agricultural growth threatening country s socio economic sustainability the area has very high rwh potentiality and the harvested amount of rainwater fulfills 71 of the total water demand which is enough for domestic and irrigation uses besides seasonal rainfall variability the rwh schemes has been implemented as pilot study with aquifer recharge well and technologically modified dug well using mar technology and re excavated kharies along with constructed cross check dam ponds and beels to replenish groundwater level through increasing infiltration and conserve more runoff water for the use in agriculture the implemented schemes are socially financially economically and environmentally acceptable to the beneficiaries moreover they are hopeful about the schemes sustainability through inclusiveness governance which is positive attitude unlike other water related implemented projects in bangladesh finally the appropriate iwrm strategies for sustainable resource management with governance performance should be kept in mind for targeting vision 2021 2041 of the gob and achieving sdg goals as declared by un general assembly by 2030

bangladesh 1 introduction bangladesh is one of the most disaster prone countries in the world world bank 2018 almost every year the country experiences disasters of one kind another or a cruel combination of extremes like floods droughts tropical cyclones etc the extreme weather events along with high population density social inequity inadequate financial resources etc have made the country highly vulnerable to disaster since independence in 1971 the country has suffered nine droughts of major magnitude as well as floods or cyclones paul 1998 the national water management plan national water management plan 2000 in the country considers drought as a major water deficiency issue in water scarce and agro based present study area popularly known as barind tract where the agricultural water demand needs to be balanced with drinking water for the livelihood and environment brammer 1996 alexander 1995 the study area in the tract includes godagari and tanore upazilas of rajshahi district and nachole and gomastapur upazilas of chapai nawabganj district that include a total of 34 unions district upazila and unions are the second third and lowest tiers of the administrative unit in bangladesh having population of 944704 covering an area of 1942 km2 fig 1 the tract is characterized typically as highly elevated 11 47 m above mean sea level rahaman et al 2018 dome shaped undulatory land mass and rain water does not conserve adequately and losses as runoff water and ultimately flow mainly into major rivers like the padma mohananda and purnabhaba and barnai at the southern western and eastern parts respectively the area enjoys sub tropical monsoon climate with seasons like winter nov feb pre monsoon or dry summer march may and monsoon or rainy june sept rahman et al 2016a the area has the focus of strong agricultural development over last 30 years with increasing agricultural productivity the barind multipurpose development authority bmda under the ministry of agriculture moa government of bangladesh gob plays a central role in the area for water resource management for agriculture and domestic use agricultural practice cover 77 of the area but only 7 covers surface water bodies which mostly dries up during summer seasons islam 2017 the cropping pattern is dominated by rice boro aman and aus where rain fed aman covers maximum area followed by boro dry season variety other crops like wheat oilseed pulse fruit and maize have 1 9 share in cropping pattern islam 2017 the area indicate that only 4 48 km2 of the total area has very good that of 13 170 km2 25 342 km2 30 405 km2 and 28 379 km2 have good moderate poor and very poor class of groundwater potentiality respectively rahaman et al 2018 the poor to very poor groundwater potential zones 58 with highly irregular to irregular topography high drainage density less rainfall and low top soil cover barind clay of pleistocene age of low infiltration capacity 2 3 mm day jahan et al 2010a to recharge groundwater has effect on its potentiality jahan et al 2007 2015 simultaneously due to excessive withdrawal of groundwater extension of irrigated agriculture groundwater table gwt has been declining at an alarming rate since beginning of last decades which undermines the water availability and put threat on sustainability jahan et al 2010b rahman et al 2016a 2016b 2017 but the irrigation demand is increasing day by day so implementation of rwh techniques with 4r principles of iwrm approach is a demand of time there is hardly no any dedicated policy related to water resource management in bangladesh the recently enacted bwa 2013 provides framework to address holistically the institutional challenges associated with resource management and establishes the authority and responsibility of government to regulate its abstraction and usage with the explicit purpose of ensuring sufficient allocation to all sectors in all places at all times the new ordinance in bengali named krishi kaje bhugorvostho pani bebosthapona ain 2017 groundwater management law in agriculture 2017 has adopted by the gob in 2018 and framed the bwr 2018 under bwa 2103 to implement the clauses and sub clauses through iwrm at grass root level with an aim to provide safe drinking and adequate irrigation water for the people especially the disadvantaged and underprivileged in bangladesh water resource management remains fragmented as it leads to be supply led sector focused technically driven and top down approach focusing high economic social and ecological cost but enabling sufficient and safe access to water for drinking purpose food productivity etc is not a sub sectoral service provision challenge for the water resources sector but rather should be a cross sectoral regulatory and management approach nwmp 2000 moreover iwrm is step by step open ended process of water management jonch clausen 2004 the sustainable paradigm shift from the sub sectoral management of water resources in the study area to a cross sectoral water management regime includes enabling environment i e provision of legal aspects like acts rules policies etc establishing the relationships of the different entities or the local govt institutions lgis like union and upazila administration working for demand supply license arbitrate etc finally the management instruments that include practices technologies and processes islam 2017 different government organisations in the country have taken efforts to improve iwrm for people food nature and industry but unfortunately these have been insufficiently coordinated among different actors and are primarily concerned with their own specific business and provides a legal framework islam 2017 in the concept of iwrm has been developed by researchers hooper 2005 bandaragoda 2006 adeel 2004 biswas 2004 jonch clausen 2004 anderson et al 2008 policymakers falkenmark et al 2004 schulze et al 2004 swatuk 2005 international organization global water partnership gwp the international water association iwa world water council wwc international network of basin organisations inbo the international american canadian water resources associations iacwra the stockholm water symposium sws and the world water price wwp and aid agencies at the same time it is argued that the concept is poorly articulated by epistemic communities conca 2006 and is a nirvana discourse that can scarcely be implemented molle 2008 several practices around the world have been implemented like as iwrm for balancing views and improving practice like iwrm grigg 2008 in developing countries in ghana agyenim and gupta 2012 contrasting principles policy and practice at awash river basin in ethiopia mersha et al 2015 moreover so far no study has carried out to establish the sustainable iwrm practices in water stressed barind tract considering water as a finite and vulnerable resource in present study technical aspects of iwrm are practiced that includes rwh i e re use capture of rainwater or runoff water i e recycle enhanced groundwater resource recharge and ultimately restoration of resource from further depletion through groundwater recharge i e the 4r recharge re use recycle and restore moreover the piloted model of rwh technique is an integral scientific outcome of the present research work along with the study of impact assessment of practiced technologies in order to improve well being of people 2 concepts and methods iwrm is a logical and intuitively appealing concept seeks to manage the water resources in a comprehensive and holistic way capnet 1999 it is intended to improve well being of people through coordinated and equitability way for promoting sustainable water resource management framework in barind tract including both physical demand for drinking water and socio economic components demand for food its three basic pillars are enabling environment of appropriate policies and laws institutional roles and framework and management instruments to apply on a daily basis the iwrm and its linkage to the sub sectors gwp 2000 is shown in fig 2 the various wings of iwrm and its linkage to the other sub sectors gwp 2000 is shown in fig 3 in the present study two major sectors of iwrm are considered as availability of fresh water of appropriate quality includes investigation on climate or rainfall pattern availability of runoff water geology vegetation or cropping pattern topography fresh water of appropriate quality etc and human water need involves components like technology science based decision making aspects and basin level management activities these study considers only the scientific consideration of iwrm so the legal aspects and social considerations are kept outside purposefully in this context rwh technique as a part of iwrm prinz 2003 has adopted as noble approach for collecting concentrating and conserving rain and runoff water from various sources at the simplest level rwh techniques as adopted in present study are divided into two groups cse 2003 rooftop and non rooftop i e settlement and agriculture land areas the long term rainfall

44 3 56 0 35 3 18 and 0 45 and 2 79 respectively whereas respective inter annual variability are 0 83 0 76 0 62 and 0 52 these variability reveals that there is high variability in distributions in rainfall with low variability over the years the rainfall patterns of different upazilas fig 4 show bimodal pattern with the long term variation in the annual rainfall depth fig 5 on the other hand the calculated values of runoff q using the scs cn method is 1215 mm in the rainy seasons june september the upazila wise total harvested amount of rainwater from the rooftop and non rooftop area settlement and cultivated area and water demand of major crops in study area has shown in table 2 the total harvested amount of rainfall from rooftop settlement area and cultivated area are 9670869 m3 145329128 m3 and 730431628 m3 respectively with total amount of 885431625 m3 on the other hand the total water demand for hh and agriculture are 18909103 m3 and 1390778014 m3 respectively with a total amount of 1409687117 m3 so the harvested amount of rainwater that can fulfill 71 of the total water demand with respective values of 58 48 and 52 deficit for godagari tanore and nachole upazilas and rest 32 surplus for gomostapur upazila in this context of high rainwater and runoff harvesting potentiality in the area artificial process of groundwater recharge like well and dug well recharge structures using mar technique and water conservation structure like recharge pond check cross dam etc are suggested as adoptive measure for sustainable use of water resource identification of appropriate potential sites for implementation of harvesting and conservation structures are made considering parameters like rainfall amount and pattern drainage network watershed area slope lithology with permeability attribute lineament land use and runoff coefficient along with factors like groundwater level effective storage seepage loss permeability of foundation and abutment permeability lund 2006 lee and farmer 1990 are considered as criteria in selecting suitable sites for harvesting structures padmavathy et al 1993 imsd 1995 el awar et al 2000 de villiers 2001 rao and satish kumar 2004 and is given in fig 7 3 2 rainwater harvesting practice rooftop rwh practice the schematic diagram of the mar technique through well recharge well is shown in fig 7 and the technique is implemented in 2014 in hh level in villages mallikpur and ganoir nachole upazila and in office building in mondumala tanore upazila see fig 8 the monitoring and impact assessment of rwh using mar technique on gwt in the villages mallikpur and ganoir in nachole upazila the seasonality of gwt shows a decreasing over the years up to 2004 the gwt almost regained its original level but after that it has a declining trend and not returning the fluctuation of gwt started rising due to inadequate recharge after implementation of mar technique situation started to reverse that is gwt started rising in response to the augmented groundwater recharge artificially the hydrograph of gwt before and after implementation of mar technique are shown in fig 9 moreover the analyzed physical ph ec and temperature chemical fetotal so4 2 po4 no3 an as and bacteriological fecal coliform parameters of groundwater samples in the area for pre and post mar technique application stages found suitable ecr 1997 bdws 2005 and who 2004 for drinking purpose and free from arsenic toxicity and fecal coliform bacteria contamination the rwh technique has implemented through mar technique using technologically modified dug well recharge in auditorium building village kakonhat and at hh level village kadipur in godagari upazila the roof area of auditorium has area of 692 m2 with respective harvested amount of rainwater are 765 m3 recharge dug well diameter 1 m schematic diagram of rwh through recharge well and dug well recharge models using mar technique are shown in fig 10 and implemented models in villages kakonhat and kadipur in godagari upazila in the study area the relationship between rainfall trends and depth of gwt and sub surface lithology from geoelectric sections of different ves stations in village kakonhat in godagari upazila fig 11 shows that the rainfall amount is decreasing with declining trend of gwt the top clay layer barind clay of thickness 14 m having low permeability and overlies the main aquifer of thickness 34 m has hydrological importance of harvesting rainwater the average depth of gwt from ground surface in the area was 9 44 m 1980 and 21 19 m 2017 i e the area has potentiality of vertically 11 75 m vacuum space which can be filled up by rain water through mar technique so the rwh potentiality of the area is very high during rainy season and the annual as well as monthly harvested and storage amount of rainwater is enough to ensure sustainability in water supply for domestic and irrigation uses runoff water conservation the stream network is very much important for surface water management according to the stream network map only the 3rd order streams are suitable for constructing a cross dam in the study area the re excavated kharies along with constructed cross dam for runoff water conservation is shown in plate 1 the runoff water in the study area is also conserved in re excavated ponds which act as infiltration tank and helps peoples especially women in domestic use cultivation of vegetables of at least 2 5 hectors of land from each pond fisheries and duck rearing plate 2 before re excavation pond water was available for only for four five months during and after rainy seasons and in rest of time of the year the ponds remained dry so inhabitants severely faced water scarcity for domestic use at the same time huge amount of the runoff water is also conserved in re excavated beels viz lakrakuri beel rohonpur union and joshoil beel radhanagar union in gomastapur upazila with re enforced embankments in the area to provide irrigation in paddy and vegetables fields before re excavation and construction of embankments water was available for only for three five months during and after rainy seasons impact assessment of rwh technique the opinion of beneficiaries about the impact of implemented rwh schemes reveals that before implementing the schemes of surface water was available mostly for three to five months in the area now the scenario has changed completely and irrigation coverage substantially has increased with diversified cropping pattern in the command areas and the withdrawal of groundwater has substantially decreased after implementation of the mar technologies the situation is totally reversed and 100 inhabitants get access to drinking round the year and reported that gwl has been increasing moreover the rain water and run off water harvesting and conservation opportunities has created new employment opportunities through increasing agricultural activities like crop production pisciculture duck rearing etc reduce cost of crop production brought financial benefit with average by 60us considering 1us 80 bdt profit per bigha per year along with about their inclusiveness during planning and implementation process of the schemes they asserted their collective responsibility to look after and maintenance and recurring cost of the schemes and mostly satisfied about the transparency and accountability of the schemes works at implementation stages based on the results of the data collected from interview of beneficiaries the implemented scheme were socially financially and environmentally acceptable to the beneficiaries through their inclusiveness 4 conclusion the iwrm approach is considered to play an important role for improving the well being of people through sustainable management of water resources following bwa 2013 with an aim to practice 4r principles in the barind tract the assessment include the annual average rainfall and seasonal rainfall pattern for planning rainwater harvesting the groundwater potentiality and subsurface lithological condition have been considered for abstraction plan of groundwater in the study area present study covers the implemented models of management instruments of iwrm like rwh technique for surface and groundwater augmentation and conservation the livelihood here is at high risk due to meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts the situation is becoming worsen due to expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture over last nearly three decades which all together put stress on sustainability of agricultural growth threatening country s socio economic sustainability the area has very high rwh potentiality and the harvested amount of rainwater fulfills 71 of the total water demand which is enough for domestic and irrigation uses besides seasonal rainfall variability the rwh schemes has been implemented as pilot study with aquifer recharge well and technologically modified dug well using mar technology and re excavated kharies along with constructed cross check dam ponds and beels to replenish groundwater level through increasing infiltration and conserve more runoff water for the use in agriculture the implemented schemes are socially financially economically and environmentally acceptable to the beneficiaries moreover they are hopeful about the schemes sustainability through inclusiveness governance which is positive attitude unlike other water related implemented projects in bangladesh finally the appropriate iwrm strategies for sustainable resource management with governance performance should be kept in mind for targeting vision 2021 2041 of the gob and achieving sdg goals as declared by un general assembly by 2030

12249,this study investigated the affinity of adsorption of congo red cr dye on burned shoot of eichhornia crassipes bsec biomass and the effects of this dye on bsec the removal of cr from aqueous solution was conducted by a series of batch experiments and the optimum conditions were screen out through optimization study the experimental data were nicely fitted with quadratic model for central composite design ccd the interaction effect of operating factors and optimum conditions of the process can be determined by response surface plots the predicted removal efficiency 98 was achieved with the optimum condition at ph 9 0 0 8 gm l of biomass 40 min contact time and 5 mg l of cr concentration among the four isotherm models langmuir freundlich and tempkin were best fitted for cr adsorption the negative values of δg and positive value of δs indicate the adsorption of dye was spontaneous and entropy effect respectively finally it may be concluded that the burned shoot of eichhornia crassipes biomass has immense potentiality towards removal of dye from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption congo red e crassipes biomass central composite design regeneration 1 introduction the disposal of huge volume of untreated waste water generated from different industries such as textile paper printing food cosmetic paints pigments plastics and leather tanning industries into different water bodies poses a dangerous problem for living organism systems shim et al 2019 kumari et al 2018 chowdhury and saha 2010 the release of industrial effluents containing dyes into the natural water bodies can pose hazardous effects on the living systems because of carcinogenic mutagenic allergenic and toxic nature of dyes akar and özcan 2009 dyes impede light penetration retard photosynthetic activity inhibit the growth of biota and also have a tendency to chelate metal ions which result in micro toxicity to fish and other organisms malik et al 2007 the decomposed product of dyes can pose different effects on humans and animals under aerobic conditions akar and özcan 2009 kiran et al 2009 congo red is a highly colored synthetic azo dye the main cause of an allergic reaction has been known to be the effect of this dye on living body the degradation of dye is the carcinogenic products that act as an eye skin and gastrointestinal irritant it induces respiratory and drowsiness problems which ultimately impresses blood factors allen and koumanova 2005 demirbas 2009 so it has been recognized that the high toxicity nature of congo red in waste water has a serious community health problem in the environment however still this dye is used in many manufacturing industries like dye textile paper and plastics industries for coloring their products alam et al 2015 in recent years dyes contaminated waste water treatment drew great attention over the different techniques such as membrane filtration coagulation precipitation ion exchange lime softening advanced oxidation process roy and mondal 2014 and adsorption shim et al 2019 roy and mondal 2015 most of these techniques have inherent limitation owing to need for expensive chemicals and the generation of newer toxic derivatives as a result of the processes so research on innovative methods and development of such methods is a continuous process for treatment of waste water this method is suitable for adsorption technology due to simplicity and low cost das et al 2013 roy et al 2013 at present it was observed that different types of biosorbents are already being used for removal of pollutants such as granular activated carbon different fruit peels etc the most important dye adsorbent is granular activated carbon deshpande et al 2017 activated carbon adsorption method is a method applied earlier and this method is very effective for the removal of dissolved organic matter many other materials like burmese grape leaf extract borah et al 2018 banana peel mondal and kar 2018 tree fern ho et al 2005 orange peel arami et al 2005 date pits fawzi et al 2003 peanut hulls gong et al 2005 giant duck weed waranusantigul et al 2003 teak tree bark powder patil et al 2011 corn cobs and barley husk chandran et al 2002 rice husk and saw dust malik 2003 agave americana l fibres ben hamissa et al 2007 have been tested for their dye adsorption capacity but finding the highly effective adsorbent with considering the costing effect for adsorption of cr from aqueous solution through a cost effective method is very difficult so the search for an appropriate and inexpensive biomass is a continuing process in the present study eichhornia crassipes is used as an important biosorbent which is found widely in india interferes with navigation recreation irrigation and power generation for the formation of dense mats for vegetative reproduction and extremely high growth rate of e crassipes mall et al 2005 martina et al 2004 most of the researchers feel interested due to easy availability on a large scale and high growth rate throughout the year all over the world so this biomass can also be utilized to remove cr from aqueous solutions which form the motivation of this study a few studies on e crassipes as an adsorbent have already been conducted wanyonyi et al 2014 soni et al 2012 but no research has been reported on use of the burned shoot of e crassipes bsec that may have higher cr removal efficiency the main aim of this investigation is to improve the adsorption capacity of bsec for the removal of cr from aqueous solutions the determination of the solute solvent interaction rate and order of the adsorption process adsorption isotherm and various kinetic models were used a central composite design ccd in response surface methodology rsm by design expert version 7 0 3 stat ease inc 2009 usa is used to optimize the process parameters for the biosorption process the individuals as well as the combined effect of different variables influencing the adsorption process was investigated by this model to identify optimum conditions where high uptake capacity is generated for the removal of cr using bsec biomass to ensure high removal efficiency at low adsorbent dosage and to reduce time consumption with maximum cr concentration as well as to develop a statistical mathematical model equation 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent preparation the collection of eichhornia crassipes plant is very easy due to presence in all local ponds here it was collected from a local pond in golapbag campus of burdwan university burdwan west bengal india after collection of raw materials the shoots of e crassipes were smoothly separated and extensively washed with tap water to remove all soil dust and earthy materials secondly the washed shoot was further washed several times with distilled water finally shoots were sliced in pieces manually and sun dried for 3 4 days and next oven dried at 80 c the dried shoots were burned in the muffle chamber at 500 c and stored in air tight containers for further use as biosorbent 2 2 characterization of prepared biosorbent bsec were characterized by phzpc ftir and sem analysis which are shown consequently in figs 1 and 2 respectively ftir spectroscopy is a very useful tool for investigating the band positions and absorption peaks ftir analysis was performed using perkin elmer ftir ftir spectrum rx1 the ftir spectrums of bsec for before and after treated are shown in fig 1 the absorption band observed at 613 873 1034 and 1442 cm 1 are attributed to the c br c h c n and o h stretching vibrations respectively scanning electron microscopy sem analysis is a useful tool for the study of the surface morphology of an adsorbent the sem micrographs 25 kv 50 mm at 1000 magnifications for bsec surface before and after cr adsorption at the optimization conditions are shown in fig 2 fig 2 clearly shows the presence of porous rough and irregular surface morphology of the unloaded bsec the surface roughness of an unloaded adsorbent indicated the availability of a very large surface area of bsec meant for high adsorption capacity in the adsorption process kamsonlian et al 2012 it is remarkable that after adsorption the adsorbent surface seemed to have decreased porosity due to the heavy impregnation of cr onto the surface of the bsec fig 2 2 3 batch adsorption procedure the effect of different parameters i e ph contact time initial cr concentration dose of biosorbent and temperature on adsorption of cr was studied in batch mode kumar et al 2019 at first the required volumes of dye solution are taken into 250 ml beaker separately the ph of the solution was adjusted by adding drop wise dilute hcl or naoh solution the required amount of biosorbent dose was added into the dye solution and taken under magnetic stirrer for continuous stirring up to equilibrium level after completion of predetermined periods 5 ml of stirring solution was taken into a centrifuged test tube to centrifuge 4000 rpm 15 min the reaction mixture solution the absorbance at 497 nm wave length by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer perkin elmer λ35 and calculation of the dye concentration from the calibration curve were made adsorption experiments curve were conducted by varying initial concentration of the dye ph contact time biosorbent dose under the aspect of adsorption kinetics the amount of dye adsorption by bsec powder at time t qt mg g was calculated by the following mass balance relationship eq 1 1 q e c 0 c t m v the dye removal efficiency i e of adsorption was calculated as eq 2 2 a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c t c 0 100 where co is the initial dye concentration mg l ct is the concentration of the dye at any time t v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass g of biosorbent 2 4 response surface methodology rsm response surface methodology rsm was used to optimize the three parameters biosorbent dose initial concentration of cr and initial ph the three parameters were selected as independent variables while the removal percentage of cr being the output response variable other factors such as stirring rate temperature and contact time were held constant table s1 shows the ranges and level of independent variables central composite design ccd was chosen to investigate the combined effect of the three independent variables by 20 sets of experiments including six replications at the center points design expert version 7 0 3 stat ease inc 2009 usa was adopted to describe the response surface in order to check the accuracy of the fitted model a series of statistical analyses such as the normal plot the residual analysis the main and interaction effects the 3d surface plots and analysis of variance anova were examined 2 5 desorption experiment the adsorbed biosorbent was regenerated by desorption experiments which was conducted by either hcl or naoh as a desorbing agent the desorption were conducted by 0 08 mg of fresh adsorbent into 100 ml of 5 mg l cr solution at ph 9 0 and shaken for 12 h next before and after desorption the cr concentration was determined spectrophotometrically the desorption efficiency eq 3 of cr was calculated as the ratio of the desorbed amount qde to the adsorbed amount qad 3 d e s o r p t i o n q d e q a d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch adsorption study 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration to get the optimum adsorption conditions the effect of cr concentration on removal of cr was studied in the concentration range of 4 10 mg l initially at ph 7 0 when increasing the initial dye concentration from 4 to 10 mg l the uptake capacity of cr removal increases from 2 435 to 4 75 mg g fig s2 this may be attributed to increasing concentration gradient acting as an increasing driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistances of the dye molecules between the aqueous and solid phase leading to an increasing equilibrium sorption until saturation is achieved wanyonyi et al 2014 the maximum removal percentage was obtained at lower initial concentration and smaller at higher initial concentration the ratio of amount of cr available and the number of adsorption dyes was low at lower concentration hence comparatively a higher percentage of adsorption resulted at higher concentrations this ratio progressively increased due to number of adsorption sites becoming fewer compared to the amount of cr available therefore it was shown that a decreasing trend in percentage of adsorption from a lower concentration to a higher concentration okeola and odebunmi 2010 mondal 2009 3 1 2 effect of adsorbents dose bsec is one of the important parameters that have been consider to determine the optimum value the effect of adsorbent dose on cr adsorption is shown in fig s3 it determines the adsorption capacity of cr the removal of cr was studied at different doses 0 3 1 0 gm l by keeping the contact time 20 min ph 9 concentration 5 mg l the removal process was increased from 61 93 to 93 87 when bsec dose was increased from 0 03 to 0 10 for 100 ml solution fig s3 it is perhaps due to the fact that the number of available active sites and surface area increased by increasing the adsorbent dose above the dose of 0 08 gm 100 ml there was no remarkable change in percentage of removal of cr dye it might be due to overlapping of active sites on biosorbents at the same time the adsorbed cr amount at equilibrium qe mg g decreased with increasing adsorbent dosage because of the split in the flux or the solute concentration gradient between the solution and the adsorbent surface so that the amount of cr adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent is reduced with increasing adsorbent dosage kumar et al 2010 vadivelan and kumar 2005 3 1 3 effect of ph the effect of ph is recognized as an important parameter that dominates the adsorption process at solid liquid interfaces the maximum removal efficiency of cr adsorption from waste water 97 84 was obtained at the ph of 9 0 and all further experiments were carried out at ph 9 0 so the ph of the reaction solution is one of the strongly dependent process parameter the adsorbent behaves as neutral at ph zero charge at ph phzpc the adsorption of cation is favored while the adsorption of anion is favored at ph phzpc mondal 2009 the point of zero charge of this biosorbent is 9 84 fig s1 so below the zero point charge at ph phzpc adsorption capacity of anionic dyes mainly sulfonated dyes such as congo red reaches a maximum value the cr adsorption rates increased with increasing ph up to 9 and further increase in ph dye removal efficiency decreases which is shown in fig s4 therefore the best ph of the treated solution should be limited to this value when using bsec because the electrostatic interaction among the anionic dye and positive surface of adsorbent is enhanced daneshvar et al 2007 khodja et al 2001 the anionic dyes were converted into neutral species by the protonation of dye at very low ph range which are less interacted with cationic biosorbent than the interaction between dye and cationic biosorbent at ph above the phzpc the number of negatively charged sites on the biosorbent surface increased so an electrostatic interaction is not favored due to the repulsion between negatively charged surface site of biosobent and anionic dye cr however a significant removal percentage on bsec was observed at alkaline ph range 8 9 similar studies were previously reported for biosorption of cr from aqueous solution onto different biosorbents hu et al 2010 3 1 4 effect of contact time the uptake capacity of cr dye by bsec dose was very fast and 97 removal was sorbed within 10 min and equilibrium was established after 40 min from fig s6 it is clear that the sorption was fast initially and become slow at later stages till the equilibrium was attained the fast removal rate at the initial stage may be explained by the abundant availability of active sites on the catalyst surface das et al 2013 saqib et al 2013 however with a lapse of time the remaining unsaturated sites cannot be occupied because of repulsive force between the solute cr on the solid and bulk phases roy et al 2013 sokker et al 2011 similar results have been previously reported in the literature for other dye removal also chanzu et al 2012 3 1 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the removal of cr by bsec at different temperatures from 25 c to 90 c was shown in fig s5 when the temperature was increased from 25 c to 90 c the percent removal of cr was decreased from 97 84 to 96 96 these results shows that the adsorption of cr onto bsec is an exothermic process and the physical bonding between the dye molecules and the active sites of the e crassipes weaken with increasing temperature similar results were observed by hu et al 2010 who investigated the effect of temperature on removal of cr from aqueous solution by cattail shoot and indicated that adsorption decreases with increasing temperature and another explanation for adsorption might be attributed to the fact that at high temperature solutes move with greater speed therefore less time of interaction along with the adsorbent active sites was available for them kanwal et al 2012 samani et al 2010 3 2 interaction of variables interaction effects of variables on the biosorption y of the validated model were shown in equation 4 the interaction parameters are demonstrated by x1x2 x1x3 and x2x3 which presented in table s1 the parameters were related by coefficients and the signs in the model the coefficients indicate the specific weight of the parameters in the model while the signs and affect the synergistic and antagonistic effects of variables on the response y the coefficients indicated the weight of variables in the model which determine the importance roles of the parameters in the biosorption as the coefficients illustrated the important of the interactions are x1x3 x1x2 x2x3 the synergistic effect in the model translates to an improvement in the biosorption while the antagonistic effects were recessive as observed the interactions x1x3 had synergistic effect while x1x2 and x2x3 were antagonistic effect in order to study the interaction among the different independent range of the variables in table s1 and their corresponding effect on the response 3d surface plots were drawn fig 3 this analysis gives a better understanding of the influence of variables and their interaction on the response as a function of two variables at a time the interaction between dye molecule and biosorbent is basically a combined result of charges on dye molecules and the surface of the adsorbent are shown in 3d plots maurya et al 2006 fig 3 depicts the interaction effect of dose and ph on the removal process within the experimental range the response function i e the removal increases with increasing dose the percentage removal increases with increase in both the ph as well as biosorbent dose up to the optimum value and decreases thereafter such behavior can be explained in the sense that all biosorbents have a limited number of active sites which become saturated at a certain concentration das et al 2013 chowdhury et al 2013 the effect of initial ph of the cr solution on its adsorption on bsec is depicted in fig 3 the maximum removal was observed up to 97 84 at ph 9 0 with further increase in ph there is decrease the removal of the dye the maximum adsorption was observed at ph 9 0 this ph effect can be explained by the different interaction between cr and shoots of e crassipes in terms of surface charge degree of ionization and speciation in the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged adsorption site and the anionic cr molecule results in high adsorption of cr dye identically the qe values were found to decrease in highly alkaline ph range of above 10 similar results were reported by earlier researchers vijayaraghavan et al 2004 additionally the adsorption of cr dye shows a fast rate of adsorption during the first 10 min of the dye sorbent contact the fast adsorption rate is due to the large amount of surface area available for adsorption of the dye molecules at higher contact time the rate of adsorption decreases gradually leading to equilibrium chakraborty et al 2011 this decline is due to decrease in total adsorbent surface area and less available binding sites saha et al 2010 from a review of the available literature it is found that only a few works on burned shoot of e crassipes have been reported otherwise most of the studies for cr removal have been conducted by simple biosorbents the higher equilibrium uptake capacity of cr makes the adsorbent attractive for use as cr removal filter units therefore the cr uptake capacity on bsec is compared with previously reported other adsorbents table 4 the results show the applicability of bsec for the removal of cr from aqueous solutions using a significance study 3 3 equilibrium isotherms the relationship between the adsorbate concentration in the liquid phase and that on the adsorbents surface under a given condition are shown in isotherm study a number of isotherms have been developed to describe equilibrium relationships in the present study the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r models were used to describe the equilibrium isotherms the illustration of the equilibrium adsorption plots and the summarized isotherm models are shown in figs s7 s8 s9 s10 and table 1 from table 1 it is observed that the langmuir isotherm showed good fit to the experimental equilibrium adsorption data than the freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm equation for cr adsorption according to the values of r2 which confirms the monolayer coverage of cr onto bsec zhou et al 2018 it is also seen from table 1 that the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity qmax mg g is 5 18 and the equilibrium constant kl l mg is 10 72 the separation factor rl values are 0 022 0 018 0 015 0 011 and 0 009 while initial cr concentrations are 4 5 6 8 and 10 mg l respectively all the rl values were found to be less than one and greater than zero indicating the favorable adsorption of cr by bsec the freundlich constant kf and n are constants incorporating the factors affecting the adsorption capacity and intensity of adsorption respectively and the value of kf is 4 46 mg g l mg 1 n furthermore the value of n at equilibrium is 3 9 that value of n lies in between 1 and 10 also represents a favorable adsorption from temkin constant bt related to adsorption binding energy for cr is found 3 945 kj mol in addition d r isotherm shows the value of the adsorption energy e is very high 6 009 kj mol the estimated value of e 8 kj mol has been indicated toward the physisorption process from table 1 it can be concluded that the obtained values of mean free energy e is 6 kj mol so it can thus be concluded that this physisorption process will play a dominating role in the process of cr dye adsorption onto bsec dada et al 2012 samarghandi et al 2009 3 4 adsorption kinetics the investigation of the rate of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models of biosorption of cr on bsec biomass are shown in figs s11 and s12 the linearized form of biosorption kinetics guo et al 2002 and their constants are presented in table 2 the plot of t q versus t shows a linear relationship which confirmed that the biosorption of cr on bsec biomass followed the pseudo second order reaction and is shown in fig s12 the values of qs and k2 can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot it is clear that the pseudo second order kinetic model showed excellent linearity with high correlation coefficient r2 1 0 at all the studied concentrations in comparison to the first order kinetic model table 2 this excellent fitting of the experimental result exhibited that the chemisorption was involved in the dye adsorption process through sharing or exchange of electrons between dye molecules and bsec ho 2006 3 5 thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic parameters can be determined from the thermodynamic equilibrium constant k0 where k0 is the ratio of adsorption capacity mg g and concentration at equilibrium state the thermodynamic parameters δg δh and δs of the adsorption of cr on bsec were calculated using equations and δg rt ln k0 where r is the ideal gas constant t is the temperature k and k0 is the distribution coefficient calculated from the experiment fig s13 from table 3 free energy change clearly indicate that congo red adsorption is favorable at higher temperature the negative values of δg indicate the spontaneous nature of adsorption with a high preference of congo red onto bsec abd ei latif et al 2010 the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the van t hoff plots listed in table 3 the negative values of free energy δ g indicate the feasibility of the process and its spontaneous nature table 3 the negative values of δ h for all the systems confirm the exothermic nature of process the positive value of δs observed for the removal of cr molecule suggested increased the randomness during the process and the driving force for cr adsorption onto bsec is controlled by an entropy effect hou et al 2012 the thermodynamic values of parameters for the cr reported in the present study are in good agreement with literature vijayakumar et al 2012 achmad et al 2012 3 6 model fitting and statistically analysis the present work focused on biosorption of cr by varying amount of conducting biosorbent bsec an empirical relationship expressed by a second order polynomial equation with interaction terms was fitted between the experimental results obtained on the basis of central composite design model ccd and the input variables the final equation obtained in terms of actual natural factors is given below cr decolourization eq 4 4 y 28 396 2 4001 x 1 19 47 x 2 1437 52 x 3 0 2298 x 1 2 1 249 x 2 2 8454 x 3 2 0 0125 x 1 x 2 37 74 x 1 x 3 2 738 x 2 x 3 where x1 x2 and x3 are defined in table s1 in order to ensure a good regression model the analysis of variance anova was applied and the results are shown in table 5 the model f value of 65 30 implied in the model was significant there was only a 0 01 chance that a model f value this large could occur due to noise p value of prob f 0 0001 less than 0 05 indicated model terms were significant the non significant lack of fit value 1 91 more than 0 01 0 05 showed that the quadratic model was valid for the study 3 7 anova analysis the anova results table 5 of the quadratic model by ccd suggest that the model was highly significant as it is evident from the fisher s f value 65 33 with a low probability value p 0 0001 the predicted correlation coefficient pred r2 0 910 also shows good agreement with the adjusted correlation coefficient adj r2 0 968 these models can be evaluated on the basis of scores obtained from the sequential model sum of squares table s2 and it showed that the quadratic model had a high score the larger magnitude of f 65 33 and smaller value of p 0 0001 indicated the high significance of the model and hence the quadratic model was found to be good and selected to continue the progress the adequacy and significance of the selected model can be further evaluated using the analysis of variance anova the evidences were fisher variation ratio f value probability value p value lack of fit coefficient of determination r squared r2 d adjusted r squared r2 adj predicted r squared r2 pred and adequate precision table s3 adequate precision is a signal to noise ratio which compares the range of the predicted values at the design points to the average prediction error the ratios greater than 4 indicate adequate model discrimination r2 adj and the r2 pred are measurements of the amount of variation around the mean and newly explained data respectively the p value represents the degree of significance of each variable while f value is a statistically valid measure of how well the factors describe the variation in the data about its mean the selected quadratic model was validated by anova which provided evidences such as high f value 65 33 very low p value 0 0001 non significant lack of fit 1 91 as well as high values for coefficient of r squared r2 d 0 9833 adjusted r squared r2 adj 0 9682 predicted r squared r2 pred 0 9103 and the adequate precision 24 408 moreover fig 3 shows the actual values versus predicted values of the cr adsorption onto bsec which indicates an excellent agreement between the actual and predicted values as observed the validity significance and adequacy of the model was confirmed by the reasonable evidence 3 8 desorption studies from the desorption study it was found that with increase in concentration of naoh solutions the desorption increased and more than 85 of cr were desorbed from bsec using 6 0 m naoh solution fig 4 the above exhausted adsorbent was regenerated and reused up to 3 cycles with 74 efficiency at higher concentration of naoh negative hydroxyl oh ion concentrations will increase at the vicinity of adsorbents this will help to desorption congo red from the surface of the adsorbent through ion exchange mechanism de farias et al 2018 almost similar results were reported by sadhukhan et al 2014 for removal of methylene blue by lemna major 4 conclusions in this work bsec was introduced for the adsorptive removal of cr from dye containing water removal was conducted by eichhornia crassipes plant biomass which can be a promising biosorbent for the removal of anionic cr dye from water and to investigate the combined effect of various process parameters on cr removal using response surface methodology according to the anova analysis cr dye removal is highly affected by biomass dose ph and most interacting effect were observed between ph with the other factors biomass dose initial concentration and contact time the hierarchical quadratic model represents adequately the response surface space based on the adjusted determination coefficient r2 adj 0 968 and the adequate precision ratio 24 408 by using this model at the optimal conditions ph 9 0 0 8 gm l of biomass 40 min contact time and 5 mg l of cr concentration the predicted removal efficiency was achieved nearby 98 of cr from aqueous solutions using bsec biomass finally it can be suggested that the burn shoot of eichhornia

12249,this study investigated the affinity of adsorption of congo red cr dye on burned shoot of eichhornia crassipes bsec biomass and the effects of this dye on bsec the removal of cr from aqueous solution was conducted by a series of batch experiments and the optimum conditions were screen out through optimization study the experimental data were nicely fitted with quadratic model for central

crassipes biomass has immense potentiality towards removal of dye from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption congo red e crassipes biomass central composite design regeneration 1 introduction the disposal of huge volume of untreated waste water generated from different industries such as textile paper printing food cosmetic paints pigments plastics and leather tanning industries into different water bodies poses a dangerous problem for living organism systems shim et al 2019 kumari et al 2018 chowdhury and saha 2010 the release of industrial effluents containing dyes into the natural water bodies can pose hazardous effects on the living systems because of carcinogenic mutagenic allergenic and toxic nature of dyes akar and özcan 2009 dyes impede light penetration retard photosynthetic activity inhibit the growth of biota and also have a tendency to chelate metal ions which result in micro toxicity to fish and other organisms malik et al 2007 the decomposed product of dyes can pose different effects on humans and animals under aerobic conditions akar and özcan 2009 kiran et al 2009 congo red is a highly colored synthetic azo dye the main cause of an allergic reaction has been known to be the effect of this dye on living body the degradation of dye is the carcinogenic products that act as an eye skin and gastrointestinal irritant it induces respiratory and drowsiness problems which ultimately impresses blood factors allen and koumanova 2005 demirbas 2009 so it has been recognized that the high toxicity nature of congo red in waste water has a serious community health problem in the environment however still this dye is used in many manufacturing industries like dye textile paper and plastics industries for coloring their products alam et al 2015 in recent years dyes contaminated waste water treatment drew great attention over the different techniques such as membrane filtration coagulation precipitation ion exchange lime softening advanced oxidation process roy and mondal 2014 and adsorption shim et al 2019 roy and mondal 2015 most of these techniques have inherent limitation owing to need for expensive chemicals and the generation of newer toxic derivatives as a result of the processes so research on innovative methods and development of such methods is a continuous process for treatment of waste water this method is suitable for adsorption technology due to simplicity and low cost das et al 2013 roy et al 2013 at present it was observed that different types of biosorbents are already being used for removal of pollutants such as granular activated carbon different fruit peels etc the most important dye adsorbent is granular activated carbon deshpande et al 2017 activated carbon adsorption method is a method applied earlier and this method is very effective for the removal of dissolved organic matter many other materials like burmese grape leaf extract borah et al 2018 banana peel mondal and kar 2018 tree fern ho et al 2005 orange peel arami et al 2005 date pits fawzi et al 2003 peanut hulls gong et al 2005 giant duck weed waranusantigul et al 2003 teak tree bark powder patil et al 2011 corn cobs and barley husk chandran et al 2002 rice husk and saw dust malik 2003 agave americana l fibres ben hamissa et al 2007 have been tested for their dye adsorption capacity but finding the highly effective adsorbent with considering the costing effect for adsorption of cr from aqueous solution through a cost effective method is very difficult so the search for an appropriate and inexpensive biomass is a continuing process in the present study eichhornia crassipes is used as an important biosorbent which is found widely in india interferes with navigation recreation irrigation and power generation for the formation of dense mats for vegetative reproduction and extremely high growth rate of e crassipes mall et al 2005 martina et al 2004 most of the researchers feel interested due to easy availability on a large scale and high growth rate throughout the year all over the world so this biomass can also be utilized to remove cr from aqueous solutions which form the motivation of this study a few studies on e crassipes as an adsorbent have already been conducted wanyonyi et al 2014 soni et al 2012 but no research has been reported on use of the burned shoot of e crassipes bsec that may have higher cr removal efficiency the main aim of this investigation is to improve the adsorption capacity of bsec for the removal of cr from aqueous solutions the determination of the solute solvent interaction rate and order of the adsorption process adsorption isotherm and various kinetic models were used a central composite design ccd in response surface methodology rsm by design expert version 7 0 3 stat ease inc 2009 usa is used to optimize the process parameters for the biosorption process the individuals as well as the combined effect of different variables influencing the adsorption process was investigated by this model to identify optimum conditions where high uptake capacity is generated for the removal of cr using bsec biomass to ensure high removal efficiency at low adsorbent dosage and to reduce time consumption with maximum cr concentration as well as to develop a statistical mathematical model equation 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent preparation the collection of eichhornia crassipes plant is very easy due to presence in all local ponds here it was collected from a local pond in golapbag campus of burdwan university burdwan west bengal india after collection of raw materials the shoots of e crassipes were smoothly separated and extensively washed with tap water to remove all soil dust and earthy materials secondly the washed shoot was further washed several times with distilled water finally shoots were sliced in pieces manually and sun dried for 3 4 days and next oven dried at 80 c the dried shoots were burned in the muffle chamber at 500 c and stored in air tight containers for further use as biosorbent 2 2 characterization of prepared biosorbent bsec were characterized by phzpc ftir and sem analysis which are shown consequently in figs 1 and 2 respectively ftir spectroscopy is a very useful tool for investigating the band positions and absorption peaks ftir analysis was performed using perkin elmer ftir ftir spectrum rx1 the ftir spectrums of bsec for before and after treated are shown in fig 1 the absorption band observed at 613 873 1034 and 1442 cm 1 are attributed to the c br c h c n and o h stretching vibrations respectively scanning electron microscopy sem analysis is a useful tool for the study of the surface morphology of an adsorbent the sem micrographs 25 kv 50 mm at 1000 magnifications for bsec surface before and after cr adsorption at the optimization conditions are shown in fig 2 fig 2 clearly shows the presence of porous rough and irregular surface morphology of the unloaded bsec the surface roughness of an unloaded adsorbent indicated the availability of a very large surface area of bsec meant for high adsorption capacity in the adsorption process kamsonlian et al 2012 it is remarkable that after adsorption the adsorbent surface seemed to have decreased porosity due to the heavy impregnation of cr onto the surface of the bsec fig 2 2 3 batch adsorption procedure the effect of different parameters i e ph contact time initial cr concentration dose of biosorbent and temperature on adsorption of cr was studied in batch mode kumar et al 2019 at first the required volumes of dye solution are taken into 250 ml beaker separately the ph of the solution was adjusted by adding drop wise dilute hcl or naoh solution the required amount of biosorbent dose was added into the dye solution and taken under magnetic stirrer for continuous stirring up to equilibrium level after completion of predetermined periods 5 ml of stirring solution was taken into a centrifuged test tube to centrifuge 4000 rpm 15 min the reaction mixture solution the absorbance at 497 nm wave length by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer perkin elmer λ35 and calculation of the dye concentration from the calibration curve were made adsorption experiments curve were conducted by varying initial concentration of the dye ph contact time biosorbent dose under the aspect of adsorption kinetics the amount of dye adsorption by bsec powder at time t qt mg g was calculated by the following mass balance relationship eq 1 1 q e c 0 c t m v the dye removal efficiency i e of adsorption was calculated as eq 2 2 a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c t c 0 100 where co is the initial dye concentration mg l ct is the concentration of the dye at any time t v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass g of biosorbent 2 4 response surface methodology rsm response surface methodology rsm was used to optimize the three parameters biosorbent dose initial concentration of cr and initial ph the three parameters were selected as independent variables while the removal percentage of cr being the output response variable other factors such as stirring rate temperature and contact time were held constant table s1 shows the ranges and level of independent variables central composite design ccd was chosen to investigate the combined effect of the three independent variables by 20 sets of experiments including six replications at the center points design expert version 7 0 3 stat ease inc 2009 usa was adopted to describe the response surface in order to check the accuracy of the fitted model a series of statistical analyses such as the normal plot the residual analysis the main and interaction effects the 3d surface plots and analysis of variance anova were examined 2 5 desorption experiment the adsorbed biosorbent was regenerated by desorption experiments which was conducted by either hcl or naoh as a desorbing agent the desorption were conducted by 0 08 mg of fresh adsorbent into 100 ml of 5 mg l cr solution at ph 9 0 and shaken for 12 h next before and after desorption the cr concentration was determined spectrophotometrically the desorption efficiency eq 3 of cr was calculated as the ratio of the desorbed amount qde to the adsorbed amount qad 3 d e s o r p t i o n q d e q a d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch adsorption study 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration to get the optimum adsorption conditions the effect of cr concentration on removal of cr was studied in the concentration range of 4 10 mg l initially at ph 7 0 when increasing the initial dye concentration from 4 to 10 mg l the uptake capacity of cr removal increases from 2 435 to 4 75 mg g fig s2 this may be attributed to increasing concentration gradient acting as an increasing driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistances of the dye molecules between the aqueous and solid phase leading to an increasing equilibrium sorption until saturation is achieved wanyonyi et al 2014 the maximum removal percentage was obtained at lower initial concentration and smaller at higher initial concentration the ratio of amount of cr available and the number of adsorption dyes was low at lower concentration hence comparatively a higher percentage of adsorption resulted at higher concentrations this ratio progressively increased due to number of adsorption sites becoming fewer compared to the amount of cr available therefore it was shown that a decreasing trend in percentage of adsorption from a lower concentration to a higher concentration okeola and odebunmi 2010 mondal 2009 3 1 2 effect of adsorbents dose bsec is one of the important parameters that have been consider to determine the optimum value the effect of adsorbent dose on cr adsorption is shown in fig s3 it determines the adsorption capacity of cr the removal of cr was studied at different doses 0 3 1 0 gm l by keeping the contact time 20 min ph 9 concentration 5 mg l the removal process was increased from 61 93 to 93 87 when bsec dose was increased from 0 03 to 0 10 for 100 ml solution fig s3 it is perhaps due to the fact that the number of available active sites and surface area increased by increasing the adsorbent dose above the dose of 0 08 gm 100 ml there was no remarkable change in percentage of removal of cr dye it might be due to overlapping of active sites on biosorbents at the same time the adsorbed cr amount at equilibrium qe mg g decreased with increasing adsorbent dosage because of the split in the flux or the solute concentration gradient between the solution and the adsorbent surface so that the amount of cr adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent is reduced with increasing adsorbent dosage kumar et al 2010 vadivelan and kumar 2005 3 1 3 effect of ph the effect of ph is recognized as an important parameter that dominates the adsorption process at solid liquid interfaces the maximum removal efficiency of cr adsorption from waste water 97 84 was obtained at the ph of 9 0 and all further experiments were carried out at ph 9 0 so the ph of the reaction solution is one of the strongly dependent process parameter the adsorbent behaves as neutral at ph zero charge at ph phzpc the adsorption of cation is favored while the adsorption of anion is favored at ph phzpc mondal 2009 the point of zero charge of this biosorbent is 9 84 fig s1 so below the zero point charge at ph phzpc adsorption capacity of anionic dyes mainly sulfonated dyes such as congo red reaches a maximum value the cr adsorption rates increased with increasing ph up to 9 and further increase in ph dye removal efficiency decreases which is shown in fig s4 therefore the best ph of the treated solution should be limited to this value when using bsec because the electrostatic interaction among the anionic dye and positive surface of adsorbent is enhanced daneshvar et al 2007 khodja et al 2001 the anionic dyes were converted into neutral species by the protonation of dye at very low ph range which are less interacted with cationic biosorbent than the interaction between dye and cationic biosorbent at ph above the phzpc the number of negatively charged sites on the biosorbent surface increased so an electrostatic interaction is not favored due to the repulsion between negatively charged surface site of biosobent and anionic dye cr however a significant removal percentage on bsec was observed at alkaline ph range 8 9 similar studies were previously reported for biosorption of cr from aqueous solution onto different biosorbents hu et al 2010 3 1 4 effect of contact time the uptake capacity of cr dye by bsec dose was very fast and 97 removal was sorbed within 10 min and equilibrium was established after 40 min from fig s6 it is clear that the sorption was fast initially and become slow at later stages till the equilibrium was attained the fast removal rate at the initial stage may be explained by the abundant availability of active sites on the catalyst surface das et al 2013 saqib et al 2013 however with a lapse of time the remaining unsaturated sites cannot be occupied because of repulsive force between the solute cr on the solid and bulk phases roy et al 2013 sokker et al 2011 similar results have been previously reported in the literature for other dye removal also chanzu et al 2012 3 1 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the removal of cr by bsec at different temperatures from 25 c to 90 c was shown in fig s5 when the temperature was increased from 25 c to 90 c the percent removal of cr was decreased from 97 84 to 96 96 these results shows that the adsorption of cr onto bsec is an exothermic process and the physical bonding between the dye molecules and the active sites of the e crassipes weaken with increasing temperature similar results were observed by hu et al 2010 who investigated the effect of temperature on removal of cr from aqueous solution by cattail shoot and indicated that adsorption decreases with increasing temperature and another explanation for adsorption might be attributed to the fact that at high temperature solutes move with greater speed therefore less time of interaction along with the adsorbent active sites was available for them kanwal et al 2012 samani et al 2010 3 2 interaction of variables interaction effects of variables on the biosorption y of the validated model were shown in equation 4 the interaction parameters are demonstrated by x1x2 x1x3 and x2x3 which presented in table s1 the parameters were related by coefficients and the signs in the model the coefficients indicate the specific weight of the parameters in the model while the signs and affect the synergistic and antagonistic effects of variables on the response y the coefficients indicated the weight of variables in the model which determine the importance roles of the parameters in the biosorption as the coefficients illustrated the important of the interactions are x1x3 x1x2 x2x3 the synergistic effect in the model translates to an improvement in the biosorption while the antagonistic effects were recessive as observed the interactions x1x3 had synergistic effect while x1x2 and x2x3 were antagonistic effect in order to study the interaction among the different independent range of the variables in table s1 and their corresponding effect on the response 3d surface plots were drawn fig 3 this analysis gives a better understanding of the influence of variables and their interaction on the response as a function of two variables at a time the interaction between dye molecule and biosorbent is basically a combined result of charges on dye molecules and the surface of the adsorbent are shown in 3d plots maurya et al 2006 fig 3 depicts the interaction effect of dose and ph on the removal process within the experimental range the response function i e the removal increases with increasing dose the percentage removal increases with increase in both the ph as well as biosorbent dose up to the optimum value and decreases thereafter such behavior can be explained in the sense that all biosorbents have a limited number of active sites which become saturated at a certain concentration das et al 2013 chowdhury et al 2013 the effect of initial ph of the cr solution on its adsorption on bsec is depicted in fig 3 the maximum removal was observed up to 97 84 at ph 9 0 with further increase in ph there is decrease the removal of the dye the maximum adsorption was observed at ph 9 0 this ph effect can be explained by the different interaction between cr and shoots of e crassipes in terms of surface charge degree of ionization and speciation in the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged adsorption site and the anionic cr molecule results in high adsorption of cr dye identically the qe values were found to decrease in highly alkaline ph range of above 10 similar results were reported by earlier researchers vijayaraghavan et al 2004 additionally the adsorption of cr dye shows a fast rate of adsorption during the first 10 min of the dye sorbent contact the fast adsorption rate is due to the large amount of surface area available for adsorption of the dye molecules at higher contact time the rate of adsorption decreases gradually leading to equilibrium chakraborty et al 2011 this decline is due to decrease in total adsorbent surface area and less available binding sites saha et al 2010 from a review of the available literature it is found that only a few works on burned shoot of e crassipes have been reported otherwise most of the studies for cr removal have been conducted by simple biosorbents the higher equilibrium uptake capacity of cr makes the adsorbent attractive for use as cr removal filter units therefore the cr uptake capacity on bsec is compared with previously reported other adsorbents table 4 the results show the applicability of bsec for the removal of cr from aqueous solutions using a significance study 3 3 equilibrium isotherms the relationship between the adsorbate concentration in the liquid phase and that on the adsorbents surface under a given condition are shown in isotherm study a number of isotherms have been developed to describe equilibrium relationships in the present study the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r models were used to describe the equilibrium isotherms the illustration of the equilibrium adsorption plots and the summarized isotherm models are shown in figs s7 s8 s9 s10 and table 1 from table 1 it is observed that the langmuir isotherm showed good fit to the experimental equilibrium adsorption data than the freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm equation for cr adsorption according to the values of r2 which confirms the monolayer coverage of cr onto bsec zhou et al 2018 it is also seen from table 1 that the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity qmax mg g is 5 18 and the equilibrium constant kl l mg is 10 72 the separation factor rl values are 0 022 0 018 0 015 0 011 and 0 009 while initial cr concentrations are 4 5 6 8 and 10 mg l respectively all the rl values were found to be less than one and greater than zero indicating the favorable adsorption of cr by bsec the freundlich constant kf and n are constants incorporating the factors affecting the adsorption capacity and intensity of adsorption respectively and the value of kf is 4 46 mg g l mg 1 n furthermore the value of n at equilibrium is 3 9 that value of n lies in between 1 and 10 also represents a favorable adsorption from temkin constant bt related to adsorption binding energy for cr is found 3 945 kj mol in addition d r isotherm shows the value of the adsorption energy e is very high 6 009 kj mol the estimated value of e 8 kj mol has been indicated toward the physisorption process from table 1 it can be concluded that the obtained values of mean free energy e is 6 kj mol so it can thus be concluded that this physisorption process will play a dominating role in the process of cr dye adsorption onto bsec dada et al 2012 samarghandi et al 2009 3 4 adsorption kinetics the investigation of the rate of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models of biosorption of cr on bsec biomass are shown in figs s11 and s12 the linearized form of biosorption kinetics guo et al 2002 and their constants are presented in table 2 the plot of t q versus t shows a linear relationship which confirmed that the biosorption of cr on bsec biomass followed the pseudo second order reaction and is shown in fig s12 the values of qs and k2 can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot it is clear that the pseudo second order kinetic model showed excellent linearity with high correlation coefficient r2 1 0 at all the studied concentrations in comparison to the first order kinetic model table 2 this excellent fitting of the experimental result exhibited that the chemisorption was involved in the dye adsorption process through sharing or exchange of electrons between dye molecules and bsec ho 2006 3 5 thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic parameters can be determined from the thermodynamic equilibrium constant k0 where k0 is the ratio of adsorption capacity mg g and concentration at equilibrium state the thermodynamic parameters δg δh and δs of the adsorption of cr on bsec were calculated using equations and δg rt ln k0 where r is the ideal gas constant t is the temperature k and k0 is the distribution coefficient calculated from the experiment fig s13 from table 3 free energy change clearly indicate that congo red adsorption is favorable at higher temperature the negative values of δg indicate the spontaneous nature of adsorption with a high preference of congo red onto bsec abd ei latif et al 2010 the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the van t hoff plots listed in table 3 the negative values of free energy δ g indicate the feasibility of the process and its spontaneous nature table 3 the negative values of δ h for all the systems confirm the exothermic nature of process the positive value of δs observed for the removal of cr molecule suggested increased the randomness during the process and the driving force for cr adsorption onto bsec is controlled by an entropy effect hou et al 2012 the thermodynamic values of parameters for the cr reported in the present study are in good agreement with literature vijayakumar et al 2012 achmad et al 2012 3 6 model fitting and statistically analysis the present work focused on biosorption of cr by varying amount of conducting biosorbent bsec an empirical relationship expressed by a second order polynomial equation with interaction terms was fitted between the experimental results obtained on the basis of central composite design model ccd and the input variables the final equation obtained in terms of actual natural factors is given below cr decolourization eq 4 4 y 28 396 2 4001 x 1 19 47 x 2 1437 52 x 3 0 2298 x 1 2 1 249 x 2 2 8454 x 3 2 0 0125 x 1 x 2 37 74 x 1 x 3 2 738 x 2 x 3 where x1 x2 and x3 are defined in table s1 in order to ensure a good regression model the analysis of variance anova was applied and the results are shown in table 5 the model f value of 65 30 implied in the model was significant there was only a 0 01 chance that a model f value this large could occur due to noise p value of prob f 0 0001 less than 0 05 indicated model terms were significant the non significant lack of fit value 1 91 more than 0 01 0 05 showed that the quadratic model was valid for the study 3 7 anova analysis the anova results table 5 of the quadratic model by ccd suggest that the model was highly significant as it is evident from the fisher s f value 65 33 with a low probability value p 0 0001 the predicted correlation coefficient pred r2 0 910 also shows good agreement with the adjusted correlation coefficient adj r2 0 968 these models can be evaluated on the basis of scores obtained from the sequential model sum of squares table s2 and it showed that the quadratic model had a high score the larger magnitude of f 65 33 and smaller value of p 0 0001 indicated the high significance of the model and hence the quadratic model was found to be good and selected to continue the progress the adequacy and significance of the selected model can be further evaluated using the analysis of variance anova the evidences were fisher variation ratio f value probability value p value lack of fit coefficient of determination r squared r2 d adjusted r squared r2 adj predicted r squared r2 pred and adequate precision table s3 adequate precision is a signal to noise ratio which compares the range of the predicted values at the design points to the average prediction error the ratios greater than 4 indicate adequate model discrimination r2 adj and the r2 pred are measurements of the amount of variation around the mean and newly explained data respectively the p value represents the degree of significance of each variable while f value is a statistically valid measure of how well the factors describe the variation in the data about its mean the selected quadratic model was validated by anova which provided evidences such as high f value 65 33 very low p value 0 0001 non significant lack of fit 1 91 as well as high values for coefficient of r squared r2 d 0 9833 adjusted r squared r2 adj 0 9682 predicted r squared r2 pred 0 9103 and the adequate precision 24 408 moreover fig 3 shows the actual values versus predicted values of the cr adsorption onto bsec which indicates an excellent agreement between the actual and predicted values as observed the validity significance and adequacy of the model was confirmed by the reasonable evidence 3 8 desorption studies from the desorption study it was found that with increase in concentration of naoh solutions the desorption increased and more than 85 of cr were desorbed from bsec using 6 0 m naoh solution fig 4 the above exhausted adsorbent was regenerated and reused up to 3 cycles with 74 efficiency at higher concentration of naoh negative hydroxyl oh ion concentrations will increase at the vicinity of adsorbents this will help to desorption congo red from the surface of the adsorbent through ion exchange mechanism de farias et al 2018 almost similar results were reported by sadhukhan et al 2014 for removal of methylene blue by lemna major 4 conclusions in this work bsec was introduced for the adsorptive removal of cr from dye containing water removal was conducted by eichhornia crassipes plant biomass which can be a promising biosorbent for the removal of anionic cr dye from water and to investigate the combined effect of various process parameters on cr removal using response surface methodology according to the anova analysis cr dye removal is highly affected by biomass dose ph and most interacting effect were observed between ph with the other factors biomass dose initial concentration and contact time the hierarchical quadratic model represents adequately the response surface space based on the adjusted determination coefficient r2 adj 0 968 and the adequate precision ratio 24 408 by using this model at the optimal conditions ph 9 0 0 8 gm l of biomass 40 min contact time and 5 mg l of cr concentration the predicted removal efficiency was achieved nearby 98 of cr from aqueous solutions using bsec biomass finally it can be suggested that the burn shoot of eichhornia crassipes could be a novel low cost adsorbent for removal of dye from aqueous solution conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest to publish the present research
