7440,southwest china as one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world is a severely eroded region due to its special geological condition thus soil and water conservation measures such as dam construction have been extensively implemented in this region to control sediment delivery however it remains unclear how dam construction affects multiscale variability of sediment discharge sd and its potentially influential factors in southwest china to assess this annual sd water discharge wd precipitation pt potential evapotranspiration pet and normalized differential vegetation index ndvi data from 1955 to 2015 were obtained from two karst watersheds of liujiang no large dams and hongshui dam controlled these sites shared the similar climatic conditions the mann kendal test wilcoxon rank sum test and continuous wavelet transform analysis was used to detect the trends and periodicity in sd and wavelet coherence analysis were employed to detect the temporal covariance between sd and wd pt pet and ndvi results indicated that the multiscale variability of sd was strongly influenced by dam construction the annual sd showed significant 4 year periodic oscillation in the liujiang watershed while no significant cycles were found in the hongshui watershed dam construction exerted substantial influence on the multiscale correlations between sd and its associated factors the time scales that the ndvi resonated with sd were concentrated on the periodicity of 2 and 3 year in the liujiang watershed in contrast no significant periodicities were observed in the hongshu watershed this study yields a greater understanding of sd dynamics and is helpful for better watershed management in karst areas of southwest china keywords soil erosion dam periodicity wavelet coherence karst landscape ecohydrology 1 introduction karst landforms cover 7 12 of the earth s continental area ford and williams 2013 hartmann et al 2014 and are mainly distributed in three areas of the world the mediterranean coast the southwest china and northern vietnam and the indiana and kentucky of the united states cuba and jamaica dai et al 2017a with approximately 0 51 million km2 of exposed outcropped carbonate rock southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world li et al 2016 this region is characterized by shallow soils overlying highly irregular carbonate rocks e g limestone dolomite peng and wang 2012 the carbonate rocks are highly soluble and unable to produce much soil feng et al 2014 dai et al 2017b the low silicate mineral content in carbonate rock especially limestone is primarily responsible for the low rates of soil formation in karst areas jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017a previous studies have shown that to create 1 m of soil in karst areas it would take one to three quarters of a million years of dissolving 25 m of carbonate rock peng and wang 2012 the low soil formation rate implies that it would be extremely difficult to recover the soil layer in the karst region once it was lost jiang et al 2014 the sediment discharge of karst rivers generally reflects soil erosion rates in karst watersheds li et al 2016 therefore a reliable assessment of sediment discharge dynamics is crucial to developing strategic plans for the sustainable management of karst watersheds water discharge is considered a principal variable driving river eroded sediment and therefore has a significant effect on sediment discharge wang et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 the magnitude and timing of water and sediment discharge are greatly influenced by climatic variability and human activity zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2017 precipitation is a regulator of water discharge as well as soil erosion and sediment transport zhang et al 2008 miao et al 2011 potential evapotranspiration pet is closely related to water discharge and vegetation growth and therefore can strongly influence sediment discharge sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 vegetation cover is another important factor influencing the occurrence and intensity of soil erosion xu et al 2008 generally a vegetation index such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be applied to reflect the temporal dynamics of land cover ouyang et al 2010 a better understanding of sediment discharge and the potentially influential factors water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi is urgently needed as an aid for developing regional soil conservation policies for karst watersheds dam construction is an effective measure to reduce sediment discharge in rivers dai et al 2008 zhao et al 2017 in recent decades many dams have been constructed in many large rivers e g colorado river mekong river nile river red river yellow river and yangtze river resulting in a dramatic decrease in sediment discharge wang et al 2011 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 generally temporal variation in sediment discharge exhibits a powerful periodicity which can provide useful information to explore the potential causes of sediment discharge dynamics for example using wavelet transform method gao et al 2014 showed that sediment discharge in the yellow river followed 6 and 11 year periods before 1980 and the periods changed to 4 7 and 12 years after 1980 zhang et al 2009 found that the sediment discharge in the lower yangtze river showed significant periodic oscillation using the techniques of scanning t test f test and coherency analysis because dams cause a dramatic decrease in sediment discharge they have the potential to disrupt these periods or create new periods of sediment discharge unrelated to the natural hydrologic regime dams may also cause changes to multiscale correlations between sediment discharge and its associated factors water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi in general spectral analysis and temporal coherency can reveal multiscale correlation relationships between factors but are only applicable to stationary systems si and zeleke 2005 however hydrological variables and sediment discharge are nonstationary zhang et al 2014 wavelet analysis e g wavelet transform wavelet coherence however can process nonstationary data series and therefore provides an opportunity to evaluate the multiscale temporal variability of sediment discharge wavelet analysis also takes advantage of the wavelet coefficient which is related to a specific period of time and frequency simultaneously making it possible to trace the amplitude and phase of fluctuations of a specific wavelength through time labat 2005 adamowski et al 2013 a variety of hydrological studies have used wavelet analysis to analyze hydrological processes coulibaly and burn 2004 gan et al 2007 labat 2010 adamowski et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 charlier et al 2015 hao et al 2016 however few studies have dealt with identification of multiscale variability of sediment discharge using wavelet analysis especially in karst regions where soil erosion is more complicated than that in non karst regions due to the special geologic structure moreover information about the effects of dam construction on the period of sediment discharge is limited although required the objectives of this study were 1 to test whether the presence of large dams changes the multiscale temporal variability of sediment discharge in two paired watersheds which shared the similar climatic condition but different construction of dams and 2 to explore the effect of dams on multiscale temporal covariance between sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area included two typical karst watersheds the liujiang 24 8 26 28 n 107 24 110 33 e and hongshui 23 3 27 1 n 102 16 109 13 e watersheds in southwest china fig 1 the two watersheds are characterized by shallow soils overlaying a highly irregular epikarst surface these regions are prone to soil erosion due to their fragility both watersheds experience a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate straddling the tropic of cancer precipitation is highly variable throughout the year and more than 80 of the precipitation occurs during the wet season from april to october the liujiang watershed contains the liujiang river which is the second largest tributary of the xijiang river the liujiang river originates from gengding mountain gengding county guizhou province and runs for 773 km from south to north before entering the xijiang river the liujiang watershed has an altitude between 91 m and 2076 m with a total area of 4 54 104 km2 the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this watershed are 19 c and 1390 mm 1955 2015 respectively six meteorological stations and one hydrologic station liuzhou are located in this watershed fig 1 there is only one dam called the mashi dam which began operation in 1971 with a storage capacity of 0 3 km3 located in this watershed and no other large dams are constructed to reduce sediment discharge hongshui river spans a total length of 1553 km and drains an area of 12 89 104 km2 with a mean annual water and sediment discharge of 64 4 km3 and 3 5 107 t 1955 2015 respectively the hongshui river watershed is located in the upper reaches of the xijiang river the elevation in this watershed ranges from 74 m to 2866 m decreasing from west to east the multi year mean annual temperature within the watershed is 19 c and the watershed wide mean precipitation is 1190 mm 1955 2015 one hydrologic station qianjiang station and fifteen meteorological stations are located in this watershed fig 1 numerous dams have been constructed since the 1960 s in this watershed the three largest dams are the yantan dam yd began operation in 1992 the tianshengqiao dam td began operation in 1997 and the longtan dam ld began operation in 2006 which have a storage capacity of 3 4 10 8 and 27 3 km3 respectively the multiscale variability of sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors can be investigated in a dam controlled watershed hongshui and a watershed relatively unaffected by dams liujiang 2 2 data long term annual water and sediment discharge series 1955 2015 of the liuzhou and qianjiang hydrologic stations were acquired from hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china sediment discharge in this study refers to suspended sediment only precipitation data time series 1955 2015 was extracted from 21 meteorological stations within the liujiang and hongshui watersheds and was provided by the china meteorological administration cma the potential evapotranspiration pet at each meteorological station was estimated using the penman formula penman 1948 the precipitation and pet data were spatially averaged across the watersheds by the cokriging interpolation algorithm using arcgis 10 3 software to compute the watershed averaged precipitation and pet annual ndvi data 1982 2015 were derived from the global inventory modeling and monitoring study gimms ndvi3g data set 3 methodology in this study the mann kendall test m k method originally proposed by mann 1945 and later improved by kendall maurice 1975 was used to analyze the temporal trends of water and sediment discharge in the liujiang watershed the wilcoxon rank sum test was employed to test whether the presence of large dams greatly reduced the sediment discharge in the hongshui watershed the continuous wavelet transform cwt analysis was applied to detect the periodicity in sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors wavelet coherence was calculated to denote the periodicity correlation between sediment discharge and water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi 3 1 m k trend test the m k test is widely used by many researchers to examine the significance of monotonic trends in meteorological and hydrological time series because it is robust against non normally distributed data zhang and lu 2009 miao et al 2010 xu et al 2013 gao et al 2016 the null hypothesis h 0 is that there is no trend in the time series x x 1 x 2 x n h 0 can be rejected at the significance level of 0 05 if z 1 96 a positive value of z represents an upward trend and a negative value indicates a downward trend the m k test assumes that the series is independent therefore the trend free pre whitening method is applied to eliminate the auto correlation in the time series in current study the detailed information of the m k trend test can be found in previous papers zhao et al 2014 li et al 2016 3 2 wilcoxon rank sum test due to the first large dam was operated in 1992 the sediment discharge was divided into two periods the pre dam construction period from 1955 to 1992 and the post dam construction period from 1993 to 2015 in the hongshui watershed the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to detect the significant difference in sediment discharge between these two periods unlike t test applied to normal distribution the wilcoxon rank sum test can be used for unknown distributions suppose there are two sample series x and y of size m and n respectively under the null hypothesis h0 the x and y sample series come from the same underlying distribution and are then combined and ordered from the minimum to the maximum expressed as zi i 1 n m n the sum of ranks of the observations in sample x wx and y wy can be expressed as 1 w x w y n n 1 2 after that we defined w1 and w2 as follows 2 w 1 w x m m 1 2 w 2 w y n n 1 2 w 1 w 2 mn for large sample series n we consider a large sample approximation to the distribution of w under h0 the exact distribution of wx has a mean and a variance 3 e w x mn 2 m n 1 2 m n 1 2 4 var w x mn n 1 12 the wx was standardized and then the z statistic can be described as 5 z w x e w x var w x w x m n 1 2 mn n 1 12 n 0 1 hence the p value can be obtained from the z value the h0 is accepted if p 0 05 here a typical confidence level of 95 ie p 0 05 was used the detailed information of the wilcoxon rank sum test can be found in previous studies rosner et al 2003 hao et al 2016 3 3 continuous wavelet transform cwt wavelet analysis is a general tool for analyzing localized variation of power within a time series labat 2005 hao et al 2012 the cwt decomposes a time series over a time scale space and can identify the dominant modes of variability and how these modes vary in time coulibaly and burn 2004 charlier et al 2015 a wavelet function ψ t which can be defined as ψ t dt 0 is a special kind of the waveform that has a finite length and a zero mean value gan et al 2007 these features are suitable for analysis of nonstationary processes that contain multi scale features torrence and compo 1998 the cwt of a discrete time series xt t 0 t 1 is defined as the convolution of xt with a scaled and translated version of ψ 0 η 6 w t x s δ t s t 1 n x t ψ 0 t i δ t s where w is the wavelet coefficient s is the scale factor which determines the degree of compression or scale δ t is time step ψ 0 denotes the complex conjugate of ψ 0 in the current study we used the complex non orthogonal morlet wavelet as the mother function as it is fairly well localized in both time and frequency space coulibaly and burn 2004 adamowski et al 2013 wu et al 2015 hao et al 2016 the morlet wavelet function ψ 0 t is expressed as 7 ψ 0 t π 1 4 e i ω 0 t e 1 2 t 2 where t is the dimensionless time and ω 0 is the dimensionless frequency because the wavelet is not completely localized in time the cwt has an edge artifact problem torrence and compo 1998 thus a cone of influence coi is employed to solve the edge effect grinsted et al 2004 the coi is represented by the region outside of the concave up shaped area nalley et al 2016 that is the wavelet power w t x s 2 caused by a discontinuity at the edge has dropped to e 2 of the value at the edge grinsted et al 2004 hao et al 2016 3 4 wavelet coherence wtc analysis 3 4 1 cross wavelet transform xwt the covariance of two time series xt and yt w t xy s is estimated using a cross wavelet transform xwt and can be calculated using 8 w t xy s w t x s w t y s where w t x s refers to the wavelet transform of time series xt at frequency s and w t y denotes the complex conjugate of wavelet transform w t y for time series yt then the cross wavelet spectrum can be represented as 9 w t xy s w t xy s e t φ t s where w n xy s denotes the power of the cross wavelet the phase angle φ t s refers to the delay between the two time series at time t and frequency s and can be calculated as 10 φ t s tan 1 i s s 1 w t xy s r s s 1 w t xy s π π where s is a smoothing operator and i and r represent the imaginary and real parts of w t xy s respectively a consistent phase relationship indicated physical causality between both time series hao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the in phase relation indicates complete positive correlation and vice versa yu and lin 2015 3 4 2 wavelet coherence wtc wavelet coherence wtc was used to analyze how coherent the xwt was in the time frequency space and thus can determine the intensity of the covariance of two time series xt and yt nalley et al 2016 schulte et al 2017 ranging from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating that the two time series are linearly related at the given frequency and time the values of the wavelet squared coherency r t 2 s were expressed as 11 r t 2 s s s 1 w t xy s 2 s s 1 w t x s 2 s s 1 w t y s 2 where s represents a smoothing operator and can be expressed as 12 s w s scale s time w t s where sscale is the smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and stime is the smoothing in time for the morlet wavelet a suitable smoothing operator is given by torrence and compo 1998 as follows 13 s time w s w t s c 1 t 2 2 s 2 14 s t i m e w t w t s c 2 0 6 s t where c 1 and c 2 are normalization constants π denotes the rectangle function and 0 6 is the empirically determined scale decorrelation length for the morlet wavelet torrence and compo 1998 3 4 3 test of significance the significance test for the wavelet coherence can be performed using monte carlo methods grinsted et al 2004 we generated 1000 surrogate data set pairs all with the same lag of 1 autoregressive coefficient si and zeleke 2005 then the wavelet coherence for each pair was calculated at each scale the 1000 wavelet powers were sorted into ascending order if the wavelet power is below 950 out of 1000 this represents a 95 confidence level or the 5 significance level si and farrell 2004 it is important to highlight that the significance level for each scale is estimated using only values outside the coi hao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the number of scales per octave has to be high enough to capture the rectangular shape of the scale smoothing operator while minimizing computing time grinsted et al 2004 in this study 6 scales per octave were required and only the 5 significance level against red noise were considered after the calculations 3 4 4 global coherence the global wavelet coherence coefficient at a certain scale s was defined as time averaged wavelet coherence coefficients over a certain period within the coi 15 r t 2 s 1 n a n n 1 n 2 r t 2 s where n 1 and n2 are the locations of the coi edge in the time domain when the scale is s n is arbitrarily assigned to the midpoint of n1 and n2 and na n2 n1 1 and is the number of points averaged torrence and compo 1998 hao et al 2016 the global coherence coefficient was applied to calculate the correlations between two time series on different scales zhang et al 2017 it ignored the time and was helpful for examining the characteristic periodicities torrence and compo 1998 labat 2010 in this study the cwt and wtc processes were both carried out by a matlab toolbox developed by grinsted et al 2004 which is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence 4 results 4 1 variations of sediment discharge and its influencing factors the statistical descriptions of the annual sediment discharge water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi in the liujiang and hongshui watersheds are shown in table 1 in the liujiang and hongshui watersheds sediment discharge varied substantially from 70 104 to 1799 104 t yr 1 and from 19 104 to 11 004 104 t yr 1 with a mean of 514 104 and 3508 104 t yr 1 respectively the precipitation pet and ndvi showed littler variation with coefficient of variation cv values ranging from 4 to 22 table 1 interestingly the cv of sediment discharge was much greater than its four influencing factors in both the liujiang and hongshui watersheds the temporal variation in annual sediment discharge and associated variables in the liujiang and hongshui watersheds are exhibited in figs 2 and 3 respectively in the liujiang watershed from 1955 to 1981 the annual sediment discharge was relatively stable with a mean of 431 104 t yr 1 the sediment discharge greatly increased from the period of 1955 1981 to that of 1982 2000 after 2000 the sediment discharge was much smaller compared to the sediment discharge that occurred during 1982 2000 nevertheless the mean sediment discharge during 2001 2015 431 104 t yr 1 was very similar to the sediment discharge during 1955 1981 fig 2 there were no obvious patterns in precipitation water discharge or pet in the liujiang watershed fig 2 a very low value was detected for ndvi in 2012 due to an extreme drought that occurred in this region liu et al 2015 in the hongshui watershed the sediment discharge varied slightly from 1955 to 1963 fig 3 similar to the liujiang watershed a large increase in sediment discharge was noted during 1964 1991 in hongshui watershed the yd and td dams constructed in 1992 and 1997 respectively both greatly reduced the sediment discharge specifically a pronounced decrease of sediment discharge was observed of 5855 104 t yr 1 between 1964 and 1991 to 2707 104 t yr 1 between 1992 and 1997 and further down to 963 104 t yr 1 between 1997 and 2006 after the ld dam became operational in 2006 sediment discharge continued to decrease unlike sediment discharge no obvious decreasing trend was found in water discharge fig 3 the m k trend tests for water and sediment discharge in the liujiang watershed are summarized in table 2 as expected an insignificant trend was detected in both water discharge p 92 and sediment discharge p 93 in the hongshui watershed the wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that a significant difference in sediment discharge was observed between pre dam and post dam construction periods p 05 table 3 the mean annual sediment discharge in the pre dam and the post dam construction periods are 5016 104 t and 1016 104 t respectively reflecting a 79 75 of reduction however no significant trend was found in water discharge in the hongshui watershed p 346 table 3 4 2 continuous wavelet analysis of sediment discharge and associated factors figs 4 and 5 showed the results of the continuous wavelet analysis for annual sediment discharge water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi for the liujiang and hongshui watersheds in liujiang watershed the variations in all five variables showed inconstant frequencies fig 4 the global wavelet spectrum for sediment discharge showed statistically significant oscillations at about a 4 year scale between 1978 and 2008 fig 4a a significant 3 year oscillation for water discharge between 1963 1985 and 1988 1998 was observed in fig 4b there also existed a 3 year significant period between 1967 1972 and 1978 2015 in precipitation fig 4c and between 1992 and 2015 in ndvi fig 4e however pet had no significant cycles throughout the past 61 years in liujiang watershed fig 4d similar to the liujiang watershed significant 3 year periods in water discharge between 1960 and 1998 fig 5b in precipitation between 1960 and 2000 fig 5c and in ndvi between 2001 and 2008 fig 5e were found in hongshui watershed unlike in the liujiang watershed pet showed a significant 3 year periodic oscillation between 1960 and 2011 in hongshui watershed fig 5d there was no significant cycle in the sediment discharge in hongshui watershed fig 5a 4 3 wavelet coherence between sediment discharge and associated factors the wavelet coherence coefficients and global coherence coefficients between sediment discharge and its associated factors are presented in fig 6 for the liujiang watershed and fig 7 for the hongshui watershed in the liujiang watershed two groups of significant regions at 3 9 year band and 12 18 year band were observed between sediment and water discharge these significant regions at 3 6 year and 6 9 year time scales were observed between 1974 1985 and 1985 2002 respectively fig 6a significant regions at 12 18 year time scale were found in the whole period the peak of global coefficients for 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 year were 0 53 0 61 0 60 0 7 0 87 and 0 95 respectively table 4 the significant region was mainly distributed in the 6 18 year bands between sediment discharge and precipitation fig 6b the significant regions at 6 and 9 year time scales were observed in the periods between 1981 1997 and 1983 1990 with the corresponding local peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 52 and 0 71 respectively table 4 the significant region at 12 18 year time scales was observed in the whole period the peak of global coherence coefficients were 0 60 0 71 and 0 86 for the 12 15 and 18 year time scales respectively table 4 three groups of significant regions at 3 5 6 9 and 18 year scale bands were found between sediment discharge and pet fig 6c the significant regions at 3 5 year scale bands were observed between 1991 and 2002 with the corresponding local peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 33 the significant regions at 6 9 year scale bands were found during 1972 1998 the peak of global coherence coefficients were 0 39 and 0 51 for 6 and 9 year scale respectively the significant regions at 18 year scale band were found in the whole period with the peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 84 table 4 as shown in fig 6d the significant regions were mainly distributed in the 2 and 3 year time scales between sediment discharge and ndvi the significant regions at 2 and 3 year scale bands were observed in the periods between 1992 1996 and 2008 2010 respectively the peak of global coherence coefficient for the 3 year scale was 0 47 table 4 in the hongshui watershed the wavelet coherence between sediment discharge and water discharge showed a significant region at 3 12 year time scale bands fig 7a the significant regions were observed in the periods between 1960 2003 1968 1983 and 1968 1980 at 3 6 and 9 year time scales respectively the peak of global coherence coefficient were 0 73 0 42 and 0 57 at 3 6 and 9 year time scales respectively table 4 significant correlations between sediment discharge and precipitation were observed at 3 5 year time scales fig 7b the significant regions at 3 year time scales were apparent between 1958 and 1971 and 1973 2000 with a corresponding local peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 64 table 4 similar to the significant regions between sediment discharge and precipitation significant regions at 3 5 year time scales were also found between sediment discharge and pet fig 7c the significant regions at the 3 year time scales were observed in the periods between 1962 1973 and 1975 1997 the maximum global coherence coefficient corresponding to the significant region is 0 59 at 3 year scale band table 4 the wavelet coherence between the sediment discharge and ndvi in hongshui watershed is shown in fig 7d interestingly no significant regions were found between sediment discharge and ndvi this phenomenon from the hongshui watershed was distinctively different from the liujiang watershed 5 discussion for the liujiang and hongshui watersheds it is important to note that the mean annual sediment yield sediment discharge per unit area is 113 t km 2 yr 1 and 272 t km 2 yr 1 respectively table 1 which were much lower than those noted in the non karst regions e g the ganga river indus river irrawaddy river yangtze river and yellow river basins syvitski et al 2005 ali and de boer 2007 furuichi et al 2009 miao et al 2011 gupta et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the soil loss in these karst regions however is still very serious due to the lower soil loss tolerance feng et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2016 it would take 2000 8000 years to form the 1 cm of soil in pure limestone areas and thus the soil loss tolerance is only 30 68 t km 2 yr 1 in this region peng and wang 2012 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017a since the homogenous carbonate rock areas are extremely sensitive to soil erosion li et al 2017a greater efforts should be made to control soil erosion in the karst areas of southwest china in the liujiang watershed between 1982 and 2000 agricultural development cutting forest and shrubs farming on hilly lands grazing irrigation and economic reformation causing repaid population growth greatly increased soil erosion zhang et al 2008 wu et al 2012 this explains why the annual sediment discharge during this period is 1 6 times greater than that of 1955 1981 fig 2 after 2000 the long term policy driven grain for green project was implemented in this watershed which has led to increased precipitation retention and consequently the reduction of river sediment discharge tian et al 2016 fig 2 however the annual sediment discharge still exhibited an increasing trend over the entire experimental period in liujiang watershed fig 2 table 2 unlike in the liujiang watershed a significant decreasing trend for sediment discharge was detected in the hongshui watershed table 3 the mean sediment discharge decreased by approximately 98 between 1964 and 1991 and after the ld dam began operation 2006 2015 fig 3 the decrease in sediment discharge in the hongshui watershed was related to the fact that the large dams yd td and ld were constructed in this watershed dai et al 2008 wu et al 2012 this implies that dam construction could play a significant role in reducing sediment discharge in karst areas dam construction exerted substantial influence on the periodic pattern of sediment discharge the significant 4 year periodic oscillation was noted in the liujiang watershed fig 4a while no significant cycle was observed in the hongshui watershed fig 5a there were no large dams constructed in the liujiang watershed in fact there is only one the mashi dam which has a storage capacity of 0 3 km3 in this watershed dai et al 2008 wu et al 2012 although vegetation restoration was implemented in this region the effectiveness of vegetation cover in reducing soil erosion was greatly limited in karst regions discussed later the large dams in the hongshui watershed can trap large quantities of sediments and the sediment discharge has shown progressive decline zhang et al 2008 li et al 2016 which modified the periodicity in sediment discharge the significant periodic oscillation in sediment discharge is important for the management of river basins and the implementation of soil and water conservation measures the periodicity in annual water discharge might not be affected by dam construction since the significant 3 year periodic oscillation was observed in both the liujiang and hongshui watershed figs 4b and 5b in kart regions of southwest china the irregular networks of pores cracks fissures fractures and conduits of various sizes and forms exist and this 3 d hydrogeological network has a significant effect on water discharge dynamics wu et al 2017 generally most rain that falls on a hillslope drains quickly and recharges groundwater systems and it has been noted that surface runoff accounts for 5 of the rainfall which is far lower than that in a non karst watershed li et al 2017b only a single precipitation event greater than 60 mm or precipitation preceded by large antecedent rainfall events could produce surface runoff peng and wang 2012 fu et al 2016 in most cases precipitation drains quickly to recharge groundwater systems through numerous cracks and fissures and the runoff generation differs vastly depending on permeability wilcox et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 karst watersheds have poor storage capacity and thus the contribution of precipitation to runoff change was great some recent studies have shown that the evolution of annual water discharge is mainly influenced by annual precipitation while human activities e g dam construction have a negligible influence zhang and lu 2009 wu et al 2012 wu et al 2017 this is consistent with the findings of the current study which showed that dam construction generally did not change the periodic pattern of water discharge in a karst watershed the results of the coherence coefficients and global coherence coefficients between the annual sediment discharge and its associated factors figs 6 and 7 table 4 showed that water discharge was an important factor controlling annual sediment discharge in the karst watersheds moreover the significant area between sediment and water discharge was much greater than that of other three influencing factors in both liujiang and hongshui watersheds table s1 this also implied that water discharge exerted more substantial influence on sediment discharge than precipitation pet and ndvi in karst regions this result further corroborates a recent study that showed monthly sediment discharge was primarily controlled by water discharge using state space models li et al 2017c the significant region between sediment and water discharge was found in the whole period in liujiang watershed fig 6a while no significant region was observed in hongshui watershed after 2001 fig 7a the same phenomenon was also found between sediment discharge and precipitation figs 6b and 7b thus the occurrence of the large dams in hongshui watershed has changed the temporal covariance between sediment and water discharge in general the sediment discharge is closely related to water discharge or precipitation in the natural hydrologic regime miao et al 2010 wang et al 2016 li et al 2016 however the presence of the large dams has sharply decreased the sediment flux in the hongshui watershed this dam regulation disrupted the natural hydrologic regime and might obviously reduce the influence of the water discharge or precipitation on sediment discharge generally vegetation can reduce erosion by reinforcing the soil body to enhance the soil resistance to erosion knapen et al 2007 li et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 in non karst areas such as the loess plateau vegetation coverage has shown a significant increasing trend and thus has been noted to be the most important factor affecting the intensity and frequency of soil erosion events even exceeding the influence of dam construction wang et al 2016 in karst areas significant correlations between sediment discharge and ndvi were only observed between 1992 1996 and 2008 2010 in the liujiang watershed while no significant regions were found in the hongshui watershed figs 6 and 7 this implies that the ndvi exerted a more substantial influence on sediment discharge in non karst areas e g the loess plateau than that in karst areas actually the original background values of ndvi for the current study area were considerably greater than that in the loess plateau ouyang et al 2010 no significant increasing trends for ndvi were detected in either the liujiang or the hongshui watershed furthermore conduits and sinkholes which lead to underground river systems have been found throughout karst watersheds jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017b most of the eroded sediment is transported from conduits or sinkholes to underground rivers which then flow into other watersheds or are stored in an underground karst environment and feed a surface river bai et al 2013 wu et al 2017 most sediment is lost through underground river and a relatively small amount of sediment is transported by overland flow due to this special geologic feature sediment reducing effects by vegetation are limited in karst watersheds additionally three large dams in the hongshui watershed effectively reduced sediment discharge and thus the dam construction could weaken or even mask the effectiveness of vegetation in reducing soil loss this further explains why significant regions were found in the liujiang watershed while no significant correlations between ndvi and sediment discharge was observed in the hongshui watershed this study has some limitations for example the present study did not present quantitative attribution of the effects of dams and vegetation on changes to sediment discharge rates further studies are needed to quantify the relative importance of the individual driving forces on sediment discharge 6 conclusions this study provides important information on the effect of dam construction on the multiscale variability of sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors in the karst watersheds of liujiang no large dams and hongshui dam controlled for the period of 1955 2015 in southwest china there were differences in the temporal variation in sediment discharge between the two watersheds the annual sediment discharge increased over time in the liujiang watershed while a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 in sediment discharge was detected in the hongshui watershed the variations in sediment discharge also showed inconstant frequencies for these two watersheds specifically sediment discharge exhibited significant power in the wavelet power spectrum at the 4 year period in the liujiang watershed however no significant temporal cycle in sediment discharge was observed in the hongshui watershed the multiscale influence of ndvi on sediment discharge was also greatly influenced by dam construction in the liujiang watershed although the effect of ndvi on sediment discharge was limited in karst areas significant regions were still detected between ndvi and sediment discharge dam construction could reduce or mask the effect of ndvi on sediment discharge and thus no significant correlation was found between ndvi and sediment discharge in the hongshui watershed the present study highlights the usefulness of wavelet analysis in revealing multiscale variability of sediment discharge and the results can provide valuable information on soil and water conservation in the karst

7440,southwest china as one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world is a severely eroded region due to its special geological condition thus soil and water conservation measures such as dam construction have been extensively implemented in this region to control sediment delivery however it remains unclear how dam construction affects multiscale variability of sediment discharge sd and its potentially influential factors in southwest china to assess this annual sd water discharge wd precipitation pt potential evapotranspiration pet and normalized differential vegetation index ndvi data from 1955 to 2015 were obtained from two karst watersheds of liujiang no large dams and hongshui dam controlled these sites shared the similar climatic conditions the mann kendal test wilcoxon rank sum test and continuous wavelet transform analysis was used to detect the trends and periodicity in sd and wavelet coherence analysis were employed to detect the temporal covariance between sd and wd pt pet and ndvi results indicated that the multiscale variability of sd was strongly influenced by dam construction the annual sd showed significant 4 year periodic oscillation in the liujiang watershed while no significant cycles were found in the hongshui watershed dam construction exerted substantial influence on the multiscale correlations between sd and its associated factors the time scales that the ndvi resonated with sd were concentrated on the periodicity of 2 and 3 year in the liujiang watershed in contrast no significant periodicities were observed in the hongshu watershed this study yields a greater understanding of sd dynamics and is helpful for better watershed management in karst areas of southwest china keywords soil erosion dam periodicity wavelet coherence karst landscape ecohydrology 1 introduction karst landforms cover 7 12 of the earth s continental area ford and williams 2013 hartmann et al 2014 and are mainly distributed in three areas of the world the mediterranean coast the southwest china and northern vietnam and the indiana and kentucky of the united states cuba and jamaica dai et al 2017a with approximately 0 51 million km2 of exposed outcropped carbonate rock southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world li et al 2016 this region is characterized by shallow soils overlying highly irregular carbonate rocks e g limestone dolomite peng and wang 2012 the carbonate rocks are highly soluble and unable to produce much soil feng et al 2014 dai et al 2017b the low silicate mineral content in carbonate rock especially limestone is primarily responsible for the low rates of soil formation in karst areas jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017a previous studies have shown that to create 1 m of soil in karst areas it would take one to three quarters of a million years of dissolving 25 m of carbonate rock peng and wang 2012 the low soil formation rate implies that it would be extremely difficult to recover the soil layer in the karst region once it was lost jiang et al 2014 the sediment discharge of karst rivers generally reflects soil erosion rates in karst watersheds li et al 2016 therefore a reliable assessment of sediment discharge dynamics is crucial to developing strategic plans for the sustainable management of karst watersheds water discharge is considered a principal variable driving river eroded sediment and therefore has a significant effect on sediment discharge wang et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 the magnitude and timing of water and sediment discharge are greatly influenced by climatic variability and human activity zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2017 precipitation is a regulator of water discharge as well as soil erosion and sediment transport zhang et al 2008 miao et al 2011 potential evapotranspiration pet is closely related to water discharge and vegetation growth and therefore can strongly influence sediment discharge sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 vegetation cover is another important factor influencing the occurrence and intensity of soil erosion xu et al 2008 generally a vegetation index such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be applied to reflect the temporal dynamics of land cover ouyang et al 2010 a better understanding of sediment discharge and the potentially influential factors water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi is urgently needed as an aid for developing regional soil conservation policies for karst watersheds dam construction is an effective measure to reduce sediment discharge in rivers dai et al 2008 zhao et al 2017 in recent decades many dams have been constructed in many large rivers e g colorado river mekong river nile river red river yellow river and yangtze river resulting in a dramatic decrease in sediment discharge wang et al 2011 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 generally temporal variation in sediment discharge exhibits a powerful periodicity which can provide useful information to explore the potential causes of sediment discharge dynamics for example using wavelet transform method gao et al 2014 showed that sediment discharge in the yellow river followed 6 and 11 year periods before 1980 and the periods changed to 4 7 and 12 years after 1980 zhang et al 2009 found that the sediment discharge in the lower yangtze river showed significant periodic oscillation using the techniques of scanning t test f test and coherency analysis because dams cause a dramatic decrease in sediment discharge they have the potential to disrupt these periods or create new periods of sediment discharge unrelated to the natural hydrologic regime dams may also cause changes to multiscale correlations between sediment discharge and its associated factors water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi in general spectral analysis and temporal coherency can reveal multiscale correlation relationships between factors but are only applicable to stationary systems si and zeleke 2005 however hydrological variables and sediment discharge are nonstationary zhang et al 2014 wavelet analysis e g wavelet transform wavelet coherence however can process nonstationary data series and therefore provides an opportunity to evaluate the multiscale temporal variability of sediment discharge wavelet analysis also takes advantage of the wavelet coefficient which is related to a specific period of time and frequency simultaneously making it possible to trace the amplitude and phase of fluctuations of a specific wavelength through time labat 2005 adamowski et al 2013 a variety of hydrological studies have used wavelet analysis to analyze hydrological processes coulibaly and burn 2004 gan et al 2007 labat 2010 adamowski et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 charlier et al 2015 hao et al 2016 however few studies have dealt with identification of multiscale variability of sediment discharge using wavelet analysis especially in karst regions where soil erosion is more complicated than that in non karst regions due to the special geologic structure moreover information about the effects of dam construction on the period of sediment discharge is limited although required the objectives of this study were 1 to test whether the presence of large dams changes the multiscale temporal variability of sediment discharge in two paired watersheds which shared the similar climatic condition but different construction of dams and 2 to explore the effect of dams on multiscale temporal covariance between sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area included two typical karst watersheds the liujiang 24 8 26 28 n 107 24 110 33 e and hongshui 23 3 27 1 n 102 16 109 13 e watersheds in southwest china fig 1 the two watersheds are characterized by shallow soils overlaying a highly irregular epikarst surface these regions are prone to soil erosion due to their fragility both watersheds experience a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate straddling the tropic of cancer precipitation is highly variable throughout the year and more than 80 of the precipitation occurs during the wet season from april to october the liujiang watershed contains the liujiang river which is the second largest tributary of the xijiang river the liujiang river originates from gengding mountain gengding county guizhou province and runs for 773 km from south to north before entering the xijiang river the liujiang watershed has an altitude between 91 m and 2076 m with a total area of 4 54 104 km2 the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this watershed are 19 c and 1390 mm 1955 2015 respectively six meteorological stations and one hydrologic station liuzhou are located in this watershed fig 1 there is only one dam called the mashi dam which began operation in 1971 with a storage capacity of 0 3 km3 located in this watershed and no other large dams are constructed to reduce sediment discharge hongshui river spans a total length of 1553 km and drains an area of 12 89 104 km2 with a mean annual water and sediment discharge of 64 4 km3 and 3 5 107 t 1955 2015 respectively the hongshui river watershed is located in the upper reaches of the xijiang river the elevation in this watershed ranges from 74 m to 2866 m decreasing from west to east the multi year mean annual temperature within the watershed is 19 c and the watershed wide mean precipitation is 1190 mm 1955 2015 one hydrologic station qianjiang station and fifteen meteorological stations are located in this watershed fig 1 numerous dams have been constructed since the 1960 s in this watershed the three largest dams are the yantan dam yd began operation in 1992 the tianshengqiao dam td began operation in 1997 and the longtan dam ld began operation in 2006 which have a storage capacity of 3 4 10 8 and 27 3 km3 respectively the multiscale variability of sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors can be investigated in a dam controlled watershed hongshui and a watershed relatively unaffected by dams liujiang 2 2 data long term annual water and sediment discharge series 1955 2015 of the liuzhou and qianjiang hydrologic stations were acquired from hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china sediment discharge in this study refers to suspended sediment only precipitation data time series 1955 2015 was extracted from 21 meteorological stations within the liujiang and hongshui watersheds and was provided by the china meteorological administration cma the potential evapotranspiration pet at each meteorological station was estimated using the penman formula penman 1948 the precipitation and pet data were spatially averaged across the watersheds by the cokriging interpolation algorithm using arcgis 10 3 software to compute the watershed averaged precipitation and pet annual ndvi data 1982 2015 were derived from the global inventory modeling and monitoring study gimms ndvi3g data set 3 methodology in this study the mann kendall test m k method originally proposed by mann 1945 and later improved by kendall maurice 1975 was used to analyze the temporal trends of water and sediment discharge in the liujiang watershed the wilcoxon rank sum test was employed to test whether the presence of large dams greatly reduced the sediment discharge in the hongshui watershed the continuous wavelet transform cwt analysis was applied to detect the periodicity in sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors wavelet coherence was calculated to denote the periodicity correlation between sediment discharge and water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi 3 1 m k trend test the m k test is widely used by many researchers to examine the significance of monotonic trends in meteorological and hydrological time series because it is robust against non normally distributed data zhang and lu 2009 miao et al 2010 xu et al 2013 gao et al 2016 the null hypothesis h 0 is that there is no trend in the time series x x 1 x 2 x n h 0 can be rejected at the significance level of 0 05 if z 1 96 a positive value of z represents an upward trend and a negative value indicates a downward trend the m k test assumes that the series is independent therefore the trend free pre whitening method is applied to eliminate the auto correlation in the time series in current study the detailed information of the m k trend test can be found in previous papers zhao et al 2014 li et al 2016 3 2 wilcoxon rank sum test due to the first large dam was operated in 1992 the sediment discharge was divided into two periods the pre dam construction period from 1955 to 1992 and the post dam construction period from 1993 to 2015 in the hongshui watershed the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to detect the significant difference in sediment discharge between these two periods unlike t test applied to normal distribution the wilcoxon rank sum test can be used for unknown distributions suppose there are two sample series x and y of size m and n respectively under the null hypothesis h0 the x and y sample series come from the same underlying distribution and are then combined and ordered from the minimum to the maximum expressed as zi i 1 n m n the sum of ranks of the observations in sample x wx and y wy can be expressed as 1 w x w y n n 1 2 after that we defined w1 and w2 as follows 2 w 1 w x m m 1 2 w 2 w y n n 1 2 w 1 w 2 mn for large sample series n we consider a large sample approximation to the distribution of w under h0 the exact distribution of wx has a mean and a variance 3 e w x mn 2 m n 1 2 m n 1 2 4 var w x mn n 1 12 the wx was standardized and then the z statistic can be described as 5 z w x e w x var w x w x m n 1 2 mn n 1 12 n 0 1 hence the p value can be obtained from the z value the h0 is accepted if p 0 05 here a typical confidence level of 95 ie p 0 05 was used the detailed information of the wilcoxon rank sum test can be found in previous studies rosner et al 2003 hao et al 2016 3 3 continuous wavelet transform cwt wavelet analysis is a general tool for analyzing localized variation of power within a time series labat 2005 hao et al 2012 the cwt decomposes a time series over a time scale space and can identify the dominant modes of variability and how these modes vary in time coulibaly and burn 2004 charlier et al 2015 a wavelet function ψ t which can be defined as ψ t dt 0 is a special kind of the waveform that has a finite length and a zero mean value gan et al 2007 these features are suitable for analysis of nonstationary processes that contain multi scale features torrence and compo 1998 the cwt of a discrete time series xt t 0 t 1 is defined as the convolution of xt with a scaled and translated version of ψ 0 η 6 w t x s δ t s t 1 n x t ψ 0 t i δ t s where w is the wavelet coefficient s is the scale factor which determines the degree of compression or scale δ t is time step ψ 0 denotes the complex conjugate of ψ 0 in the current study we used the complex non orthogonal morlet wavelet as the mother function as it is fairly well localized in both time and frequency space coulibaly and burn 2004 adamowski et al 2013 wu et al 2015 hao et al 2016 the morlet wavelet function ψ 0 t is expressed as 7 ψ 0 t π 1 4 e i ω 0 t e 1 2 t 2 where t is the dimensionless time and ω 0 is the dimensionless frequency because the wavelet is not completely localized in time the cwt has an edge artifact problem torrence and compo 1998 thus a cone of influence coi is employed to solve the edge effect grinsted et al 2004 the coi is represented by the region outside of the concave up shaped area nalley et al 2016 that is the wavelet power w t x s 2 caused by a discontinuity at the edge has dropped to e 2 of the value at the edge grinsted et al 2004 hao et al 2016 3 4 wavelet coherence wtc analysis 3 4 1 cross wavelet transform xwt the covariance of two time series xt and yt w t xy s is estimated using a cross wavelet transform xwt and can be calculated using 8 w t xy s w t x s w t y s where w t x s refers to the wavelet transform of time series xt at frequency s and w t y denotes the complex conjugate of wavelet transform w t y for time series yt then the cross wavelet spectrum can be represented as 9 w t xy s w t xy s e t φ t s where w n xy s denotes the power of the cross wavelet the phase angle φ t s refers to the delay between the two time series at time t and frequency s and can be calculated as 10 φ t s tan 1 i s s 1 w t xy s r s s 1 w t xy s π π where s is a smoothing operator and i and r represent the imaginary and real parts of w t xy s respectively a consistent phase relationship indicated physical causality between both time series hao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the in phase relation indicates complete positive correlation and vice versa yu and lin 2015 3 4 2 wavelet coherence wtc wavelet coherence wtc was used to analyze how coherent the xwt was in the time frequency space and thus can determine the intensity of the covariance of two time series xt and yt nalley et al 2016 schulte et al 2017 ranging from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating that the two time series are linearly related at the given frequency and time the values of the wavelet squared coherency r t 2 s were expressed as 11 r t 2 s s s 1 w t xy s 2 s s 1 w t x s 2 s s 1 w t y s 2 where s represents a smoothing operator and can be expressed as 12 s w s scale s time w t s where sscale is the smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and stime is the smoothing in time for the morlet wavelet a suitable smoothing operator is given by torrence and compo 1998 as follows 13 s time w s w t s c 1 t 2 2 s 2 14 s t i m e w t w t s c 2 0 6 s t where c 1 and c 2 are normalization constants π denotes the rectangle function and 0 6 is the empirically determined scale decorrelation length for the morlet wavelet torrence and compo 1998 3 4 3 test of significance the significance test for the wavelet coherence can be performed using monte carlo methods grinsted et al 2004 we generated 1000 surrogate data set pairs all with the same lag of 1 autoregressive coefficient si and zeleke 2005 then the wavelet coherence for each pair was calculated at each scale the 1000 wavelet powers were sorted into ascending order if the wavelet power is below 950 out of 1000 this represents a 95 confidence level or the 5 significance level si and farrell 2004 it is important to highlight that the significance level for each scale is estimated using only values outside the coi hao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the number of scales per octave has to be high enough to capture the rectangular shape of the scale smoothing operator while minimizing computing time grinsted et al 2004 in this study 6 scales per octave were required and only the 5 significance level against red noise were considered after the calculations 3 4 4 global coherence the global wavelet coherence coefficient at a certain scale s was defined as time averaged wavelet coherence coefficients over a certain period within the coi 15 r t 2 s 1 n a n n 1 n 2 r t 2 s where n 1 and n2 are the locations of the coi edge in the time domain when the scale is s n is arbitrarily assigned to the midpoint of n1 and n2 and na n2 n1 1 and is the number of points averaged torrence and compo 1998 hao et al 2016 the global coherence coefficient was applied to calculate the correlations between two time series on different scales zhang et al 2017 it ignored the time and was helpful for examining the characteristic periodicities torrence and compo 1998 labat 2010 in this study the cwt and wtc processes were both carried out by a matlab toolbox developed by grinsted et al 2004 which is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence 4 results 4 1 variations of sediment discharge and its influencing factors the statistical descriptions of the annual sediment discharge water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi in the liujiang and hongshui watersheds are shown in table 1 in the liujiang and hongshui watersheds sediment discharge varied substantially from 70 104 to 1799 104 t yr 1 and from 19 104 to 11 004 104 t yr 1 with a mean of 514 104 and 3508 104 t yr 1 respectively the precipitation pet and ndvi showed littler variation with coefficient of variation cv values ranging from 4 to 22 table 1 interestingly the cv of sediment discharge was much greater than its four influencing factors in both the liujiang and hongshui watersheds the temporal variation in annual sediment discharge and associated variables in the liujiang and hongshui watersheds are exhibited in figs 2 and 3 respectively in the liujiang watershed from 1955 to 1981 the annual sediment discharge was relatively stable with a mean of 431 104 t yr 1 the sediment discharge greatly increased from the period of 1955 1981 to that of 1982 2000 after 2000 the sediment discharge was much smaller compared to the sediment discharge that occurred during 1982 2000 nevertheless the mean sediment discharge during 2001 2015 431 104 t yr 1 was very similar to the sediment discharge during 1955 1981 fig 2 there were no obvious patterns in precipitation water discharge or pet in the liujiang watershed fig 2 a very low value was detected for ndvi in 2012 due to an extreme drought that occurred in this region liu et al 2015 in the hongshui watershed the sediment discharge varied slightly from 1955 to 1963 fig 3 similar to the liujiang watershed a large increase in sediment discharge was noted during 1964 1991 in hongshui watershed the yd and td dams constructed in 1992 and 1997 respectively both greatly reduced the sediment discharge specifically a pronounced decrease of sediment discharge was observed of 5855 104 t yr 1 between 1964 and 1991 to 2707 104 t yr 1 between 1992 and 1997 and further down to 963 104 t yr 1 between 1997 and 2006 after the ld dam became operational in 2006 sediment discharge continued to decrease unlike sediment discharge no obvious decreasing trend was found in water discharge fig 3 the m k trend tests for water and sediment discharge in the liujiang watershed are summarized in table 2 as expected an insignificant trend was detected in both water discharge p 92 and sediment discharge p 93 in the hongshui watershed the wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that a significant difference in sediment discharge was observed between pre dam and post dam construction periods p 05 table 3 the mean annual sediment discharge in the pre dam and the post dam construction periods are 5016 104 t and 1016 104 t respectively reflecting a 79 75 of reduction however no significant trend was found in water discharge in the hongshui watershed p 346 table 3 4 2 continuous wavelet analysis of sediment discharge and associated factors figs 4 and 5 showed the results of the continuous wavelet analysis for annual sediment discharge water discharge precipitation pet and ndvi for the liujiang and hongshui watersheds in liujiang watershed the variations in all five variables showed inconstant frequencies fig 4 the global wavelet spectrum for sediment discharge showed statistically significant oscillations at about a 4 year scale between 1978 and 2008 fig 4a a significant 3 year oscillation for water discharge between 1963 1985 and 1988 1998 was observed in fig 4b there also existed a 3 year significant period between 1967 1972 and 1978 2015 in precipitation fig 4c and between 1992 and 2015 in ndvi fig 4e however pet had no significant cycles throughout the past 61 years in liujiang watershed fig 4d similar to the liujiang watershed significant 3 year periods in water discharge between 1960 and 1998 fig 5b in precipitation between 1960 and 2000 fig 5c and in ndvi between 2001 and 2008 fig 5e were found in hongshui watershed unlike in the liujiang watershed pet showed a significant 3 year periodic oscillation between 1960 and 2011 in hongshui watershed fig 5d there was no significant cycle in the sediment discharge in hongshui watershed fig 5a 4 3 wavelet coherence between sediment discharge and associated factors the wavelet coherence coefficients and global coherence coefficients between sediment discharge and its associated factors are presented in fig 6 for the liujiang watershed and fig 7 for the hongshui watershed in the liujiang watershed two groups of significant regions at 3 9 year band and 12 18 year band were observed between sediment and water discharge these significant regions at 3 6 year and 6 9 year time scales were observed between 1974 1985 and 1985 2002 respectively fig 6a significant regions at 12 18 year time scale were found in the whole period the peak of global coefficients for 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 year were 0 53 0 61 0 60 0 7 0 87 and 0 95 respectively table 4 the significant region was mainly distributed in the 6 18 year bands between sediment discharge and precipitation fig 6b the significant regions at 6 and 9 year time scales were observed in the periods between 1981 1997 and 1983 1990 with the corresponding local peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 52 and 0 71 respectively table 4 the significant region at 12 18 year time scales was observed in the whole period the peak of global coherence coefficients were 0 60 0 71 and 0 86 for the 12 15 and 18 year time scales respectively table 4 three groups of significant regions at 3 5 6 9 and 18 year scale bands were found between sediment discharge and pet fig 6c the significant regions at 3 5 year scale bands were observed between 1991 and 2002 with the corresponding local peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 33 the significant regions at 6 9 year scale bands were found during 1972 1998 the peak of global coherence coefficients were 0 39 and 0 51 for 6 and 9 year scale respectively the significant regions at 18 year scale band were found in the whole period with the peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 84 table 4 as shown in fig 6d the significant regions were mainly distributed in the 2 and 3 year time scales between sediment discharge and ndvi the significant regions at 2 and 3 year scale bands were observed in the periods between 1992 1996 and 2008 2010 respectively the peak of global coherence coefficient for the 3 year scale was 0 47 table 4 in the hongshui watershed the wavelet coherence between sediment discharge and water discharge showed a significant region at 3 12 year time scale bands fig 7a the significant regions were observed in the periods between 1960 2003 1968 1983 and 1968 1980 at 3 6 and 9 year time scales respectively the peak of global coherence coefficient were 0 73 0 42 and 0 57 at 3 6 and 9 year time scales respectively table 4 significant correlations between sediment discharge and precipitation were observed at 3 5 year time scales fig 7b the significant regions at 3 year time scales were apparent between 1958 and 1971 and 1973 2000 with a corresponding local peak of global coherence coefficient of 0 64 table 4 similar to the significant regions between sediment discharge and precipitation significant regions at 3 5 year time scales were also found between sediment discharge and pet fig 7c the significant regions at the 3 year time scales were observed in the periods between 1962 1973 and 1975 1997 the maximum global coherence coefficient corresponding to the significant region is 0 59 at 3 year scale band table 4 the wavelet coherence between the sediment discharge and ndvi in hongshui watershed is shown in fig 7d interestingly no significant regions were found between sediment discharge and ndvi this phenomenon from the hongshui watershed was distinctively different from the liujiang watershed 5 discussion for the liujiang and hongshui watersheds it is important to note that the mean annual sediment yield sediment discharge per unit area is 113 t km 2 yr 1 and 272 t km 2 yr 1 respectively table 1 which were much lower than those noted in the non karst regions e g the ganga river indus river irrawaddy river yangtze river and yellow river basins syvitski et al 2005 ali and de boer 2007 furuichi et al 2009 miao et al 2011 gupta et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the soil loss in these karst regions however is still very serious due to the lower soil loss tolerance feng et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2016 it would take 2000 8000 years to form the 1 cm of soil in pure limestone areas and thus the soil loss tolerance is only 30 68 t km 2 yr 1 in this region peng and wang 2012 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017a since the homogenous carbonate rock areas are extremely sensitive to soil erosion li et al 2017a greater efforts should be made to control soil erosion in the karst areas of southwest china in the liujiang watershed between 1982 and 2000 agricultural development cutting forest and shrubs farming on hilly lands grazing irrigation and economic reformation causing repaid population growth greatly increased soil erosion zhang et al 2008 wu et al 2012 this explains why the annual sediment discharge during this period is 1 6 times greater than that of 1955 1981 fig 2 after 2000 the long term policy driven grain for green project was implemented in this watershed which has led to increased precipitation retention and consequently the reduction of river sediment discharge tian et al 2016 fig 2 however the annual sediment discharge still exhibited an increasing trend over the entire experimental period in liujiang watershed fig 2 table 2 unlike in the liujiang watershed a significant decreasing trend for sediment discharge was detected in the hongshui watershed table 3 the mean sediment discharge decreased by approximately 98 between 1964 and 1991 and after the ld dam began operation 2006 2015 fig 3 the decrease in sediment discharge in the hongshui watershed was related to the fact that the large dams yd td and ld were constructed in this watershed dai et al 2008 wu et al 2012 this implies that dam construction could play a significant role in reducing sediment discharge in karst areas dam construction exerted substantial influence on the periodic pattern of sediment discharge the significant 4 year periodic oscillation was noted in the liujiang watershed fig 4a while no significant cycle was observed in the hongshui watershed fig 5a there were no large dams constructed in the liujiang watershed in fact there is only one the mashi dam which has a storage capacity of 0 3 km3 in this watershed dai et al 2008 wu et al 2012 although vegetation restoration was implemented in this region the effectiveness of vegetation cover in reducing soil erosion was greatly limited in karst regions discussed later the large dams in the hongshui watershed can trap large quantities of sediments and the sediment discharge has shown progressive decline zhang et al 2008 li et al 2016 which modified the periodicity in sediment discharge the significant periodic oscillation in sediment discharge is important for the management of river basins and the implementation of soil and water conservation measures the periodicity in annual water discharge might not be affected by dam construction since the significant 3 year periodic oscillation was observed in both the liujiang and hongshui watershed figs 4b and 5b in kart regions of southwest china the irregular networks of pores cracks fissures fractures and conduits of various sizes and forms exist and this 3 d hydrogeological network has a significant effect on water discharge dynamics wu et al 2017 generally most rain that falls on a hillslope drains quickly and recharges groundwater systems and it has been noted that surface runoff accounts for 5 of the rainfall which is far lower than that in a non karst watershed li et al 2017b only a single precipitation event greater than 60 mm or precipitation preceded by large antecedent rainfall events could produce surface runoff peng and wang 2012 fu et al 2016 in most cases precipitation drains quickly to recharge groundwater systems through numerous cracks and fissures and the runoff generation differs vastly depending on permeability wilcox et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 karst watersheds have poor storage capacity and thus the contribution of precipitation to runoff change was great some recent studies have shown that the evolution of annual water discharge is mainly influenced by annual precipitation while human activities e g dam construction have a negligible influence zhang and lu 2009 wu et al 2012 wu et al 2017 this is consistent with the findings of the current study which showed that dam construction generally did not change the periodic pattern of water discharge in a karst watershed the results of the coherence coefficients and global coherence coefficients between the annual sediment discharge and its associated factors figs 6 and 7 table 4 showed that water discharge was an important factor controlling annual sediment discharge in the karst watersheds moreover the significant area between sediment and water discharge was much greater than that of other three influencing factors in both liujiang and hongshui watersheds table s1 this also implied that water discharge exerted more substantial influence on sediment discharge than precipitation pet and ndvi in karst regions this result further corroborates a recent study that showed monthly sediment discharge was primarily controlled by water discharge using state space models li et al 2017c the significant region between sediment and water discharge was found in the whole period in liujiang watershed fig 6a while no significant region was observed in hongshui watershed after 2001 fig 7a the same phenomenon was also found between sediment discharge and precipitation figs 6b and 7b thus the occurrence of the large dams in hongshui watershed has changed the temporal covariance between sediment and water discharge in general the sediment discharge is closely related to water discharge or precipitation in the natural hydrologic regime miao et al 2010 wang et al 2016 li et al 2016 however the presence of the large dams has sharply decreased the sediment flux in the hongshui watershed this dam regulation disrupted the natural hydrologic regime and might obviously reduce the influence of the water discharge or precipitation on sediment discharge generally vegetation can reduce erosion by reinforcing the soil body to enhance the soil resistance to erosion knapen et al 2007 li et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 in non karst areas such as the loess plateau vegetation coverage has shown a significant increasing trend and thus has been noted to be the most important factor affecting the intensity and frequency of soil erosion events even exceeding the influence of dam construction wang et al 2016 in karst areas significant correlations between sediment discharge and ndvi were only observed between 1992 1996 and 2008 2010 in the liujiang watershed while no significant regions were found in the hongshui watershed figs 6 and 7 this implies that the ndvi exerted a more substantial influence on sediment discharge in non karst areas e g the loess plateau than that in karst areas actually the original background values of ndvi for the current study area were considerably greater than that in the loess plateau ouyang et al 2010 no significant increasing trends for ndvi were detected in either the liujiang or the hongshui watershed furthermore conduits and sinkholes which lead to underground river systems have been found throughout karst watersheds jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017b most of the eroded sediment is transported from conduits or sinkholes to underground rivers which then flow into other watersheds or are stored in an underground karst environment and feed a surface river bai et al 2013 wu et al 2017 most sediment is lost through underground river and a relatively small amount of sediment is transported by overland flow due to this special geologic feature sediment reducing effects by vegetation are limited in karst watersheds additionally three large dams in the hongshui watershed effectively reduced sediment discharge and thus the dam construction could weaken or even mask the effectiveness of vegetation in reducing soil loss this further explains why significant regions were found in the liujiang watershed while no significant correlations between ndvi and sediment discharge was observed in the hongshui watershed this study has some limitations for example the present study did not present quantitative attribution of the effects of dams and vegetation on changes to sediment discharge rates further studies are needed to quantify the relative importance of the individual driving forces on sediment discharge 6 conclusions this study provides important information on the effect of dam construction on the multiscale variability of sediment discharge and its potential influencing factors in the karst watersheds of liujiang no large dams and hongshui dam controlled for the period of 1955 2015 in southwest china there were differences in the temporal variation in sediment discharge between the two watersheds the annual sediment discharge increased over time in the liujiang watershed while a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 in sediment discharge was detected in the hongshui watershed the variations in sediment discharge also showed inconstant frequencies for these two watersheds specifically sediment discharge exhibited significant power in the wavelet power spectrum at the 4 year period in the liujiang watershed however no significant temporal cycle in sediment discharge was observed in the hongshui watershed the multiscale influence of ndvi on sediment discharge was also greatly influenced by dam construction in the liujiang watershed although the effect of ndvi on sediment discharge was limited in karst areas significant regions were still detected between ndvi and sediment discharge dam construction could reduce or mask the effect of ndvi on sediment discharge and thus no significant correlation was found between ndvi and sediment discharge in the hongshui watershed the present study highlights the usefulness of wavelet analysis in revealing multiscale variability of sediment discharge and the results can provide valuable information on soil and water conservation in the karst

7441,a test using rhodamine wt and heat as tracers conducted over a 78 day period in a strongly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer was used to evaluate the utility of the combined observation dataset for aquifer characterization a highly parameterized model was inverted with concentration and temperature time series as calibration targets groundwater heads recorded during the experiment were boundary dependent and were ignored during the inversion process the inverted model produced a high resolution depiction of the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields statistical properties of these fields are in very good agreement with estimates from previous studies at the site spatially distributed sensitivity analysis suggests that both solute and heat transport were most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields and less sensitive to dispersivity and thermal distribution factor with sensitivity to porosity greatly reducing outside the monitored area the issues of model over parameterization and non uniqueness are addressed through identifiability analysis longitudinal dispersivity and thermal distribution factor are highly identifiable however spatially distributed parameters are only identifiable near the injection point temperature related density effects became observable for both heat and solute as the temperature anomaly increased above 12 degrees centigrade and affected down gradient propagation finally we demonstrate that high frequency and spatially dense temperature data cannot inform a dual porosity model in the absence of frequent solute concentration measurements keywords thermal and solute tracer test inverse modeling identifiability dual domain model 1 introduction alluvial gravel aquifers are inherently heterogeneous as a consequence of their complex sedimentary architecture which has significant implications for reliable predictive contaminant transport modelling required for successful water resource management decision making tracer tests can provide valuable information on groundwater flow velocities and improve quantitative contaminant movement predictions large scale field studies conducted at heavily monitored and well known field sites have provided valuable insights in understanding complex transport processes these sites include borden ontario canada mackay et al 1986 mobile alabama molz et al 1986 twin lake minnesota killey and moltyaner 1988 cape cod massachusetts leblanc et al 1991 and columbus mississippi boggs et al 1992 a solute tracer test however can be very expensive to conduct as sampling and analysis costs generally limit the horizontal vertical and time density that would be typically desired for detailed analysis over the last 60 years heat has been recognized as a potential natural tracer of groundwater flow suzuki 1960 bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 temperature readings can be easily and inexpensively obtained in the form of almost continuous time series providing invaluable data for understanding the groundwater movement using heat as a tracer has the additional advantage that no artificial compounds are introduced in the groundwater environment making regulatory permissions easier to obtain using temperature profiles beneath streams was identified as a method for the quantification of groundwater surface water interaction lapham 1989 conant 2004 schmidt et al 2006 constantz 2008 vogt et al 2010 nützmann et al 2014 while geothermal profiles have been used extensively to quantify vertical and horizontal flows on a regional scale bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 anderson 2005 irvine et al 2016 injection of heated water has been used in several experimental sites to examine the applicability of aquifer thermal systems and recovery efficiencies molz et al 1983 palmer et al 1992 xue et al 1990 molson et al 1992 sauty et al 1982 ambient temperature variations and thermal tracer tests have also been used to describe flow pathways in fractured and karst aquifers chatelier et al 2011 guihéneuf et al 2014 wagner et al 2014 klepikova et al 2016 in many cases active heat tracer tests have been used to complement pump tests and in some cases solute tracer tests for the characterization of aquifer heterogeneity these studies attempt to relate temperature and solute concentrations to groundwater fluxes and hydraulic conductivities in one of the earliest applications bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 calculated vertical groundwater fluxes through the use of one dimensional heat transport equation while winslow 1962 related naturally occurring temperature anomalies with hydraulic conductivity zones woodbury and smith 1988 demonstrated how the joint inversion of hydrogeologic and thermal data can improve hydraulic conductivity estimates bravo et al 2002 coupled the groundwater flow and heat transport models to simultaneously estimate hydraulic conductivities and fluxes in a shallow aquifer macfarlane et al 2002 used temperature data from a field test where artificially heated water was injected and extracted at a nearby pumping well and quantitatively derived distinct hydraulic conductivity zones vandenbohede et al 2009 analyzed the simultaneous injection of chloride and heat in an aquifer of two push pull tests and concluded that solute dispersivity and thermal diffusivity can be successfully inferred from the coupled tests vandenbohede et al 2011 analyzed a shallow heat injection experiment and their sensitivity analysis indicated that the matrix thermal conductivity followed by porosity are the most sensitive modelling parameters giambastiani et al 2013 investigated the propagation of a heat plume in a large tank and concluded that when flow velocities are small heat transport becomes conduction dominated and insensitive to mechanical mixing and thermal dispersivities cannot be reliably estimated from temperature data ma et al 2012 injected bromide and heat in a highly permeable advection dominated aquifer and evaluated the utility of these tracers for aquifer characterization these authors developed a numerical flow and transport model and calibrated spatially distributed effective porosity horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity fields and uniform longitudinal aquifer dispersivity using heads and bromide concentrations as calibration targets and subsequently used the heat data for model validation they concluded that both heat and solute tracers can provide valuable insights for aquifer characterization but each tracer has limitations that introduce noise into the model schwede et al 2014 proposed a quasi linear geostatistical approach to simultaneously invert hydraulic head and thermal arrival times for estimating the aquifer hydraulic conductivity they demonstrated that thermal data can improve the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field and reduce the estimation uncertainty when combined with head data seibert et al 2014 studied the heat and chloride transport in a managed aquifer recharge site and concluded that in highly stratified units temperature observations can be greatly affected by neighboring permeability distributions in this study we examine the utility of heat as a tracer to complement the traditional application of a solute tracer rhodamine wt for aquifer characterization we interpret the experimental data collected from the simultaneous injection of a heated rhodamine wt rwt solution in a highly permeable heterogeneous gravel aquifer and we simultaneously invert the thermal and solute transport equations to characterize the aquifer heterogeneity in the inversion process we ignore head fluctuations as they are boundary dependent given the non uniqueness of the solution we attempt to qualitatively describe the spatial distribution of the estimated aquifer parameter uncertainty that stems from the inversion 2 tracer test experiment 2 1 field site the heat and solute tracing experiment was undertaken at esr s burnham experimental site located in a farm paddock up gradient of the burnham wastewater oxidation pond about 25 km southwest of christchurch new zealand fig 1 the aquifer sediments underlying the site consist of mainly sandy gravels with occasional sand and open framework gravel ofg lenses these lenses are often interconnected and create highly permeable preferential flow networks that can result in very high groundwater velocities the site has been used for a number of hydrological and contaminant tracer tests pang et al 1998 sinton et al 2000 pang et al 2005 as well as pumping and tracer tests dann et al 2008 tests of transport processes in heterogeneous aquifers pang and close 1999 and trials for new dye tracing techniques close et al 2002 in the experimental site there exist 23 wells with 100 mm internal diameter and a larger diameter pumping well not used in this study constructed at various times the injection well and observation wells are between 16 and 20 m deep and have slotted pvc well screens screen porosity approximately 20 from 12 m below ground through to the bottom of the well there are three observation wells w01 w02 and w03 located close to the injection well with the other wells situated in four arrays at approximately 20 40 65 and 90 m down gradient from the injection well shown in plan in fig 1 and in cross section in fig 2 2 2 tracer test setup the experiment involved injecting heated water combined with a conservative solute tracer rwt into the aquifer at a constant rate over a 15 day period from nov 22 2011 to dec 7 2011 groundwater temperatures and solution chemistry rwt tracer concentrations were monitored in 22 observation wells at the site for around 2 months after the injection commencement the experiment ended on the feb 8 2012 when groundwater temperatures had stabilized and returned close to background levels groundwater levels were at about 12 m below ground level at the start of the experiment these levels dropped consistently during the experiment most likely due to seasonal cycling and or irrigation abstraction in the surrounding area during the summer season groundwater levels were lowered by approximately 3 5 m throughout the site by the end of the experiment hydraulic gradients however remained generally unaffected by this regional water level decline fig 2 shows a schematic cross section of the burnham experimental site showing well installation details water levels at the start and end of the experiment and instrumentation depths during the experiment water supplied from the burnham military base was heated to 37 c using a califont fueled by lpg bottles that were replenished every 2 3 days ambient groundwater temperatures at the site were about 12 7 c before the experiment commencing and probably do not display much seasonal variation below the water table after the water was heated rwt tracer with a concentration of about 663 mg l was added to the injection water at a rate of 15 ml min using a peristaltic pump which gave a final design concentration being injected into the well of about 830 µg l in total about 345 l of rwt tracer solution was used during the injection period the injection solution was pumped into the injection well at a rate of about 12 l min for the 15 days of the injection on the fourth day of the experiment the lpg gas supply to the heater was temporarily interrupted for about two days during this time the injected water was not heated but the rwt tracer was continuously added in the injection solution the temperature in the injection well w0 and the 22 down gradient observation wells was monitored continuously throughout the experiment at 10 min intervals each well had between 1 and 3 temperature sensors installed at different levels in the screened interval table 1 summarizes installed monitoring instrumentation periodically initially daily and then at greater intervals towards the middle and end of the experiment throughout the experiment duration solution samples were collected for rwt analysis from selected observation wells using dedicated low flow blow suck samplers samples were taken approximately from the depth where the mid level temperature sensor was installed 3 numerical modelling 3 1 groundwater flow heat and solute tracer transport model setup a numerical model was setup to better understand the variable groundwater temperatures and rwt concentrations recorded in the heterogeneous aquifer steady state flow conditions have been assumed ignoring temporal variations these included transient flow conditions induced by the injection commencement and stopping that were considered to be minimal due to high aquifer permeability and the small injection rate and seasonal variations i e the generalized lowering of groundwater levels observed during the experiment the latter could have more significant effects especially if there were highly permeable flow paths near the water table that became inactive as groundwater levels declined flow gradients however remained unchanged during the experiment mclaughlin and townley 1996 and carrera et al 2005 concluded that sensitivity of head to hydraulic conductivity can be low especially in steady state conditions and when parameters are difficult to identify it is more efficient to introduce new kinds of information rather than more measurements of the same low sensitivity variable as a result in this study and considering the significant computational effort savings during model calibration more than 82 000 model runs were required for the inversion process all transient flow terms were ignored and head records were not included in the observations dataset flow in the unsaturated zone above the water table was also ignored the model area was 110 m long and 105 m wide aligned with the mean flow direction and discretized horizontally by a 1 m 1 m finite difference grid vertically five uniform thickness layers were incorporated sloping parallel to the average water table depth specific solute concentrations were not collected during the experiment and even though temperature data were collected at three levels in most observation bores the sensors were installed in the same screen at different depths and therefore it has been recognized that some noise is included into these readings as discussed later the five layers achieved a good balance between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency through the intensive model inversion process the fate and transport of contaminants in fickian three dimensional transient groundwater flow systems can be expressed as zheng and wang 1999 1 θ c t θ d c θ v i c q s c s r n where c is the dissolved solute concentration θ the dimensionless porosity of the subsurface medium d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor defined as the sum of the mechanical dispersion coefficient tensor and molecular diffusion coefficient vi is the linear pore water velocity defined as qi θ and relates the transport to the flow equation cs is the concentration of the source or sink fluxes and r n is the chemical reactions term used to include the effect of all biochemical and geochemical reactions various studies have investigated the transport properties of rwt runkel 2015 presented an extensive literature review of how the reactive properties of rwt are considered in hydrological applications the author concluded that there are significant inconsistencies with many researchers concluding that rwt is non conservative and subject to sorption sabatini and austin 1991 everts and kanwar 1994 jakovovic et al 2012 while others conclude that it is reasonably stable with low sorptive tendency wilson et al 1986 in an earlier test at the burnham experimental site pang et al 1998 compared multiple btcs for rwt and cl and concluded that in the absence of organic compounds rwt did not exhibit any reactive or sorption properties assuming that all chemical reactions can be described by a first order rate irreversible mass reduction eq 1 can be expressed as 2 θ c t θ d c θ v i c q s c s λ θ c where λ is the irreversible reduction rate constant the heat transport is mathematically equivalent to that of eq 1 kim et al 2005 prommer and stuyfzand 2005 thorne et al 2006 assuming thermal equilibrium between the aquifer and the groundwater zheng and wang 1999 ma and zheng 2010 and ignoring the groundwater density and viscosity dependency on temperature variations these effects are discussed later in the paper the equation that describes conductive and advective heat transport through a porous medium can be expressed as anderson 2005 3 1 1 θ θ ρ s c s ρ w c w θ t t θ θ κ w 1 θ κ s θ ρ w c w d t t q t t q st t s where t is the temperature cs and cw are the specific heat capacity of solid and fluid ρs and ρw are the solid and fluid densities κs and κw are the solid and fluid thermal conductivities dt is the mechanical heat dispersion coefficient qst is the heat source flow and ts is the source temperature defining the thermal distribution factor as 4 k dt c s ρ w c w and the numerical bulk thermal diffusivity as zheng and wang 1999 5 d mt κ 0 θ ρ w c w θ κ w 1 θ κ s θ ρ w c w eq 3 can be rewritten as 6 1 ρ b θ k dt θ t t θ d mt d t t q t t q st t s where ρ b is the bulk density of the rock matrix ρ b ρ s 1 θ the thermal distribution factor in 4 is a grouping parameter resulting from the analogy between solute and heat transport equations in solute transport the distribution coefficient kd is used in the presence of sorption and quantifies the solute retardation factor in heat transport energy is transported through both groundwater and the sediment matrix and the ratio of water to thermal front velocities is related to the volumetric heat capacities thus heat transport can also be regarded retarded but the process is fundamentally different from that of solute transport with sorption ma et al 2012 the numerical bulk thermal diffusivity defined in 5 is different from the bulk thermal diffusivity defined by de marsily 1986 as bulk thermal conductivity divided by volumetric heat capacity of the bulk dmt is merely the numerical reinterpretation of the solute molecular diffusion coefficient for heat transport that does not have a physical meaning 3 2 inverse model for parameter estimation the transport eqs 2 and 6 were solved simultaneously for groundwater flow temperature and rwt concentrations as in this work we are not addressing the comparative value of the two observation datasets the groundwater flow model was setup using modflow nwt harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 and the solute transport model using mt3dms v5 3 zheng and wang 1999 the highly parameterized model was calibrated using pest doherty 2003 with concentration and temperature time series as calibration targets i e recorded heads were not used appropriately weighted so that they have approximately equal contribution to the objective function pilot points were used for the parameterization of porosity horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity fields while the remaining transport parameters were assumed to be homogeneous the process results in estimated parameters having minimum error variance with respect to the current measurement dataset but does not account however for measurement or structural noise for further details regarding pest calibration and the use of pilot points the reader is referred to the pest manual and to doherty 2015 daily collected rwt concentrations and discrete temperature records at regular intervals were used as calibration targets the temperature records have not been adjusted for daily weather related fluctuations or longer term season related trends the experiment lasted for 2 5 months from late spring to mid summer but no apparent trend was observed in the two most distant wells w21 and w22 located approximately 90 m from the injection bore suggesting minimal interference from surface thermal signals molina giraldo et al 2011 coupling solute and heat transport with groundwater flow means that thermal transport parameters need to be estimated thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the aquifer material although variable appear to only vary over small ranges constantz 2008 and therefore do not introduce significant uncertainties in a model vandenbohede et al 2011 concluded that when aquifer heterogeneity is not considered heat propagation was most sensitive to the bulk thermal conductivity followed by the porosity values when however porosity heterogeneity is considered it is very difficult to distinguish between the effects of porosity and thermal conductivity as the thermal conduction term becomes spatially variable according to 5 due to numerical limitations our analysis ignores the inherent spatial structure of thermal diffusivity which has been assigned a constant value and as a result no conclusions can be drawn regarding the importance of thermal conductivities in this experiment as summarized by anderson 2005 there are contrasting views regarding the magnitude of thermal dispersivity de marsily 1986 concluded from a test site in france where solute and heat were injected simultaneously that thermal and solute dispersivities appeared to be of the same order and vandenbohede et al 2011 concluded that thermal dispersion cannot be ignored in heat transport models other authors however e g ingebritsen et al 2006 suggest that thermal dispersion can be considered negligible when compared to conduction and therefore thermal dispersivity should be set to zero while rau et al 2012 concluded that in homogeneous coarse sands thermal dispersion terms can be neglected when the thermal peclet number is less than 0 5 preliminary sensitivity analysis suggested that the burnham simulated temperatures are sensitive to longitudinal dispersivity multispecies simulation in mt3dms does not allow the use different dispersivity values for each simulated species and as a result in this study we consider dispersivity an aquifer property that is the same for solute and energy transport de marsily 1986 vandenbohede et al 2011 table 2 summarizes the flow and transport parameters used in the model the spatially distributed parameters have been calibrated using 1815 pilot points 605 pilot points for each parameter set out on a regular grid across the model area shown in fig 3 prior knowledge of site conditions obtained during past investigations has not been used for the model inversion site specific information can greatly assist the model inversion reduce computational time and improve modelled and observed data agreement they have been deliberately ignored in this study however in an effort to evaluate the usefulness of the solute and heat observation data alone unbiased from prior knowledge that may or may not exist in other sites as a result initial model parameters were assigned spatially uniform values obtained from the literature 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results the evolution of the thermal and rwt plumes is shown in figs 4 and 5 in these figures the dashed and solid lines represent recorded and simulated values respectively temperature breakthrough curves btc are plotted as temperature difference δt t t0 where t is the logged temperature and t0 the ambient groundwater temperature rwt btcs are plotted as normalized concentrations c c0 with c being the measured and c0 the diluted injection well concentration rwt sampling was obtained close to the screen mid point in each observation well for better visualization rwt btcs are superimposed to the temperature curves for the mid sensor in fig 5 as observed at other sites ma et al 2012 irvine et al 2015 vandenbohede et al 2009 there exists significant time lag between the thermal and solute breakthrough times fig 5 at the most distant wells with distinct thermal signal i e w13 this time lag is about 2 days suggesting a retarded heat transport mechanism breakthrough characteristics are also different for the two plumes with maximum concentrations recorded at different locations the maximum recorded temperature increase 2 m from the injection well was 21 c recorded on the 12th day of the experiment while signs of slow temperature decline were observed within an hour of the injection ceasing the thermal plume reached array 2 located approximately 37 m from the injection well while no distinguishable δt was observed at array 3 located 65 m down gradient of w0 in comparison the rwt plume reached the furthest array located 90 m from the source the rwt plume shows a more conservative advection dominated propagation with sharper concentration fronts faster recovery and less tailing characteristic of a single domain aquifer system while the plume was laterally dispersed peak concentrations were along a well known open framework pathway crossing the observation arrays 4 2 numerical results the numerical inversion process discussed in section 3 2 required 82 038 transient model runs simulated breakthrough curves are plotted in figs 4 and 5 as solid lines comparison between observed and modelled data generally shows a very good fit with normalized root mean square error 0 04 and 0 08 for temperature and rwt respectively in some instances the model under predicts temperatures at the early and or late recovery stages probably indicative of the influence of a slower transport zone the interruption of the heat supply that occurred on days four and five of the experiment were also accurately reproduced in most locations rwt modelled concentrations do not show any biased errors and the greater residual standard deviation is due to the inconsistent measurements obtained during the injection period in most monitoring locations these inconsistencies are typical of small variations in injection solution concentration in source diluted concentrations and measurement accuracy and errors the simulated heterogeneous horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh and effective porosity neff fields statistics are summarized in table 3 while the kh field is mapped in fig 6 horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges between 10 2 m d and 104 m d with mean and median values of 191 m d and 77 m d respectively these results are in agreement with the findings of dann et al 2008 who at the same site analyzed two pumping tests and estimated average large scale hydraulic conductivities between 68 m d and 105 m d but analysis of a series of tracer experiments suggested that preferential flow paths along ofg networks can have hydraulic conductivities ranging from 4 5 103 m d to 1 6 104 m d these authors estimated that the ofg networks comprise approximately 1 2 of the aquifer volume but can account for 98 of the total aquifer discharge the spatial distribution of large simulated kh values shown in fig 6 is also in agreement with the findings of previous studies at the site pang et al 1998 and dann et al 2008 analyzed the results of four tracer experiments to identify horizontal preferential flow paths the main flow line through the site was found to be curved and running approximately through w0 w05 w12 w17 w21 but with significant vertical variations pang et al 1998 this main path corresponds well with the high kh simulated values in layers 1 through 3 fig 6 but may not be completely interconnected and continuous as previously thought we need to point out that these interconnected ofg lenses are typically narrow 5 30 cm wide and smaller than the numerical grid dimensions used in this study therefore scale remains an issue when one tries to relate numerically inverted hydraulic conductivity values with these aquifer features to achieve this task further grid refinement and a denser network of pilot points would be required to completely characterize the ofg networks at the pilot point locations the variance of the log transformed horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity kv is 3 7 and 0 7 respectively indicative of a strongly heterogeneous environment in the horizontal direction sarris and paleologos 2004 in the stochastic subsurface literature a very common assumption is that of hydraulic conductivity log normality dagan 1989 gómez hernández and gorelick 1989 paleologos and sarris 2011 normal probability plots suggest that the calibrated lnkh field at pilot point locations exhibit a reasonably linear pattern in the center of the data the tails however show significant departures distribution fitting suggests that alternative distributions such as double exponential or logistic that are better suited for symmetrical long tailed data would provide a better fit than a normal distribution for the burnham aquifer and the same holds for the calibrated porosity field the assumption of log normality would tend to limit the representation of the very high conductivity values occurring within preferential flow paths along the ofg network the choice of distribution could have significant implications in the simulation of synthetic fields or when geostatistical methods are used for grid scaling under these conditions the effect of the more permeable outliers will be smoothed out which would significantly impact simulated contaminant transport the distribution of kh at the pilot point locations i e the calibrated but not interpolated values indicates that there exists one frequency peak at 60 m d and a secondary peak at 400 m d indicative of a bimodal distribution supporting the findings of dann et al 2008 regarding the effects of the ofg network such a model could be more appropriate to describe the statistical properties of similar strongly heterogeneous alluvial aquifers we also need to point out that no structural assumptions have been made at any stage of the inversion process and the properties discussed here are the result of the transport measurements obtained during this experiment and of the inversion process the calibrated flux variances are five orders of magnitude smaller than the variance of the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity field the variance of the linear pore water velocities however is three orders of magnitude larger than that of the fluxes but lower than the hydraulic conductivity variance a similar conclusion was reached by irvine et al 2015 these authors using data from well characterized sites analyzed the results of synthetic simulations and found that σ2 lnv can be one to two orders of magnitude lower than σ2 lnkh in burnham however and in the presence of the ofg networks pore water velocity variance is significantly larger and more comparable to that of hydraulic conductivity suggesting that these networks have significant implications for contaminant movement in the subsurface environment maximum simulated effective porosities exceeded physically realistic values approximately 1 of simulated grid values are greater than 0 5 a result of the interpolation between pilot point locations using an exponential variogram calibrated transport parameter values are summarized in table 4 from previous tracer experiments solute and microbial pang and close 1999 calculated longitudinal dispersivities from solute data at the burnham site using the non equilibrium analytical model of leij and toride 1997 assuming homogeneous conditions between the injection and each monitoring location estimated dispersivities ranged between 0 12 m and 9 71 m with a mean of 1 97 m in the current study calibrated longitudinal dispersivity from solute and heat data was 6 2 m while transverse dispersivity was 1 2 10 3 m indicative of very limited lateral spreading small transverse dispersion terms are expected in an open gravel framework setting where the lateral plume spreading is to a high degree controlled by the width of the framework and the conductivity contrast between framework and matrix calibrated vertical dispersivity was 6 10 5 m which is the lower bound allowed during the inversion vertical transverse dispersion terms were expected to be small and are not considered unreasonable but can also be indicative of low vertical measurement resolution for the reasons discussed earlier the peclet number pe indicates the ratio between advective and dispersive transport of the system for solute transport it is defined as 7 pe vl d where l is a characteristic length here the maximum plume travel distance 62 m for rwt and 30 m for heat in the rwt transport model developed for this study the peclet number is about 10 indicating advection dominated transport the peclet number for energy transport pe t is defined by as 8 pe t ρ w c w ql θ κ w 1 θ κ s and expresses the ratio of heat transfer by groundwater flow convection to heat transfer by conduction from the heat transport model developed for this study the peclet number for the modelled q values ranges between 90 and 2000 for the maximum modelled q suggesting a convection dominated system the calibrated rwt reduction rate that is used to quantify all irreversible mass reduction terms was quite small 4 2 10 4 d 1 the solute transport model mass balance indicates that only approximately 0 5 of the rwt mass that was injected in the aquifer reacted during the experiment confirming the findings of pang et al 1998 that in the burnham environment rwt can be considered a conservative tracer similarly when linear sorption was considered in the model calibrated distribution coefficient was of the order of 10 8 m3 kg suggesting negligible adsorption during the experiment 4 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis to characterize the impact that changes in model inputs have on predicted temperatures and rwt concentrations has also been undertaken the local perturbation analysis method was employed for the sensitivity analysis by computing the composite sensitivities csj k for parameter j with respect to observation group k as proposed by doherty 2015 9 cs j k j t qj jj 1 2 n k where j and q are the jacobian and observation weight matrices respectively and nk is the number of observations in group k composite sensitivities have been log transformed and normalized over their kh kv and neff range i e all pilot point locations according to 10 csn j k ln css j k min ln css p k max ln css p k min ln css p k where p denotes pilot point estimates of parameters kh kv and neff the spatially distributed parameter sensitivities of temperature and rwt concentrations calculated on the pilot point locations and interpolated on the model grid are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively table 5 summarizes the normalized composite sensitivities to all calibrated parameters towards each observation group the composite sensitivities to the 1820 model parameters have been calculated after 7281 model runs using the five point rule to construct parameter space jacobian matrix j in eq 9 the transport of both rwt and heat are mostly sensitive to aquifer hydraulic conductivity porosity and longitudinal dispersivity with small differences in the relative sensitivities between the two observation groups most notably temperature observations are more sensitive to vertical hydraulic conductivities than rwt concentrations this is expected as the solute concentrations do not provide vertical gradient information as they are collected in a single depth per well while temperature data provide the only source of information regarding the vertical flow tensors sensitivity of both solute and heat transport decreases for the spatially distributed parameters as the distance from observation points increases the decrease is quite smooth for hydraulic conductivity while sensitivity to porosity reduces quite rapidly towards the minimum values immediately outside the plume extent furthermore heat transport sensitivity to porosity down gradient is significantly smaller than that of rwt as the heat plume is retarded and does not extend to the furthermost observation wells the normalized composite sensitivity of both observation groups to αl is almost equal or even higher for heat to the maximum one of the kh field however considering that kh kv and neff are spatially distributed the contribution of each one of these property fields to observation sensitivity is greater than that of αl horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivities contribute less than αl to either dataset sensitivity with αt contribution being the same in the two datasets while αv has greater effect on temperature data heat observations are slightly more sensitive to kdt than to αl while solute concentrations are relatively insensitive to the mass reductions term indicative of a conservative transport process 4 4 parameter identifiability environmental simulation models are usually over parameterized with respect to the available calibration data making the calculation of the true model parameter values an unreasonable task it has been well documented in the literature that only a subset of environmental model parameters can be uniquely estimated using typical calibration data sets yeh 1986 beven and freer 2001 vrugt et al 2002 marcé et al 2008 and in this context the task should be concentrated on finding reasonable parameter estimates that describe the observed data adequately in complex usually non linear models these parameter estimates are non unique and identifiability analysis is used to obtain insight about parameter values brun et al 2001 there are several statistics defined in the literature quantifying parameter identifiability in this section we use the definition of doherty and hunt 2009 who express parameter identifiability as the normalized projection of its magnitude to the calibration solution space the identifiability of a parameter i is defined as 11 d i v 1 v 1 t ii i i t v 1 v 1 t i i where v 1 is a matrix whose columns are the orthogonal eigenvectors of the calibration solution space obtained according to moore and doherty 2005 and i i is a vector pertaining to parameter i it follows from 11 that di lies between zero indicating complete non identifiability of i from the current observation dataset and one indicating complete identifiability the latter however does not necessarily mean that the parameter estimate is without an error but rather that any error terms are associated solely with the current observation dataset noise doherty and hunt 2009 post calibration parameter identifiability has been calculated for all model calibrated parameters listed in table 2 for the spatially distributed kh kv and neff fields di has been calculated at the pilot point locations and interpolated on the model grid the resulting identifiability field is shown in fig 9 and ranges are summarized for all calibrated parameters in table 6 maximum d k h is 0 92 with a minimum of almost zero in the model areas not enclosed by observation points while average and median d k h over the 606 pilot point locations are 0 07 and 0 01 respectively similarly maximum d k v and d n eff are 0 70 and 0 82 respectively with most areas outside the observation regime having near zero values this suggests that the observation dataset provides enough information to estimate more accurately aquifer parameters at locations close and immediately down gradient of the source the combined solute and heat dataset provides more information for the description of kh than for any other distributed aquifer property in the areas outside the monitored regime the observed solute concentrations and groundwater temperature data provide little or no information regarding the aquifer properties and even though the calibrated model accurately reproduces the propagation of both plumes aquifer properties at the less identifiable locations should be considered more uncertain seibert et al 2014 showed that zoned hydraulic conductivity identifiabilities of a layered aquifer can range between 0 05 and 1 00 but most zones were estimated to have identifiabilities greater than 0 80 the uniform structure of the k field within each zone allowed the observation dataset to provide sufficient information for the characterization of the zoned properties which cannot be accomplished for spatially distributed parameters outside the monitored regime longitudinal dispersivity has identifiability d a l of almost one but both horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivities have very low identifiabilities 0 002 and 10 4 respectively as discussed earlier transverse dispersion terms are quite small and do not appear to contribute significantly to the propagation of either plume this results in the numerical model parameters not contributing significantly to the calibration dataset and as follows from 16 having low identifiability similarly rwt irreversible mass reduction terms are very small resulting in very small identifiability dλ 10 3 finally d k dt which is used for the quantification of the thermal exchange between solids and water has identifiability of almost one 0 998 suggesting that the observation dataset provides enough information for the accurate estimation of this parameter and any uncertainty regarding its true value mainly stems from dataset noise parameter identifiability has been calculated using the combined observation dataset it follows from the sensitivity analysis presented in the previous section that parameter identifiability could be lower if only one dataset was used for model calibration with the relative reduction being dependent on the sensitivity of the observation dataset to the parameter considering only the rwt concentrations for example would result in even lower identifiabilities of kv while using the temperature dataset alone would result in near zero identifiabilities down gradient of the first monitoring array 4 5 dual domain considerations solute transport in fractured or strongly heterogeneous aquifers as is the case in burnham can be described by three alternative conceptual models heinze and hamidi 2017 a by explicit representation of fractures or preferential paths if these are known in detail reeves et al 2008 b by a classical macroscopic approach where physical properties are represented by their effective or volume averaged equivalents or c a dual porosity model where two overlapping and interconnected domains one highly mobile and one relatively immobile contribute to the transport process gerke and van genuchten 1993 the first approach can result in a discontinuous model domain while fractures or preferential path distribution are not commonly known in detail resulting in implementation difficulties lichtner 2013 the second approach is easier to implement with geostatistical characterization of the spatially distributed properties however that implies that the transition between the very permeable to the less permeable zones is smooth and continuous resulting in a straight forward numerical formulation but not necessarily in a realistic representation of the physical problem the third approach can be regarded as an extension to the macroscopic model without the need to explicitly define fractures or preferential flow paths the use of the dual domain approach has been successfully implemented for solute transport ray et al 1997 di donato and blunt 2004 porta et al 2013 while heat transport models can also benefit from the consideration of a fast transport domain gelet et al 2012 hao et al 2013 the applicability of a dual domain solute transport model to better describe the different breakthrough characteristics of the two tracers has been tested by inverting the transport model after partitioning porosity θ as the sum of the mobile θm and immobile θim porosities then eq 2 for solute transport can be rewritten as 12 θ m c m t θ im c im t θ m d c m θ m v i c m q s c s λ m θ m c m λ im θ im c im and 13 θ im c im t ζ c m c ι m λ im θ im c im where the subscripts m and im denote mobile and immobile components respectively and ζ is the first order mass transfer rate between the two domains similar partitioning can be applied to eq 6 for the description of heat transport in the dual domain system we have assumed that the same partitioning applies for solute and energy transport the resulting dual domain model improved slightly the reproduction of the observed solute concentrations but agreement deteriorated for the thermal plume propagation despite the additional model complexity the introduction of additional degrees of freedom in the inversion process and the further reduction of parameter identifiability this suggests that the observation dataset does not provide enough information to inform a dual domain model in previous studies at this site using instantaneous injections of tracers and bacteria multiple breakthrough concentration peaks have been observed pang et al 1998 which have been attributed to mass contributions from variably mobile zones in the current experiment however such solute multiple peaks have not been explicitly observed in any observation point considering that flow conditions were similar during the two tests the daily solute sampling frequency combined with the 15 day long injection period are the most likely reasons for failing to identify these secondary peaks temperature data also did not indicate any secondary peaks due to the large thermal diffusion transport terms this suggests that heat as a tracer provides limited benefits for the development of dual porosity models in alluvial gravel aquifers that may need to rely more on high frequency solute measurements 4 6 density effects ignoring changes in groundwater density and viscosity allows decoupling the flow from the transport simulation increasing computational efficiency dramatically ma and zeng 2010 have studied extensively through a series of numerical experiments the conditions under which the effects of variable density and viscosity can be neglected without significant accuracy losses their results suggest that viscosity changes can be ignored for temperature changes of up to 30 c while fluid density changes may become important when temperature changes are above 15 c in the test site the maximum temperature increase in the injection well was 21 c so while viscosity effects should be negligible density effects could be more significant temperature increases of more than 12 c however were only detected in well w01 located 2 m from the injection well using the calibrated property fields we simulated the propagation of both plumes considering temperature dependent density effects the simulation was undertaken using seawat v4 langevin et al 2008 assuming a linear relationship between groundwater density and temperature fig 10 shows the comparison of simulated temperature 10a and solute 10b breakthrough curves at various locations the greatest density related discrepancy in simulated temperature peaks is of the order of 2 5 c and observed at the deep monitoring locations of wells 1 and 5 near the injection point simulated temperatures appear inconsistent when the temperature anomaly reaches 12 c this localized effect however changes the flow dynamics creating additional vertical flow gradients that affect the simulated plume propagation at distances even when the temperature anomaly is less than 5 c these effects are greater at the deeper parts of the aquifer and more observable at locations hydraulically connected to the source but in most occasions peak temperature discrepancies are less than 1 5 c density related effects are also observable to simulated solute concentrations these are greatly affected by the disruption of heat supply and the retarded arrival of the heat plume fig 10b maximum simulated discrepancies are of the order of 0 1 expressed in terms of δc c0 and near the injection point differences appear when temperature increases by approximately 12 c similarly to heat and as density effects alter the flow characteristics simulated solute concentrations are affected at smaller temperature anomalies as distance from the source increases i e 8 c in w02 and 4 c in w05 unlike heat however solute concentration discrepancies become negligible at the recovery stage when density related errors are compared with the other noise terms like background groundwater temperature or seasonal trends for long duration tests and considering the resulting overall uncertainty of system parameters discussed earlier these effects may not necessarily be significant density related effects however are biased particularly with depth and therefore should be accounted for whenever possible 5 conclusions over a 78 day period a test using rhodamine wt and heat tracers was conducted and the combined observation dataset was used for aquifer characterization data were collected at 22 monitoring wells organized in four transects and provided a very good description of the solute and heat plumes the heat plume however did not reach the two furthest arrays located approximately 60 m and 95 m from the injection point spatially distributed aquifer properties have been obtained through simultaneous inversion of the flow solute and heat transport models the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the combined observation dataset allowed the development of a high resolution description of aquifer heterogeneity the simulated horizontal hydraulic conductivity statistics are in great agreement with the results of previous analytical work at the site that relied on numerous site tests the resulting hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields successfully describe the simultaneous movement of the solute and heat plumes during the 2 5 months of the experiment at the numerical grid scale 2 both heat and solute measurement sensitivities were dominated by the spatially distributed properties most controlling parameter was horizontal hydraulic conductivity followed by vertical hydraulic conductivity and porosity as expected the spatial distribution of sensitivities suggests that they decrease as the distance from observation points increases this is particularly true for porosity and to a smaller degree for the sensitivity of solute concentrations to vertical hydraulic conductivity temperature change was less sensitive to the thermal distribution factor while solute concentrations and temperature change had similar sensitivities to longitudinal dispersivity the assumption of spatially distributed porosity makes addressing the effect of porosity to the bulk thermal conductivity very difficult and therefore no conclusions can be drawn for the importance of the aquifer solids thermal conductivity from our study 3 spatially distributed parameters remain to a large degree non unique identifiability analysis was used to qualitatively describe how confident one can be with regards to the yielded aquifer property values the analysis suggests that longitudinal dispersivity and thermal distribution factor are completely identifiable by the combined observation dataset horizontal hydraulic conductivity has also high identifiability along the plume center of mass and relatively close to the injection point suggesting that only in these areas one can be relatively confident for the estimated values 4 the injection temperature resulted in some temperature related density effects these effects were not considered in the model inversion process but their post calibration effects were demonstrated by comparing the simulated heat and solute concentrations with and without groundwater density corrections discrepancies for both tracers started developing near the injection well when simulated temperature increase approached 12 c as the flow dynamics near the injection point are affected by high groundwater temperatures density related effects propagate down gradient and can be measurable even when the temperature anomalies are less than 5 c these effects are greater at the deeper parts of the aquifer and more observable at locations hydraulically connected to the source even though these discrepancies may be small compared to other uncertainties density related effects should be accounted for when computationally possible 5 finally high frequency and spatially dense temperature data did not provide enough information to inform a dual domain conceptual model even when heat transport is convection dominated in highly permeable fast flowing aquifers development of a dual porosity model will need to be based on high frequency and potentially

7441,a test using rhodamine wt and heat as tracers conducted over a 78 day period in a strongly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer was used to evaluate the utility of the combined observation dataset for aquifer characterization a highly parameterized model was inverted with concentration and temperature time series as calibration targets groundwater heads recorded during the experiment were boundary dependent and were ignored during the inversion process the inverted model produced a high resolution depiction of the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields statistical properties of these fields are in very good agreement with estimates from previous studies at the site spatially distributed sensitivity analysis suggests that both solute and heat transport were most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields and less sensitive to dispersivity and thermal distribution factor with sensitivity to porosity greatly reducing outside the monitored area the issues of model over parameterization and non uniqueness are addressed through identifiability analysis longitudinal dispersivity and thermal distribution factor are highly identifiable however spatially distributed parameters are only identifiable near the injection point temperature related density effects became observable for both heat and solute as the temperature anomaly increased above 12 degrees centigrade and affected down gradient propagation finally we demonstrate that high frequency and spatially dense temperature data cannot inform a dual porosity model in the absence of frequent solute concentration measurements keywords thermal and solute tracer test inverse modeling identifiability dual domain model 1 introduction alluvial gravel aquifers are inherently heterogeneous as a consequence of their complex sedimentary architecture which has significant implications for reliable predictive contaminant transport modelling required for successful water resource management decision making tracer tests can provide valuable information on groundwater flow velocities and improve quantitative contaminant movement predictions large scale field studies conducted at heavily monitored and well known field sites have provided valuable insights in understanding complex transport processes these sites include borden ontario canada mackay et al 1986 mobile alabama molz et al 1986 twin lake minnesota killey and moltyaner 1988 cape cod massachusetts leblanc et al 1991 and columbus mississippi boggs et al 1992 a solute tracer test however can be very expensive to conduct as sampling and analysis costs generally limit the horizontal vertical and time density that would be typically desired for detailed analysis over the last 60 years heat has been recognized as a potential natural tracer of groundwater flow suzuki 1960 bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 temperature readings can be easily and inexpensively obtained in the form of almost continuous time series providing invaluable data for understanding the groundwater movement using heat as a tracer has the additional advantage that no artificial compounds are introduced in the groundwater environment making regulatory permissions easier to obtain using temperature profiles beneath streams was identified as a method for the quantification of groundwater surface water interaction lapham 1989 conant 2004 schmidt et al 2006 constantz 2008 vogt et al 2010 nützmann et al 2014 while geothermal profiles have been used extensively to quantify vertical and horizontal flows on a regional scale bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 anderson 2005 irvine et al 2016 injection of heated water has been used in several experimental sites to examine the applicability of aquifer thermal systems and recovery efficiencies molz et al 1983 palmer et al 1992 xue et al 1990 molson et al 1992 sauty et al 1982 ambient temperature variations and thermal tracer tests have also been used to describe flow pathways in fractured and karst aquifers chatelier et al 2011 guihéneuf et al 2014 wagner et al 2014 klepikova et al 2016 in many cases active heat tracer tests have been used to complement pump tests and in some cases solute tracer tests for the characterization of aquifer heterogeneity these studies attempt to relate temperature and solute concentrations to groundwater fluxes and hydraulic conductivities in one of the earliest applications bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 calculated vertical groundwater fluxes through the use of one dimensional heat transport equation while winslow 1962 related naturally occurring temperature anomalies with hydraulic conductivity zones woodbury and smith 1988 demonstrated how the joint inversion of hydrogeologic and thermal data can improve hydraulic conductivity estimates bravo et al 2002 coupled the groundwater flow and heat transport models to simultaneously estimate hydraulic conductivities and fluxes in a shallow aquifer macfarlane et al 2002 used temperature data from a field test where artificially heated water was injected and extracted at a nearby pumping well and quantitatively derived distinct hydraulic conductivity zones vandenbohede et al 2009 analyzed the simultaneous injection of chloride and heat in an aquifer of two push pull tests and concluded that solute dispersivity and thermal diffusivity can be successfully inferred from the coupled tests vandenbohede et al 2011 analyzed a shallow heat injection experiment and their sensitivity analysis indicated that the matrix thermal conductivity followed by porosity are the most sensitive modelling parameters giambastiani et al 2013 investigated the propagation of a heat plume in a large tank and concluded that when flow velocities are small heat transport becomes conduction dominated and insensitive to mechanical mixing and thermal dispersivities cannot be reliably estimated from temperature data ma et al 2012 injected bromide and heat in a highly permeable advection dominated aquifer and evaluated the utility of these tracers for aquifer characterization these authors developed a numerical flow and transport model and calibrated spatially distributed effective porosity horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity fields and uniform longitudinal aquifer dispersivity using heads and bromide concentrations as calibration targets and subsequently used the heat data for model validation they concluded that both heat and solute tracers can provide valuable insights for aquifer characterization but each tracer has limitations that introduce noise into the model schwede et al 2014 proposed a quasi linear geostatistical approach to simultaneously invert hydraulic head and thermal arrival times for estimating the aquifer hydraulic conductivity they demonstrated that thermal data can improve the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field and reduce the estimation uncertainty when combined with head data seibert et al 2014 studied the heat and chloride transport in a managed aquifer recharge site and concluded that in highly stratified units temperature observations can be greatly affected by neighboring permeability distributions in this study we examine the utility of heat as a tracer to complement the traditional application of a solute tracer rhodamine wt for aquifer characterization we interpret the experimental data collected from the simultaneous injection of a heated rhodamine wt rwt solution in a highly permeable heterogeneous gravel aquifer and we simultaneously invert the thermal and solute transport equations to characterize the aquifer heterogeneity in the inversion process we ignore head fluctuations as they are boundary dependent given the non uniqueness of the solution we attempt to qualitatively describe the spatial distribution of the estimated aquifer parameter uncertainty that stems from the inversion 2 tracer test experiment 2 1 field site the heat and solute tracing experiment was undertaken at esr s burnham experimental site located in a farm paddock up gradient of the burnham wastewater oxidation pond about 25 km southwest of christchurch new zealand fig 1 the aquifer sediments underlying the site consist of mainly sandy gravels with occasional sand and open framework gravel ofg lenses these lenses are often interconnected and create highly permeable preferential flow networks that can result in very high groundwater velocities the site has been used for a number of hydrological and contaminant tracer tests pang et al 1998 sinton et al 2000 pang et al 2005 as well as pumping and tracer tests dann et al 2008 tests of transport processes in heterogeneous aquifers pang and close 1999 and trials for new dye tracing techniques close et al 2002 in the experimental site there exist 23 wells with 100 mm internal diameter and a larger diameter pumping well not used in this study constructed at various times the injection well and observation wells are between 16 and 20 m deep and have slotted pvc well screens screen porosity approximately 20 from 12 m below ground through to the bottom of the well there are three observation wells w01 w02 and w03 located close to the injection well with the other wells situated in four arrays at approximately 20 40 65 and 90 m down gradient from the injection well shown in plan in fig 1 and in cross section in fig 2 2 2 tracer test setup the experiment involved injecting heated water combined with a conservative solute tracer rwt into the aquifer at a constant rate over a 15 day period from nov 22 2011 to dec 7 2011 groundwater temperatures and solution chemistry rwt tracer concentrations were monitored in 22 observation wells at the site for around 2 months after the injection commencement the experiment ended on the feb 8 2012 when groundwater temperatures had stabilized and returned close to background levels groundwater levels were at about 12 m below ground level at the start of the experiment these levels dropped consistently during the experiment most likely due to seasonal cycling and or irrigation abstraction in the surrounding area during the summer season groundwater levels were lowered by approximately 3 5 m throughout the site by the end of the experiment hydraulic gradients however remained generally unaffected by this regional water level decline fig 2 shows a schematic cross section of the burnham experimental site showing well installation details water levels at the start and end of the experiment and instrumentation depths during the experiment water supplied from the burnham military base was heated to 37 c using a califont fueled by lpg bottles that were replenished every 2 3 days ambient groundwater temperatures at the site were about 12 7 c before the experiment commencing and probably do not display much seasonal variation below the water table after the water was heated rwt tracer with a concentration of about 663 mg l was added to the injection water at a rate of 15 ml min using a peristaltic pump which gave a final design concentration being injected into the well of about 830 µg l in total about 345 l of rwt tracer solution was used during the injection period the injection solution was pumped into the injection well at a rate of about 12 l min for the 15 days of the injection on the fourth day of the experiment the lpg gas supply to the heater was temporarily interrupted for about two days during this time the injected water was not heated but the rwt tracer was continuously added in the injection solution the temperature in the injection well w0 and the 22 down gradient observation wells was monitored continuously throughout the experiment at 10 min intervals each well had between 1 and 3 temperature sensors installed at different levels in the screened interval table 1 summarizes installed monitoring instrumentation periodically initially daily and then at greater intervals towards the middle and end of the experiment throughout the experiment duration solution samples were collected for rwt analysis from selected observation wells using dedicated low flow blow suck samplers samples were taken approximately from the depth where the mid level temperature sensor was installed 3 numerical modelling 3 1 groundwater flow heat and solute tracer transport model setup a numerical model was setup to better understand the variable groundwater temperatures and rwt concentrations recorded in the heterogeneous aquifer steady state flow conditions have been assumed ignoring temporal variations these included transient flow conditions induced by the injection commencement and stopping that were considered to be minimal due to high aquifer permeability and the small injection rate and seasonal variations i e the generalized lowering of groundwater levels observed during the experiment the latter could have more significant effects especially if there were highly permeable flow paths near the water table that became inactive as groundwater levels declined flow gradients however remained unchanged during the experiment mclaughlin and townley 1996 and carrera et al 2005 concluded that sensitivity of head to hydraulic conductivity can be low especially in steady state conditions and when parameters are difficult to identify it is more efficient to introduce new kinds of information rather than more measurements of the same low sensitivity variable as a result in this study and considering the significant computational effort savings during model calibration more than 82 000 model runs were required for the inversion process all transient flow terms were ignored and head records were not included in the observations dataset flow in the unsaturated zone above the water table was also ignored the model area was 110 m long and 105 m wide aligned with the mean flow direction and discretized horizontally by a 1 m 1 m finite difference grid vertically five uniform thickness layers were incorporated sloping parallel to the average water table depth specific solute concentrations were not collected during the experiment and even though temperature data were collected at three levels in most observation bores the sensors were installed in the same screen at different depths and therefore it has been recognized that some noise is included into these readings as discussed later the five layers achieved a good balance between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency through the intensive model inversion process the fate and transport of contaminants in fickian three dimensional transient groundwater flow systems can be expressed as zheng and wang 1999 1 θ c t θ d c θ v i c q s c s r n where c is the dissolved solute concentration θ the dimensionless porosity of the subsurface medium d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor defined as the sum of the mechanical dispersion coefficient tensor and molecular diffusion

term used to include the effect of all biochemical and geochemical reactions various studies have investigated the transport properties of rwt runkel 2015 presented an extensive literature review of how the reactive properties of rwt are considered in hydrological applications the author concluded that there are significant inconsistencies with many researchers concluding that rwt is non conservative and subject to sorption sabatini and austin 1991 everts and kanwar 1994 jakovovic et al 2012 while others conclude that it is reasonably stable with low sorptive tendency wilson et al 1986 in an earlier test at the burnham experimental site pang et al 1998 compared multiple btcs for rwt and cl and concluded that in the absence of organic compounds rwt did not exhibit any reactive or sorption properties assuming that all chemical reactions can be described by a first order rate irreversible mass reduction eq 1 can be expressed as 2 θ c t θ d c θ v i c q s c s λ θ c where λ is the irreversible reduction rate constant the heat transport is mathematically equivalent to that of eq 1 kim et al 2005 prommer and stuyfzand 2005 thorne et al 2006 assuming thermal equilibrium between the aquifer and the groundwater zheng and wang 1999 ma and zheng 2010 and ignoring the groundwater density and viscosity dependency on temperature variations these effects are discussed later in the paper the equation that describes conductive and advective heat transport through a porous medium can be expressed as anderson 2005 3 1 1 θ θ ρ s c s ρ w c w θ t t θ θ κ w 1 θ κ s θ ρ w c w d t

distribution coefficient kd is used in the presence of sorption and quantifies the solute retardation factor in heat transport energy is transported through both groundwater and the sediment matrix and the ratio of water to thermal front velocities is related to the volumetric heat capacities thus heat transport can also be regarded retarded but the process is fundamentally different from that of solute transport with sorption ma et al 2012 the numerical bulk thermal diffusivity defined in 5 is different from the bulk thermal diffusivity defined by de marsily 1986 as bulk thermal conductivity divided by volumetric heat capacity of the bulk dmt is merely the numerical reinterpretation of the solute molecular diffusion coefficient for heat transport that does not have a physical meaning 3 2 inverse model for parameter estimation the transport eqs 2 and 6 were solved simultaneously for groundwater flow temperature and rwt concentrations as in this work we are not addressing the comparative value of the two observation datasets the groundwater flow model was setup using modflow nwt harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 and the solute transport model using mt3dms v5 3 zheng and wang 1999 the highly parameterized model was calibrated using pest doherty 2003 with concentration and temperature time series as calibration targets i e recorded heads were not used appropriately weighted so that they have approximately equal contribution to the objective function pilot points were used for the parameterization of porosity horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity fields while the remaining transport parameters were assumed to be homogeneous the process results in estimated parameters having minimum error variance with respect to the current measurement dataset but does not account however for measurement or structural noise for further details regarding pest calibration and the use of pilot points the reader is referred to the pest manual and to doherty 2015 daily collected rwt concentrations and discrete temperature records at regular intervals were used as calibration targets the temperature records have not been adjusted for daily weather related fluctuations or longer term season related trends the experiment lasted for 2 5 months from late spring to mid summer but no apparent trend was observed in the two most distant wells w21 and w22 located approximately 90 m from the injection bore suggesting minimal interference from surface thermal signals molina giraldo et al 2011 coupling solute and heat transport with groundwater flow means that thermal transport parameters need to be estimated thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the aquifer material although variable appear to only vary over small ranges constantz 2008 and therefore do not introduce significant uncertainties in a model vandenbohede et al 2011 concluded that when aquifer heterogeneity is not considered heat propagation was most sensitive to the bulk thermal conductivity followed by the porosity values when however porosity heterogeneity is considered it is very difficult to distinguish between the effects of porosity and thermal conductivity as the thermal conduction term becomes spatially variable according to 5 due to numerical limitations our analysis ignores the inherent spatial structure of thermal diffusivity which has been assigned a constant value and as a result no conclusions can be drawn regarding the importance of thermal conductivities in this experiment as summarized by anderson 2005 there are contrasting views regarding the magnitude of thermal dispersivity de marsily 1986 concluded from a test site in france where solute and heat were injected simultaneously that thermal and solute dispersivities appeared to be of the same order and vandenbohede et al 2011 concluded that thermal dispersion cannot be ignored in heat transport models other authors however e g ingebritsen et al 2006 suggest that thermal dispersion can be considered negligible when compared to conduction and therefore thermal dispersivity should be set to zero while rau et al 2012 concluded that in homogeneous coarse sands thermal dispersion terms can be neglected when the thermal peclet number is less than 0 5 preliminary sensitivity analysis suggested that the burnham simulated temperatures are sensitive to longitudinal dispersivity multispecies simulation in mt3dms does not allow the use different dispersivity values for each simulated species and as a result in this study we consider dispersivity an aquifer property that is the same for solute and energy transport de marsily 1986 vandenbohede et al 2011 table 2 summarizes the flow and transport parameters used in the model the spatially distributed parameters have been calibrated using 1815 pilot points 605 pilot points for each parameter set out on a regular grid across the model area shown in fig 3 prior knowledge of site conditions obtained during past investigations has not been used for the model inversion site specific information can greatly assist the model inversion reduce computational time and improve modelled and observed data agreement they have been deliberately ignored in this study however in an effort to evaluate the usefulness of the solute and heat observation data alone unbiased from prior knowledge that may or may not exist in other sites as a result initial model parameters were assigned spatially uniform values obtained from the literature 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results the evolution of the thermal and rwt plumes is shown in figs 4 and 5 in these figures the dashed and solid lines represent recorded and simulated values respectively temperature breakthrough curves btc are plotted as temperature difference δt t t0 where t is the logged temperature and t0 the ambient groundwater temperature rwt btcs are plotted as normalized concentrations c c0 with c being the measured and c0 the diluted injection well concentration rwt sampling was obtained close to the screen mid point in each observation well for better visualization rwt btcs are superimposed to the temperature curves for the mid sensor in fig 5 as observed at other sites ma et al 2012 irvine et al 2015 vandenbohede et al 2009 there exists significant time lag between the thermal and solute breakthrough times fig 5 at the most distant wells with distinct thermal signal i e w13 this time lag is about 2 days suggesting a retarded heat transport mechanism breakthrough characteristics are also different for the two plumes with maximum concentrations recorded at different locations the maximum recorded temperature increase 2 m from the injection well was 21 c recorded on the 12th day of the experiment while signs of slow temperature decline were observed within an hour of the injection ceasing the thermal plume reached array 2 located approximately 37 m from the injection well while no distinguishable δt was observed at array 3 located 65 m down gradient of w0 in comparison the rwt plume reached the furthest array located 90 m from the source the rwt plume shows a more conservative advection dominated propagation with sharper concentration fronts faster recovery and less tailing characteristic of a single domain aquifer system while the plume was laterally dispersed peak concentrations were along a well known open framework pathway crossing the observation arrays 4 2 numerical results the numerical inversion process discussed in section 3 2 required 82 038 transient model runs simulated breakthrough curves are plotted in figs 4 and 5 as solid lines comparison between observed and modelled data generally shows a very good fit with normalized root mean square error 0 04 and 0 08 for temperature and rwt respectively in some instances the model under predicts temperatures at the early and or late recovery stages probably indicative of the influence of a slower transport zone the interruption of the heat supply that occurred on days four and five of the experiment were also accurately reproduced in most locations rwt modelled concentrations do not show any biased errors and the greater residual standard deviation is due to the inconsistent measurements obtained during the injection period in most monitoring locations these inconsistencies are typical of small variations in injection solution concentration in source diluted concentrations and measurement accuracy and errors the simulated heterogeneous horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh and effective porosity neff fields statistics are summarized in table 3 while the kh field is mapped in fig 6 horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges between 10 2 m d and 104 m d with mean and median values of 191 m d and 77 m d respectively these results are in agreement with the findings of dann et al 2008 who at the same site analyzed two pumping tests and estimated average large scale hydraulic conductivities between 68 m d and 105 m d but analysis of a series of tracer experiments suggested that preferential flow paths along ofg networks can have hydraulic conductivities ranging from 4 5 103 m d to 1 6 104 m d these authors estimated that the ofg networks comprise approximately 1 2 of the aquifer volume but can account for 98 of the total aquifer discharge the spatial distribution of large simulated kh values shown in fig 6 is also in agreement with the findings of previous studies at the site pang et al 1998 and dann et al 2008 analyzed the results of four tracer experiments to identify horizontal preferential flow paths the main flow line through the site was found to be curved and running approximately through w0 w05 w12 w17 w21 but with significant vertical variations pang et al 1998 this main path corresponds well with the high kh simulated values in layers 1 through 3 fig 6 but may not be completely interconnected and continuous as previously thought we need to point out that these interconnected ofg lenses are typically narrow 5 30 cm wide and smaller than the numerical grid dimensions used in this study therefore scale remains an issue when one tries to relate numerically inverted hydraulic conductivity values with these aquifer features to achieve this task further grid refinement and a denser network of pilot points would be required to completely characterize the ofg networks at the pilot point locations the variance of the log transformed horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity kv is 3 7 and 0 7 respectively indicative of a strongly heterogeneous environment in the horizontal direction sarris and paleologos 2004 in the stochastic subsurface literature a very common assumption is that of hydraulic conductivity log normality dagan 1989 gómez hernández and gorelick 1989 paleologos and sarris 2011 normal probability plots suggest that the calibrated lnkh field at pilot point locations exhibit a reasonably linear pattern in the center of the data the tails however show significant departures distribution fitting suggests that alternative distributions such as double exponential or logistic that are better suited for symmetrical long tailed data would provide a better fit than a normal distribution for the burnham aquifer and the same holds for the calibrated porosity field the assumption of log normality would tend to limit the representation of the very high conductivity values occurring within preferential flow paths along the ofg network the choice of distribution could have significant implications in the simulation of synthetic fields or when geostatistical methods are used for grid scaling under these conditions the effect of the more permeable outliers will be smoothed out which would significantly impact simulated contaminant transport the distribution of kh at the pilot point locations i e the calibrated but not interpolated values indicates that there exists one frequency peak at 60 m d and a secondary peak at 400 m d indicative of a bimodal distribution supporting the findings of dann et al 2008 regarding the effects of the ofg network such a model could be more appropriate to describe the statistical properties of similar strongly heterogeneous alluvial aquifers we also need to point out that no structural assumptions have been made at any stage of the inversion process and the properties discussed here are the result of the transport measurements obtained during this experiment and of the inversion process the calibrated flux variances are five orders of magnitude smaller than the variance of the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity field the variance of the linear pore water velocities however is three orders of magnitude larger than that of the fluxes but lower than the hydraulic conductivity variance a similar conclusion was reached by irvine et al 2015 these authors using data from well characterized sites analyzed the results of synthetic simulations and found that σ2 lnv can be one to two orders of magnitude lower than σ2 lnkh in burnham however and in the presence of the ofg networks pore water velocity variance is significantly larger and more comparable to that of hydraulic conductivity suggesting that these networks have significant implications for contaminant movement in the subsurface environment maximum simulated effective porosities exceeded physically realistic values approximately 1 of simulated grid values are greater than 0 5 a result of the interpolation between pilot point locations using an exponential variogram calibrated transport parameter values are summarized in table 4 from previous tracer experiments solute and microbial pang and close 1999 calculated longitudinal dispersivities from solute data at the burnham site using the non equilibrium analytical model of leij and toride 1997 assuming homogeneous conditions between the injection and each monitoring location estimated dispersivities ranged between 0 12 m and 9 71 m with a mean of 1 97 m in the current study calibrated longitudinal dispersivity from solute and heat data was 6 2 m while transverse dispersivity was 1 2 10 3 m indicative of very limited lateral spreading small transverse dispersion terms are expected in an open gravel framework setting where the lateral plume spreading is to a high degree controlled by the width of the framework and the conductivity contrast between framework and matrix calibrated vertical dispersivity was 6 10 5 m which is the lower bound allowed during the inversion vertical transverse dispersion terms were expected to be small and are not considered unreasonable but can also be indicative of low vertical measurement resolution for the reasons discussed earlier the peclet number pe indicates the ratio between advective and dispersive transport of the system for solute transport it is defined as 7 pe vl d where l is a characteristic length here the maximum plume travel distance 62 m for rwt and 30 m for heat in the rwt transport model developed for this study the peclet number is about 10 indicating advection dominated transport the peclet number for energy transport pe t is defined by as 8 pe t ρ w c w ql θ κ w 1 θ κ s and expresses the ratio of heat transfer by groundwater flow convection to heat transfer by conduction from the heat transport model developed for this study the peclet number for the modelled q values ranges between 90 and 2000 for the maximum modelled q suggesting a convection dominated system the calibrated rwt reduction rate that is used to quantify all irreversible mass reduction terms was quite small 4 2 10 4 d 1 the solute transport model mass balance indicates that only approximately 0 5 of the rwt mass that was injected in the aquifer reacted during the experiment confirming the findings of pang et al 1998 that in the burnham environment rwt can be considered a conservative tracer similarly when linear sorption was considered in the model calibrated distribution coefficient was of the order of 10 8 m3 kg suggesting negligible adsorption during the experiment 4 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis to characterize the impact that changes in model inputs have on predicted temperatures and rwt concentrations has also been undertaken the local perturbation analysis method was employed for the sensitivity analysis by computing the composite sensitivities csj k for parameter j with respect to observation group k as proposed by doherty 2015 9 cs j k j t qj jj 1 2 n k where j and q are the jacobian and observation weight matrices respectively and nk is the number of observations in group k composite sensitivities have been log transformed and normalized over their kh kv and neff range i e all pilot point locations according to 10 csn j k ln css j k min ln css p k max ln css p k min ln css p k where p denotes pilot point estimates of parameters kh kv and neff the spatially distributed parameter sensitivities of temperature and rwt concentrations calculated on the pilot point locations and interpolated on the model grid are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively table 5 summarizes the normalized composite sensitivities to all calibrated parameters towards each observation group the composite sensitivities to the 1820 model parameters have been calculated after 7281 model runs using the five point rule to construct parameter space jacobian matrix j in eq 9 the transport of both rwt and heat are mostly sensitive to aquifer hydraulic conductivity porosity and longitudinal dispersivity with small differences in the relative sensitivities between the two observation groups most notably temperature observations are more sensitive to vertical hydraulic conductivities than rwt concentrations this is expected as the solute concentrations do not provide vertical gradient information as they are collected in a single depth per well while temperature data provide the only source of information regarding the vertical flow tensors sensitivity of both solute and heat transport decreases for the spatially distributed parameters as the distance from observation points increases the decrease is quite smooth for hydraulic conductivity while sensitivity to porosity reduces quite rapidly towards the minimum values immediately outside the plume extent furthermore heat transport sensitivity to porosity down gradient is significantly smaller than that of rwt as the heat plume is retarded and does not extend to the furthermost observation wells the normalized composite sensitivity of both observation groups to αl is almost equal or even higher for heat to the maximum one of the kh field however considering that kh kv and neff are spatially distributed the contribution of each one of these property fields to observation sensitivity is greater than that of αl horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivities contribute less than αl to either dataset sensitivity with αt contribution being the same in the two datasets while αv has greater effect on temperature data heat observations are slightly more sensitive to kdt than to αl while solute concentrations are relatively insensitive to the mass reductions term indicative of a conservative transport process 4 4 parameter identifiability environmental simulation models are usually over parameterized with respect to the available calibration data making the calculation of the true model parameter values an unreasonable task it has been well documented in the literature that only a subset of environmental model parameters can be uniquely estimated using typical calibration data sets yeh 1986 beven and freer 2001 vrugt et al 2002 marcé et al 2008 and in this context the task should be concentrated on finding reasonable parameter estimates that describe the observed data adequately in complex usually non linear models these parameter estimates are non unique and identifiability analysis is used to obtain insight about parameter values brun et al 2001 there are several statistics defined in the literature quantifying parameter identifiability in this section we use the definition of doherty and hunt 2009 who express parameter identifiability as the normalized projection of its magnitude to the calibration solution space the identifiability of a parameter i is defined as 11 d i v 1 v 1 t ii i i t v 1 v 1 t i i where v 1 is a matrix whose columns are the orthogonal eigenvectors of the calibration solution space obtained according to moore and doherty 2005 and i i is a vector pertaining to parameter i it follows from 11 that di lies between zero indicating complete non identifiability of i from the current observation dataset and one indicating complete identifiability the latter however does not necessarily mean that the parameter estimate is without an error but rather that any error terms are associated solely with the current observation dataset noise doherty and hunt 2009 post calibration parameter identifiability has been calculated for all model calibrated parameters listed in table 2 for the spatially distributed kh kv and neff fields di has been calculated at the pilot point locations and interpolated on the model grid the resulting identifiability field is shown in fig 9 and ranges are summarized for all calibrated parameters in table 6 maximum d k h is 0 92 with a minimum of almost zero in the model areas not enclosed by observation points while average and median d k h over the 606 pilot point locations are 0 07 and 0 01 respectively similarly maximum d k v and d n eff are 0 70 and 0 82 respectively with most areas outside the observation regime having near zero values this suggests that the observation dataset provides enough information to estimate more accurately aquifer parameters at locations close and immediately down gradient of the source the combined solute and heat dataset provides more information for the description of kh than for any other distributed aquifer property in the areas outside the monitored regime the observed solute concentrations and groundwater temperature data provide little or no information regarding the aquifer properties and even though the calibrated model accurately reproduces the propagation of both plumes aquifer properties at the less identifiable locations should be considered more uncertain seibert et al 2014 showed that zoned hydraulic conductivity identifiabilities of a layered aquifer can range between 0 05 and 1 00 but most zones were estimated to have identifiabilities greater than 0 80 the uniform structure of the k field within each zone allowed the observation dataset to provide sufficient information for the characterization of the zoned properties which cannot be accomplished for spatially distributed parameters outside the monitored regime longitudinal dispersivity has identifiability d a l of almost one but both horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivities have very low identifiabilities 0 002 and 10 4 respectively as discussed earlier transverse dispersion terms are quite small and do not appear to contribute significantly to the propagation of either plume this results in the numerical model parameters not contributing significantly to the calibration dataset and as follows from 16 having low identifiability similarly rwt irreversible mass reduction terms are very small resulting in very small identifiability dλ 10 3 finally d k dt which is used for the quantification of the thermal exchange between solids and water has identifiability of almost one 0 998 suggesting that the observation dataset provides enough information for the accurate estimation of this parameter and any uncertainty regarding its true value mainly stems from dataset noise parameter identifiability has been calculated using the combined observation dataset it follows from the sensitivity analysis presented in the previous section that parameter identifiability could be lower if only one dataset was used for model calibration with the relative reduction being dependent on the sensitivity of the observation dataset to the parameter considering only the rwt concentrations for example would result in even lower identifiabilities of kv while using the temperature dataset alone would result in near zero identifiabilities down gradient of the first monitoring array 4 5 dual domain considerations solute transport in fractured or strongly heterogeneous aquifers as is the case in burnham can be described by three alternative conceptual models heinze and hamidi 2017 a by explicit representation of fractures or preferential paths if these are known in detail reeves et al 2008 b by a classical macroscopic approach where physical properties are represented by their effective or volume averaged equivalents or c a dual porosity model where two overlapping and interconnected domains one highly mobile and one relatively immobile contribute to the transport process gerke and van genuchten 1993 the first approach can result in a discontinuous model domain while fractures or preferential path distribution are not commonly known in detail resulting in implementation difficulties lichtner 2013 the second approach is easier to implement with geostatistical characterization of the spatially distributed properties however that implies that the transition between the very permeable to the less permeable zones is smooth and continuous resulting in a straight forward numerical formulation but not necessarily in a realistic representation of the physical problem the third approach can be regarded as an extension to the macroscopic model without the need to explicitly define fractures or preferential flow paths the use of the dual domain approach has been successfully implemented for solute transport ray et al 1997 di donato and blunt 2004 porta et al 2013 while heat transport models can also benefit from the consideration of a fast transport domain gelet et al 2012 hao et al 2013 the applicability of a dual domain solute transport model to better describe the different breakthrough characteristics of the two tracers has been tested by inverting the transport model after partitioning porosity θ as the sum of the mobile θm and immobile θim porosities then eq 2 for solute transport can be rewritten as 12 θ m c m t θ im c im t θ m d c m θ m v i c m q s c s λ m θ m c m λ im θ im c im and 13 θ im c im t ζ c m c ι m λ im θ im c im where the subscripts m and im denote mobile and immobile components respectively and ζ is the first order mass transfer rate between the two domains similar partitioning can be applied to eq 6 for the description of heat transport in the dual domain system we have assumed that the same partitioning applies for solute and energy transport the resulting dual domain model improved slightly the reproduction of the observed solute concentrations but agreement deteriorated for the thermal plume propagation despite the additional model complexity the introduction of additional degrees of freedom in the inversion process and the further reduction of parameter identifiability this suggests that the observation dataset does not provide enough information to inform a dual domain model in previous studies at this site using instantaneous injections of tracers and bacteria multiple breakthrough concentration peaks have been observed pang et al 1998 which have been attributed to mass contributions from variably mobile zones in the current experiment however such solute multiple peaks have not been explicitly observed in any observation point considering that flow conditions were similar during the two tests the daily solute sampling frequency combined with the 15 day long injection period are the most likely reasons for failing to identify these secondary peaks temperature data also did not indicate any secondary peaks due to the large thermal diffusion transport terms this suggests that heat as a tracer provides limited benefits for the development of dual porosity models in alluvial gravel aquifers that may need to rely more on high frequency solute measurements 4 6 density effects ignoring changes in groundwater density and viscosity allows decoupling the flow from the transport simulation increasing computational efficiency dramatically ma and zeng 2010 have studied extensively through a series of numerical experiments the conditions under which the effects of variable density and viscosity can be neglected without significant accuracy losses their results suggest that viscosity changes can be ignored for temperature changes of up to 30 c while fluid density changes may become important when temperature changes are above 15 c in the test site the maximum temperature increase in the injection well was 21 c so while viscosity effects should be negligible density effects could be more significant temperature increases of more than 12 c however were only detected in well w01 located 2 m from the injection well using the calibrated property fields we simulated the propagation of both plumes considering temperature dependent density effects the simulation was undertaken using seawat v4 langevin et al 2008 assuming a linear relationship between groundwater density and temperature fig 10 shows the comparison of simulated temperature 10a and solute 10b breakthrough curves at various locations the greatest density related discrepancy in simulated temperature peaks is of the order of 2 5 c and observed at the deep monitoring locations of wells 1 and 5 near the injection point simulated temperatures appear inconsistent when the temperature anomaly reaches 12 c this localized effect however changes the flow dynamics creating additional vertical flow gradients that affect the simulated plume propagation at distances even when the temperature anomaly is less than 5 c these effects are greater at the deeper parts of the aquifer and more observable at locations hydraulically connected to the source but in most occasions peak temperature discrepancies are less than 1 5 c density related effects are also observable to simulated solute concentrations these are greatly affected by the disruption of heat supply and the retarded arrival of the heat plume fig 10b maximum simulated discrepancies are of the order of 0 1 expressed in terms of δc c0 and near the injection point differences appear when temperature increases by approximately 12 c similarly to heat and as density effects alter the flow characteristics simulated solute concentrations are affected at smaller temperature anomalies as distance from the source increases i e 8 c in w02 and 4 c in w05 unlike heat however solute concentration discrepancies become negligible at the recovery stage when density related errors are compared with the other noise terms like background groundwater temperature or seasonal trends for long duration tests and considering the resulting overall uncertainty of system parameters discussed earlier these effects may not necessarily be significant density related effects however are biased particularly with depth and therefore should be accounted for whenever possible 5 conclusions over a 78 day period a test using rhodamine wt and heat tracers was conducted and the combined observation dataset was used for aquifer characterization data were collected at 22 monitoring wells organized in four transects and provided a very good description of the solute and heat plumes the heat plume however did not reach the two furthest arrays located approximately 60 m and 95 m from the injection point spatially distributed aquifer properties have been obtained through simultaneous inversion of the flow solute and heat transport models the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the combined observation dataset allowed the development of a high resolution description of aquifer heterogeneity the simulated horizontal hydraulic conductivity statistics are in great agreement with the results of previous analytical work at the site that relied on numerous site tests the resulting hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields successfully describe the simultaneous movement of the solute and heat plumes during the 2 5 months of the experiment at the numerical grid scale 2 both heat and solute measurement sensitivities were dominated by the spatially distributed properties most controlling parameter was horizontal hydraulic conductivity followed by vertical hydraulic conductivity and porosity as expected the spatial distribution of sensitivities suggests that they decrease as the distance from observation points increases this is particularly true for porosity and to a smaller degree for the sensitivity of solute concentrations to vertical hydraulic conductivity temperature change was less sensitive to the thermal distribution factor while solute concentrations and temperature change had similar sensitivities to longitudinal dispersivity the assumption of spatially distributed porosity makes addressing the effect of porosity to the bulk thermal conductivity very difficult and therefore no conclusions can be drawn for the importance of the aquifer solids thermal conductivity from our study 3 spatially distributed parameters remain to a large degree non unique identifiability analysis was used to qualitatively describe how confident one can be with regards to the yielded aquifer property values the analysis suggests that longitudinal dispersivity and thermal distribution factor are completely identifiable by the combined observation dataset horizontal hydraulic conductivity has also high identifiability along the plume center of mass and relatively close to the injection point suggesting that only in these areas one can be relatively confident for the estimated values 4 the injection temperature resulted in some temperature related density effects these effects were not considered in the model inversion process but their post calibration effects were demonstrated by comparing the simulated heat and solute concentrations with and without groundwater density corrections discrepancies for both tracers started developing near the injection well when simulated temperature increase approached 12 c as the flow dynamics near the injection point are affected by high groundwater temperatures density related effects propagate down gradient and can be measurable even when the temperature anomalies are less than 5 c these effects are greater at the deeper parts of the aquifer and more observable at locations hydraulically connected to the source even though these discrepancies may be small compared to other uncertainties density related effects should be accounted for when computationally possible 5 finally high frequency and spatially dense temperature data did not provide enough information to inform a dual domain conceptual model even when heat transport is convection dominated in highly permeable fast flowing aquifers development of a dual porosity model will need to be based on high frequency and potentially

7442,in the hydrological cycle the infiltration process is a critical component in the distribution of water into the soil and in the groundwater system the nonlinear dynamics of the soil infiltration process yield preferential flow which affects the water distribution in soil preferential flow is influenced by the interactions between water soil plants and microorganisms although the relationship among the plant roots their rhizodeposits and water transport in soil has been the subject of extensive study the effect of microbial exudates has been studied in only a few cases here the authors investigated the influence of two artificial microbial exudates catechol and riboflavin on the infiltration process particularly unstable fingered flow one form of preferential flow flow experiments investigating the effects of types and concentrations of microbial exudates on unstable fingered flow were conducted in a two dimensional tank that was filled with astm c778 graded silica sand the light transmission method ltm which is based on capturing the light intensity transmitted through a sand water system and then converting it into degree of water saturation was used to visualize and characterize the flow of water in porous media as well as to image and measure the spatial and temporal distribution of water in porous media flow patterns vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation of the fingers as well as measurements of the fingers dimension width number and velocity were determined using the light transmission method interfacial experiments exploring the influence of microbial exudates on the wettability behavior of water were performed by measuring the contact angle and the interfacial tension of the solid gas microbial exudate solution systems unstable wetting front generating fingered flow was observed in all infiltration experiments the experimental results showed that the microbial exudate addition affected the infiltration process as the measurements of the degree of saturation profiles and widths of the fingers differed from those of the control nacl solution these differences may be due to an improved water holding capacity in the presence of the microbial exudates the lowest catechol solution concentration 10 μm produced the largest finger width 9 69 cm among the tested catechol solution concentrations and all the other solutions including the control solution 7 24 cm moreover the wettability of the medium for the catechol solution increased with an increase in concentration the highest riboflavin solution concentration 1000 μm generated the highest finger width 7 75 cm among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations however the wettability of the medium for the riboflavin solution decreased with an increase in concentration our study demonstrated that the microbial exudates which are biochemical compounds produced and released by microbes in the environment are capable of influencing the soil infiltration process the results of this study also demonstrated that the influence of the contact angle expressed as cos θ 1 2 should be integrated in the scaling of the finger dimension i e finger width when the miller and miller 1956 scaling theory is applied for the hydrodynamic scaling in porous media keywords preferential flow fingered flow wetting front instability unsaturated porous media microbial exudates light transmission method ltm 1 introduction the infiltration process is an extremely important factor within the hydrological cycle as it filters water from both the atmosphere and the ground surface into the soil which in turn revives the underground ecosystem through a recharged ground water table to ensure the continuity of the cycle a combination of gravity and capillarity forces acts upon the water and upon entry into the soil pores with gravity always acting vertically and with the capillary forces channeling the water in all directions gray and norum 1967 derived in

non uniform with wetting fronts flowing irregularly green and ampt 1911 in a non uniform flow water movement in some areas of the unsaturated subsurface is faster and more intense than in others preferential flow in the form of macropore flow unstable fingered flow and funnel flow are a few of the characteristic non uniform flows that may occur preferential flow refers to the movement of water in addition to the solutes in a non uniform flow and is independent from common conditions that characterize soils in various locations andreini and steenhuis 1990 baveye et al 1998 dekker and

change hydraulic conductivity by modifying soil porosity and inducing water repellency which then forms preferential flow paths morales et al 2010 these preferential flow paths of a soil profile can then form a saturated distribution zone with fingering flow paths kim et al 2005 steenhuis et al 1994 these unstable wetting fronts then split the original horizontal profiles into fingering flow paths that may cause a leaching of contaminants via the soil into the groundwater bauters et al 2000 darnault et al 2003 2004 doerr et al 2007 hendrickx and flury 2001 uyusur et al 2010 2015 wang et al 2000 in addition unexpected dry and wet soil patches from fingering flow paths can negatively affect microbial populations and plant growth morales et al 2010 for example the agrochemicals and wetting agents surfactants regularly applied to golf course greens can rapidly move through the subsurface by preferential flow kostka 2000 morales et al 2010 soil moisture is an integral component concerning the support of biogeochemical processes as nutrient cycles and a catalyst for microbial and plant activities wang et al 2015 soil modification by microorganisms and plant roots creates preferential flow which in turn facilitates the microbial and plant activity by supplying more oxygen moisture content available nutrients and different dissolved substrates along the wetted flow path the soil water dynamics are complex due to the heterogeneity in soil media from the nonuniform spatial distribution of microorganisms and plant roots different soil structures numerous interrelated biogeochemical reactions spatial and temporal variability and the scaling factor for hydrological processes ettema and wardle 2002 morales et al 2010 microorganisms growing in the soil tend to accumulate low molecular weight organic molecules also known as osmolytes the semi permeability of membranes of these microorganisms causes a release of the intracellular solutes as exudates which in turn preserve their osmotic potential with the surrounding medium although the exudate production varies among microorganisms this microbial response is a useful strategy to prevent cell lysis and death caused by changes in soil water content boot et al 2013 griffin 1981 halverson et al 2000 kieft et al 1987 potts 1994 wang et al 2015 it has been determined that plant exudates released by roots can function as surfactants and change surface tension of soil solutions which in turn alters the hydraulic conductivity and water flow around the rhizosphere passioura 1988 read et al 2003 read and gregory 1997 as surface active organic compounds surfactants can alter both surface tension of liquids and contact angle at the solid liquid interface which can further influence both the water flow and the potential transport of contaminants in the vadose zone bashir et al 2008 karagunduz et al 2015 however little research has been undertaken to examine the influence of different microbial exudates on water infiltration processes into the vadose zone catechol is one compound produced by certain bacteria e g escherichia coli that can be synthesized by feeding those microbes on glucose

many microorganisms including candida famata bacillus subtilis and lactic acid bacteria is a second compound that can be treated as a microbial exudate bacher et al 2001 perkins et al 1999 perkins and pero 1993 schallmey et al 2004 stahmann et al 2000 thakur et al 2016 first used by hoa in 1981 to measure water content in two dimensional unsaturated sandy porous media the light transmission method ltm is ideal for studying the infiltration process without disturbing the porous media system this non invasive imaging technique is inexpensive and fast responding and provides high resolution with a mininum of acquisition time darnault et al 1998 werth et al 2010 in order to acquire available data a transparent thin enough to be two dimensional system that enables visible light to transmit through is needed a charge coupled device ccd camera is commonly used for data capture in the light transmission method as the resolution is acceptable werth et al 2010 the light intensity data separated from the original rgb image can be converted to the percentage of water saturation based on the calibration equation as a result profiles of water distribution of wetting front and fingered flow during the infiltration process can be obtained and then analyzed for flow characteristics very little study has been undertaken to examine the infiltration process in porous media using the light transmission method and even less to elucidate the influence of microbial exudate on the flow process although plant exudates act as surfactants to influence water flow the effect of microbial exudates upon the infiltration process is unknown therefore a random rain event rather than point source was simulated to mimic natural conditions and to use the light transmission method to investigate the effect of these microbial exudates on preferential flow with different concentrations which relate to different concentrations of biomass when applying real microbes the primary objective of this research entailed an investigation of how different microbial exudates with varying concentrations alter the infiltration process in an unsaturated sand system and the distribution of the soil moisture content specifically the microbial exudates catechol and riboflavin were examined to determine any influence on flow in porous media the surface tension and the contact angle were dynamically monitored to obtain the interfacial properties of exudate solutions and the infiltration experiments were conducted in a homogeneous and initially dry porous media in a two dimensional 2d tank a light transmission method with high spatial and temporal resolution was used to construct the flow patterns and to visualize the water saturation distribution followed by the use of matlab to process the imaging and data analyses 2 material and methods 2 1 microbial exudates solution preparation two solutions of microbial exudate were simulated using catechol and riboflavin the molar

500 ph meter fisher scientific waltham ma the different constituents and concentrations of the solutions are listed in table 1 2 2 contact angle and surface tension a drop shape analyzer the fm40mk2 easydrop model instrument krüss hamburg germany was used to measure the contact angle of the different experimental solutions and the easydrop complimentary drop shape analysis software was used to process the data a 5 μl drop of sample was excreted from a 1 ml norm ject syringe fisher scientific waltham ma with an attached needle to form a sessile drop on a glass slide that was continuously measured at 30 s increments when placed in front of a camera for 10 min all samples were conducted in triplicate and the results were recorded in excel a krüss drop shape analyzer apparatus with a needle of approximately 1 8 mm in diameter was then used to experimentally measure the surface tension of the different microbial exudate solutions and the control solution a pendant drop was formed

in the setting to 0 0012 g cm3 and 23 c for the surface tension measurements droplets from the sample solutions were measured at 30 s increments in front of the camera over five full minutes all samples were conducted in triplicate and the results were recorded in excel an overview of the experimental parameters and analyses for the interfacial dynamics study is outlined in table 1 2 3 two dimensional tank flow experiment a two dimensional tank with two plates constructed of scratch resistant polycarbonate and an inner dimension of 30 2 cm 1 2 cm 30 8 cm l w h was used for the microbial exudate flow experiments the bottom of the tank on which was layered four pieces of ceramic porous plates for permeability was inclined downward to the left four evenly distributed drainage outlets and one additional outlet at the left corner were also placed within the tank during flow experiments a filter sheet was placed at the bottom to prevent sand clogging and for the proper solutions to drain a picture of the 2d tank with setup is shown in fig 1 astm c778 graded sand with unground silica u s silica company ottawa il was used to fill the tank the physical and chemical characterization of the astm c778 graded sand from the us silica product data sheet are provided in table 2 a sand volume corresponding to the volume of two tanks was loaded into a handmade y shaped sand loader with a piece of cloth within with the loader taped above the tank the cloth was then quickly removed from the tank to create a uniform packing of sand within the tank with a uniform sand bulk density of 1 50 g cm3 the rest of the sand in the loader and the loader were then removed to ensure a consistent density of sand a plastic rod was used to tap the top edge of the tank several times to settle the top sand layer after the tank was loaded with sand the microbial exudate solutions and the control solution were pumped into the tank through a model 77200 60 easy load ii peristaltic pump head masterflex gelsenkirchen germany via a connecting tube at a constant flow rate of 10 ml min solutions were continuously stirred in their containers which were positioned on a ms3002s newclassic balance mettler toledo columbus oh to record the initial and final weights the other end of the tube was connected to an actuator which moved back and forth at a constant speed above the tank two short tube openings were suspended from the actuator and solutions were randomly dropped from either tube to simulate a random rainfall event with an infiltration velocity of 13 12 cm hr into the sand system an overview of the experimental parameters and analyses for the two dimensional tank flow in porous media study is outlined in table 1 2 4 visualization and light transmission method the light transmission method was used to visualize the microbial exudate solution flow pattern within the 2d tank and to measure the spatial and temporal water saturation in porous media a 0 6 m 0 6 m square even glow led panel light fixture with natural white color and a maximum of 2900 lm super bright leds st louis mo was placed behind the 2d tank the entire configuration except for the tank front surface was fully covered by a black plastic sheet to avoid extra light emanation from the side a d5500 dslr camera nikon tokyo japan on a vtsl7200 72 tripod bower long island city ny was placed in front of the tank at a distance to record the transmitted light through the sand column in the 2d tank with a constant flow of exudate solution the camera setting was adjusted to manual to avoid overexposure with the led panel light only activated when both pump and actuator started to function the camera then began imaging automatically every 30 s until the bottom of the tank was saturated and then drained for at least five minutes each flow experiment was performed in duplicate the secondary experimental images of each flow experiment are available for viewing in the supplementary material figures s1 s4 an empirical calibration was conducted in calibration cell tanks 7 6 1 5 8 9 cm packed with sand to a full range of known water saturation percentage values i e 0 5 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 the calibration was performed in triplicate a linear calibration relationship was observed between water saturation and intensity of the transmitted light with an r2 value of 0 96 fig 2 this relationship was also detected by uyusur et al 2015 this linear relationship and resulting equation were then used to transform the intensity values into water saturation values with matlab r2016a the mathworks inc natick ma usa therefore for each flow experiment the intensity values corresponding to 0 and 100 water saturation were acquired and the slope from each experiment was evaluated to the calibration curve to confirm that the empirical calibrations among experiments were similar 2 5 data and imaging analysis for each flow experiment four pictures representing different stages of the main finger formation prior to reaching the tank s bottom were analyzed in addition to the original image at a time of 0 min and a drainage image for calibration purposes matlab was used to process the images specifically to convert rgb red green and blue files to the form in hsv hue saturation and intensity where solely the intensity was used later the imaging method yielded both a high spatial resolution by tracking the main finger formation and a constant temporal response at 30 s intervals both vertical and horizontal water distribution profiles were analyzed along and across the main finger for each stage of development a 30 pixel wide rectangle appearing as a vertical line was drawn through the middle of the main finger to provide a vertical water distribution profile along the length with a second rectangle horizontally drawn across the main finger at 90 of its total length to provide a horizontal water distribution profile regression equations were calculated using the observed linear relationship between the degree of water saturation and the image of transmitted light intensity fig 2 based on the initial dry sand and fully saturated sand images with water saturation degree of 0 and 100 respectively darnault et al 2001 hoa 1981 uyuşur et al 2016 matlab was then used to code the regression equations to calculate the water saturation based on the transmitted light intensity values of each finger an overview of the imaging parameters and analyses for the two dimensional tank flow in the porous media study is outlined in table 1 2 6 statistical analysis interfacial parameters and flow characteristics were examined statistically to make comparisons between types and concentrations of microbial exudate solutions anova was utilized to determine the statistical significance of the experimental factors anova student s t tests with an alpha value of 0 05 were run to determine statistically significant differences among factor means microsoft excel 2010 and jmp pro 12 were used for the statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 contact angle and surface tension 3 1 1 catechol the contact angles for the catechol solutions are shown in fig 3 the lowest concentration of 10 μm catechol solution with 0 01 m nacl exhibited the highest contact angle among the four concentrations an increase in the catechol concentration from 10 μm to 1000 μm reduced the contact angle from 75 2 82 to 69 3 52 at time 0 min successively at approximately 10 min all contact angles decreased and slowly plateaued the initial contact angle of 76 7 1 61 in the 0 01 m nacl control solution suddenly declined and finally exhibited a higher contact angle compared to the solutions with catechol added the measurements of surface tension for catechol solutions in fig 4 show similar results between 72 5 mn m to 74 5 mn m within a period of 5 min the initial surface tension for a 10 μm solution of catechol was greater than the 100 μm and 1000 μm solutions of catechol with the lowest surface tension within the 500 μm solution however within five minutes a slight fluctuation of surface tensions indicated no significant difference overall compared to the control solution of 0 01 m nacl with the surface tension at 73 7 0 04 mn m the 10 μm and 100 μm catechol solutions caused an increase in surface tension whereas the 500 μm and 1000 μm solutions caused a decrease 3 1 2 riboflavin the contact angles for the riboflavin solutions are shown in fig 5 of the four concentrations analyzed the lowest contact angle was for the 10 μm concentration of riboflavin solution with 0 01 m nacl at 0 min and the solution with the 1000 μm concentration exhibited the highest value the contact angle increased from 75 3 0 70 to 80 3 1 47 when the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm the rise of which was concentration dependent and increased in order however when the time approached 10 min all decreasing trends began to plateau although the initial contact angle of the 0 01 m nacl control solution was greater than 10 μm and 100 μm solutions the overall trend was similar to the 10 μm of riboflavin solution in the later stage the surface tensions for riboflavin solutions were then measured continuously every 30 s for 5 min which are shown in fig 6 indicating a lower surface tension with higher riboflavin concentrations these values fluctuated slightly however which failed to indicate any great differences within the range of 73 5 mn m to 75 mn m the initial surface tension decreased from 74 6 0 12 mn m to 73 9 0 25 mn m when the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm the 0 01 m nacl control solution exhibited the lowest surface tension during this five minute interval 3 1 3 microbial exudate solutions versus control the percentage difference in contact angle for catechol and riboflavin solutions compared to the control nacl solution is shown in fig 7 at concentrations of 500 μm and 1000 μm the two microbial exudates exhibited the opposite percentages compared to the baseline of control for example the contact angle for catechol solution was about 11 smaller than the control while it was almost 13 greater than the control for riboflavin solution at 1000 μm similarly the percentage difference in surface tension for catechol and riboflavin solutions compared to the control is plotted in fig 8 at concentrations of 500 μm and 1000 μm the two microbial exudates also showed opposite values although the overall difference in percentage was not large compared to that in the contact angle for example at 500 μm the catechol solution was 0 36 and the riboflavin solution was 0 68 different from the control diverse significant differences were found in contact angle and surface tension values both between types of microbial exudates and among concentrations except for the first minute of contact angle measurement table 3 3 2 profile analysis of the finger development the 2d tank visualizations of the flow experiments representing the microbial exudate dependent infiltration processes were subsequently displayed for water distribution profiles as original rgb images extracted intensity figures and water saturation percentage profiles detailed information about the finger numbers and characteristics are shown in table 4 the results from statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference within the number of fingers and the velocity of finger formation among types and concentrations of solutions table 4 in addition main finger length and width did not significantly differ from each other 3 2 1 catechol vertical and horizontal finger profiles were analyzed for different concentrations of catechol solutions at different stages of the main finger formation these four successive stages beginning at 5 min and ending prior to contact of the primary finger to the tank bottom are shown in their vertical water saturation profiles and respective catechol concentrations fig 9 a to d it was determined from a comparison of the main finger shapes between catechol concentrations that more small branches formed on the two sides of the finger at higher concentrations the finger exhibiting the most tendrils was that observed with the 1000 μm catechol solution while the sides were flat and smooth with the 10 μm solution as the catechol concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm the water saturation percentage at the fingertip increased from approximately 70 to 80 to 90 and finally to full saturation mostly two fingers were formed among the four concentrations of catechol exudate solution in terms of velocity of the main finger development the finger velocity increased from 1 63 cm min at concentration of 10 μm to 2 17 cm min at concentration of 1000 μm in sequence regarding the nacl control solution fig 9 e three fingers were formed which were mostly smooth at two sides and the water saturation percentage at the fingertip was in a similar range with the 500 μm of catechol solution roughly around 90 the horizontal finger profiles of the final stages for four concentrations of catechol as well as the control nacl solution are collectively shown in fig 10 the main finger width at the fingertip was widest for 10 μm catechol solution at 11 72 cm and it decreased to a range of five to seven centimeters at higher concentrations as for the control nacl solution the width was 8 4 cm at the fingertip at 90 of the total length of the main fingers the water saturation percentage profiles suddenly increased and dropped at both sides where the solution failed to reach the sand matrix the middle portion of the water saturation percentage profiles increased from approximately 70 to 80 to 90 and to almost 100 as the catechol concentrations were raised from 10 μm to 1000 μm which was consistent with the vertical profiles 3 2 2 riboflavin vertical and horizontal finger profiles were analyzed for different concentrations of riboflavin solutions at different stages of the main finger formation beginning at 5 min and terminating when the main finger almost contacted the tank bottom the vertical profiles by riboflavin concentration for the four successive stages of finger formation including their original rgb pictures the corresponding intensity figures and the water saturation percentage distribution profiles as well as the nacl control for purposes of comparison are shown in fig 11 an analysis of the main finger shapes indicated a more bulbous main finger within an increase in riboflavin concentration from 10 μm to 500 μm further the water saturation percentage also increased at the fingertip of the riboflavin solutions from 75 to 85 and to 90 as the concentrations increased from 10 μm to 500 μm with the exception of the 1000 μm solution which decreased to 80 each of the four riboflavin concentrations also formed two fingers during which the velocity was the highest 2 07 cm min at 10 μm concentrations and decreased to 1 63 cm min at 1000 μm concentrations for a 1000 μm concentration of riboflavin solution the slightly inclined main finger was relatively thinner compared to the fingers at lower concentrations and it did not exhibit the highest water saturation percentage as did the fingertip in the last stage the highest percentage of water saturation in the nacl control was approximately 90 which was quite close to the 500 μm of the riboflavin solution the horizontal finger profiles for the final stages of the four concentrations of riboflavin and the control nacl solutions are shown in fig 12 the widest main finger width was 9 84 cm at 500 μm with the width decreasing to 6 97 cm a 100 μm and to 6 66 cm at 10 μm an approximate 75 water saturation was observed in the horizontal profiles for the 10 μm solution and it increased to nearly 90 for the 500 μm solution and then decreased to 80 for the 1000 μm solution which were consistent with the vertical profiles 4 discussion microbial exudate as the first step in the simulation of a microbial effect does affect the infiltration process particularly preferential flow through porous media in this research catechol and riboflavin in particular were studied as were the interfacial characteristics of contact angle and surface tension which played an important role in the analysis of the fingering flow process the study of interfacial characteristics of catechol and riboflavin provided the basic information for their linkage to preferential flow features the opposite behaviors in contact angle in addition to different performances in surface tension induced various flow patterns for two exudate solutions among four concentrations at 10 100 500 and 1000 μm figs 7 and 8 the light transmission method was used to correlate the transmitted light intensity to the water saturation percentage which showed significant differences among the finger profiles figs 9 12 and s1 s4 in a homogeneous porous medium preferential flow may lead to a finger shaped wetted zone filled with water and solutes the fully formed fingers generated by gravity driven flow behave like traveling waves i e constant shape and velocity and the water saturation profile of the fully formed fingers exhibits the following pattern a region of high water saturation directly behind the wetting front known as the fingertip i e an overshoot at the fingertip followed by another region of drainage where the water content in the finger decreases to a lower and uniform water saturation known as the finger tail dicarlo 2004 glass et al 1989a liu et al 1994 selker et al 1992 in this study the fingers in the initially dry medium formed wet cores with relatively high water content in contrast to their dry surroundings as initially described by hill and parlange 1972 the movement of the main fingers downward as indicated in the images failed to disturb the widths of the finger cores for a short distance immediately behind the fingertip figs 10 and 12 and s2 and s4 this stasis was due to the drying process behind the fingertip and reduction of matric potential preventing a rapid expansion of the fingers glass et al 1989c similarly an analysis of the relationship between the width and velocity of the finger determined that a higher flow rate led to a wider and faster moving finger glass et al 1989a b in this examination of the flow experiments under similar infiltration rates the physical properties of the microbial exudate solutions were deemed the major cause of variability in the preferential flow paths i e fingered flow the size and shape of the fingers and the water distribution profiles for all the 2d tank experiments provided direct evidence of the influence of the catechol and riboflavin solutions that were analyzed table 4 figs 9 12 and s1 s4 each of the four concentrations of respective microbial exudate solution indicated distinct contact angles and surface tensions table 3 all of which placed different stresses upon the infiltration process and finger formation wetting front instability has been studied under several scenarios most notably that of parlange and hill 1976 who derived modeling equations to predict the width of a finger in an air water system by incorporating the sorptivity and glass and nicholl 1996 who adjusted the equation to fit an air water system this system is expressed as 2 d c π s 2 2 k s θ s θ i 1 1 q s k s where d c is the minimum finger width s is the sorptivity θ s is the saturated water content θ i is the initial water content q s is the flux k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and π is a constant for a 2d system and 4 8 for a 3d system glass et al 1991 wallach et al 2013 it is important to note that the intrinsic sorptivity is independent of the liquid properties philip 1969 wallach et al 2013 scaling of fluid flow in porous media was developed by miller and miller 1956 hydrodynamic scaling in porous media applied to fingered flow may be used to characterize the finger dimension the theoretical analysis of wetting front instability in soils developed by parlange and hill 1976 led to equations that predict the finger dimension i e width in porous media these equations of finger dimension can be scaled using the miller and miller scaling theory 1956 to obtain a scaling equation that can be applied to width of fingers expressed as 3 d ρ g λ σ gl d where ρ is liquid density g is gravitational constant λ is the characteristic media length scale σgl is the gas liquid interfacial tension d is the finger width and d is the scaled finger width glass and nicholl 1996 this scaling equation was previously applied to finger dimensions by varying the characteristic media length scale the liquid density and the gas water interfacial tension selker and schroth 1998 using this scaling equation we compared the finger dimensions obtained in our experiment by performing a scaling based on the density of the microbial exudate solutions relative to the control nacl solution the gas liquid interfacial tension of the microbial exudate solution relative to the control nacl solution and the coupling of both the density and gas liquid interfacial tension of the microbial exudate solution relative to the control nacl solution table 5 scaling results show that the fluid density the gas liquid interfacial tension and the coupling of fluid density and gas liquid interfacial tension did not have a significant influence on the scaling inconsistencies of the finger dimension table 5 as stated by selker and schroth 1998 the cause is related to the consistency of the contact angle among the experiments to be scaled when using the miller and miller scaling theory culligan et al 2005 showed that soil sorptivity is a function of cos θ 1 2 recently an extension of the miller and miller scaling theory to scale sorptivity by contact angle was proposed by wallach and wang 2013 their results showed that the miller and miller equation can be employed for scaling sorptivity by the contact angle i e cos θ 1 2 for uniform pore geometry this is the case here as our experiments are conducted in homogeneous and uniform sandy porous media in which fingered flow occurs based on these findings the finger width was scaled with cos θ 1 2 to account for the synergistic effect between contact and pore geometry table 5 and expressed as 4 d d cos θ 1 2 scaling results show that the use of cos θ 1 2 decreases the scaling inconsistencies of the finger dimension table 5 therefore demonstrating the key contribution of contact angle through the expression of cos θ 1 2 in the development and growth of fingers in porous media the width of fingers as well as the pore scale consideration in unstable gravity driven finger flow steenhuis et al 2013 the number of observed fingers two was similar for each chemical solution table 4 from top to bottom mostly two fingers were formed in the system with the vertical water saturation profiles for the main fingers exhibiting similar patterns figs 9 12 and s1 s4 from top to bottom of the 2d tank these main fingers often encompassed two zones both of which differed from the theoretical finger profile described by glass et al 1989c an ideal finger has three zones of classification indicating a downward migration of the solution in an initially dry medium the conceptual profile transitioned from a zone with a constant degree of water saturation between 50 and 60 to that of an increasing gradient in water saturation and which reached near or full saturation at the fingertip further although only the transition and saturation zones were clearly observed in the vertical water saturation profiles of fingers for catechol and riboflavin solutions all three zones were present in the nacl control solution figs 9 12 and s1 s4 the difference between the control solution and the exudate added solutions indicates a possible increase of the degree of water saturation in porous medium by the microbial exudate prior to saturation it is now known that microbial excreted extracellular polymeric substance eps can increase the holding capacity of soil water morales et al 2010 which is consistent with the findings detailed here specifically an application of eps on soil particles showed an increase in soil water contact angle and a great change in soil matric potential which caused the formation of preferential flows bauters et al 2000 similarly the use of commercially prepared dextran and xanthan to model the microbial exudates of polysaccharides in order to analyze the soil structure and water transport indicated a reduction in water repellency of soils after the microbial exudate treatment czarnes et al 2000 clearly these studies validated the effect of the microbial exudates on the infiltration process that was detailed in this study an analysis of the effect of concentration differences for each microbial exudate solution was also undertaken during the infiltration experiment it is well known that the underground migration of contaminants is closely related to the properties and chemistries of the solution meaning that the solute concentration ionic strength and ph affect both the surface tension and contact angle bashir et al 2009 2008 henry and smith 2002 lord et al 1997 therefore the young laplace equation can be used to express capillary pressure at the pore scale as a function of surface tension and contact angle this equation is expressed as 5 p c 2 γ cos θ r where pc is for the capillary pressure γ and θ are the surface tension and contact angle of a solution respectively and r is the radius of the pore size of medium lord et al 1997 to explain the action of the interfacial forces upon the solution s infiltration process we assumed a constant radius for pore size under various combinations of surface tension and contact angle the capillary pressures would then correspondingly contribute to water flow and distribution changes across the porous medium resulting finally in diverse infiltration processes and finger shapes here a decrease in contact angle at higher concentrations of catechol solution table 3 likely increased the wettability of the porous medium thus causing a greater protrusion of the solution into the dry matrix and quickly reaching conditions of near saturation the slopes of the transition zone shown in the vertical water saturation profiles increase with increasing catechol concentrations which reflect this faster water distribution rate fig 9 based on these horizontal water saturation profiles for the catechol solutions under study the water saturation distribution profile at 90 of the total finger length of the highest catechol concentration of 1000 μm showed the greatest drops at two edges the greatest constancy of degree of water saturation in between and the narrowest width fig 10 as expressed in eq 5 at 1000 μm of catechol solution for example the largest cosine of the contact angle which was given by the smallest contact angle value multiplied by the second small surface tension nearly cancelled out its resulted capillary pressure change figs 3 and 4 therefore the capillary pressure may not be the causative factor in the finger development process among concentrations for catechol a better water holding capacity induced by a catechol solution at higher concentrations may be useful in explaining the greater wettability and water saturation percentage at fingertip and a reduction in drainage to the surrounding dry matrix fig 10 here the water holding capacity resulting from catechol may dominate the preferential flow patterns over the interactive forces that occur at the interfaces of soil water solution and sand grain and of soil water solution and air an increase in contact angle that was observed with an increase in concentration of riboflavin table 3 indicated that more time was required within the medium to form a fully developed main finger due to decreased wettability the difference in the slope of the transition zone the water saturation at the fingertip fig 11 and the horizontal water distribution profile between four riboflavin concentrations was not as apparent as in the catechol solutions fig 12 however a slight increase in saturation percentage at the fingertip and in the overall finger width shown in riboflavin s vertical and horizontal water saturation profiles from 10 μm to 500 μm could still be observed with an exception of 1000 μm where the finger might have been affected by the incline while the surface tension from the catechol solutions indicated no obvious trend among concentrations it decreased when the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm fig 6 in the context of equation 5 at 10 μm of riboflavin solution for example the smallest contact angle which led to the largest value of its cosine in addition to the largest surface tension resulted in the largest capillary pressure value figs 5 and 6 at higher concentrations for riboflavin this reducing capillarity pressure therefore enhanced water saturation except for 1000 μm a wider finger width at higher concentration except for 1000 μm may be due to a decrease in water holding capacity with more water diffused into the dry soil matrix moreover by adding chemicals the surface tension of water could decrease and therefore the fingers size would reduce glass et al 1989a although the phenomenon described by glass et al 1988 is opposite to our findings the study above further supports the likelihood that surface tension also plays a role in changing the preferential flow process previous point source experiments have determined that at the same flow rate with a lower contact angle of media the fingers tend to be more bulbous and wider than under a higher contact angle wallach et al 2013 however our observance of the fingers from the catechol and riboflavin solutions figs 9 and 11 indicated a decreased contact angle that narrowed the bulbous finger shapes with an increase in catechol concentration and a decrease in riboflavin concentration table 3 the results presented here may differ from previous work due to the imposed boundary condition of simulated rain event induced infiltration rather than point source dripping infiltration the application of the random rain event completely saturated the top layer consequently the capillary force acting on the wetting front that caused the finger to spread was slightly smaller as compared to the gravitational force therefore for the lower contact angles the bulbous shape failed to persevere as gravity caused the eventual elongation of all fingers to different degrees at the respective contact angles and surface tensions as fingers flow through a porous medium the water carries solutes and nutrients to microbes in pores and in turn the microbes and their exudates possibly affect the finger flow pattern and water distribution as a degraded intermediate of aromatic compound catechol is poisonous and possibly harmful to microbes as the catechol concentration increases from 10 μm to 1000 μm the fingers become narrower and produce more branches fig 10 a possible relationship between microbial behavior and fingering flow may manifest in the microbes metabolizing to more rapidly dispense with the catechol as they increase the contact area to the surrounding matrix and minimize or narrow the internal hold zone for the catechol an increased water saturation percentage at higher concentration may also be useful in catalyzing the chemical reactions in a wet system however riboflavin also serves as a nutrient for microbes specifically in studies with riboflavin at increased concentrations from 10 μm to 1000 μm the fingers were observed to grow wider except for the 1000 μm sample fig 12 a possible explanation is that the riboflavin exudate effect on the preferential flow is tied to the degree to which the microbes favor this nutrient at higher concentrations of riboflavin solution 500 μm microbes might favor this nutrient and wish to retain it for further use which leads to wider fingers and a maximum internal zone however once the concentration reaches 1000 μm which might be too high for microbes the flow pattern becomes narrow again the highest water saturation percentage at 500 μm of concentration observed in profiles created the wettest system for the maximum microbial activity thus far this research used the light transmission method to evaluate the concentration effects of artificial microbial exudates on infiltration process which has not been widely studied the use of the light transmission method an optical imagery system using visible light has been used in such diverse applications as contaminant hydrogeology measurement of flow paths and in determining the velocity of both fluid and solutes and in characterizing both fluid distribution and contaminant transport werth et al 2010 boundary effects on the hydrodynamics process observed in the two dimensional tank may arise from the contact of flow and porous media with the plates these boundary effects are minimized by choosing a sand grain size that is relatively small compared to the width of the two dimensional tank to ensure that sufficient porous media size between the two plates is available for the development of the flow in porous media many such optical methods have been used to evaluate many biotic and abiotic systems in either saturated or unsaturated porous media however very little research has been undertaken on unsaturated systems and only a few studies emphasizing the process of infiltration keller and auset 2007 of the studies analyzing biomass growth microbial and colloidal transport and biofilm process in unsaturated porous media most involved only optical methods to qualitatively visualize pore scale flow or transport with additional results derived from a further model calculation or graphing breakthrough curves auset et al 2005 dunsmore et al 2004 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 the application of the light transmission method in this research directly related image information i e light intensity to flow characteristics i e water saturation percentage quantitatively through calibration the study also filled the gap and expanded the research regarding infiltration process related to microbial activity where the previously mentioned study looked solely at the contact angle influence wallach et al 2013 this paper however was more specific regarding types and concentrations of fluid infiltration as one of the most important processes that occurs in natural systems is worth investigating given its effects on both biotic and abiotic characteristics in the subsurface future research must entail the use of actual microbes and different biomass concentrations which closely corresponds to the various microbial exudate concentrations a departure from the analysis of microbial transport biofilm growth or bioclogging would involve studying the effect of microbial existence on the infiltration process in nearby flowing water furthermore the evolution of the research involving microbes should emphasize the secreted microbial exudates diffusing from those microbes which may cause a change in the water gradient potential around the microbial colony a study using the light transmission method to reveal the microbial exudates distribution around living microbes and to evaluate the relationship between media moisture and exudates diffusion process e g rate would be quite interesting the integration of hysteresis with repeated wetting and drying cycles to investigate the influence of microbes and microbial exudates is also recommended the image and data acquired from imaging techniques will be useful for depicting colony morphology in porous media to show the shifting variations in water content between dry and wet conditions and to explain the water uptake strategies used by microbes under changing media hydrological properties carminati et al 2016 as new bioimaging technology of microbial systems are developed these technologies may be coupled with the light transmission method to study multiscale dynamics of water saturation and transport regulated by microbes the light transmission method may also be used to support research on microbial competition and evolution in natural porous media as this research endeavor will require the development of more realistic models and additional data associated with the physical chemical and microbial characteristics of microenvironments in real porous media baveye and darnault 2017 5 conclusion the important findings of this 2d tank microbial exudate flow study are summarized below the light transmission method is a unique tool allowing the investigation of the synergistic influence of solution chemistry and porous media characteristics on the infiltration process including the unstable fingered flow phenomenon with a high spatial and temporal resolution microbial exudates affected the preferential flow during the infiltration process by forming two zones in the vertical water saturation profiles for both of the artificial exudate added solutions catechol and riboflavin rather than three zones in the nacl control solution this formation occurs perhaps from the enhancement in the water retaining capacity of the porous medium an examination of the infiltration process under the same intake flow rate determined the influence of various concentrations upon the preferential flow which was indicated by different vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation within the fingers the lowest catechol solution concentration 10 μm produced the largest finger width 9 69 cm among the tested catechol solution concentrations while the highest riboflavin solution concentration 1000 μm generated the highest finger width 7 75 cm among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations the results of this study demonstrated the influence of the contact angle expressed as cos θ 1 2 on the application of the theory for hydrodynamic scaling in homogeneous and uniform porous media and applied to the scaling of the finger dimension i e finger width the interfacial measurements and distinguished flow patterns of the two microbial exudates indicated each had a different reaction upon the infiltration process o an increased wettability of the catechol solutions was caused by a reduced contact angle at higher concentrations creating more branches in the fingers that greatly accelerated the time to saturation a faster finger moving velocity a greater water saturation percentage and a narrower finger width were observed at higher concentrations an increase in water holding capacity at higher concentration was hypothesized as the main cause of this phenomenon o the contact angle within the riboflavin solutions increased with a corresponding increase in concentration decreasing the wettability at higher concentrations a slower finger moving velocity a small increase in water saturation percentage at the fingertip and a larger width of the overall finger size was observed as the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 500 μm the reduced capillarity gave a greater saturation at fingertip at higher concentrations of riboflavin possible relationships between the microbial activity and preferential flow characteristics were assumed according to the properties of chemicals o microbes may try to minimize contact with catechol and tend to affect the preferential flow by narrowing the finger o microbes favor the usage of riboflavin and tend to increase the width of fingers acknowledgments this material is based upon work supported by the u s

7442,in the hydrological cycle the infiltration process is a critical component in the distribution of water into the soil and in the groundwater system the nonlinear dynamics of the soil infiltration process yield preferential flow which affects the water distribution in soil preferential flow is influenced by the interactions between water soil plants and microorganisms although the relationship among the plant roots their rhizodeposits and water transport in soil has been the subject of extensive study the effect of microbial exudates has been studied in only a few cases here the authors investigated the influence of two artificial microbial exudates catechol and riboflavin on the infiltration process particularly unstable fingered flow one form of preferential flow flow experiments investigating the effects of types and concentrations of microbial exudates on unstable fingered flow were conducted in a two dimensional tank that was filled with astm c778 graded silica sand the light transmission method ltm which is based on capturing the light intensity transmitted through a sand water system and then converting it into degree of water saturation was used to visualize and characterize the flow of water in porous media as well as to image and measure the spatial and temporal distribution of water in porous media flow patterns vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation of the fingers as well as measurements of the fingers dimension width number and velocity were determined using the light transmission method interfacial experiments exploring the influence of microbial exudates on the wettability behavior of water were performed by measuring the contact angle and the interfacial tension of the solid gas microbial exudate solution systems unstable wetting front generating fingered flow was observed in all infiltration experiments the experimental results showed that the microbial exudate addition affected the infiltration process as the measurements of the degree of saturation profiles and widths of the fingers differed from those of the control nacl solution these differences may be due to an improved water holding capacity in the presence of the microbial exudates the lowest catechol solution concentration 10 μm produced the largest finger width 9 69 cm among the tested catechol solution concentrations and all the other solutions including the control solution 7 24 cm moreover the wettability of the medium for the catechol solution increased with an increase in concentration the highest riboflavin solution concentration 1000 μm generated the highest finger width 7 75 cm among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations however the wettability of the medium for the riboflavin solution decreased with an increase in concentration our study demonstrated that the microbial exudates which are biochemical compounds produced and released by microbes in the environment are capable of influencing the soil infiltration process the results of this study also demonstrated that the influence of the contact angle expressed as cos θ 1 2 should be integrated in the scaling of the finger dimension i e finger width when the miller and miller 1956 scaling theory is applied for the hydrodynamic scaling in porous media keywords preferential flow fingered flow wetting front instability unsaturated porous media microbial exudates light transmission method ltm 1 introduction the infiltration process is an extremely important factor within the hydrological cycle as it filters water from both the atmosphere and the ground surface into the soil which in turn revives the underground ecosystem through a recharged ground water table to ensure the continuity of the cycle a combination of gravity and capillarity forces acts upon the water and upon entry into the soil pores with gravity always acting vertically and with the capillary forces channeling the water in all directions gray and norum 1967 derived in 1931 by lorenzo a richards the richards equation is used to determine water flow in the vadose zone under constant temperature from darcy s law and the conservation of mass it is expressed as 1 θ t z k θ d ψ θ d θ θ z k θ z z d θ θ z k θ z where θ represents the volumetric water content in soil t the time z the vertical axis pointing downward indicating positive k the soil hydraulic conductivity ψ the soil water potential and d the soil water diffusivity this highly nonlinear problem makes analytical and numerical solutions to the richards equation typically non unique celia et al 1990 the theory of infiltration and solutions to elucidate the question of flow in porous media have been the focus of extensive research most particularly through the seminal work of jean yves parlange parlange 1971a b c 1972a b c d e 1973 1975 parlange and aylor 1972 analytical and quasi analytical solutions of the equation of flow in porous media have been formulated through time expansion philip

bras 1990 smith et al 1993 waechter and philip 1985 water flow during the infiltration process in soil systems is either uniform with wetting fronts flowing in parallel to the soil surface level or non uniform with wetting fronts flowing irregularly green and ampt 1911 in a non uniform flow water movement in some areas of the unsaturated subsurface is faster and more intense than in others preferential flow in the form of macropore flow unstable fingered flow and funnel flow are a few of the characteristic non uniform flows that may occur preferential flow refers to the movement of water in addition to the solutes in a non uniform flow and is independent from common conditions that characterize soils in various locations andreini and steenhuis 1990 baveye et al 1998 dekker and ritsema 1996 doerr et al 2007 2006 the occurrence of finger flows one form of preferential flow that frequently occurs in homogeneous porous media may appear due to i entrapment of air during the movement of the wetting front ii flow through water repellent soils iii the process of continuous non ponding infiltration and iv flow through layered materials having different textures baker and hillel 1990 diment and watson 1985 du et al 2001 glass et al 1991 1990 1989a b c hill and parlage 1972 hill and baker 1988 parlange and hill 1976 philip 1975a b raats 1973 selker et al 1992 tamai et al 1987 yao and hendrickx 1996 2001 surface tension and contact angle are the two interfacial parameters most commonly examined in the infiltration process yuan and lee 2013 additional details on wetting front instability and gravity driven flow in porous media can be obtained in extensive reviews assouline 2013 glass and nicholl 1996 de rooij 2000 dicarlo 2013 xiong 2014 the formation of preferential flow may be influenced either directly or indirectly from various biological factors although plant root zones induce water into the soil microorganisms and their secreted compounds can change hydraulic conductivity by modifying soil porosity and inducing water repellency which then forms preferential flow paths morales et al 2010 these preferential flow paths of a soil profile can then form a saturated distribution zone with fingering flow paths kim et al 2005 steenhuis et al 1994 these unstable wetting fronts then split the original horizontal profiles into fingering flow paths that may cause a leaching of contaminants via the soil into the groundwater bauters et al 2000 darnault et al 2003 2004 doerr et al 2007 hendrickx and flury 2001 uyusur et al 2010 2015 wang et al 2000 in addition unexpected dry and wet soil patches from fingering flow paths can negatively affect microbial populations and plant growth morales et al 2010 for example the agrochemicals and wetting agents surfactants regularly applied to golf course greens can rapidly move through the subsurface by preferential flow kostka 2000 morales et al 2010 soil moisture is an integral component concerning the support of biogeochemical processes as nutrient cycles and a catalyst for microbial and plant activities wang et al 2015 soil modification by microorganisms and plant roots creates preferential flow which in turn facilitates the microbial and plant activity by supplying more oxygen moisture content available nutrients and different dissolved substrates along the wetted flow path the soil water dynamics are complex due to the heterogeneity in soil media from the nonuniform spatial distribution of microorganisms and plant roots different soil structures numerous interrelated biogeochemical reactions spatial and temporal variability and the scaling factor for hydrological processes ettema and wardle 2002 morales et al 2010 microorganisms growing in the soil tend to accumulate low molecular weight organic molecules also known as osmolytes the semi permeability of membranes of these microorganisms causes a release of the intracellular solutes as exudates which in turn preserve their osmotic potential with the surrounding medium although the exudate production varies among microorganisms this microbial response is a useful strategy to prevent cell lysis and death caused by changes in soil water content boot et al 2013 griffin 1981 halverson et al 2000 kieft et al 1987 potts 1994 wang et al 2015 it has been determined that plant exudates released by roots can function as surfactants and change surface tension of soil solutions which in turn alters the hydraulic conductivity and water flow around the rhizosphere passioura 1988 read et al 2003 read and gregory 1997 as surface active organic compounds surfactants can alter both surface tension of liquids and contact angle at the solid liquid interface which can further influence both the water flow and the potential transport of contaminants in the vadose zone bashir et al 2008 karagunduz et al 2015 however little research has been undertaken to examine the influence of different microbial

pero 1993 schallmey et al 2004 stahmann et al 2000 thakur et al 2016 first used by hoa in 1981 to measure water content in two dimensional unsaturated sandy porous media the light transmission method ltm is ideal for studying the infiltration process without disturbing the porous media system this non invasive imaging technique is inexpensive and fast responding and provides high resolution with a mininum of acquisition time darnault et al 1998 werth et al 2010 in order to acquire available data a transparent thin enough to be two dimensional system that enables visible light to transmit through is needed a charge coupled device ccd camera is commonly used for data capture in the light transmission method as the resolution is acceptable werth et al 2010 the light intensity data separated from the original rgb image can be converted to the percentage of water saturation based on the calibration equation as a result profiles of water distribution of wetting front and fingered flow during the infiltration process can be obtained and then analyzed for flow characteristics very little study has been undertaken to examine the infiltration process in porous media using the light transmission method and even less to elucidate the influence of microbial exudate on the flow process although plant exudates act as surfactants to influence water flow the effect of microbial exudates upon the infiltration process is unknown therefore a random rain event rather than point source was simulated to mimic natural conditions and to use the light transmission method to investigate the effect of these microbial exudates on preferential flow with different concentrations which relate to different concentrations of biomass when applying real microbes the primary objective of this research entailed an investigation of how different microbial exudates with varying concentrations alter the infiltration process in an unsaturated sand system and the distribution of the soil moisture content specifically the microbial exudates catechol and riboflavin were examined to determine any influence on flow in porous media the surface tension and the contact angle were dynamically monitored to obtain the interfacial properties of exudate solutions and the infiltration experiments were conducted in a homogeneous and initially dry porous media in a two dimensional 2d tank a light transmission method with high spatial and temporal resolution was used to construct the flow patterns and to visualize the water saturation distribution followed by the use of matlab to process the imaging and data analyses 2 material and methods 2 1 microbial exudates solution preparation two solutions of microbial exudate were simulated using catechol and riboflavin the molar

easydrop model instrument krüss hamburg germany was used to measure the contact angle of the different experimental solutions and the easydrop complimentary drop shape analysis software was used to process the data a 5 μl drop of sample was excreted from a 1 ml norm ject syringe fisher scientific waltham ma with an attached needle to form a sessile drop on a glass slide that was continuously measured at 30 s increments when placed in front of a camera for 10 min all samples were conducted in triplicate and the results were recorded in excel a krüss drop shape analyzer apparatus with a needle of approximately 1 8 mm in diameter was then used to experimentally measure the surface tension of the different microbial exudate solutions and the control solution a pendant drop was formed from the tip of the needle and imaged by the camera to determine the interfacial tension measurement in mn m the parameters for embedding phase density air in this case and temperature were adjusted in the setting to 0 0012 g cm3 and 23 c for the surface tension measurements droplets from the sample solutions were measured at 30 s increments in front of the camera over five full minutes all samples were conducted in triplicate and the results were recorded in excel an overview of the experimental parameters and analyses for the interfacial dynamics study is outlined in table 1 2 3 two dimensional tank flow experiment a two dimensional tank with two plates constructed of scratch resistant polycarbonate and an inner dimension of 30 2 cm 1 2 cm 30 8 cm l w h was used for the microbial exudate flow experiments the bottom of the tank on which was layered four pieces of ceramic porous plates for permeability was inclined downward to the left four evenly distributed drainage outlets and one additional outlet at the left corner were also placed within the tank during flow experiments a filter sheet was placed at the bottom to prevent sand clogging and for the proper solutions to drain a picture of the 2d tank with setup is shown in fig 1 astm c778 graded sand with unground silica u s silica company ottawa il was used to fill the tank the physical and chemical characterization of the astm c778 graded sand from the us silica product data sheet are provided in table 2 a sand volume corresponding to the volume of two tanks was loaded into a handmade y shaped sand loader with a piece of cloth within with the loader taped above the tank the cloth was then quickly removed from the tank to create a uniform packing of sand within the tank with a uniform sand bulk density of 1 50 g cm3 the rest of the sand in the loader and the loader were then removed to ensure a consistent density of sand a plastic rod was used to tap the top edge of the tank several times to settle the top sand layer after the tank was loaded with sand the microbial exudate solutions and the control solution were pumped into the tank through a model 77200 60 easy load ii peristaltic pump head masterflex gelsenkirchen germany via a connecting tube at a constant flow rate of 10 ml min solutions were continuously stirred in their containers which were positioned on a ms3002s newclassic balance mettler toledo columbus oh to record the initial and final weights the other end of the tube was connected to an actuator which moved back and forth at a constant speed above the tank two short tube openings were suspended from the actuator and solutions were randomly dropped from either tube to simulate a random rainfall event with an infiltration velocity of 13 12 cm hr into the sand system an overview of the experimental parameters and analyses for the two dimensional tank flow in porous media study is outlined in table 1 2 4 visualization and light transmission method the light transmission method was used to visualize the microbial exudate solution flow pattern within the 2d tank and to measure the spatial and temporal water saturation in porous media a 0 6 m 0 6 m square even glow led panel light fixture with natural white color and a maximum of 2900 lm super bright leds st louis mo was placed behind the 2d tank the entire configuration except for the tank front surface was fully covered by a black plastic sheet to avoid extra light emanation from the side a d5500 dslr camera nikon tokyo japan on a vtsl7200 72 tripod bower long island city ny was placed in front of the tank at a distance to record the transmitted light through the sand column in the 2d tank with a constant flow of exudate solution the camera setting was adjusted to manual to avoid overexposure with the led panel light only activated when both pump and actuator started to function the camera then began imaging automatically every 30 s until the bottom of the tank was saturated and then drained for at least five minutes each flow experiment was performed in duplicate the secondary experimental images of each flow experiment are available for viewing in the supplementary material figures s1 s4 an empirical calibration was conducted in calibration cell tanks 7 6 1 5 8 9 cm packed with sand to a full range of known water saturation percentage values i e 0 5 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 the calibration was performed in triplicate a linear calibration relationship was observed between water saturation and intensity of the transmitted light with an r2 value of 0 96 fig 2 this relationship was also detected by uyusur et al 2015 this linear relationship and resulting equation were then used to transform the intensity values into water saturation values with matlab r2016a the mathworks inc natick ma usa therefore for each flow experiment the intensity values corresponding to 0 and 100 water saturation were acquired and the slope from each experiment was evaluated to the calibration curve to confirm that the empirical calibrations among experiments were similar 2 5 data and imaging analysis for each flow experiment four pictures representing different stages of the main finger formation prior to reaching the tank s bottom were analyzed in addition to the original image at a time of 0 min and a drainage image for calibration purposes matlab was used to process the images specifically to convert rgb red green and blue files to the form in hsv hue saturation and intensity where solely the intensity was used later the imaging method yielded both a high spatial resolution by tracking the main finger formation and a constant temporal response at 30 s intervals both vertical and horizontal water distribution profiles were analyzed along and across the main finger for each stage of development a 30 pixel wide rectangle appearing as a vertical line was drawn through the middle of the main finger to provide a vertical water distribution profile along the length with a second rectangle horizontally drawn across the main finger at 90 of its total length to provide a horizontal water distribution profile regression equations were calculated using the observed linear relationship between the degree of water saturation and the image of transmitted light intensity fig 2 based on the initial dry sand and fully saturated sand images with water saturation degree of 0 and 100 respectively darnault et al 2001 hoa 1981 uyuşur et al 2016 matlab was then used to code the regression equations to calculate the water saturation based on the transmitted light intensity values of each finger an overview of the imaging parameters and analyses for the two dimensional tank flow in the porous media study is outlined in table 1 2 6 statistical analysis interfacial parameters and flow characteristics were examined statistically to make comparisons between types and concentrations of microbial exudate solutions anova was utilized to determine the statistical significance of the experimental factors anova student s t tests with an alpha value of 0 05 were run to determine statistically significant differences among factor means microsoft excel 2010 and jmp pro 12 were used for the statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 contact angle and surface tension 3 1 1 catechol the contact angles for the catechol solutions are shown in fig 3 the lowest concentration of 10 μm catechol solution with 0 01 m nacl exhibited the highest contact angle among the four concentrations an increase in the catechol concentration from 10 μm to 1000 μm reduced the contact angle from 75 2 82 to 69 3 52 at time 0 min successively at approximately 10 min all contact angles decreased and slowly plateaued the initial contact angle of 76 7 1 61 in the 0 01 m nacl control solution suddenly declined and finally exhibited a higher contact angle compared to the solutions with catechol added the measurements of surface tension for catechol solutions in fig 4 show similar results between 72 5 mn m to 74 5 mn m within a period of 5 min the initial surface tension for a 10 μm solution of catechol was greater than the 100 μm and 1000 μm solutions of catechol with the lowest surface tension within the 500 μm solution however within five minutes a slight fluctuation of surface tensions indicated no significant difference overall compared to the control solution of 0 01 m nacl with the surface tension at 73 7 0 04 mn m the 10 μm and 100 μm catechol solutions caused an increase in surface tension whereas the 500 μm and 1000 μm solutions caused a decrease 3 1 2 riboflavin the contact angles for the riboflavin solutions are shown in fig 5 of the four concentrations analyzed the lowest contact angle was for the 10 μm concentration of riboflavin solution with 0 01 m nacl at 0 min and the solution with the 1000 μm concentration exhibited the highest value the contact angle increased from 75 3 0 70 to 80 3 1 47 when the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm the rise of which was concentration dependent and increased in order however when the time approached 10 min all decreasing trends began to plateau although the initial contact angle of the 0 01 m nacl control solution was greater than 10 μm and 100 μm solutions the overall trend was similar to the 10 μm of riboflavin solution in the later stage the surface tensions for riboflavin solutions were then measured continuously every 30 s for 5 min which are shown in fig 6 indicating a lower surface tension with higher riboflavin concentrations these values fluctuated slightly however which failed to indicate any great differences within the range of 73 5 mn m to 75 mn m the initial surface tension decreased from 74 6 0 12 mn m to 73 9 0 25 mn m when the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm the 0 01 m nacl control solution exhibited the lowest surface tension during this five minute interval 3 1 3 microbial exudate solutions versus control the percentage difference in contact angle for catechol and riboflavin solutions compared to the control nacl solution is shown in fig 7 at concentrations of 500 μm and 1000 μm the two microbial exudates exhibited the opposite percentages compared to the baseline of control for example the contact angle for catechol solution was about 11 smaller than the control while it was almost 13 greater than the control for riboflavin solution at 1000 μm similarly the percentage difference in surface tension for catechol and riboflavin solutions compared to the control is plotted in fig 8 at concentrations of 500 μm and 1000 μm the two microbial exudates also showed opposite values although the overall difference in percentage was not large compared to that in the contact angle for example at 500 μm the catechol solution was 0 36 and the riboflavin solution was 0 68 different from the control diverse significant differences were found in contact angle and surface tension values both between types of microbial exudates and among concentrations except for the first minute of contact angle measurement table 3 3 2 profile analysis of the finger development the 2d tank visualizations of the flow experiments representing the microbial exudate dependent infiltration processes were subsequently displayed for water distribution profiles as original rgb images extracted intensity figures and water saturation percentage profiles detailed information about the finger numbers and characteristics are shown in table 4 the results from statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference within the number of fingers and the velocity of finger formation among types and concentrations of solutions table 4 in addition main finger length and width did not significantly differ from each other 3 2 1 catechol vertical and horizontal finger profiles were analyzed for different concentrations of catechol solutions at different stages of the main finger formation these four successive stages beginning at 5 min and ending prior to contact of the primary finger to the tank bottom are shown in their vertical water saturation profiles and respective catechol concentrations fig 9 a to d it was determined from a comparison of the main finger shapes between catechol concentrations that more small branches formed on the two sides of the finger at higher concentrations the finger exhibiting the most tendrils was that observed with the 1000 μm catechol solution while the sides were flat and smooth with the 10 μm solution as the catechol concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm the water saturation percentage at the fingertip increased from approximately 70 to 80 to 90 and finally to full saturation mostly two fingers were formed among the four concentrations of catechol exudate solution in terms of velocity of the main finger development the finger velocity increased from 1 63 cm min at concentration of 10 μm to 2 17 cm min at concentration of 1000 μm in sequence regarding the nacl control solution fig 9 e three fingers were formed which were mostly smooth at two sides and the water saturation percentage at the fingertip was in a similar range with the 500 μm of catechol solution roughly around 90 the horizontal finger profiles of the final stages for four concentrations of catechol as well as the control nacl solution are collectively shown in fig 10 the main finger width at the fingertip was widest for 10 μm catechol solution at 11 72 cm and it decreased to a range of five to seven centimeters at higher concentrations as for the control nacl solution the width was 8 4 cm at the fingertip at 90 of the total length of the main fingers the water saturation percentage profiles suddenly increased and dropped at both sides where the solution failed to reach the sand matrix the middle portion of the water saturation percentage profiles increased from approximately 70 to 80 to 90 and to almost 100 as the catechol concentrations were raised from 10 μm to 1000 μm which was consistent with the vertical profiles 3 2 2 riboflavin vertical and horizontal finger profiles were analyzed for different concentrations of riboflavin solutions at different stages of the main finger formation beginning at 5 min and terminating when the main finger almost contacted the tank bottom the vertical profiles by riboflavin concentration for the four successive stages of finger formation including their original rgb pictures the corresponding intensity figures and the water saturation percentage distribution profiles as well as the nacl control for purposes of comparison are shown in fig 11 an analysis of the main finger shapes indicated a more bulbous main finger within an increase in riboflavin concentration from 10 μm to 500 μm further the water saturation percentage also increased at the fingertip of the riboflavin solutions from 75 to 85 and to 90 as the concentrations increased from 10 μm to 500 μm with the exception of the 1000 μm solution which decreased to 80 each of the four riboflavin concentrations also formed two fingers during which the velocity was the highest 2 07 cm min at 10 μm concentrations and decreased to 1 63 cm min at 1000 μm concentrations for a 1000 μm concentration of riboflavin solution the slightly inclined main finger was relatively thinner compared to the fingers at lower concentrations and it did not exhibit the highest water saturation percentage as did the fingertip in the last stage the highest percentage of water saturation in the nacl control was approximately 90 which was quite close to the 500 μm of the riboflavin solution the horizontal finger profiles for the final stages of the four concentrations of riboflavin and the control nacl solutions are shown in fig 12 the widest main finger width was 9 84 cm at 500 μm with the width decreasing to 6 97 cm a 100 μm and to 6 66 cm at 10 μm an approximate 75 water saturation was observed in the horizontal profiles for the 10 μm solution and it increased to nearly 90 for the 500 μm solution and then decreased to 80 for the 1000 μm solution which were consistent with the vertical profiles 4 discussion microbial exudate as the first step in the simulation of a microbial effect does affect the infiltration process particularly preferential flow through porous media in this research catechol and riboflavin in particular were studied as were the interfacial characteristics of contact angle and surface tension which played an important role in the analysis of the fingering flow process the study of interfacial characteristics of catechol and riboflavin provided the basic information for their linkage to preferential flow features the opposite behaviors in contact angle in addition to different performances in surface tension induced various flow patterns for two exudate solutions among four concentrations at 10 100 500 and 1000 μm figs 7 and 8 the light transmission method was used to correlate the transmitted light intensity to the water saturation percentage which showed significant differences among the finger profiles figs 9 12 and s1 s4 in a homogeneous porous medium preferential flow may lead to a finger shaped wetted zone filled with water and solutes the fully formed fingers generated by gravity driven flow behave like traveling waves i e constant shape and velocity and the water saturation profile of the fully formed fingers exhibits the following pattern a region of high water saturation directly behind the wetting front known as the fingertip i e an overshoot at the fingertip followed by another region of drainage where the water content in the finger decreases to a lower and uniform water saturation known as the finger tail dicarlo 2004 glass et al 1989a liu et al 1994 selker et al 1992 in this study the fingers in the initially dry medium formed wet cores with relatively high water content in contrast to their dry surroundings as initially described by hill and parlange 1972 the movement of the main fingers downward as indicated in the images failed to disturb the widths of the finger cores for a short distance immediately behind the fingertip figs 10 and 12 and s2 and s4 this stasis was due to the drying process behind the fingertip and reduction of matric potential preventing a rapid expansion of the fingers glass et al 1989c similarly an analysis of the relationship between the width and velocity of the finger determined that a higher flow rate led to a wider and faster moving finger glass et al 1989a b in this examination of the flow experiments under similar infiltration rates the physical properties of the microbial exudate solutions were deemed the major cause of variability in the preferential flow paths i e fingered flow the size and shape of the fingers and the water distribution profiles for all the 2d tank experiments provided direct evidence of the influence of the catechol and riboflavin solutions that were analyzed table 4 figs 9 12 and s1 s4 each of the four concentrations of respective microbial exudate solution indicated distinct contact angles and surface tensions table 3 all of which placed different stresses upon the infiltration process and finger formation wetting front instability has been studied under several scenarios most notably that of parlange and hill 1976 who derived modeling equations to predict the width of a finger in an air water system by incorporating the sorptivity and glass and nicholl 1996 who adjusted the equation to fit an air water system this system is expressed as 2 d c π s 2 2 k s θ s θ i 1 1 q s k s where d c is the minimum finger width s is the sorptivity θ s is the saturated water content θ i is the initial water content q s is the flux k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and π is a constant for a 2d system and 4 8 for a 3d system glass et al 1991 wallach et al 2013 it is important to note that the intrinsic sorptivity is independent of the liquid properties philip 1969 wallach et al 2013 scaling of fluid flow in porous media was developed by miller and miller 1956 hydrodynamic scaling in porous media applied to fingered flow may be used to characterize the finger dimension the theoretical analysis of wetting front instability in soils developed by parlange and hill 1976 led to equations that predict the finger dimension i e width in porous media these equations of finger dimension can be scaled using the miller and miller scaling theory 1956 to obtain a scaling equation that can be applied to width of fingers expressed as 3 d ρ g λ σ gl d where ρ is liquid density g is gravitational constant λ is the characteristic media length scale σgl is the gas liquid interfacial tension d is the finger width and d is the scaled finger width glass and nicholl 1996 this scaling equation was previously applied to finger dimensions by varying the characteristic media length scale the liquid density and the gas water interfacial tension selker and schroth 1998 using this scaling equation we compared the finger dimensions obtained in our experiment by performing a scaling based on the density of the microbial exudate solutions relative to the control nacl solution the gas liquid interfacial tension of the microbial exudate solution relative to the control nacl solution and the coupling of both the density and gas liquid interfacial tension of the microbial exudate solution relative to the control nacl solution table 5 scaling results show that the fluid density the gas liquid interfacial tension and the coupling of fluid density and gas liquid interfacial tension did not have a significant influence on the scaling inconsistencies of the finger dimension table 5 as stated by selker and schroth 1998 the cause is related to the consistency of the contact angle among the experiments to be scaled when using the miller and miller scaling theory culligan et al 2005 showed that soil sorptivity is a function of cos θ 1 2 recently an extension of the miller and miller scaling theory to scale sorptivity by contact angle was proposed by wallach and wang 2013 their results showed that the miller and miller equation can be employed for scaling sorptivity by the contact angle i e cos θ 1 2 for uniform pore geometry this is the case here as our experiments are conducted in homogeneous and uniform sandy porous media in which fingered flow occurs based on these findings the finger width was scaled with cos θ 1 2 to account for the synergistic effect between contact and pore geometry table 5 and expressed as 4 d d cos θ 1 2 scaling results show that the use of cos θ 1 2 decreases the scaling inconsistencies of the finger dimension table 5 therefore demonstrating the key contribution of contact angle through the expression of cos θ 1 2 in the development and growth of fingers in porous media the width of fingers as well as the pore scale consideration in unstable gravity driven finger flow steenhuis et al 2013 the number of observed fingers two was similar for each chemical solution table 4 from top to bottom mostly two fingers were formed in the system with the vertical water saturation profiles for the main fingers exhibiting similar patterns figs 9 12 and s1 s4 from top to bottom of the 2d tank these main fingers often encompassed two zones both of which differed from the theoretical finger profile described by glass et al 1989c an ideal finger has three zones of classification indicating a downward migration of the solution in an initially dry medium the conceptual profile transitioned from a zone with a constant degree of water saturation between 50 and 60 to that of an increasing gradient in water saturation and which reached near or full saturation at the fingertip further although only the transition and saturation zones were clearly observed in the vertical water saturation profiles of fingers for catechol and riboflavin solutions all three zones were present in the nacl control solution figs 9 12 and s1 s4 the difference between the control solution and the exudate added solutions indicates a possible increase of the degree of water saturation in porous medium by the microbial exudate prior to saturation it is now known that microbial excreted extracellular polymeric substance eps can increase the holding capacity of soil water morales et al 2010 which is consistent with the findings detailed here specifically an application of eps on soil particles showed an increase in soil water contact angle and a great change in soil matric potential which caused the formation of preferential flows bauters et al 2000 similarly the use of commercially prepared dextran and xanthan to model the microbial exudates of polysaccharides in order to analyze the soil structure and water transport indicated a reduction in water repellency of soils after the microbial exudate treatment czarnes et al 2000 clearly these studies validated the effect of the microbial exudates on the infiltration process that was detailed in this study an analysis of the effect of concentration differences for each microbial exudate solution was also undertaken during the infiltration experiment it is well known that the underground migration of contaminants is closely related to the properties and chemistries of the solution meaning that the solute concentration ionic strength and ph affect both the surface tension and contact angle bashir et al 2009 2008 henry and smith 2002 lord et al 1997 therefore the young laplace equation can be used to express capillary pressure at the pore scale as a function of surface tension and contact angle this equation is expressed as 5 p c 2 γ cos θ r where pc is for the capillary pressure γ and θ are the surface tension and contact angle of a solution respectively and r is the radius of the pore size of medium lord et al 1997 to explain the action of the interfacial forces upon the solution s infiltration process we assumed a constant radius for pore size under various combinations of surface tension and contact angle the capillary pressures would then correspondingly contribute to water flow and distribution changes across the porous medium resulting finally in diverse infiltration processes and finger shapes here a decrease in contact angle at higher concentrations of catechol solution table 3 likely increased the wettability of the porous medium thus causing a greater protrusion of the solution into the dry matrix and quickly reaching conditions of near saturation the slopes of the transition zone shown in the vertical water saturation profiles increase with increasing catechol concentrations which reflect this faster water distribution rate fig 9 based on these horizontal water saturation profiles for the catechol solutions under study the water saturation distribution profile at 90 of the total finger length of the highest catechol concentration of 1000 μm showed the greatest drops at two edges the greatest constancy of degree of water saturation in between and the narrowest width fig 10 as expressed in eq 5 at 1000 μm of catechol solution for example the largest cosine of the contact angle which was given by the smallest contact angle value multiplied by the second small surface tension nearly cancelled out its resulted capillary pressure change figs 3 and 4 therefore the capillary pressure may not be the causative factor in the finger development process among concentrations for catechol a better water holding capacity induced by a catechol solution at higher concentrations may be useful in explaining the greater wettability and water saturation percentage at fingertip and a reduction in drainage to the surrounding dry matrix fig 10 here the water holding capacity resulting from catechol may dominate the preferential flow patterns over the interactive forces that occur at the interfaces of soil water solution and sand grain and of soil water solution and air an increase in contact angle that was observed with an increase in concentration of riboflavin table 3 indicated that more time was required within the medium to form a fully developed main finger due to decreased wettability the difference in the slope of the transition zone the water saturation at the fingertip fig 11 and the horizontal water distribution profile between four riboflavin concentrations was not as apparent as in the catechol solutions fig 12 however a slight increase in saturation percentage at the fingertip and in the overall finger width shown in riboflavin s vertical and horizontal water saturation profiles from 10 μm to 500 μm could still be observed with an exception of 1000 μm where the finger might have been affected by the incline while the surface tension from the catechol solutions indicated no obvious trend among concentrations it decreased when the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 1000 μm fig 6 in the context of equation 5 at 10 μm of riboflavin solution for example the smallest contact angle which led to the largest value of its cosine in addition to the largest surface tension resulted in the largest capillary pressure value figs 5 and 6 at higher concentrations for riboflavin this reducing capillarity pressure therefore enhanced water saturation except for 1000 μm a wider finger width at higher concentration except for 1000 μm may be due to a decrease in water holding capacity with more water diffused into the dry soil matrix moreover by adding chemicals the surface tension of water could decrease and therefore the fingers size would reduce glass et al 1989a although the phenomenon described by glass et al 1988 is opposite to our findings the study above further supports the likelihood that surface tension also plays a role in changing the preferential flow process previous point source experiments have determined that at the same flow rate with a lower contact angle of media the fingers tend to be more bulbous and wider than under a higher contact angle wallach et al 2013 however our observance of the fingers from the catechol and riboflavin solutions figs 9 and 11 indicated a decreased contact angle that narrowed the bulbous finger shapes with an increase in catechol concentration and a decrease in riboflavin concentration table 3 the results presented here may differ from previous work due to the imposed boundary condition of simulated rain event induced infiltration rather than point source dripping infiltration the application of the random rain event completely saturated the top layer consequently the capillary force acting on the wetting front that caused the finger to spread was slightly smaller as compared to the gravitational force therefore for the lower contact angles the bulbous shape failed to persevere as gravity caused the eventual elongation of all fingers to different degrees at the respective contact angles and surface tensions as fingers flow through a porous medium the water carries solutes and nutrients to microbes in pores and in turn the microbes and their exudates possibly affect the finger flow pattern and water distribution as a degraded intermediate of aromatic compound catechol is poisonous and possibly harmful to microbes as the catechol concentration increases from 10 μm to 1000 μm the fingers become narrower and produce more branches fig 10 a possible relationship between microbial behavior and fingering flow may manifest in the microbes metabolizing to more rapidly dispense with the catechol as they increase the contact area to the surrounding matrix and minimize or narrow the internal hold zone for the catechol an increased water saturation percentage at higher concentration may also be useful in catalyzing the chemical reactions in a wet system however riboflavin also serves as a nutrient for microbes specifically in studies with riboflavin at increased concentrations from 10 μm to 1000 μm the fingers were observed to grow wider except for the 1000 μm sample fig 12 a possible explanation is that the riboflavin exudate effect on the preferential flow is tied to the degree to which the microbes favor this nutrient at higher concentrations of riboflavin solution 500 μm microbes might favor this nutrient and wish to retain it for further use which leads to wider fingers and a maximum internal zone however once the concentration reaches 1000 μm which might be too high for microbes the flow pattern becomes narrow again the highest water saturation percentage at 500 μm of concentration observed in profiles created the wettest system for the maximum microbial activity thus far this research used the light transmission method to evaluate the concentration effects of artificial microbial exudates on infiltration process which has not been widely studied the use of the light transmission method an optical imagery system using visible light has been used in such diverse applications as contaminant hydrogeology measurement of flow paths and in determining the velocity of both fluid and solutes and in characterizing both fluid distribution and contaminant transport werth et al 2010 boundary effects on the hydrodynamics process observed in the two dimensional tank may arise from the contact of flow and porous media with the plates these boundary effects are minimized by choosing a sand grain size that is relatively small compared to the width of the two dimensional tank to ensure that sufficient porous media size between the two plates is available for the development of the flow in porous media many such optical methods have been used to evaluate many biotic and abiotic systems in either saturated or unsaturated porous media however very little research has been undertaken on unsaturated systems and only a few studies emphasizing the process of infiltration keller and auset 2007 of the studies analyzing biomass growth microbial and colloidal transport and biofilm process in unsaturated porous media most involved only optical methods to qualitatively visualize pore scale flow or transport with additional results derived from a further model calculation or graphing breakthrough curves auset et al 2005 dunsmore et al 2004 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 the application of the light transmission method in this research directly related image information i e light intensity to flow characteristics i e water saturation percentage quantitatively through calibration the study also filled the gap and expanded the research regarding infiltration process related to microbial activity where the previously mentioned study looked solely at the contact angle influence wallach et al 2013 this paper however was more specific regarding types and concentrations of fluid infiltration as one of the most important processes that occurs in natural systems is worth investigating given its effects on both biotic and abiotic characteristics in the subsurface future research must entail the use of actual microbes and different biomass concentrations which closely corresponds to the various microbial exudate concentrations a departure from the analysis of microbial transport biofilm growth or bioclogging would involve studying the effect of microbial existence on the infiltration process in nearby flowing water furthermore the evolution of the research involving microbes should emphasize the secreted microbial exudates diffusing from those microbes which may cause a change in the water gradient potential around the microbial colony a study using the light transmission method to reveal the microbial exudates distribution around living microbes and to evaluate the relationship between media moisture and exudates diffusion process e g rate would be quite interesting the integration of hysteresis with repeated wetting and drying cycles to investigate the influence of microbes and microbial exudates is also recommended the image and data acquired from imaging techniques will be useful for depicting colony morphology in porous media to show the shifting variations in water content between dry and wet conditions and to explain the water uptake strategies used by microbes under changing media hydrological properties carminati et al 2016 as new bioimaging technology of microbial systems are developed these technologies may be coupled with the light transmission method to study multiscale dynamics of water saturation and transport regulated by microbes the light transmission method may also be used to support research on microbial competition and evolution in natural porous media as this research endeavor will require the development of more realistic models and additional data associated with the physical chemical and microbial characteristics of microenvironments in real porous media baveye and darnault 2017 5 conclusion the important findings of this 2d tank microbial exudate flow study are summarized below the light transmission method is a unique tool allowing the investigation of the synergistic influence of solution chemistry and porous media characteristics on the infiltration process including the unstable fingered flow phenomenon with a high spatial and temporal resolution microbial exudates affected the preferential flow during the infiltration process by forming two zones in the vertical water saturation profiles for both of the artificial exudate added solutions catechol and riboflavin rather than three zones in the nacl control solution this formation occurs perhaps from the enhancement in the water retaining capacity of the porous medium an examination of the infiltration process under the same intake flow rate determined the influence of various concentrations upon the preferential flow which was indicated by different vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation within the fingers the lowest catechol solution concentration 10 μm produced the largest finger width 9 69 cm among the tested catechol solution concentrations while the highest riboflavin solution concentration 1000 μm generated the highest finger width 7 75 cm among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations the results of this study demonstrated the influence of the contact angle expressed as cos θ 1 2 on the application of the theory for hydrodynamic scaling in homogeneous and uniform porous media and applied to the scaling of the finger dimension i e finger width the interfacial measurements and distinguished flow patterns of the two microbial exudates indicated each had a different reaction upon the infiltration process o an increased wettability of the catechol solutions was caused by a reduced contact angle at higher concentrations creating more branches in the fingers that greatly accelerated the time to saturation a faster finger moving velocity a greater water saturation percentage and a narrower finger width were observed at higher concentrations an increase in water holding capacity at higher concentration was hypothesized as the main cause of this phenomenon o the contact angle within the riboflavin solutions increased with a corresponding increase in concentration decreasing the wettability at higher concentrations a slower finger moving velocity a small increase in water saturation percentage at the fingertip and a larger width of the overall finger size was observed as the riboflavin concentration increased from 10 μm to 500 μm the reduced capillarity gave a greater saturation at fingertip at higher concentrations of riboflavin possible relationships between the microbial activity and preferential flow characteristics were assumed according to the properties of chemicals o microbes may try to minimize contact with catechol and tend to affect the preferential flow by narrowing the finger o microbes favor the usage of riboflavin and tend to increase the width of fingers acknowledgments this material is based upon work supported by the u s

7443,the effects of vegetation cover on overland flow and erosion processes on hillslopes vary with vegetation type and spatial distribution and the different vegetation components including the above and below ground biomass however few attempts have been made to quantify how these factors affect erosion processes field experimental plots 5 m 2 m with a slope of approximately 25 were constructed and simulated rainfall 60 mm hr 1 rainfall and simulated rainfall combined with upslope overland flow 20 l min 1 rainfall flow were applied three grass species were planted specifically astragalus adsurgens a adsurgens medicago sativa m sativa and cosmos bipinnatus c bipinnatus to isolate and quantify the relative contributions of the above ground grass parts stems litter cover and leaves and the roots to reducing surface runoff and erosion each of the three grass species was subjected to three treatments intact grass control ig no litter or leaves only the grass stems and roots were reserved nll and only roots remaining or the results showed that planting grass significantly reduced overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield and the mean reductions were 21 8 29 1 and 67 1 respectively m sativa performed the best in controlling water and soil losses due to its thick canopy and dense fine roots grasses reduced soil erosion mainly during the early stage of overland flow generation the above ground grass parts primarily contributed to reducing overland flow rate and velocity with mean relative contributions of 64 and 86 respectively the roots played a predominant role in reducing soil erosion with mean contribution of 84 due to the impact of upslope inflow overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield increased under the rainfall flow conditions the results suggest that grass species on downslope parts of semi arid hillslopes performed better in reducing water and soil losses this study is beneficial for forage selection allocation and management practices such as forage harvesting when implementing restoration strategies to control soil and water losses keywords rainfall simulation overland flow sediment grass roots loess soil china 1 introduction soil erosion by surface runoff is a major environmental problem worldwide vegetation restoration is an important measure in reducing high erosion risks in semi arid areas zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 mcvicar et al 2010 wang et al 2012 duan et al 2016 the impacts of vegetation cover on runoff and erosion depend on the type of vegetation duan et al 2016 its spatial distribution shi et al 2013 wei et al 2014 and the above ground stems leaves and litter covers and below ground roots biomass gyssels et al 2005 vannoppen et al 2015 both the above ground biomass and the roots affect runoff and erosion processes table 1 vegetation cover affects infiltration and overland flow rate in that its above ground parts intercept rainfall dunkerley and booth 1999 dunkerley 2000 and in that its root development increases soil organic matter and macroporosity vegetation cover controls erosion by reducing erosive forces including kinetic raindrops energy wainwright et al 2000 and overland flow velocity and the above ground parts increase hydraulic roughness abrahams et al 1994 pan and shangguan 2006 zhao et al 2015 in addition roots improve soil structure by enhancing formation of aggregates and increasing soil stability and shear strength gyssels et al 2005 vannoppen et al 2015 it is important to isolate and quantify the relative contributions of above ground vegetation parts and roots to reducing surface flow and erosion gyssels and poesen 2003 zhou and shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2016 however little experimental work has been conducted in the field table 1 and some conflicting results have been reported it is usually reported that the above ground grass parts mainly contribute to reducing surface flow whereas grass roots make a greater contribution to reducing soil losses zhou and shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2016 however some researchers have found that the effects of grass roots and the above ground parts on reducing soil erosion were almost equivalent zhang et al 2014 in some cases the effect of roots on reducing erosion were found to be less important than that of the above ground parts gyssels et al 2005 the discrepancies may be related to the differences in plant morphology among the different grass species studied few studies have been conducted and further exploration is needed to examine the effects of different grass species that have different morphological traits both above and below ground on infiltration overland flow velocity and sediment yield the relative importance of above ground grass parts and roots on runoff and erosion likely also depend on the erosion processes considered de baets and poesen 2010 vannoppen et al 2015 gyssels et al 2005 reported that the plant roots were more effective in controlling rill erosion and gully erosion whereas the above ground plant parts were more effective in reducing splash detachment and interrill erosion rates therefore experimental work that simulates different erosion processes is capable of providing evidence for a better understanding of the role of different grass components in hydrological and erosion processes runoff generation and erosion processes on hillslopes are closely related to slope positions as downslope parts tend to be affected by accumulated surface flow and sediment transported from farther upslope cerdà 1998 numerous studies have examined the effects of spatially distributed vegetation cover on reducing water and soil losses at the plot scale cerdà 1998 rey 2003 calvo cases et al 2003 ruiz sinoga et al 2010 wei et al 2014 and the catchment scale shi et al 2013 2014 some studies have found that vegetation on the lower portions of slopes reduces surface flow and sediment to a greater degree than those on the upper and middle positions wei et al 2014 ding and li 2016 however some studies have shown that the impacts of vegetation cover on runoff generation and erosion are independent of slope position cerdà 1998 ruiz sinoga et al 2010 the differences are associated with the wide range of soil types vegetation types and measuring methodologies used in different studies few experimental data or direct measurements have been collected to examine whether the impacts of different vegetation components on reducing erosion differ with slope positions in addition most previous studies applied simply simulated rainfall or inflow to vegetated plots at different slope positions on hillslopes to examine the effects of the spatial distribution of vegetation in reducing water and soil losses cerdà 1998 wei et al 2014 ding and li 2016 few studies have emphasized the importance of the combined effects of rainfall and upslope inflow further field work is necessary to study the combined effects of these factors in order to provide empirical evidence for the optimal location of vegetation along hillslope profiles to better conserve water and soil the loess plateau of china is one of the hotpots having severe soil erosion threats in the world and it experiences an average annual soil loss of 2000 2500 t km2 shi and shao 2000 approximately 60 70 of the annual precipitation in this region falls between july and september most of which is in the form of heavy rainstorms the resulted surface runoff is one of the main reasons for the severe soil erosion observed on the loess plateau of china shi and shao 2000 designing and implementing effective measures to retain surface runoff for infiltration is important in reducing soil losses the grain for green project has been carried out in china since 1999 to mitigate environmental degradation by converting cultivated land with slopes of 25 or greater to grass or forest lands mcvicar et al 2007 grass restoration as the start of successional re vegetation strategies is beneficial for vegetation restoration mcvicar et al 2010 on the steep slopes of the loess plateau a positive feedback of such re vegetation scheme is the reduction of stream discharge and erosion risks wang et al 2012 liu and mcvicar 2012 however bans on grazing have adverse impacts on the incomes of local farmers which in turn affect their enthusiasm for participating in the project pan et al 2006 harvesting of forage material to feed animals has been proposed to improve the livelihoods of the local residents an evaluation of the impacts of such practices on runoff and erosion risks is needed there are also concerns about the selection of optimal grass species and the spatial extent of areas that should be involved in re vegetation activities mcvicar et al 2010 duan et al 2016 to maximize the impact of grass on reducing erosion and sustainable vegetation restoration the growing body of research and practical concerns on restoration management practices identify three key issues related to the impacts of vegetation cover on hillslope runoff and erosion these issues are 1 the effect of vegetation restoration on runoff control 2 the relative importance of different vegetation components on reducing erosion and 3 the effects of the distribution of vegetation on hillslopes on runoff and erosion key papers that discuss these factors are summarized in table 1 there is a need to assess these three issues through integrated and systematic analyses the main aim of this paper is to address all three of the issues mentioned above simultaneously compare this to previous studies that only addressed one or at best two of the abovementioned three issues the findings are expected to contribute to our understanding of re vegetation management practices for use in soil and water conservation in semi arid areas this paper has three main objectives i to clarify the effects of grass restoration on runoff control ii to illustrate the relative importance of different grass components in reducing erosion and iii to investigate the impacts of grass distribution on hillslope on reducing surface runoff and erosion 2 study site and hillslope treatment 2 1 study site the study area is located in the hilly loess area of northern china and near the guanting reservoir fig 1 a the guanting reservoir was built in the early 1950 s and had long served as a water source for beijing city however it failed to meet the standards for water sources starting in 1997 due to severe soil erosion problem the mean annual loss rates were approximately 2500 t km 2 yr 1 between 1950 and 1980 liu et al 2008 resulting in deteriorated water quality and reservoir sedimentation the severe erosion is mainly caused by highly erodible loess soil sparse vegetation cover and high intensity rainstorms the region is one of the key areas for implementing soil and water conservation projects in china the field experiments were conducted at the huailai field ecological station 115 37 01 e 40 15 32 n that is affiliated with the state key laboratory of earth surface processes and resource ecology beijing normal university the climate is semi arid with mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 9 c based on locally recorded data covering the period from 1950 to 2000 the mean annual precipitation ranges from 370 to 480 mm 1950 2000 most of which occurs as short duration and high intensity rainstorms in the summer months 2 2 grass plots to avoid uncertainties caused by differences in slope aspect and original soil property a north facing loess hillslope that is approximately 30 m long and 20 m wide with uniform soil properties was selected as the study site fig 1 b before planting the studied grass species on the hillslope artificial surface levelling was undertaken to minimize the impact of microtopographic changes the hillslope has a rectilinear shape with a slope gradient of approximately 25 table 2 presents the basic physical and chemical properties of the soil in the 0 10 cm layer of the experimental hillslope the particle size distribution of the tested soils 0 10 cm is shown in fig 2 the soil was loamy with mean sand silt and clay contents of 38 79 0 72 41 92 0 86 and 19 50 0 59 respectively three grass species used for grazing table 3 astragalus adsurgens a adsurgens medicago sativa m sativa and cosmos bipinnatus c bipinnatus were planted on the hillslope for research purposes the grass species were selected due to their high drought tolerance and wide application in reducing runoff and erosion risks in semi arid areas equal weights of seeds for the three grass species were planted parallel to the contour of the hillslope and with a row spacing of 20 cm after two years of growth the grass species were approximately 30 cm in height 85 in coverage as determined by digital image analysis and had a mean density of approximately 150 stands per m2 a litter layer that was 1 mm in thickness was distributed randomly over the surfaces of the a adsurgens and m sativa plots whereas minor litter cover was observed for the c bipinnatus plot to address the first objective four runoff plots were constructed with different ground covers including a adsurgens m sativa c bipinnatus bare soil was used as a reference fig 1 b the experimental plots were established by carefully inserting 30 cm high pvc sheets 10 cm into the soil and each plot had dimensions of 10 m2 5 m 2 m for the second objective the three grass species were subjected to three different treatments one treatment was performed with the intact grass control ig as a reference one treatment involved carefully removing the litter cover and leaves of the grass and leaving the stems and roots of the grass nll fig 1 d and another one was cutting the stems to the ground surface leaving only the roots or fig 1 e the successive removal of the above ground grass parts was designed to satisfy the experimental criterion of homogeneous plant properties e g plant density and root density which is necessary if the effects of different grass parts are to be isolated to meet the third research objective field experiments involving four plots including one that was bare and three that were subjected to different treatments ig nll and or for each grass species were conducted under two conditions simulated rainfall 60 mm h 1 rainfall and simulated rainfall combined with upslope overland flow 10 l m 1 min 1 rainfall flow in the study area where the rainfall runoff process is dominated by infiltration excess overland flow the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions were assumed to represent the upper slope and lower slope positions along a long hillslope when assuming the infiltration rate during the steady state overland flow stage is half of the rainfall intensity 30 mm h 1 the simulated upslope inflow with a rate of 10 l m 1 min 1 indicates an upslope contributing area of 40 m2 20 m in length and 2 m in width compared with the rainfall event the rainfall flow event represents a plot 20 m downslope from the crest of the hillslope which corresponds to the lower slope position on natural hillslopes that are normally 25 35 m in length inflows of clear water were used due to their similarity in terms of overland flow shear stress and stream power with silt laden flow zhang et al 2010 the experiments were conducted first with the rainfall and subsequently the rainfall flow to minimize the differences in initial surface conditions 3 experimental methods and data analysis 3 1 experimental set ups a portable spray type rainfall simulator developed by the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences bian et al 2011 was applied the rainfall simulator consists of two opposite sprayers with nozzles to form raindrops manometers to control water pressure two tripods held together with stainless steel tubes to support the sprayers and a pump that delivers water to the sprayers the rainfall simulator can simulate rainfall with an intensity ranging from 10 to 180 mm h 1 by adjusting nozzle size 3 0 14 0 mm and water pressure 0 10 0 15 mpa the simulator has a coverage of rainfall area ranging from 12 m2 4 m 3 m to 24 m2 8 m 3 m a constant intensity of 60 3 mm hr 1 rainfall was applied over a duration of with 1 h the pattern of temporal fluctuations in intensity during a rainfall event has been widely reported to affect infiltration and overland flow responses dunkerley 2012 2017 however since our rainfall simulator failed to deliver smooth changes in rainfall intensity it is more feasible to apply a constant intensity to create replicate rainfall events in a controlled way the simulated rainfall has an intensity of 60 mm h 1 and a duration of 1 h that represents a one in five year rain event jiang 1997 this type of rainfall was selected to simulate typical short duration and high intensity rainstorm that makes great contributions to annual precipitation and soil losses in many hilly loess areas of china shi and shao 2000 calibrations of the rainfall intensity and uniformity were conducted prior to running the experiments the raindrops were produced by two opposite nozzles that had an inside diameter of 7 mm and at a distance of 7 m at the water pressure of 0 15 mpa the two nozzles were 4 1 m above the soil surface and the falling height of the raindrops was 5 5 m with a uniformity of 85 the drop size distribution of the simulated rainfall was measured using the stain method and the d50 of the rainfall at 60 mm h 1 ranged from 1 0 to 1 5 mm which aligns with natural drop size distributions for this rainfall intensity xu et al 2004 2006 the velocity of falling raindrops was 4 85 m s 1 laws 1941 and the mean kinetic energy was calculated as 0 238 j m 2 s 1 xu et al 2006 the field experiments were conducted during the summer months under hot conditions with maximum daily temperature of approximately 30 c the majority of the experiments were performed in the early morning and started shortly after sunrise at 06 00 am at that time of day the relative humidity was higher than during the hot afternoon conditions and the wind disturbance was minimal a trough was constructed using a pvc pipe 2 0 m in length and 0 15 m in diameter with a row of equally spaced 1 cm grooves 1 5 cm in length and 0 5 cm in width along its length the trough was installed horizontally at the top of each plot and upslope inflow entered the runoff plots evenly by overflowing through the grooves a plastic water tank with constant water head was used to supply water the inflow rate was maintained using a valve at a value of 10 l m 1 min 1 in response to the rainfall intensity and the ratio of upslope to downslope area 2 1 3 2 experimental processes and measurements before each test a soil auger with a diameter of 1 cm was used to determine the antecedent soil moisture content and bulk density within 10 cm of the soil surface three soil samples were collected from the upper middle and lower parts of each plot and the antecedent soil gravimetric moisture content table 2 was measured by oven drying at 105 c until a constant weight was achieved the antecedent soil volumetric moisture content was derived through multiplying the antecedent soil gravimetric moisture by the soil bulk density to minimize the differences in antecedent soil water content the soil moisture content of the topsoil 0 10 cm within the plot for all of the treatments was adjusted gravimetrically to approximately 13 g g 1 at the beginning of the rainfall simulation experiments during the experimental process each test lasted 60 min after overland flow initiation a pvc runoff collector was set at the bottom of each plot runoff samples were collected using plastic buckets every 4 min and a total of 15 runoff samples were collected after each test the amount of runoff in each bucket was measured the suspended sediment was deposited separated from the water transferred to iron basins and dried in a forced air oven at 105 c to a constant weight the overland flow rate and sediment yields were subsequently calculated dye tracing method was used to measure surface flow velocities by recording time required a reading resolution of 0 01 s for leading edge of the colouration of a kmno4 solution to travel across a marked distance 1 m each 5 m long experimental plot was divided into three measured cross sections namely 0 5 1 5 m 2 0 3 0 m and 3 5 4 5 m from upslope to downslope four parallel measured lines were made for each measured cross section with an interval of 0 5 m 12 travel times with three replicates were measured for the whole plot measurements were performed along the slope length from the lower to the upper position of each plot to avoid possible observation errors caused by progress of dye solution from upslope to downslope nine measurements were performed for the whole plot during each test and 3 tests each were performed during the 0 10 min 10 30 min and 30 60 min intervals of the whole experimental process respectively each treatment plot was exposed to natural conditions drying under windy conditions and in full sun at approximately 30 c for 2 days longer when natural rainfall occurred after the test in order to enable the natural weathering processes of the surface soil to operate photos of soil surface were taken from multiple angles within the bare soil plot and bare inter canopy patches within the grassed plots for areas with rills the morphological characteristics of the rills including their locations within the plot and their lengths widths and depths were measured the measurements were conducted continuously along the length of each rill at an interval of 5 10 cm artificial filling of the rills using soil collected from adjacent areas outside the plot was subsequently carefully undertaken followed by compaction of the infilled soil there was a good mixture of the original soil and newly added soil and rills did not tend to occur at the same locations during subsequent tests artificial levelling was undertaken to minimize the differences in microtopographic changes resulting from one experimental test these measures were taken to make the whole plot uniform from the upper to the lower slope positions with a slope of approximately 25 and to enable achievement of similar antecedent surface conditions including slope soil moisture and bulk density 3 3 data analysis the instantaneous soil infiltration rate fi was calculated using the following formula 1 f i icos θ f 10 r i st where i is the rainfall intensity mm min 1 θ is the slope f is the upslope inflow rate mm min 1 ri is the ith runoff volume collected ml s is the plot area cm2 t is the time interval between the collection of successive runoff samples min and the factor 10 is an adjusting coefficient the overland flow depths were not measured directly due to the physical difficulties slippy surface the disturbance of raindrops on shallow overland flow steep slope dense vegetation cover of doing measurements within the relatively large plot area 10 m2 in the field the mean overland flow depth was estimated by using the equation 2 h q v q v bt where h is the flow depth cm q is the unit discharge cm2 s 1 q is the runoff volume during time t ml b is the width of the water cross section cm and v is the mean flow velocity cm s 1 for a laminar flow profile vertical velocity distribution can be calculated using a quadratic equation that assumes zero velocity at the bed and maximum velocity at the surface katz et al 1995 the theoretical relationship between the profile mean velocity v and the measured maximum surface velocity vs was expressed as v 0 67vs li et al 1996 the correction factor between mean velocity and surface velocity depends on reynolds number water depth sediment concentration and bed roughness pan et al 2015 dunkerley 2001 but in this study a fixed correction factor with the value of 0 67 that is widely used for laminar flow was adopted li et al 1996 the effects of the three grass species i 1 2 3 that had received three different treatments j 1 2 3 on reducing overland flow rates and velocities and sediment yields were calculated as 3 cr ij r b r ij r b 100 4 cv ij v b v ij v b 100 5 cs ij s b s ij s b 100 where crij cvij and

indicate the effectiveness of different grass species i 1 2 3 under different treatments ig nll and or in reducing overland flow rate the contributions of different grass parts to reducing overland flow velocity and sediment yield can be derived and the forms of the equations are similar to those of eqs 6 9 datasets were tested for normality using the anderson darling normality test and student s t test or the mann whitney u test were applied to test for a significant difference in the means or the medians of the studied response variables between two treatments all statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 4 results 4 1 runoff and infiltration compared with the bare soil plot the grassed plots a adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus that had received different treatments ig nll and or exhibited an increase in the infiltration rate and a decrease in the overland flow rate table 4 the grassed plots with intact grass control significantly p 0 05 reduced overland flow rate by 12 7 36 8 under the rainfall condition and by 11 6 32 2 under the rainfall flow condition fig 3 this result showed that planting forage grass effectively reduces surface runoff and enhances soil infiltration the m sativa plot had significantly p 0 05 higher infiltration rate table 4 and overland flow rate reduction fig 3 than those of the a adsurgens and c bipinnatus plots when the above ground grass parts were removed there were an increase in the overland flow rate and a decrease in the infiltration table 4 for all three of the grass species the ig treatment the intact grass control displayed the highest overland flow rate reduction followed by the nll treatment no litter or leaves and the or treatment in which only the roots were reserved fig 3 under both the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions significant differences p 0 05 were found in the overland flow rate reduction among the three treatments ig nll and or for the m sativa plot fig 3 the time required for overland flow initiation was generally 2 min for all of the treatments the temporal patterns of soil infiltration showed that infiltration rates were highest at the initiation of overland flow and subsequently decreased gradually under the rainfall condition and more rapidly under the rainfall flow condition fig 4 a more rapidly decrease in the infiltration rate was found for the bare soil plot than that for the grassed plots fig 4 for the grass plots that had been subjected to different treatments the ig treatment generally produced higher infiltration rates than those of the nll and ro treatments fig 4 and table 4 significantly greater p 0 05 infiltration rates were found for all of the treatments under the rainfall flow condition compared with those under the rainfall condition table 4 the simulated upslope inflow contributed to an increase in infiltration with the contributions ranging from 33 to 62 4 2 overland flow velocity the mean overland flow velocities for the bare soil plot were 0 22 and 0 35 m s 1 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 4 the grassed plots had significantly lower p 0 05 overland flow velocities than the bare soil plot table 4 with 9 3 44 8 less under the rainfall condition and 11 4 44 4 less under the rainfall flow condition fig 5 statistical analysis results showed that the differences in the overland flow velocities among the three grass species a adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus were significant at p 0 05 the c bipinnatus plot had the greatest overland flow velocity followed by the m sativa and a adsurgens plots table 4 due to the impact of simulated upslope inflow significantly higher p 0 05 overland flow velocities were found under the rainfall flow condition than those under the rainfall condition table 4 the overland flow velocity for each grass type generally increased with the removal of the above ground grass parts table 4 for the a adsurgens and m sativa plots there were significant differences in the overland flow velocity reductions among the ig nll and or treatments p 0 05 for the c bipinnatus plot no significant differences were found in the overland flow velocity reduction among the three treatments under the rainfall condition p 0 05 the ig and nll treatments of the c bipinnatus plot under the rainfall flow condition produced the similar overland flow velocity reductions p 0 084 which were significantly higher p 0 05 than that of the or treatment fig 5 4 3 sediment yield compared with the bare soil plot the grassed plots that had been subjected to different treatments ig nll and or significantly reduced the sediment yield rates p 0 05 table 4 the percent reductions of the grass species with ig treatments ranged from 57 6 to 84 6 under the rainfall condition and from 55 1 to 75 2 under the rainfall flow condition fig 6 m sativa performed better in reducing the sediment yield than c bipinnatus and a adsurgens fig 6 the sediment yields for all of the three grass species generally increased with the cutting of the above ground grass parts table 4 no significant differences p 0 05 were found in the sediment yield reductions between the ig and nll treatments for any of the grassed plots fig 6 indicating that litter cover and leaves had no significant impacts on reducing soil erosion for the c bipinnatus plot rainfall and the a adsurgens and m sativa plots rainfall flow the sediment yield reductions for the or treatment were significantly lower p 0 05 than those for the nll treatments showing a significant effect of stems on reducing soil losses the temporal variations in the sediment yield are shown in fig 7 sediment yields increased rapidly during the early stage of overland flow generation and then decreased to an almost constant value fig 7 for the bare soil plot the sediment yield rate was the highest during the early stage 0 20 min rates of 75 27 and 197 90 g m 2 min 1 were observed under the rainfall and the rainfall flow conditions respectively table 5 the sediment yields were generally low table 5 and showed little variation fig 7 during the middle stage 20 40 min and the late stage 40 60 min for the three grassed plots that had been subjected to different treatments the sediment yields initially increased and subsequently decreased with fluctuations to a steady state compared with the bare soil plot the observed decreases in sediment yield rates in the grassed plots mainly occurred during the early stages 0 20 min with the mean reductions of 51 and 99 under the rainfall and the rainfall flow conditions respectively table 5 the sediment yields increased significantly p 0 05 from the rainfall condition to the rainfall flow condition table 4 the effects of inflow on erosion mainly occurred during the early stage 0 20 min table 5 with the mean contribution of 48 that is higher than 31 of the middle stage 20 40 min and 21 of the late stage 40 60 min compared to the rainfall condition the grass impact on sediment reduction was greater under the rainfall flow condition table 4 in particular during the early stage 0 20 min table 5 4 4 contributions of the different vegetation components the contributions of the different parts of grass to reducing overland flow rate overland flow velocity and sediment yield are shown in table 6 and fig 8 the above ground grass parts mainly contributed to reducing overland flow rates and velocities whereas the roots contributed more to reducing sediment yields table 6 relatively the above ground grass parts made higher contributions to reducing overland flow rate with the mean value of 64 of the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 a of the above ground grass parts the effect of the stems on reducing overland flow rate was greater than that of the litter cover and leaves table 6 the above ground parts significantly p 0 05 reduced the overland flow velocity with the mean reductions of 24 7 and 25 2 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 6 the intact grass contributed to reducing the mean sediment yields by 70 1 and 64 1 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively the grass roots played a predominant role in reducing soil erosion with the mean relative contribution of 84 for both the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 c of the three grass species m sativa showed the greatest reduction in overland flow rate resulting from the impact of the above ground parts of m sativa which accounted for an average of 72 of the total overland flow rate reduction for the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 a the effects of all of the above ground parts of m sativa were significant p 0 05 in reducing overland flow rate table 6 in terms of overland flow velocity reduction a adsurgens produced greater values than those of m sativa and c bipinnatus for both a adsurgens and m sativa the above ground parts litter leaves and stems had a significant impact on reducing surface velocity p 0 05 m sativa showed the highest sediment yield reduction with the mean value of 79 9 for the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions followed by c bipinnatus mean 65 1 and a adsurgens mean 56 4 table 6 the significant effect of m sativa in reducing sediment yields is mainly caused by its roots development which contributed 89 and 88 to sediment yield reductions under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively fig 8 c the contributions of the above ground parts to reducing overland flow rate and velocity were on average higher under the rainfall flow condition than the rainfall condition table 6 the roots made contributions of 60 8 and 52 3 to reducing erosion under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 6 5 discussion 5 1 the effects of grass restoration on runoff the grassed plots had a significantly higher infiltration rate than that of the bare soil plot which had sealing of the soil surface by raindrop impacts and lower soil porosity table 2 for the plots with grass the above ground grass parts significantly reduced p 0 05 the overland flow velocity table 6 the grass root networks taproot system of the a adsurgens and fibrous root systems of the m sativa and c bipinnatus increased the soil porosity table 2 that enhanced infiltration the interception of precipitation by the grass litter leaves and stems is also important in preventing surface sealing and the development of crust as it reduces the kinetic energy of the raindrops reaching the soil surface abrahams et al 2003 wainwright et al 2000 the three grass species significantly p 0 05 reduced overland flow rates and velocities compared to the bare soil indicating that the planting of forage grass plays an important role in reducing water losses in the study area in many semi arid areas the majority of precipitation occurs as high intensity and short duration summer rainstorms the storm pattern has raised considerable concern about increasing risks of flood and erosion shi and shao 2000 our study showed that planting of forage grass is important in strengthening soil infiltration capacity by increasing soil porosity through the development of roots and reducing overland flow velocity and development of soil crusts through the grass leaves and stems compared to c bipinnatus and a adsurgens m sativa displayed a significantly greater p 0 05 infiltration rate table 4 and a better performance in overland flow rate reduction table 6 this favorable effect of m sativa on reducing overland flow rate was primarily caused by the development of its above ground parts during the early stages of plant growth m sativa showed a faster growth rate with a relatively dense litter cover and a thick canopy than the other grass species the leaves of m sativa were clustered which resulted in a high leaf area index these plant characteristics are beneficial for m sativa reducing overland flow velocity table 6 and intercepting rainfall in many hilly loess regions of china with arid and semi arid climates the survival and growth of vegetation is limited by water availability mcvicar et al 2010 the favorable effects of m sativa in promoting soil infiltration and overland flow velocity retardation is beneficial for successional restoration and the ecological functions of soil and water conservation the above ground grass parts performed better in reducing overland flow rate and velocity than the grass roots the mean relative contributions of the stems litter cover and leaves were 44 and 42 to reducing the overland flow velocity fig 8 b for grassed slopes the friction resistance attributed to grass stems litter and leaves commonly represents the main resistance component abrahams et al 1994 pan et al 2016 a minor reduction in overland flow velocity caused by the above ground grass parts appeared to lead to a significant increase in hydraulic roughness of the surface estimated by the darcy weisbach friction factor f 8 gθq v3 the above ground parts of forage grass are important for increasing surface roughness and reducing overland flow velocity and these results are beneficial for soil water retention and infiltration into deep soil 5 2 the importance of different grass components on controlling erosion with the removal of the above ground grass parts litter leaves and stems the average infiltration rate decreased table 4 resulted from an increase in overland flow velocity table 4 and soil crust formation because of lack of rainfall interception by above ground grass parts the grassed plots significantly p 0 05 reduced sediment yields by 67 1 on average compared to the bare soil plot table 6 grass is more effective in reducing soil erosion than surface flow table 6 of the three grass species m sativa performed the best in reducing erosion with the average erosion reducing effect of 79 9 table 6 resulting from its system of fine dense roots 1 mm in diameter that contributed an average of 88 to the total reduction in soil erosion fig 8 c the high density of fine roots improved the soil structure causing it to show high resistance to flow wash gyssels et al 2005 vannoppen et al 2015 m sativa was efficient in facilitating surface water infiltration and retention through the action of its above ground parts and in protecting soil from being eroded through its root system these results are beneficial for ecological restoration operations on degraded lands within the study area the average erosion reducing effect of a adsurgens was 56 4 table 6 which is the lowest of the three grass species the root networks of a adsurgens consist of a tap root system with primarily central and vertical main roots but limited lateral and branching fine roots which are responsible for the low roots contribution to reducing soil erosion table 6 similar results have been reported by de baets et al 2007 who found that fibrous roots are more effective in reducing soil erosion than tap roots c bipinnatus showed a good performance in reducing soil erosion table 6 which is caused by the relatively dense fine roots and the associated enhancements in soil structure and low erodibility the roots played a predominant role in reducing erosion table 6 with the mean relative contribution of 84 for the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 c the findings are in agreement with those of previous studies conducted under similar experimental conditions e g zhou and shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2016 the fundamental role of grass roots in protecting soil against water erosion is related to their ability to enhance soil stability by physically binding soil particles and aggregates de baets et al 2006 and to improve soil strength knapen et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 in arid and semi arid environments vegetation cover is sparse and the above ground biomass can temporarily disappear because of overgrazing or harvesting de baets and poesen 2010 our results imply that grass roots are still effective in controlling soil erosion in the study area even when the above ground grass parts are not well developed or have been harvested for raising livestock the presence of roots is key to erosion prevention it is thus suggested that the protection of roots and increasing the plant root density in topsoil is a viable erosion control strategy during the early stages of plant growth our study showed that the above ground grass parts had a minor impact on reducing soil erosion table 6 which is related to the incompletely developed above ground grass parts during the early stage of plant growth however it is not known whether the effect of the above ground parts on reducing soil losses increases when the shoots develop abundantly further exploration of whether there is a shift in importance between the above ground grass parts and the roots as the plants grows is merited 5 3 the impacts of grass distribution on hillslope on controlling runoff and erosion there was an increase in the infiltration rate from rainfall to rainfall flow conditions table 4 there are three possible reasons first an increase in the mean overland flow depth mean value of 0 27 mm for the rainfall events and of 0 93 mm for the rainfall flow events with higher water pressure and greater inundation area is beneficial for water infiltration second the greater flow resistance under the rainfall flow conditions contributed to prolonging the infiltrating time another possible reason is that less crust would be developed under the rainfall flow condition than the rainfall condition because of the significantly greater overland flow velocity table 4 and reduced kinetic energy of the raindrops through deeper overland flow table 4 disturbance due to the impact of the applied upslope inflow the overland flow rates and velocities and erosion rates for the rainfall flow conditions increased significantly p 0 05 compared to those of the rainfall conditions table 4 this result is associated with the presence of well connected flow pathways under the rainfall flow conditions flow paths began to develop at the upper end of the plots due to the impact of upslope simulated inflow and quickly developed into efficient pathways for overland flow during the first 20 min of the experiments table 5 similar findings have been reported by previous studies gilley et al 1985 parsons et al 1994 these results highlight the impacts of upslope inflow on flow sourcing sediment entrainment and transport downslope in many hilly loess areas of china landscapes with steep slopes 25 and long slope lengths 30 m are one of the basic geographic characteristics that induce a large amount of surface runoff from upslope areas effective grass restoration strategies that are intended to reduce flow from upslope would reduce water and soil losses from entire slopes the grass species under the rainfall flow conditions had a greater reduction in erosion than that under the rainfall conditions table 4 especially during the early stage 0 20 min table 5 there are two possible explanations first the grass located downslope prevented more erosion caused by rills for the bare soil plot the contribution of rill erosion to total erosion increased significantly from 20 0 under the rainfall condition to 83 9 under the rainfall flow condition due to the impact of grass plantation no apparent rills occurred within the plot under the rainfall flow condition second improved soil structure with grass roots is highly resistant to flow wash under high flow condition the mean contributions of grass roots to reducing sediment yields increased from 29 83 g m 2 min 1 under the rainfall condition to 43 73 g m 2 min 1 under the rainfall flow condition table 4 these results showed that the grass roots had the ability to protect the soils from erosion under the additional inflow conditions when extended to the catchment scale this study suggests that re vegetation downslope is more effective in reducing sediment yields from a hillslope to the streams downslope the effects of the above ground grass parts on reducing overland flow rate and velocity were on average higher under the rainfall flow condition than the rainfall condition table 6 the reason is that the hydraulic roughness contributed by the above ground grass parts which dominates in the total resistance abrahams et al 1994 pan et al 2016 increased from low flow to high flow conditions due to an increase in flow depth table 4 and greater submergence of the above ground grass parts roots were highly effective in reducing erosion with relative contributions of 87 and 80 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 6 showing that grass roots were effective in reducing soil detachment capacity under both low and high runoff conditions roots were effective in controlling interrill erosion that is dominant within upslope regions and concentrated flow erosion that mainly occurs within downslope regions these findings are in agreement with those reported by previous studies zhou and shangguan 2007 gyssels and poesen 2003 vannoppen et al 2015 this study showed that management practices such as harvesting the above ground forage parts for feeding livestock by local farmers would have a minor impact on the ability of grass to control soil erosion it is important to emphasize that the present experiments were performed under simulated rainfall conditions with and without upslope inflow to simulate the upslope and downslope portions of a long hillslope given the wide range of characteristics of upslope inflow in terms of flow rate overland flow velocity and sediment concentration a wider range of test conditions is required in future studies to further our understanding of the impacts of slope positions on runoff and erosion processes 6 conclusions field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on grassed plots that had received different treatments to investigate the effectiveness of different grass components and the effect of the distribution of grass on hillslopes on reducing overland flow and erosion the main findings are listed below 1 the three grass species astragalus adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus evaluated in this study were effective in reducing water and soil losses compared to the bare soil plot the mean overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield for the grassed plots were reduced by 21 8 29 1 and 67 1 respectively grass is more effective in reducing soil erosion than surface flow of the three grass species m sativa performed the best in enhancing infiltration reducing overland flow velocity and soil losses mainly due to its thick canopy and dense fine roots 1 mm in diameter the findings are beneficial for selection of forage species when implementing forage restoration to reduce runoff and erosion risks in the region 2 the above ground grass parts displayed better performance in reducing overland flow rate and velocity with mean relative contributions of 64 and 86 respectively the effect of the above ground parts on reducing erosion was minor during the early stages of plant growth the roots mainly contributed to reducing soil erosion with mean contribution of 84 increasing plant root density is important in preventing soil erosion in semi arid environments where vegetation cover is sparse 3 the downslope system had a higher retention capacity for water retention and storage that is beneficial for growth of forage grass due to the impact of upslope inflow overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield increased we suggest that grass in downslope positions performed better in controlling water and soil losses acknowledgements the authors wish to thank all of the technicians involved in field and laboratory work this research is jointly funded by the national natural science foundation of china

7443,the effects of vegetation cover on overland flow and erosion processes on hillslopes vary with vegetation type and spatial distribution and the different vegetation components including the above and below ground biomass however few attempts have been made to quantify how these factors affect erosion processes field experimental plots 5 m 2 m with a slope of approximately 25 were constructed and simulated rainfall 60 mm hr 1 rainfall and simulated rainfall combined with upslope overland flow 20 l min 1 rainfall flow were applied three grass species were planted specifically astragalus adsurgens a adsurgens medicago sativa m sativa and cosmos bipinnatus c bipinnatus to isolate and quantify the relative contributions of the above ground grass parts stems litter cover and leaves and the roots to reducing surface runoff and erosion each of the three grass species was subjected to three treatments intact grass control ig no litter or leaves only the grass stems and roots were reserved nll and only roots remaining or the results showed that planting grass significantly reduced overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield and the mean reductions were 21 8 29 1 and 67 1 respectively m sativa performed the best in controlling water and soil losses due to its thick canopy and dense fine roots grasses reduced soil erosion mainly during the early stage of overland flow generation the above ground grass parts primarily contributed to reducing overland flow rate and velocity with mean relative contributions of 64 and 86 respectively the roots played a predominant role in reducing soil erosion with mean contribution of 84 due to the impact of upslope inflow overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield increased under the rainfall flow conditions the results suggest that grass species on downslope parts of semi arid hillslopes performed better in reducing water and soil losses this study is beneficial for forage selection allocation and management practices such as forage harvesting when implementing restoration strategies to control soil and water losses keywords rainfall simulation overland flow sediment grass roots loess soil china 1 introduction soil erosion by surface runoff is a major environmental problem worldwide vegetation restoration is an important measure in reducing high erosion risks in semi arid areas zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 mcvicar et al 2010 wang et al 2012 duan et al 2016 the impacts of vegetation cover on runoff and erosion depend on the type of vegetation duan et al 2016 its spatial distribution shi et al 2013 wei et al 2014 and the above ground stems leaves and litter covers and below ground roots biomass gyssels et al 2005 vannoppen et al 2015 both the above ground biomass and the roots affect runoff and erosion processes table 1 vegetation cover affects infiltration and overland flow rate in that its above ground parts intercept rainfall dunkerley and booth 1999 dunkerley 2000 and in that its root development increases soil organic matter and macroporosity vegetation cover controls erosion by reducing erosive forces including kinetic raindrops energy wainwright et al 2000 and overland flow velocity and the above ground parts increase hydraulic roughness abrahams et al 1994 pan and shangguan 2006 zhao et al 2015 in addition roots improve soil structure by enhancing formation of aggregates and increasing soil stability and shear strength gyssels et al 2005 vannoppen et al 2015 it is important to isolate and quantify the relative contributions of above ground vegetation parts and roots to reducing surface flow and erosion gyssels and poesen 2003 zhou and shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2016 however little experimental work has been conducted in the field table 1 and some conflicting results have been reported it is usually reported that the above ground grass parts mainly contribute to reducing surface flow whereas grass roots make a greater contribution to reducing soil losses zhou and shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2016 however some researchers have found that the effects of grass roots and the above ground parts on reducing soil erosion were almost equivalent zhang et al 2014 in some cases the effect of roots on reducing erosion were found to be less important than that of the above ground parts gyssels et al 2005 the discrepancies may be related to the differences in plant morphology among the different grass species studied few studies have been conducted and further exploration is needed to examine the effects of different grass species that have different morphological traits both above and below ground on infiltration overland flow velocity and sediment yield the relative importance of above ground grass parts and roots on runoff and erosion likely also depend on the erosion processes considered de baets and poesen 2010 vannoppen et al 2015 gyssels et al 2005 reported that the plant roots were more effective in controlling rill erosion and gully erosion whereas the above ground plant parts were more effective in reducing splash detachment and interrill erosion rates therefore experimental work that simulates different erosion processes is capable of providing evidence for a better understanding of the role of different grass components in hydrological and erosion processes runoff generation and erosion processes on hillslopes are closely related to slope positions as downslope parts tend to be affected by accumulated surface flow and sediment transported from farther upslope cerdà 1998 numerous studies have examined the effects of spatially distributed vegetation cover on reducing water and soil losses at the plot scale cerdà 1998 rey 2003 calvo cases et al 2003 ruiz sinoga et al 2010 wei et al 2014 and the catchment scale shi et al 2013 2014 some studies have found that vegetation on the lower portions of slopes reduces surface flow and sediment to a greater degree than those on the upper and middle positions wei et al 2014 ding and li 2016 however some studies have shown that the impacts of vegetation cover on runoff generation and erosion are independent of slope position cerdà 1998 ruiz sinoga et al 2010 the differences are associated with the wide range of soil types vegetation types and measuring methodologies used in different studies few experimental data or direct measurements have been collected to examine whether the impacts of different vegetation components on reducing erosion differ with slope positions in addition most previous studies applied simply simulated rainfall or inflow to vegetated plots at different slope positions on hillslopes to examine the effects of the spatial distribution of vegetation in reducing water and soil losses cerdà 1998 wei et al 2014 ding and li 2016 few studies have emphasized the importance of the combined effects of rainfall and upslope inflow further field work is necessary to study the combined effects of these factors in order to provide empirical evidence for the optimal location of vegetation along hillslope profiles to better conserve water and soil the loess plateau of china is one of the hotpots having severe soil erosion threats in the world and it experiences an average annual soil loss of 2000 2500 t km2 shi and shao 2000 approximately 60 70 of the annual precipitation in this region falls between july and september most of which is in the form of heavy rainstorms the resulted surface runoff is one of the main reasons for the severe soil erosion observed on the loess plateau of china shi and shao 2000 designing and implementing effective measures to retain surface runoff for infiltration is important in reducing soil losses the grain for green project has been carried out in china since 1999 to mitigate environmental degradation by converting cultivated land with slopes of 25 or greater to grass or forest lands mcvicar et al 2007 grass restoration as the start of successional re vegetation strategies is beneficial for vegetation restoration mcvicar et al 2010 on the steep slopes of the loess plateau a positive feedback of such re vegetation scheme is the reduction of stream discharge and erosion risks wang et al 2012 liu and mcvicar 2012 however bans on grazing have adverse impacts on the incomes of local farmers which in turn affect their enthusiasm for participating in the project pan et al 2006 harvesting of forage material to feed animals has been proposed to improve the livelihoods of the local residents an evaluation of the impacts of such practices on runoff and erosion risks is needed there are also concerns about the selection of optimal grass species and the spatial extent of areas that should be involved in re vegetation activities mcvicar et al 2010 duan et al 2016 to maximize the impact of grass on reducing erosion and sustainable vegetation restoration the growing body of research and practical concerns on restoration management practices identify three key issues related to the impacts of vegetation cover on hillslope runoff and erosion these issues are 1 the effect of vegetation restoration on runoff control 2 the relative importance of different vegetation components on reducing erosion and 3 the effects of the distribution of vegetation on hillslopes on runoff and erosion key papers that discuss these factors are summarized in table 1 there is a need to assess these three issues through integrated and systematic analyses the main aim of this paper is to address all three of the issues mentioned above simultaneously compare this to previous studies that only addressed one or at best two of the abovementioned three issues the findings are expected to contribute to our understanding of re vegetation management practices for use in soil and water conservation in semi arid areas this paper has three main objectives i to clarify the effects of grass restoration on runoff control ii to illustrate the relative importance of different grass components in reducing erosion and iii to investigate the impacts of grass distribution on hillslope on reducing surface runoff and erosion 2 study site and hillslope treatment 2 1 study site the study area is located in the hilly loess area of northern china and near the guanting reservoir fig 1 a the guanting reservoir was built in the early 1950 s and had long served as a water source for beijing city however it failed to meet the standards for water sources starting in 1997 due to severe soil erosion problem the mean annual loss rates were approximately 2500 t km 2 yr 1 between 1950 and 1980 liu et al 2008 resulting in deteriorated water quality and reservoir sedimentation the severe erosion is mainly caused by highly erodible loess soil sparse vegetation cover and high intensity rainstorms the region is one of the key areas for implementing soil and water conservation projects in china the field experiments were conducted at the huailai field ecological station 115 37 01 e 40 15 32 n that is affiliated with the state key laboratory of earth surface processes and resource ecology beijing normal university the climate is semi arid with mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 9 c based on locally recorded data covering the period from 1950 to 2000 the mean annual precipitation ranges from 370 to 480 mm 1950 2000 most of which occurs as short duration and high intensity rainstorms in the summer months 2 2 grass plots to avoid uncertainties caused by differences in slope aspect and original soil property a north facing loess hillslope that is approximately 30 m long and 20 m wide with uniform soil properties was selected as the study site fig 1 b before planting the studied grass species on the hillslope artificial surface levelling was undertaken to minimize the impact of microtopographic changes the hillslope has a rectilinear shape with a slope gradient of approximately 25 table 2 presents the basic physical and chemical properties of the soil in the 0 10 cm layer of the experimental hillslope the particle size distribution of the tested soils 0 10 cm is shown in fig 2 the soil was loamy with mean sand silt and clay contents of 38 79 0 72 41 92 0 86 and 19 50 0 59 respectively three grass species used for grazing table 3 astragalus adsurgens a adsurgens medicago sativa m sativa and cosmos bipinnatus c bipinnatus were planted on the hillslope for research purposes the grass species were selected due to their high drought tolerance and wide application in reducing runoff and erosion risks in semi arid areas equal weights of seeds for the three grass species were planted parallel to the contour of the hillslope and with a row spacing of 20 cm after two years of growth the grass species were approximately 30 cm in height 85 in coverage as determined by digital image analysis and had a mean density of approximately 150 stands per m2 a litter layer that was 1 mm in thickness was distributed randomly over the surfaces of the a adsurgens and m sativa plots whereas minor litter cover was observed for the c bipinnatus plot to address the first objective four runoff plots were constructed with different ground covers including a adsurgens m sativa c bipinnatus bare soil was used as a reference fig 1 b the experimental plots were established by carefully inserting 30 cm high pvc sheets 10 cm into the soil and each plot had dimensions of 10 m2 5 m 2 m for the second objective the three grass species were subjected to three different treatments one treatment was performed with the intact grass control ig as a reference one treatment involved carefully removing the litter cover and leaves of the grass and leaving the stems and roots of the grass nll fig 1 d and another one was cutting the stems to the ground surface leaving only the roots or fig 1 e the successive removal of the above ground grass parts was designed to satisfy the experimental criterion of homogeneous plant properties e g plant density and root density which is necessary if the effects of different grass parts are to be isolated to meet the third research objective field experiments involving four plots including one that was bare and three that were subjected to different treatments ig nll and or for each grass species were conducted under two conditions simulated rainfall 60 mm h 1 rainfall and simulated rainfall combined with upslope overland flow 10 l m 1 min 1 rainfall flow in the study area where the rainfall runoff process is dominated by infiltration excess overland flow the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions were assumed to represent the upper slope and lower slope positions along a long hillslope when assuming the infiltration rate during the steady state overland flow stage is half of the rainfall intensity 30 mm h 1 the simulated upslope inflow with a rate of 10 l m 1 min 1 indicates an upslope contributing area of 40 m2 20 m in length and 2 m in width compared with the rainfall event the rainfall flow event represents a plot 20 m downslope from the crest of the hillslope which corresponds to the lower slope position on natural hillslopes that are normally 25 35 m in length inflows of clear water were used due to their similarity in terms of overland flow shear stress and stream power with silt laden flow zhang et al 2010 the experiments were conducted first with the rainfall and subsequently the rainfall flow to minimize the differences in initial surface conditions 3 experimental methods and data analysis 3 1 experimental set ups a portable spray type rainfall simulator developed by the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences bian et al 2011 was applied the rainfall simulator consists of two opposite sprayers with nozzles to form raindrops manometers to control water pressure two tripods held together with stainless steel tubes to support the sprayers and a pump that delivers water to the sprayers the rainfall simulator can simulate rainfall with an intensity ranging from 10 to 180 mm h 1 by adjusting nozzle size 3 0 14 0 mm and water pressure 0 10 0 15 mpa the simulator has a coverage of rainfall area ranging from 12 m2 4 m 3 m to 24 m2 8 m 3 m a constant intensity of 60 3 mm hr 1 rainfall was applied over a duration of with 1 h the pattern of temporal fluctuations in intensity during a rainfall event has been widely reported to affect infiltration and overland flow responses dunkerley 2012 2017 however since our rainfall simulator failed to deliver smooth changes in rainfall intensity it is more feasible to apply a constant intensity to create replicate rainfall events in a controlled way the simulated rainfall has an intensity of 60 mm h 1 and a duration of 1 h that represents a one in five year rain event jiang 1997 this type of rainfall was selected to simulate typical short duration and high intensity rainstorm that makes great contributions to annual precipitation and soil losses in many hilly loess areas of china shi and shao 2000 calibrations of the rainfall intensity and uniformity were conducted prior to running the experiments the raindrops were produced by two opposite nozzles that had an inside diameter of 7 mm and at a distance of 7 m at the water pressure of 0 15 mpa the two nozzles were 4 1 m above the soil surface and the falling height of the raindrops was 5 5 m with a uniformity of 85 the drop size distribution of the simulated rainfall was measured using the stain method and the d50 of the rainfall at 60 mm h 1 ranged from 1 0 to 1 5 mm which aligns with natural drop size distributions for this rainfall intensity xu et al 2004 2006 the velocity of falling raindrops was 4 85 m s 1 laws 1941 and the mean kinetic energy was calculated as 0 238 j m 2 s 1 xu et al 2006 the field experiments were conducted during the summer months under hot conditions with maximum daily temperature of approximately 30 c the majority of the experiments were performed in the early morning and started shortly after sunrise at 06 00 am at that time of day the relative humidity was higher than during the hot afternoon conditions and the wind disturbance was minimal a trough was constructed using a pvc pipe 2 0 m in length and 0 15 m in diameter with a row of equally spaced 1 cm grooves 1 5 cm in length and 0 5 cm in width along its length the trough was installed horizontally at the top of each plot and upslope inflow entered the runoff plots evenly by overflowing through the grooves a plastic water tank with constant water head was used to supply water the inflow rate was maintained using a valve at a value of 10 l m 1 min 1 in response to the rainfall intensity and the ratio of upslope to downslope area 2 1 3 2 experimental processes and measurements before each test a soil auger with a diameter of 1 cm was used to determine the antecedent soil moisture content and bulk density within 10 cm of the soil surface three soil samples were collected from the upper middle and lower parts of each plot and the antecedent soil gravimetric moisture content table 2 was measured by oven drying at 105 c until a constant weight was achieved the antecedent soil volumetric moisture content was derived through multiplying the antecedent soil gravimetric moisture by the soil bulk density to minimize the differences in antecedent soil water content the soil moisture content of the topsoil 0 10 cm within the plot for all of the treatments was adjusted gravimetrically to approximately 13 g g 1 at the beginning of the rainfall simulation experiments during the experimental process each test lasted 60 min after overland flow initiation a pvc runoff collector was set at the bottom of each plot runoff samples were collected using plastic buckets every 4 min and a total of 15 runoff samples were collected after each test the amount of runoff in each bucket was measured the suspended sediment was deposited separated from the water transferred to iron basins and dried in a forced air oven at 105 c to a constant weight the overland flow rate and sediment yields were subsequently calculated dye tracing method was used to measure surface flow velocities by recording time required a reading resolution of 0 01 s for leading edge of the colouration of a kmno4 solution to travel across a marked distance 1 m each 5 m long experimental plot was divided into three measured cross sections namely 0 5 1 5 m 2 0 3 0 m and 3 5 4 5 m from upslope to downslope four parallel measured lines were made for each measured cross section with an interval of 0 5 m 12 travel times with three replicates were measured for the whole plot measurements were performed along the slope length from the lower to the upper position of each plot to avoid possible observation errors caused by progress of dye solution from upslope to downslope nine measurements were performed for the whole plot during each test and 3 tests each were performed during the 0 10 min 10 30 min and 30 60 min intervals of the whole experimental process respectively each treatment plot was exposed to natural conditions drying under windy conditions and in full sun at approximately 30 c for 2 days longer when natural rainfall occurred after the test in order to enable the natural weathering processes of the surface soil to operate photos of soil surface were taken from multiple angles within the bare soil plot and bare inter canopy patches within the grassed plots for areas with rills the morphological characteristics of the rills including their locations within the plot and their lengths widths and depths were measured the measurements were conducted continuously along the length of each rill at an interval of 5 10 cm artificial filling of the rills using soil collected from adjacent areas outside the plot was subsequently carefully undertaken followed by compaction of the infilled soil there was a good mixture of the original soil and newly added soil and rills did not tend to occur at the same locations during subsequent tests artificial levelling was undertaken to minimize the differences in microtopographic changes resulting from one experimental test these measures were taken to make the whole plot uniform from the upper to the lower slope positions with a slope of approximately 25 and to enable achievement of similar antecedent surface conditions including slope soil moisture and bulk density 3 3 data analysis the instantaneous soil infiltration rate fi was calculated using the following formula 1 f i icos θ f 10 r i st where i is the rainfall intensity mm min 1 θ is the slope f is the upslope inflow rate mm min 1 ri is the ith runoff volume collected ml s is the plot area cm2 t is the time interval between the collection of successive runoff samples min and the factor 10 is an adjusting coefficient the overland flow depths were not measured directly due to the physical difficulties slippy surface the disturbance of raindrops on shallow overland flow steep slope dense vegetation cover of doing measurements within the relatively large plot area 10 m2 in the field the mean overland flow depth was estimated by using the equation 2 h q v q v bt where h is the flow depth cm q is the unit discharge cm2 s 1 q is the runoff volume during time t ml b is the width of the water cross section cm and v is the mean flow velocity cm s 1 for a laminar flow profile vertical velocity distribution can be calculated using a quadratic equation that assumes zero velocity at the bed and maximum velocity at the surface katz et al 1995 the theoretical relationship between the profile mean velocity v and the measured maximum surface velocity vs was expressed as v 0 67vs li et al 1996 the correction factor between mean velocity and surface velocity depends on reynolds number water depth sediment concentration and bed roughness pan et al 2015 dunkerley 2001 but in this study a fixed correction factor with the value of 0 67 that is widely used for laminar flow was adopted li et al 1996 the effects of the three grass species i 1 2 3 that had received three different treatments j 1 2 3 on reducing overland flow rates and velocities and sediment yields were calculated as 3 cr ij r b r ij r b 100 4 cv ij v b v ij v b 100 5 cs ij s b s ij s b 100 where crij cvij and csij are the contributions of the grass species a adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus under different treatments ig nll and or to reductions in overland flow rates overland flow velocities and sediment yield rates respectively rb mm min 1 vb cm s 1 and sb g m 2 min 1 are the overland flow rates overland flow velocities and sediment yield rates from the bare soil plot respectively and rij mm min 1 vij cm s 1 and sij g m 2 min 1 are the overland flow rates overland flow velocities and sediment yield rates from the grassed plots with different treatments respectively the contributions of the different components of grass to reducing overland flow rate were obtained using 6 e litter leaves cr i ig cr i nll 7 e stems cr i nll cr i or 8 e roots cr i or 9 e total e litter leaves e stems e roots cr i ig where elitter leaves estems eroots and etotal are the overland flow rate reductions caused by litter cover and leaves stems roots and intact grass respectively cri ig cri nll and cri or indicate the effectiveness of different grass species i 1 2 3 under different treatments ig nll and or in reducing overland flow rate the contributions of different grass parts to reducing overland flow velocity and sediment yield can be derived and the forms of the equations are similar to those of eqs 6 9 datasets were tested for normality using the anderson darling normality test and student s t test or the mann whitney u test were applied to test for a significant difference in the means or the medians of the studied response variables between two treatments all statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 4 results 4 1 runoff and infiltration compared with the bare soil plot the grassed plots a adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus that had received different treatments ig nll and or exhibited an increase in the infiltration rate and a decrease in the overland flow rate table 4 the grassed plots with intact grass control significantly p 0 05 reduced overland flow rate by 12 7 36 8 under the rainfall condition and by 11 6 32 2 under the rainfall flow condition fig 3 this result showed that planting forage grass effectively reduces surface runoff and enhances soil infiltration the m sativa plot had significantly p 0 05 higher infiltration rate table 4 and overland flow rate reduction fig 3 than those of the a adsurgens and c bipinnatus plots when the above ground grass parts were removed there were an increase in the overland flow rate and a decrease in the infiltration table 4 for all three of the grass species the ig treatment the intact grass control displayed the highest overland flow rate reduction followed by the nll treatment no litter or leaves and the or treatment in which only the roots were reserved fig 3 under both the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions significant differences p 0 05 were found in the overland flow rate reduction among the three treatments ig nll and or for the m sativa plot fig 3 the time required for overland flow initiation was generally 2 min for all of the treatments the temporal patterns of soil infiltration showed that infiltration rates were highest at the initiation of overland flow and subsequently decreased gradually under the rainfall condition and more rapidly under the rainfall flow condition fig 4 a more rapidly decrease in the infiltration rate was found for the bare soil plot than that for the grassed plots fig 4 for the grass plots that had been subjected to different treatments the ig treatment generally produced higher infiltration rates than those of the nll and ro treatments fig 4 and table 4 significantly greater p 0 05 infiltration rates were found for all of the treatments under the rainfall flow condition compared with those under the rainfall condition table 4 the simulated upslope inflow contributed to an increase in infiltration with the contributions ranging from 33 to 62 4 2 overland flow velocity the mean overland flow velocities for the bare soil plot were 0 22 and 0 35 m s 1 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 4 the grassed plots had significantly lower p 0 05 overland flow velocities than the bare soil plot table 4 with 9 3 44 8 less under the rainfall condition and 11 4 44 4 less under the rainfall flow condition fig 5 statistical analysis results showed that the differences in the overland flow velocities among the three grass species a adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus were significant at p 0 05 the c bipinnatus plot had the greatest overland flow velocity followed by the m sativa and a adsurgens plots table 4 due to the impact of simulated upslope inflow significantly higher p 0 05 overland flow velocities were found under the rainfall flow condition than those under the rainfall condition table 4 the overland flow velocity for each grass type generally increased with the removal of the above ground grass parts table 4 for the a adsurgens and m sativa plots there were significant differences in the overland flow velocity reductions among the ig nll and or treatments p 0 05 for the c bipinnatus plot no significant differences were found in the overland flow velocity reduction among the three treatments under the rainfall condition p 0 05 the ig and nll treatments of the c bipinnatus plot under the rainfall flow condition produced the similar overland flow velocity reductions p 0 084 which were significantly higher p 0 05 than that of the or treatment fig 5 4 3 sediment yield compared with the bare soil plot the grassed plots that had been subjected to different treatments ig nll and or significantly reduced the sediment yield rates p 0 05 table 4 the percent reductions of the grass species with ig treatments ranged from 57 6 to 84 6 under the rainfall condition and from 55 1 to 75 2 under the rainfall flow condition fig 6 m sativa performed better in reducing the sediment yield than c bipinnatus and a adsurgens fig 6 the sediment yields for all of the three grass species generally increased with the cutting of the above ground grass parts table 4 no significant differences p 0 05 were found in the sediment yield reductions between the ig and nll treatments for any of the grassed plots fig 6 indicating that litter cover and leaves had no significant impacts on reducing soil erosion for the c bipinnatus plot rainfall and the a adsurgens and m sativa plots rainfall flow the sediment yield reductions for the or treatment were significantly lower p 0 05 than those for the nll treatments showing a significant effect of stems on reducing soil losses the temporal variations in the sediment yield are shown in fig 7 sediment yields increased rapidly during the early stage of overland flow generation and then decreased to an almost constant value fig 7 for the bare soil plot the sediment yield rate was the highest during the early stage 0 20 min rates of 75 27 and 197 90 g m 2 min 1 were observed under the rainfall and the rainfall flow conditions respectively table 5 the sediment yields were generally low table 5 and showed little variation fig 7 during the middle stage 20 40 min and the late stage 40 60 min for the three grassed plots that had been subjected to different treatments the sediment yields initially increased and subsequently decreased with fluctuations to a steady state compared with the bare soil plot the observed decreases in sediment yield rates in the grassed plots mainly occurred during the early stages 0 20 min with the mean reductions of 51 and 99 under the rainfall and the rainfall flow conditions respectively table 5 the sediment yields increased significantly p 0 05 from the rainfall condition to the rainfall flow condition table 4 the effects of inflow on erosion mainly occurred during the early stage 0 20 min table 5 with the mean contribution of 48 that is higher than 31 of the middle stage 20 40 min and 21 of the late stage 40 60 min compared to the rainfall condition the grass impact on sediment reduction was greater under the rainfall flow condition table 4 in particular during the early stage 0 20 min table 5 4 4 contributions of the different vegetation components the contributions of the different parts of grass to reducing overland flow rate overland flow velocity and sediment yield are shown in table 6 and fig 8 the above ground grass parts mainly contributed to reducing overland flow rates and velocities whereas the roots contributed more to reducing sediment yields table 6 relatively the above ground grass parts made higher contributions to reducing overland flow rate with the mean value of 64 of the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 a of the above ground grass parts the effect of the stems on reducing overland flow rate was greater than that of the litter cover and leaves table 6 the above ground parts significantly p 0 05 reduced the overland flow velocity with the mean reductions of 24 7 and 25 2 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 6 the intact grass contributed to reducing the mean sediment yields by 70 1 and 64 1 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively the grass roots played a predominant role in reducing soil erosion with the mean relative contribution of 84 for both the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 c of the three grass species m sativa showed the greatest reduction in overland flow rate resulting from the impact of the above ground parts of m sativa which accounted for an average of 72 of the total overland flow rate reduction for the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 a the effects of all of the above ground parts of m sativa were significant p 0 05 in reducing overland flow rate table 6 in terms of overland flow velocity reduction a adsurgens produced greater values than those of m sativa and c bipinnatus for both a adsurgens and m sativa the above ground parts litter leaves and stems had a significant impact on reducing surface velocity p 0 05 m sativa showed the highest sediment yield reduction with the mean value of 79 9 for the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions followed by c bipinnatus mean 65 1 and a adsurgens mean 56 4 table 6 the significant effect of m sativa in reducing sediment yields is mainly caused by its roots development which contributed 89 and 88 to sediment yield reductions under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively fig 8 c the contributions of the above ground parts to reducing overland flow rate and velocity were on average higher under the rainfall flow condition than the rainfall condition table 6 the roots made contributions of 60 8 and 52 3 to reducing erosion under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 6 5 discussion 5 1 the effects of grass restoration on runoff the grassed plots had a significantly higher infiltration rate than that of the bare soil plot which had sealing of the soil surface by raindrop impacts and lower soil porosity table 2 for the plots with grass the above ground grass parts significantly reduced p 0 05 the overland flow velocity table 6 the grass root networks taproot system of the a adsurgens and fibrous root systems of the m sativa and c bipinnatus increased the soil porosity table 2 that enhanced infiltration the interception of precipitation by the grass litter leaves and stems is also important in preventing surface sealing and the development of crust as it reduces the kinetic energy of the raindrops reaching the soil surface abrahams et al 2003 wainwright et al 2000 the three grass species significantly p 0 05 reduced overland flow rates and velocities compared to the bare soil indicating that the planting of forage grass plays an important role in reducing water losses in the study area in many semi arid areas the majority of precipitation occurs as high intensity and short duration summer rainstorms the storm pattern has raised considerable concern about increasing risks of flood and erosion shi and shao 2000 our study showed that planting of forage grass is important in strengthening soil infiltration capacity by increasing soil porosity through the development of roots and reducing overland flow velocity and development of soil crusts through the grass leaves and stems compared to c bipinnatus and a adsurgens m sativa displayed a significantly greater p 0 05 infiltration rate table 4 and a better performance in overland flow rate reduction table 6 this favorable effect of m sativa on reducing overland flow rate was primarily caused by the development of its above ground parts during the early stages of plant growth m sativa showed a faster growth rate with a relatively dense litter cover and a thick canopy than the other grass species the leaves of m sativa were clustered which resulted in a high leaf area index these plant characteristics are beneficial for m sativa reducing overland flow velocity table 6 and intercepting rainfall in many hilly loess regions of china with arid and semi arid climates the survival and growth of vegetation is limited by water availability mcvicar et al 2010 the favorable effects of m sativa in promoting soil infiltration and overland flow velocity retardation is beneficial for successional restoration and the ecological functions of soil and water conservation the above ground grass parts performed better in reducing overland flow rate and velocity than the grass roots the mean relative contributions of the stems litter cover and leaves were 44 and 42 to reducing the overland flow velocity fig 8 b for grassed slopes the friction resistance attributed to grass stems litter and leaves commonly represents the main resistance component abrahams et al 1994 pan et al 2016 a minor reduction in overland flow velocity caused by the above ground grass parts appeared to lead to a significant increase in hydraulic roughness of the surface estimated by the darcy weisbach friction factor f 8 gθq v3 the above ground parts of forage grass are important for increasing surface roughness and reducing overland flow velocity and these results are beneficial for soil water retention and infiltration into deep soil 5 2 the importance of different grass components on controlling erosion with the removal of the above ground grass parts litter leaves and stems the average infiltration rate decreased table 4 resulted from an increase in overland flow velocity table 4 and soil crust formation because of lack of rainfall interception by above ground grass parts the grassed plots significantly p 0 05 reduced sediment yields by 67 1 on average compared to the bare soil plot table 6 grass is more effective in reducing soil erosion than surface flow table 6 of the three grass species m sativa performed the best in reducing erosion with the average erosion reducing effect of 79 9 table 6 resulting from its system of fine dense roots 1 mm in diameter that contributed an average of 88 to the total reduction in soil erosion fig 8 c the high density of fine roots improved the soil structure causing it to show high resistance to flow wash gyssels et al 2005 vannoppen et al 2015 m sativa was efficient in facilitating surface water infiltration and retention through the action of its above ground parts and in protecting soil from being eroded through its root system these results are beneficial for ecological restoration operations on degraded lands within the study area the average erosion reducing effect of a adsurgens was 56 4 table 6 which is the lowest of the three grass species the root networks of a adsurgens consist of a tap root system with primarily central and vertical main roots but limited lateral and branching fine roots which are responsible for the low roots contribution to reducing soil erosion table 6 similar results have been reported by de baets et al 2007 who found that fibrous roots are more effective in reducing soil erosion than tap roots c bipinnatus showed a good performance in reducing soil erosion table 6 which is caused by the relatively dense fine roots and the associated enhancements in soil structure and low erodibility the roots played a predominant role in reducing erosion table 6 with the mean relative contribution of 84 for the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions fig 8 c the findings are in agreement with those of previous studies conducted under similar experimental conditions e g zhou and shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2016 the fundamental role of grass roots in protecting soil against water erosion is related to their ability to enhance soil stability by physically binding soil particles and aggregates de baets et al 2006 and to improve soil strength knapen et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 in arid and semi arid environments vegetation cover is sparse and the above ground biomass can temporarily disappear because of overgrazing or harvesting de baets and poesen 2010 our results imply that grass roots are still effective in controlling soil erosion in the study area even when the above ground grass parts are not well developed or have been harvested for raising livestock the presence of roots is key to erosion prevention it is thus suggested that the protection of roots and increasing the plant root density in topsoil is a viable erosion control strategy during the early stages of plant growth our study showed that the above ground grass parts had a minor impact on reducing soil erosion table 6 which is related to the incompletely developed above ground grass parts during the early stage of plant growth however it is not known whether the effect of the above ground parts on reducing soil losses increases when the shoots develop abundantly further exploration of whether there is a shift in importance between the above ground grass parts and the roots as the plants grows is merited 5 3 the impacts of grass distribution on hillslope on controlling runoff and erosion there was an increase in the infiltration rate from rainfall to rainfall flow conditions table 4 there are three possible reasons first an increase in the mean overland flow depth mean value of 0 27 mm for the rainfall events and of 0 93 mm for the rainfall flow events with higher water pressure and greater inundation area is beneficial for water infiltration second the greater flow resistance under the rainfall flow conditions contributed to prolonging the infiltrating time another possible reason is that less crust would be developed under the rainfall flow condition than the rainfall condition because of the significantly greater overland flow velocity table 4 and reduced kinetic energy of the raindrops through deeper overland flow table 4 disturbance due to the impact of the applied upslope inflow the overland flow rates and velocities and erosion rates for the rainfall flow conditions increased significantly p 0 05 compared to those of the rainfall conditions table 4 this result is associated with the presence of well connected flow pathways under the rainfall flow conditions flow paths began to develop at the upper end of the plots due to the impact of upslope simulated inflow and quickly developed into efficient pathways for overland flow during the first 20 min of the experiments table 5 similar findings have been reported by previous studies gilley et al 1985 parsons et al 1994 these results highlight the impacts of upslope inflow on flow sourcing sediment entrainment and transport downslope in many hilly loess areas of china landscapes with steep slopes 25 and long slope lengths 30 m are one of the basic geographic characteristics that induce a large amount of surface runoff from upslope areas effective grass restoration strategies that are intended to reduce flow from upslope would reduce water and soil losses from entire slopes the grass species under the rainfall flow conditions had a greater reduction in erosion than that under the rainfall conditions table 4 especially during the early stage 0 20 min table 5 there are two possible explanations first the grass located downslope prevented more erosion caused by rills for the bare soil plot the contribution of rill erosion to total erosion increased significantly from 20 0 under the rainfall condition to 83 9 under the rainfall flow condition due to the impact of grass plantation no apparent rills occurred within the plot under the rainfall flow condition second improved soil structure with grass roots is highly resistant to flow wash under high flow condition the mean contributions of grass roots to reducing sediment yields increased from 29 83 g m 2 min 1 under the rainfall condition to 43 73 g m 2 min 1 under the rainfall flow condition table 4 these results showed that the grass roots had the ability to protect the soils from erosion under the additional inflow conditions when extended to the catchment scale this study suggests that re vegetation downslope is more effective in reducing sediment yields from a hillslope to the streams downslope the effects of the above ground grass parts on reducing overland flow rate and velocity were on average higher under the rainfall flow condition than the rainfall condition table 6 the reason is that the hydraulic roughness contributed by the above ground grass parts which dominates in the total resistance abrahams et al 1994 pan et al 2016 increased from low flow to high flow conditions due to an increase in flow depth table 4 and greater submergence of the above ground grass parts roots were highly effective in reducing erosion with relative contributions of 87 and 80 under the rainfall and rainfall flow conditions respectively table 6 showing that grass roots were effective in reducing soil detachment capacity under both low and high runoff conditions roots were effective in controlling interrill erosion that is dominant within upslope regions and concentrated flow erosion that mainly occurs within downslope regions these findings are in agreement with those reported by previous studies zhou and shangguan 2007 gyssels and poesen 2003 vannoppen et al 2015 this study showed that management practices such as harvesting the above ground forage parts for feeding livestock by local farmers would have a minor impact on the ability of grass to control soil erosion it is important to emphasize that the present experiments were performed under simulated rainfall conditions with and without upslope inflow to simulate the upslope and downslope portions of a long hillslope given the wide range of characteristics of upslope inflow in terms of flow rate overland flow velocity and sediment concentration a wider range of test conditions is required in future studies to further our understanding of the impacts of slope positions on runoff and erosion processes 6 conclusions field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on grassed plots that had received different treatments to investigate the effectiveness of different grass components and the effect of the distribution of grass on hillslopes on reducing overland flow and erosion the main findings are listed below 1 the three grass species astragalus adsurgens m sativa and c bipinnatus evaluated in this study were effective in reducing water and soil losses compared to the bare soil plot the mean overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield for the grassed plots were reduced by 21 8 29 1 and 67 1 respectively grass is more effective in reducing soil erosion than surface flow of the three grass species m sativa performed the best in enhancing infiltration reducing overland flow velocity and soil losses mainly due to its thick canopy and dense fine roots 1 mm in diameter the findings are beneficial for selection of forage species when implementing forage restoration to reduce runoff and erosion risks in the region 2 the above ground grass parts displayed better performance in reducing overland flow rate and velocity with mean relative contributions of 64 and 86 respectively the effect of the above ground parts on reducing erosion was minor during the early stages of plant growth the roots mainly contributed to reducing soil erosion with mean contribution of 84 increasing plant root density is important in preventing soil erosion in semi arid environments where vegetation cover is sparse 3 the downslope system had a higher retention capacity for water retention and storage that is beneficial for growth of forage grass due to the impact of upslope inflow overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield increased we suggest that grass in downslope positions performed better in controlling water and soil

7444,spatial distribution of groundwater recharge discharge fluxes has an important impact on mass and energy exchanges in shallow streambeds during the last two decades extensive studies have been devoted to the quantification of one dimensional 1 d vertical exchange fluxes nevertheless few studies were conducted to characterize two dimensional 2 d heterogeneous flux fields that commonly exist in real world cases in this study we used an iterative ensemble smoother ies to quantify the spatial distribution of 2 d exchange fluxes by assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements four assimilation scenarios corresponding to different potential field applications were tested in the first three scenarios the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields were first inferred from hydraulic head and or temperature measurements and then the flux fields were derived through darcy s law using the estimated conductivity fields in the fourth scenario the flux fields were estimated directly from the temperature measurements which is more efficient and especially suitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable we concluded that the best estimation could be achieved through jointly assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements and temperature data were superior to the head data when they were used independently overall the ies method provided more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those given by the widely used analytical solution based methods furthermore ies gave reasonable uncertainty estimations which were unavailable in traditional methods since temperature can be accurately monitored with high spatial and temporal resolutions the coupling of heat tracing techniques and ies provides promising potential in quantifying complex exchange fluxes under field conditions keywords heat tracer exchange flux data assimilation heterogeneity sandbox experiment 1 introduction accurate quantification of surface water and ground water sw gw exchange fluxes in shallow aquifers is important to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the studied regions boulton et al 2010 krause et al 2014 sophocleous 2002 among various methods for estimating the sw gw exchange fluxes heat tracing has been receiving the most attention since temperature is a naturally occurring and environmentally friendly tracer that can be easily and reliably measured constantz and su 2003 johnson et al 2005 new developments of the heat tracing methods such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensing dts have enabled temperature monitoring at increased spatial and temporal resolutions resulting in vast applications in sw gw interaction related studies becker et al 2013 briggs et al 2016 2012 hare et al 2015 a common approach to infer vertical sw gw exchange fluxes from diurnal temperature signals is based on the analytical solution of 1 d heat transport equation which explicitly expresses the relationship between the temperature time series and the vertical exchange flux hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 mccallum et al 2012 this analytical approach is valid only if multiple assumptions are satisfied 1 sinusoidal temperature signal 2 1 d vertical water flow 3 thermal equilibrium between the matrix and water and 4 homogeneous thermal and hydraulic properties of the streambed in natural conditions however these assumptions are often invalid many studies have been conducted to evaluate the applicability of analytical solution based methods to determine the vertical water flux under non ideal conditions for example lautz 2010 found that multidimensional flows can cause a larger error compared to violations of other assumptions rau et al 2015 observed that the non sinusoidal temperature boundary can significantly influence the results of the estimated fluxes irvine et al 2015a quantitativelyanalyzed the influence of streambed heterogeneity and concluded that the errors in flux estimation increase as the degree of heterogeneity increases to overcome the limitations of the analytical approach voytek et al 2014 developed a numerical algorithm 1dtemppro to estimate vertical sw gw exchange fluxes by calibrating the model to the observed temperature profiles at the presence of complicated forcing mechanisms besides frequency domain methods have also been introduced to quantify vertical flux components based on spectral analysis of streambed temperature time series at different depths schneidewind et al 2016 vandersteen et al 2015 wörman et al 2012 nevertheless these methods only provide vertical exchange flux estimations whereas heterogeneous non vertical sw gw exchange is ubiquitous in real world cases bhaskar et al 2012 rau et al 2010 swanson and cardenas 2010 furthermore these classical methods are deterministic in that they only provide the unique estimation result and the estimation uncertainties cannot be quantified data assimilations methods can be employed as ideal tools to quantify the spatially heterogeneous exchange fluxes and corresponding estimation uncertainties the ensemble kalman filter enkf and its variants have been widely used to estimate unknown parameters or states evensen 2003 since the sensitivity information is not required to be explicitly calculated the ensemble based methods can be easily implemented with existing simulators recently huang et al 2016 assimilated dts data and vertical hydraulic gradients to estimate streambed hydraulic conductivities and 1 d vertical exchange fluxes using both enkf and enks smoother nevertheless to the best of our knowledge there are very few existing data assimilation studies on estimating 2 d heterogeneous flux fields furthermore the iterative ensemble smoother ies method assimilates the entire historical data in an iterative batch mode and has been shown to perform better than other variants of enkf chen and oliver 2013 emerick and reynolds 2013 inspired by the recent advances in sw gw exchange flux quantification and data assimilation the main objectives of this study were to i experimentally evaluate the applicability of the 1 d analytical method in quantifying vertical exchange fluxes in a heterogeneous streambed ii assess the applicability of a more powerful data assimilation method ies to 2 d heterogeneous flux quantification iii compare the efficacy of various measurements under different assimilation scenarios we first implemented 2 d synthetic numerical cases in which the true exchange fluxes and conductivities were exactly known thus the estimation accuracy of ies could be readily evaluated then the ies method was applied to a sandbox experiment under well controlled experimental conditions for further validation the rest of this paper is organized as follows the methodologies are described in section 2 both numerical and experimental case studies are presented in section 3 and conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations in this study groundwater flow is incompressible and in the steady state in a 2 d domain when the principal directions of the conductivity tensor are the same as the principal coordinate directions the flow process can be described as 1 x k x h x z k z h z 0 and the darcy water flux density q can be expressed as 2 q x k x h x 3 q z k z h z where x z are the distances alongthe longitudinal and vertical directions respectively m h is the hydraulic head m k x k z are the hydraulic conductivities of the matrix block in the longitudinal and vertical directions respectively m d 1 the heat transport equation is written as bear 1972 sophocleous 1979 4 t t k e x t x t z ρ w c w ρ c q

in the effective thermal diffusivity in this study comsol multiphysics was employed to solve the governing equations 2 2 1 d analytical solution based methods the widelyused 1 d analytical solution

implementation details of the ies method are presented assuming that the relationship between the measurements and the model parameters can be expressed as 11 d obs f m ε where d obs is a vector for the measurements f is the forward model m is a vector for the unknown parameters and ε is a vector of normally distributed measurement errors with zero mean and covariance c d e ε ε t the ies method is then implemented in the following way step 1 generate n e parameter samples from the prior distribution and then the initial ensemble for the parameters can be expressed as 12 m 0 m 1 0 m ne 0 where the superscript denotes iteration index and the subscript denotes the ensemble number index step 2 at the l th iteration step l 1 2 the parameter ensemble m l can be iteratively updated with the entire historical measurements by the following formula 13 m l 1 β l m 0 1 β l m l β l c m g l t c d g l c m g l t 1 f m l d obs g l m l m 0 where β l is an adjustment to the iteration step length c m

this study we used ies to assimilate hydraulic head and or temperature measurements to estimate 2 d steady flux fields the estimation uncertainties were represented by the final ensemble of ies four assimilation scenarios using different measurements and models were tested in the first scenario s hkf only the hydraulic head measurements were used to estimate the log transformed hydraulic conductivity log k field in the second scenario s tkf only the temperature measurements were used to update the log k field in the third scenario s htkf the hydraulic head and temperature measurements were jointly assimilated to estimate the log k field the estimations of flux fields were then derived using darcy s law with the estimated conductivity fields generally more accurate log k estimations lead to better flux estimations these three updating scenarios were designed to systematically compare the efficacy of the two types of measurements in estimating the sw gw exchange flux fields the comparisons can provide guidance on optimal monitoring design in related studies since only the steady groundwater flow was considered in this study the fluxes were treated as static parameters and estimated with the temperature measurements directly in the fourth scenario s tf in this scenario the groundwater flow equation was only solved to obtain the initial ensemble of flux fields based on the initial conductivity ensemble and not used in the update process of ies therefore the computational cost can be greatly reduced compared with the first three scenarios another advantage of this scenario is that the potential model errors in the groundwater flow modeling can be avoided since ensemble based methods are generally robust even with the biased prior information chen and zhang 2006 this assimilation scenario is especiallysuitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable while the first three scenarios need a more detailed survey on the flow conditions table 1 lists the measurements and models used in different scenarios to guarantee the estimation accuracy of the ies method a relatively large ensemble size n e 600 was used the convergence ratio γ was chosen as 1 10 4 in the inversion of both the numerical and sandbox experimental cases 2 4 sandbox experiments a sandbox made of plexiglass with w h d 1 86 m 1 m 0 12 m was used to carry out the experiment the top of the sandbox wasused for holding surface water with a constant pressure head of 0 1 m the height of reservoir 2 was adjustable to allow for creating desired hydraulic gradients the sandbox from h 0 05 m to h 0 85 m was filled with the same type of sieved natural quartz sand with diameter ranging from 0 15 mm to 1 mm before filling the sandbox the sand was washed to remove fine particles to facilitate precise packing sand was filled and packed at a 0 2 m increment in the box the bottom 0 05 m of the sandbox was equally divided into five rectangular bays in the vertical direction to ensure the bottom boundary could receive equal pressure exerted by reservoir 2 as shown in fig 1 63 ports 2 5 cm in diameter were drilled on the front wall of the sandbox a hermetically sealed thermistor omegahsth 44 000series and a pressure transducer honeywell 19c003pg5k with a range of 0 3 psi were then installed at each port the instrument accuracies were 0 1 c for the thermistors and 0 25 full scale span for the pressure transducers respectively these sensors were wired to a campbell scientific cr1000 data acquisition system to collect data to prevent heat exchange with the environment the sandbox was covered with insulationmaterials during the experiments the top and bottom head boundaries were maintained constant as 0 906 m and 0 72 m respectively to simulate temperature variation of surface water the heater in reservoir 1 was turned on and off with a 2 h interval thus the surface water temperature approximated a sinusoidal variation with a period of 4 h and a range of 23 33 c hydraulic head and temperature data at the 63 ports were monitored at a 5 min interval 2 5 performance measures the estimation accuracy was evaluated by the following performance indicators 16 rc i 1 q j 1 n 1 n e k 1 n e c i j k r i j 2 q n 17 rm i 1 q j 1 n c i j r i j 2 q n where rc is the root mean square error between the final ensemble realizations of model parameters or predicted states c and their reference values r r are the true values of conductivities fluxes and temperature measurements on all nodes in the numerical case but it only contains the temperature measurements at observation locations in the experimental case because the true conductivities and fluxes there are unknown rm is the root mean square error between the mean values of these assessed variables c and their reference values n is the number of nodes for the numerical case and the number of observation locations for the sandbox experimental case respectively with j denoting its index n e is the total number of ensemble realizations and k is the corresponding index q is the number of the reference sets and i is the corresponding index since the reference true parameters are randomly chosen in the numerical case to avoid accidental errors performance comparisons were repeated for 20 randomly chosen sets of reference parameters i e q 20 essentially the two performance indicators are based on the root mean square error between the assessed model parameters states and their respective true values the smaller rm values indicate more accurate estimation of the means while smaller rc values show lower uncertainty in the estimation results 3 case studies 3 1 numerical case a numerical case fig 2 was first set up for the sandbox experiment to evaluate the performance of different assimilation scenarios based on the sandbox experiment two constant hydraulic heads 0 906 m and 0 72 m were applied at the top and bottom boundaries respectively and no flow boundary conditions were prescribed for the lateral boundaries for heat transport in the numerical model the top boundary temperature was assumed to be sinusoidal according to previous studies irvine et al 2015a luce et al 2013 18 t t t ave a sin 2 π t p where t ave 30 c was the average temperature a 5 c and p 4 h the lower boundary was an outflow boundary and the lateral boundaries were insulated with the chosen temperature amplitude the influence of heat transport on groundwater flow was negligible hecht méndez et al 2010 ma and zheng 2010 as suggested by irvine et al 2015a the initial temperature fields were generated by running the model for a sufficiently long time with the prescribed boundary conditions the model domain was discretized into 4000 100 40 nodes in this case only the hydraulic conductivities on these nodes were treated as unknowns while other parameters were given as constants listed in table 2 the heterogeneous log k field was modeled as a gaussian random field with the following statistics 19 log k 3 13 log md 1 20 σ log k 2 1 21 c log k x 1 x 2 c log k x 1 z 1 x 2 z 2 σ log k 2 exp x 1 x 2 l x z 1 z 2 l z where l x 0 5 m and l z 0 2 m are the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths respectively the choleskydecomposition was employed to generate the random fields which were then used to derive the initial ensemble of flux fields by solving the groundwater flow equation eq 1 with comsol hydraulic head and temperature measurements were obtained through running the simulation with a randomly chosen reference field the measurement errors of hydraulic head and temperature were assumed to follow the gaussian distributions with zero means and standard deviations of 5 10 3 m and 0 1 c respectively according to the accuracies of the sensors used in the sandbox experiment the total simulation period was set as 4 h and the measurement interval was 5 min thus temperatures at all 63 observation locations denoted by circles in fig 2 were recorded 48 times during the entire simulation period while hydraulic heads were recorded only once because they remained unchanged in the steady state flow field since the applicability of the 1 d analytical solution based methods in heterogeneous streambeds and multidirectional flow fields has been numerically evaluated in previous studies irvine et al 2015a roshan et al 2012 we only implemented the 2 d flux estimation in our numerical case the temperature data of the first 45 records 63 45 data points as well as the 63 steady state hydraulic head measurements were used to estimate the 2 d exchange fluxes 4000 2 horizontal and vertical components under different assimilation scenarios listed in table 1 while the last three temperature records 63 3 validation period were used to validate the estimations by testing the predictive ability of the estimated flux fields 3 1 1 estimation results of ies for the numerical case using 20 randomly chosen reference log k fields we obtained 20 sets of estimated 2 d exchange flux fields under the four different assimilation scenarios on average scenario s hkf with only head measurements required 14 iterations to reach convergence while the other three scenarios with high density temperature measurements only required 6 iterations performance indicators for the 20 sets of exchange flux fields were calculated for the first three assimilation scenarios the performance indicator values were also calculated for the estimated log k fields the estimation accuracy under each assimilation scenario was also assessed by the ability to predict the temperature during the validation period performance indicator values for the estimated log k fields exchange flux fields and temperature predictions during the validation period are listed in table 3 it can be seen that scenario s htkf gave the most accurate log k estimations followed by s tkf and scenario s hkf gave the worst estimations as indicated by the rm and rc values in terms of exchange flux estimation scenario s htkf with the most accurate log k estimations gave the best flux estimations among the first three scenarios assimilation of temperature data provided smaller rc values thus with lower uncertainty than that of the hydraulic head data did however scenario s tkf was superior over s hkf in estimating the mean horizontal fluxes smaller rm while s hkf performed better in estimating the mean vertical fluxes interestingly scenarios s tkf and s tf gave comparable water flux estimations with similar values of rm and rc this suggests that if the purpose is only to estimate the flux field it is more computationally efficient to directly estimate the flux field from temperature measurements on the other hand since the groundwater flow equation was not utilized in scenario s tf it is possible that some flux field realizations were not physically based i e the horizontal fluxes near the two lateral boundaries were nonzero for the temperature predictions during the validation period scenario s htkf gave more accurate results than s tkf and s tf did while the latter two had comparable rm and rc values that were smaller than those of scenario s hkf the estimated log k fields and the corresponding estimated 2 d flux fields are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively fig 3 shows that the estimated mean log k field from scenario s htkf best resembled the reference field and had the lowest variances while scenario s hkf clearly underestimated the true values and had the largest variances the results of the flux estimations fig 4 were generally in agreement with those of the log k estimations overall joint assimilation of hydraulic head and temperature data scenario s htkf provided the best estimation of exchange flux field while temperature measurements scenarios s tkf and s tf were superior to head measurements scenario s hkf when they were used independently this was attributed to that the hydraulic head and temperature carry non redundant information of conductivity consequently a joint assimilation provided more parameter information and led to more accurate flux estimations the reason for the relatively high efficacy of temperature measurements was partly due to that their observation density was much higher than that of hydraulic head data 3 2 sandbox experimental case to analyze the sandbox experimental data the domain was discretized in the same way as that in the numerical case resulting in 4000 nodes the log k field in the sandbox was also modeled as a gaussian random field following the same correlation function described in the numerical case the statistic properties i e mean variance and correlation scales of the estimated hydraulic conductivities were set based on the following considerations the log transformed effective hydraulic conductivity of the entire sandbox log 22 88 md 1 calculated by collecting the outflow from reservoir 2 during the experimental process flow through experiment was chosen as the mean of the random field although the packed sand only covered a relatively narrow grain size range the variance σ log k 2 was chosen as 1 corresponding to a moderate level of heterogeneity to model the heterogeneity induced by the non uniform packing and the heterogeneity resulting from grain size separation during packing the vertical correlation length l z was set as 0 2 m equaling the thickness of each packed layer while the ratio of horizontal correlation length l x to l z was chosen as 2 1 the initial ensemble of flux fields was also obtained by solving the groundwater flow equation with the initial conductivity ensemble it should be pointed out that an appropriate choice for the statistical parameters remains an open question in stochastic inverse methods it may be possible to estimate the statistical parameters as part of the inversion lee and kitanidis 2013 in this study the estimation of statistical parameters was not implemented since they would only produce minor impacts on the estimation results when ample measurements are available chen and zhang 2006 michael tso et al 2016 yeh and liu 2000 in this case the thermal parameters thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the sand were unknowns and they were estimated by ies using one set of temperature measurements in the absence of exchange fluxes the remaining parameters are given in table 4 the priors of thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the solid matrix were assumed to be uniformly distributed within the ranges of 1 6 w m 1 c 1 and 500 900 jkg 1 c 1 respectively with a good match between the predicted and observed temperatures rm 0 004 rc 0 0306 the estimated values of thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the solid matrix were 2 36 w m 1 c 1 and 758 jkg 1 c 1 respectively the two estimated thermal parameters were then used in the inversion of the experimental case with exchange fluxes similar to the numerical case the head and temperature measurements obtained from the sandbox experiments were assimilated under the four different scenarios fig 5 illustrates the temperature time series at all 63 observation points during the entire experimental period temperature time series from the same row were denoted with the same color to avoid the influence of boundary effects only the temperature measurements during the middle 315 min were analyzed in the ies assimilation temperature measurements collected during the first 300 min 63 60 assimilation period and the 63 steady state hydraulic head measurements were used to estimate the 2 d flux fields while the temperature measurements during the last 15 min validation period were used for validation purpose 3 2 1 estimation results of analytical approaches for the experimental case vertical fluxes in the sandbox were first inferred from the temperature time series during the assimilation period with analytical solution based methods an analytical solution based tool the vflux 2 package irvine et al 2015b was employed to calculate the vertical flux between every two adjacent measurement points in each column the estimated mean vertical flux was then taken as the vertical flux at the middle point of the two adjacent measurement points in this way fluxes at points located every 0 1 m from z 0 05 m to z 0 65 m in all nine columns were available the estimated vertical flux fields with different analytical solution based methods are presented in fig 6 there were some outliers in the flux fields calculated from a r and δ ϕ fig 6 a b the hatch a r method gave vertical fluxes with smaller absolute values compared with the other two methods the mean vertical fluxes through the whole sandbox were as follows 4 19 md 1 for the hatch a r method 5 87 md 1 for the hatch δ ϕ method and 4 71 md 1 for the combined a r and δ ϕ method all the estimated mean vertical fluxes deviated from the reference value of 5 32 md 1 from the flow through experiment this discrepancy is partially attributed to the heterogeneity of the sandbox which again demonstrated the necessity of using data assimilation methods to estimate the exchange fluxes in heterogeneous streambeds 3 2 2 estimation results of ies for the experimental case the number of iterations required to reach convergence under different assimilation scenarios were as follows 15 for scenario s hkf 8 for scenarios s tkf and s htkf and 9 for scenario s tf the estimated mean and variance fields of log k under different assimilation scenarios are presented in fig 7 the main patterns of the mean log k fields were similar with the high values of log k centered in the sandbox under different scenarios lower variances were observed around the observation locations scenario s htkf provided the smallest mean of variances 0 071 indicating the lowest uncertainty in the estimated log k field scenario s tkf gave an intermediate mean variance of 0 111 which was smaller than 0 557 by s hkf therefore the temperature measurements were superior to the hydraulic head measurements to reduce the uncertainty in the conductivity estimation which agreed with the results of numerical case studies fig 8 illustrates the estimated flux fields under the four different scenarios overall the estimated flux fields all showed similar patterns the magnitudes of the horizontal fluxes were generally smaller than those of the vertical fluxes due to the specified flow boundary conditions of the sandbox experiment compared with the estimated vertical fluxes from the analytical solution based methods fig 6 the spatial variation of the exchange fluxes estimated by ies was much smaller smoother as can be seen from fig 9 the reference mean vertical flux 5 32 md 1 was within the confidence intervals of the estimated vertical fluxes under the four different scenarios the mean vertical fluxes under the four different scenarios were as follows 5 17 md 1 for scenario s hkf 5 77 md 1 for scenario s tkf 5 71 md 1 for scenario s htkf and 5 63 md 1 for scenario s tf all of which were close to the reference value from the flow through experiment scenario s hkf performed the best in estimating the mean vertical flux which was in agreement with the findings of the above numerical case section 3 1 since the true hydraulic conductivities and flux fields in the sandbox were unknown the comparison of estimation accuracies under different scenarios was restricted to the ability to predict temperature during the validation period with the estimated exchange fluxes performance indicators for temperature predictions at the observation locations under different assimilation scenarios are listed in table 5 the values of rm and rc for scenario s htkf were again the smallest followed by scenarios s tkf and s tf which had comparable rm and rc values scenario s hkf had the largest rm and rc values in summary similar to the numerical case studies section 3 1 parameters estimated from scenario s htkf resulted in the lowest uncertainty and the best temperature predictions during the validation period while s hkf provided the worst estimations scenarios s tkf and s tf provided comparable flux fields and temperature predictions 4 conclusions in this study we used an iterative ensemble smoother to assimilate measurements of hydraulic head and or temperature to characterize the 2 d heterogeneous sw gw exchange flux fields that commonly exist in real world cases both numerical and sandbox experimental cases were conducted to evaluate the performances of different assimilation scenarios results of the numerical case studies indicated that temperature was advantageous over hydraulic head in estimating the 2 d flux fields joint assimilation of hydraulic head and temperature measurements led to the most accurate flux estimations and temperature predictions specifically compared with other assimilation scenarios estimating exchange fluxes directly from temperature measurements showed multiple merits i e the higher computational efficiency and lower requirement for a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions results of the sandbox experiment agreed with the numerical case study overall the ies method can provide more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those from the widely used analytical solution based methods while the ies method is computationally more demanding than the analytical solution based methods it can accurately estimate horizontal fluxes and corresponding uncertainties which are unavailable in the traditional analytical methods to alleviate the computational burden of ies surrogate based techniques i e the probabilistic collocation method man et al 2016 and the gaussian process regression zhang et al 2016 can be employed in future studies the comparisons of the assimilation scenarios can provide guidance on optimal monitoring design in related studies the ies method can improve modeling of the sw gw system under field conditions which is vital for water resources management and stream ecosystem conservation acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science

7444,spatial distribution of groundwater recharge discharge fluxes has an important impact on mass and energy exchanges in shallow streambeds during the last two decades extensive studies have been devoted to the quantification of one dimensional 1 d vertical exchange fluxes nevertheless few studies were conducted to characterize two dimensional 2 d heterogeneous flux fields that commonly exist in real world cases in this study we used an iterative ensemble smoother ies to quantify the spatial distribution of 2 d exchange fluxes by assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements four assimilation scenarios corresponding to different potential field applications were tested in the first three scenarios the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields were first inferred from hydraulic head and or temperature measurements and then the flux fields were derived through darcy s law using the estimated conductivity fields in the fourth scenario the flux fields were estimated directly from the temperature measurements which is more efficient and especially suitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable we concluded that the best estimation could be achieved through jointly assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements and temperature data were superior to the head data when they were used independently overall the ies method provided more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those given by the widely used analytical solution based methods furthermore ies gave reasonable uncertainty estimations which were unavailable in traditional methods since temperature can be accurately monitored with high spatial and temporal resolutions the coupling of heat tracing techniques and ies provides promising potential in quantifying complex exchange fluxes under field conditions keywords heat tracer exchange flux data assimilation heterogeneity sandbox experiment 1 introduction accurate quantification of surface water and ground water sw gw exchange fluxes in shallow aquifers is important to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the studied regions boulton et al 2010 krause et al 2014 sophocleous 2002 among various methods for estimating the sw gw exchange fluxes heat tracing has been receiving the most attention since temperature is a naturally occurring and environmentally friendly tracer that can be easily and reliably measured constantz and su 2003 johnson et al 2005 new developments of the heat tracing methods such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensing dts have enabled temperature monitoring at increased spatial and temporal resolutions resulting in vast applications in sw gw interaction related studies becker et al 2013 briggs et al 2016 2012 hare et al 2015 a common approach to infer vertical sw gw exchange fluxes from diurnal temperature signals is based on the analytical solution of 1 d heat transport equation which explicitly expresses the relationship between the temperature time series and the vertical exchange flux hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 mccallum et al 2012 this analytical approach is valid only if multiple assumptions are satisfied 1 sinusoidal temperature signal 2 1 d vertical water flow 3 thermal equilibrium between the matrix and water and 4 homogeneous thermal and hydraulic properties of the streambed in natural conditions however these assumptions are often invalid many studies have been conducted to evaluate the applicability of analytical solution based methods to determine the vertical water flux under non ideal conditions for example lautz 2010 found that multidimensional flows can cause a larger error compared to violations of other assumptions rau et al 2015 observed that the non sinusoidal temperature boundary can significantly influence the results of the estimated fluxes irvine et al 2015a quantitativelyanalyzed the influence of streambed heterogeneity and concluded that the errors in flux estimation increase as the degree of heterogeneity increases to overcome the limitations of the analytical approach voytek et al 2014 developed a numerical algorithm 1dtemppro to estimate vertical sw gw exchange fluxes by calibrating the model to the observed temperature profiles at the presence of complicated forcing mechanisms besides frequency domain methods have also been introduced to quantify vertical flux components based on spectral analysis of streambed temperature time series at different depths schneidewind et al 2016 vandersteen et al 2015 wörman et al 2012 nevertheless these methods only provide vertical exchange flux estimations whereas heterogeneous non vertical sw gw exchange is ubiquitous in real world cases bhaskar et al 2012 rau et al 2010 swanson and cardenas 2010 furthermore these classical methods are deterministic in that they only provide the unique estimation result and the estimation uncertainties cannot be quantified data assimilations methods can be employed as ideal tools to quantify the spatially heterogeneous exchange fluxes and corresponding estimation uncertainties the ensemble kalman filter enkf and its variants have been widely used to estimate unknown parameters or states evensen 2003 since the sensitivity information is not required to be explicitly calculated the ensemble based methods can be easily implemented with existing simulators recently huang et al 2016 assimilated dts data and vertical hydraulic gradients to estimate streambed hydraulic conductivities and 1 d vertical exchange fluxes using both enkf and enks smoother nevertheless to the best of our knowledge there are very few existing data assimilation studies on estimating 2 d heterogeneous flux fields furthermore the iterative ensemble smoother ies method assimilates the entire historical data in an iterative batch mode and has been shown to perform better than other variants of enkf chen and oliver 2013 emerick and reynolds 2013 inspired by the recent advances in sw gw exchange flux quantification and data assimilation the main objectives of this study were to i experimentally evaluate the applicability of the 1 d analytical method in quantifying vertical exchange fluxes in a heterogeneous streambed ii assess the applicability of a more powerful data assimilation method ies to 2 d heterogeneous flux quantification iii compare the efficacy of various measurements under different assimilation scenarios we first implemented 2 d synthetic numerical cases in which the true exchange fluxes and conductivities were exactly known thus the estimation accuracy of ies could be readily evaluated then the ies method was applied to a sandbox experiment under well controlled experimental conditions for further validation the rest of this paper is organized as follows the methodologies are described in section 2 both numerical and experimental case studies are presented in section 3 and conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations in this study groundwater flow is incompressible and in the steady state in a 2 d domain when the principal directions of the conductivity tensor are the same as the principal coordinate directions the flow process can be described as 1 x k x h x z k z h z 0 and the darcy water flux

implementation details of the ies method are presented assuming that the relationship between the measurements and the model parameters can be expressed as 11 d obs f m ε where d obs is a vector for the measurements f is the forward model m is a vector for the unknown parameters and ε is a vector of normally distributed measurement errors with zero mean and covariance c d e ε ε t the ies method is then implemented in the following way step 1 generate n e parameter samples from the prior distribution and then the initial ensemble for the parameters can be expressed as 12 m 0 m 1 0 m ne 0 where the superscript denotes iteration index and the subscript denotes the ensemble number index step 2 at the l th iteration step l 1 2 the parameter ensemble m l can be iteratively updated with the

this study we used ies to assimilate hydraulic head and or temperature measurements to estimate 2 d steady flux fields the estimation uncertainties were represented by the final ensemble of ies four assimilation scenarios using different measurements and models were tested in the first scenario s hkf only the hydraulic head measurements were used to estimate the log transformed hydraulic conductivity log k field in the second scenario s tkf only the temperature measurements were used to update the log k field in the third scenario s htkf the hydraulic head and temperature measurements were jointly assimilated to estimate the log k field the estimations of flux fields were then derived using darcy s law with the estimated conductivity fields generally more accurate log k estimations lead to better flux estimations these three updating scenarios were designed to systematically compare the efficacy of the two types of measurements in estimating the sw gw exchange flux fields the comparisons can provide guidance on optimal monitoring design in related studies since only the steady groundwater flow was considered in this study the fluxes were treated as static parameters and estimated with the temperature measurements directly in the fourth scenario s tf in this scenario the groundwater flow equation was only solved to obtain the initial ensemble of flux fields based on the initial conductivity ensemble and not used in the update process of ies therefore the computational cost can be greatly reduced compared with the first three scenarios another advantage of this scenario is that the potential model errors in the groundwater flow modeling can be avoided since ensemble based methods are generally robust even with the biased prior information chen and zhang 2006 this assimilation scenario is especiallysuitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable while the first three scenarios need a more detailed survey on the flow conditions table 1 lists the measurements and models used in different scenarios to guarantee the estimation accuracy of the ies method a relatively large ensemble size n e 600 was used the convergence ratio γ was chosen as 1 10 4 in the inversion of both the numerical and sandbox experimental cases 2 4 sandbox experiments a sandbox made of plexiglass with w h d 1 86 m 1 m 0 12 m was used to carry out the experiment the top of the sandbox wasused for holding surface water with a constant pressure head of 0 1 m the height of reservoir 2 was adjustable to allow for creating desired hydraulic gradients the sandbox from h 0 05 m to h 0 85 m was filled with the same type of sieved natural quartz sand with diameter ranging from 0 15 mm to 1 mm before filling the sandbox the sand was washed to remove fine particles to facilitate precise packing sand was filled and packed at a 0 2 m increment in the box the bottom 0 05 m of the sandbox was equally divided into five rectangular bays in the vertical direction to ensure the bottom boundary could receive equal pressure exerted by reservoir 2 as shown in fig 1 63 ports 2 5 cm in diameter were drilled on the front wall of the sandbox a hermetically sealed thermistor omegahsth 44 000series and a pressure transducer honeywell 19c003pg5k with a range of 0 3 psi were then installed at each port the instrument accuracies were 0 1 c for the thermistors and 0 25 full scale span for the pressure transducers respectively these sensors were wired to a campbell scientific cr1000 data acquisition system to collect data to prevent heat exchange with the environment the sandbox was covered with insulationmaterials during the experiments the top and bottom head boundaries were maintained constant as 0 906 m and 0 72 m respectively to simulate temperature variation of surface water the heater in reservoir 1 was turned on and off with a 2 h interval thus the surface water temperature approximated a sinusoidal variation with a period of 4 h and a range of 23 33 c hydraulic head and temperature data at the 63 ports were monitored at a 5 min interval 2 5 performance measures the estimation accuracy was evaluated by the following performance indicators 16 rc i 1 q j 1 n 1 n e k 1 n e c i j k r i j 2 q n 17 rm i 1 q j 1 n c i j r i j 2 q n where rc is the root mean square error between the final ensemble realizations of model parameters or predicted states c and their reference values r r are the true values of conductivities fluxes and temperature measurements on all nodes in the numerical case but it only contains the temperature measurements at observation locations in the experimental case because the true conductivities and fluxes there are unknown rm is the root mean square error between the mean values of these assessed variables c and their reference values n is the number of nodes for the numerical case and the number of observation locations for the sandbox experimental case respectively with j denoting its index n e is the total number of ensemble realizations and k is the corresponding index q is the number of the reference sets and i is the corresponding index since the reference true parameters are randomly chosen in the numerical case to avoid accidental errors performance comparisons were repeated for 20 randomly chosen sets of reference parameters i e q 20 essentially the two performance indicators are based on the root mean square error between the assessed model parameters states and their respective true values the smaller rm values indicate more accurate estimation of the means while smaller rc values show lower uncertainty in the estimation results 3 case studies 3 1 numerical case a numerical case fig 2 was first set up for the sandbox experiment to evaluate the performance of different assimilation scenarios based on the sandbox experiment two constant hydraulic heads 0 906 m and 0 72 m were applied at the top and bottom boundaries respectively and no flow boundary conditions were prescribed for the lateral boundaries for heat transport in the numerical model the top boundary temperature was assumed to be sinusoidal according to previous studies irvine et al 2015a luce et al 2013 18 t t t ave a sin 2 π t p where t ave 30 c was the average temperature a 5 c and p 4 h the lower boundary was an outflow boundary and the lateral boundaries were insulated with the chosen temperature amplitude the influence of heat transport on groundwater flow was negligible hecht méndez et al 2010 ma and zheng 2010 as suggested by irvine et al 2015a the initial temperature fields were generated by running the model for a sufficiently long time with the prescribed boundary conditions the model domain was discretized into 4000 100 40 nodes in this case only the hydraulic conductivities on these nodes were treated as unknowns while other parameters were given as constants listed in table 2 the heterogeneous log k field was modeled as a gaussian random field with the following statistics 19 log k 3 13 log md 1 20 σ log k 2 1 21 c log k x 1 x 2 c log k x 1 z 1 x 2 z 2 σ log k 2 exp x 1 x 2 l x z 1 z 2 l z where l x 0 5 m and l z 0 2 m are the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths respectively the choleskydecomposition was employed to generate the random fields which were then used to derive the initial ensemble of flux fields by solving the groundwater flow equation eq 1 with comsol hydraulic head and temperature measurements were obtained through running the simulation with a randomly chosen reference field the measurement errors of hydraulic head and temperature were assumed to follow the gaussian distributions with zero means and standard deviations of 5 10 3 m and 0 1 c respectively according to the accuracies of the sensors used in the sandbox experiment the total simulation period was set as 4 h and the measurement interval was 5 min thus temperatures at all 63 observation locations denoted by circles in fig 2 were recorded 48 times during the entire simulation period while hydraulic heads were recorded only once because they remained unchanged in the steady state flow field since the applicability of the 1 d analytical solution based methods in heterogeneous streambeds and multidirectional flow fields has been numerically evaluated in previous studies irvine et al 2015a roshan et al 2012 we only implemented the 2 d flux estimation in our numerical case the temperature data of the first 45 records 63 45 data points as well as the 63 steady state hydraulic head measurements were used to estimate the 2 d exchange fluxes 4000 2 horizontal and vertical components under different assimilation scenarios listed in table 1 while the last three temperature records 63 3 validation period were used to validate the estimations by testing the predictive ability of the estimated flux fields 3 1 1 estimation results of ies for the numerical case using 20 randomly chosen reference log k fields we obtained 20 sets of estimated 2 d exchange flux fields under the four different assimilation scenarios on average scenario s hkf with only head measurements required 14 iterations to reach convergence while the other three scenarios with high density temperature measurements only required 6 iterations performance indicators for the 20 sets of exchange flux fields were calculated for the first three assimilation scenarios the performance indicator values were also calculated for the estimated log k fields the estimation accuracy under each assimilation scenario was also assessed by the ability to predict the temperature during the validation period performance indicator values for the estimated log k fields exchange flux fields and temperature predictions during the validation period are listed in table 3 it can be seen that scenario s htkf gave the most accurate log k estimations followed by s tkf and scenario s hkf gave the worst estimations as indicated by the rm and rc values in terms of exchange flux estimation scenario s htkf with the most accurate log k estimations gave the best flux estimations among the first three scenarios assimilation of temperature data provided smaller rc values thus with lower uncertainty than that of the hydraulic head data did however scenario s tkf was superior over s hkf in estimating the mean horizontal fluxes smaller rm while s hkf performed better in estimating the mean vertical fluxes interestingly scenarios s tkf and s tf gave comparable water flux estimations with similar values of rm and rc this suggests that if the purpose is only to estimate the flux field it is more computationally efficient to directly estimate the flux field from temperature measurements on the other hand since the groundwater flow equation was not utilized in scenario s tf it is possible that some flux field realizations were not physically based i e the horizontal fluxes near the two lateral boundaries were nonzero for the temperature predictions during the validation period scenario s htkf gave more accurate results than s tkf and s tf did while the latter two had comparable rm and rc values that were smaller than those of scenario s hkf the estimated log k fields and the corresponding estimated 2 d flux fields are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively fig 3 shows that the estimated mean log k field from scenario s htkf best resembled the reference field and had the lowest variances while scenario s hkf clearly underestimated the true values and had the largest variances the results of the flux estimations fig 4 were generally in agreement with those of the log k estimations overall joint assimilation of hydraulic head and temperature data scenario s htkf provided the best estimation of exchange flux field while temperature measurements scenarios s tkf and s tf were superior to head measurements scenario s hkf when they were used independently this was attributed to that the hydraulic head and temperature carry non redundant information of conductivity consequently a joint assimilation provided more parameter information and led to more accurate flux estimations the reason for the relatively high efficacy of temperature measurements was partly due to that their observation density was much higher than that of hydraulic head data 3 2 sandbox experimental case to analyze the sandbox experimental data the domain was discretized in the same way as that in the numerical case resulting in 4000 nodes the log k field in the sandbox was also modeled as a gaussian random field following the same correlation function described in the numerical case the statistic properties i e mean variance and correlation scales of the estimated hydraulic conductivities were set based on the following considerations the log transformed effective hydraulic conductivity of the entire sandbox log 22 88 md 1 calculated by collecting the outflow from reservoir 2 during the experimental process flow through experiment was chosen as the mean of the random field although the packed sand only covered a relatively narrow grain size range the variance σ log k 2 was chosen as 1 corresponding to a moderate level of heterogeneity to model the heterogeneity induced by the non uniform packing and the heterogeneity resulting from grain size separation during packing the vertical correlation length l z was set as 0 2 m equaling the thickness of each packed layer while the ratio of horizontal correlation length l x to l z was chosen as 2 1 the initial ensemble of flux fields was also obtained by solving the groundwater flow equation with the initial conductivity ensemble it should be pointed out that an appropriate choice for the statistical parameters remains an open question in stochastic inverse methods it may be possible to estimate the statistical parameters as part of the inversion lee and kitanidis 2013 in this study the estimation of statistical parameters was not implemented since they would only produce minor impacts on the estimation results when ample measurements are available chen and zhang 2006 michael tso et al 2016 yeh and liu 2000 in this case the thermal parameters thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the sand were unknowns and they were estimated by ies using one set of temperature measurements in the absence of exchange fluxes the remaining parameters are given in table 4 the priors of thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the solid matrix were assumed to be uniformly distributed within the ranges of 1 6 w m 1 c 1 and 500 900 jkg 1 c 1 respectively with a good match between the predicted and observed temperatures rm 0 004 rc 0 0306 the estimated values of thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the solid matrix were 2 36 w m 1 c 1 and 758 jkg 1 c 1 respectively the two estimated thermal parameters were then used in the inversion of the experimental case with exchange fluxes similar to the numerical case the head and temperature measurements obtained from the sandbox experiments were assimilated under the four different scenarios fig 5 illustrates the temperature time series at all 63 observation points during the entire experimental period temperature time series from the same row were denoted with the same color to avoid the influence of boundary effects only the temperature measurements during the middle 315 min were analyzed in the ies assimilation temperature measurements collected during the first 300 min 63 60 assimilation period and the 63 steady state hydraulic head measurements were used to estimate the 2 d flux fields while the temperature measurements during the last 15 min validation period were used for validation purpose 3 2 1 estimation results of analytical approaches for the experimental case vertical fluxes in the sandbox were first inferred from the temperature time series during the assimilation period with analytical solution based methods an analytical solution based tool the vflux 2 package irvine et al 2015b was employed to calculate the vertical flux between every two adjacent measurement points in each column the estimated mean vertical flux was then taken as the vertical flux at the middle point of the two adjacent measurement points in this way fluxes at points located every 0 1 m from z 0 05 m to z 0 65 m in all nine columns were available the estimated vertical flux fields with different analytical solution based methods are presented in fig 6 there were some outliers in the flux fields calculated from a r and δ ϕ fig 6 a b the hatch a r method gave vertical fluxes with smaller absolute values compared with the other two methods the mean vertical fluxes through the whole sandbox were as follows 4 19 md 1 for the hatch a r method 5 87 md 1 for the hatch δ ϕ method and 4 71 md 1 for the combined a r and δ ϕ method all the estimated mean vertical fluxes deviated from the reference value of 5 32 md 1 from the flow through experiment this discrepancy is partially attributed to the heterogeneity of the sandbox which again demonstrated the necessity of using data assimilation methods to estimate the exchange fluxes in heterogeneous streambeds 3 2 2 estimation results of ies for the experimental case the number of iterations required to reach convergence under different assimilation scenarios were as follows 15 for scenario s hkf 8 for scenarios s tkf and s htkf and 9 for scenario s tf the estimated mean and variance fields of log k under different assimilation scenarios are presented in fig 7 the main patterns of the mean log k fields were similar with the high values of log k centered in the sandbox under different scenarios lower variances were observed around the observation locations scenario s htkf provided the smallest mean of variances 0 071 indicating the lowest uncertainty in the estimated log k field scenario s tkf gave an intermediate mean variance of 0 111 which was smaller than 0 557 by s hkf therefore the temperature measurements were superior to the hydraulic head measurements to reduce the uncertainty in the conductivity estimation which agreed with the results of numerical case studies fig 8 illustrates the estimated flux fields under the four different scenarios overall the estimated flux fields all showed similar patterns the magnitudes of the horizontal fluxes were generally smaller than those of the vertical fluxes due to the specified flow boundary conditions of the sandbox experiment compared with the estimated vertical fluxes from the analytical solution based methods fig 6 the spatial variation of the exchange fluxes estimated by ies was much smaller smoother as can be seen from fig 9 the reference mean vertical flux 5 32 md 1 was within the confidence intervals of the estimated vertical fluxes under the four different scenarios the mean vertical fluxes under the four different scenarios were as follows 5 17 md 1 for scenario s hkf 5 77 md 1 for scenario s tkf 5 71 md 1 for scenario s htkf and 5 63 md 1 for scenario s tf all of which were close to the reference value from the flow through experiment scenario s hkf performed the best in estimating the mean vertical flux which was in agreement with the findings of the above numerical case section 3 1 since the true hydraulic conductivities and flux fields in the sandbox were unknown the comparison of estimation accuracies under different scenarios was restricted to the ability to predict temperature during the validation period with the estimated exchange fluxes performance indicators for temperature predictions at the observation locations under different assimilation scenarios are listed in table 5 the values of rm and rc for scenario s htkf were again the smallest followed by scenarios s tkf and s tf which had comparable rm and rc values scenario s hkf had the largest rm and rc values in summary similar to the numerical case studies section 3 1 parameters estimated from scenario s htkf resulted in the lowest uncertainty and the best temperature predictions during the validation period while s hkf provided the worst estimations scenarios s tkf and s tf provided comparable flux fields and temperature predictions 4 conclusions in this study we used an iterative ensemble smoother to assimilate measurements of hydraulic head and or temperature to characterize the 2 d heterogeneous sw gw exchange flux fields that commonly exist in real world cases both numerical and sandbox experimental cases were conducted to evaluate the performances of different assimilation scenarios results of the numerical case studies indicated that temperature was advantageous over hydraulic head in estimating the 2 d flux fields joint assimilation of hydraulic head and temperature measurements led to the most accurate flux estimations and temperature predictions specifically compared with other assimilation scenarios estimating exchange fluxes directly from temperature measurements showed multiple merits i e the higher computational efficiency and lower requirement for a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions results of the sandbox experiment agreed with the numerical case study overall the ies method can provide more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those from the widely used analytical solution based methods while the ies method is computationally more demanding than the analytical solution based methods it can accurately estimate horizontal fluxes and corresponding uncertainties which are unavailable in the traditional analytical methods to alleviate the computational burden of ies surrogate based techniques i e the probabilistic collocation method man et al 2016 and the gaussian process regression zhang et al 2016 can be employed in future studies the comparisons of the assimilation scenarios can provide guidance on optimal monitoring design in related studies the ies method can improve modeling of the sw gw system under field conditions which is vital for water resources management and stream ecosystem conservation acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science
