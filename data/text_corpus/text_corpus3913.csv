19565,a win win strategy by the integration of wastewater treatment with value added products production through a vertical algal biofilm enhanced raceway was investigated in the present study raceway pond was enhanced by vertically setting the biofilm in the system with a certain interval distance that could be adjusted for different light conditions and wastewater types two types of synthetic wastewater were treated with suitability proven materials as biofilm carriers under four operation distances composition of the harvested algal biomass was analyzed coral velvet with 5 8 mm length villus was the optimal carrier since it was durable and with high biomass productivity 6 95 8 11 g m 2 day 1 nutrients in the wastewaters were efficiently removed with the cod tn and tp reduction of over 86 61 73 68 and 89 85 respectively wastewater with the low nutrients concentration experienced lower biomass and lipid productivity but larger biodiesel productivity and higher nutrient removal efficiency in addition as the operation distance increased wastewater treatment efficiency was first increased but then decreased while algal biomass footprint production was decreased differences in nutrients removal efficiencies were mainly due to the distance difference which caused different biofilm culture surface areas and light regimes the optimal operation distance as a function of the efficient nutrient removal and biodiesel production in this study was 6 cm graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal biomass biofilm carrier biodiesel mechanical harvester wastewater 1 introduction owing to the global industrialization and living standard enhancement of mankind wastewater generation is sharply increased in recent years zeng et al 2015 discarding of wastewater into environment without any treatment or inefficient pollutant removal is harmful to the water body soil and even the atmosphere zeng et al 2015 wastewater treatment could be conducted by chemical physical and biological methods treating wastewater via aerobic process is energy exhaustive and inefficient in nitrogen and phosphorus removal and it also generates huge amount of sludge which needs large input for the management salama et al 2017 besides nutrient removal via nitrification denitrification membrane separation and chemical precipitation is also energy and or resource intensive especially for the treatment of industrial wastewaters hu et al 2017 however wastewater is an excellent medium for algal growth by providing nitrogen phosphorus and carbon source mu et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 and many algal species could grow in industrial wastewater which has poisonous and harmful substances like heavy metals raslavicius et al 2018 wastewater treatment via microalgae cultivation is a win win strategy for not only producing algal biomass for the algal based clean energy production miranda et al 2017 ooms et al 2016 but also saving plenty of money related to the removal of nitrogen phosphorus etc rawat et al 2013 algae are efficient in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater sharp et al 2017 su et al 2011 traditional algal based wastewater treatment system involves raceway pond multi layer open pond like bioreactors and different types of closed bioreactors de vree et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 among these systems raceway pond is believed to be the most feasible and cost effective facility to treat large amounts of wastewater due to its lower capital cost easier to scale up and higher treatment volume compared to other techniques zhou et al 2013 however traditional raceway ponds with suspended algal culture have various limitations 1 limited light penetration due to the self shadowing effect wang et al 2015 2 inefficient photosynthesis 3 energy consuming and expensive for harvesting the suspended algal biomass christenson and sims 2012 and 4 deteriorated effluent quality induced by inefficient harvest of the biomass zhou et al 2014 these drawbacks greatly limit its upscaling algal biofilm systems have the advantages that cells can be grown as biofilm so no separation of algal biomass from wastewater is needed before discharging the effluent and biomass can be just harvested by scrapping which largely reduces the downstream processing costs meanwhile higher light penetration efficiency exists during the attached cultivation wang et al 2015 algal biofilm based wastewater treatment systems have been widely reported and some examples are rotating disks christenson and sims 2012 algal turf scrubber mulbry and wilkie 2001 rotating algal biofilm reactor christenson and sims 2012 and horizontal biofilm reactor boelee et al 2011 however these systems are either inefficient in algal biomass production and wastewater treatment due to the limited biofilm culture surface on unit land footprint or poor in cell attachment due to the moving and folding of the carrier materials besides biofilm is more susceptible to the changed light condition because light directly penetrates on its surface and cannot be diluted in these systems therefore a new kind of vertical algal biofilm enhanced raceway pond vab enhanced raceway has been developed for efficient wastewater treatment and algal biomass production algal cells are attached to the carrier materials which are vertically set inside the raceway pond and biomass is just harvested through scrapping with no need of the separation of algal biomass from the effluent in addition such vertical strategy can also largely increase the biofilm growth area on the unit land footprint area meanwhile incident light can be well diluted to adapt to different light conditions by adjusting the distance between the vertical biofilms and thus photo limitation and photo inhibition are under control hence the objectives of this study were to 1 prove the concept of the vab system and determine the optimal materials for algal attachment 2 detect the optimal operation conditions 3 estimate the productivities of algal biomass lipid and biodiesel and 4 specify the scale up possibility of the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal strains and subculture the microalgae scenedesmus obliquus fachb 416 chlorella vulgaris fachb 32 and oscillatoria tenuis fachb 1052 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences pr china were involved in this study prior to each batch of study all species were grown in 150 ml autoclaved bg 11 medium under a light intensity of 200 μmol m 2s 1 with a light dark cycle of 14 10 h on an orbital shaker 60 rpm at 25 2 c the cultures were then used for inoculation into the vab enhanced raceway when the optical density od685 reached about 1 0 1 5 after cultivation for four to six days 2 2 laboratory scale vab enhanced raceway pond in this study vab enhanced raceway pond was constructed with a raceway pond a rotator and a couple of vertical algal biofilm components fig 1 a two identical vab enhanced raceways were designed the rotator was constructed with a motor 220 v 60 w 51k90 120a a xin li china and four paddle impellers fig 1a the raceway pond was built with 70 cm length 40 cm width and 15 cm height fig 1b algal biofilm growth area was set in the middle of the raceway pond with an area of 2 20 40 cm2 and illuminated with led lights under light intensity of 425 μmol m 2s 1 in a light dark cycle of 14 10 h growth area was further divided into eight parts for simplified sampling procedure by ten biofilm support brackets fig 1c which were fixed at the bottom of the pond each part own an area of 20 10 cm2 fig 1b materials used for algal attachment were first divided into 10 11 cm2 and then were fixed onto two straight stainless steel wires with the length of 12 cm diameter of 2 mm to form a biofilm component fig 1c then the components were vertically positioned in the supporting brackets parallel to each other after each batch culture the materials were cleanly washed with deionized water for the next batch cultivation each component was considered as a sample and the distance between each component can be adjusted to dilute the incident light to obtain suitable light intensity for algal growth during this study distances of 2 4 6 and 8 cm between each component corresponding to the total amount of components about 64 32 24 and 16 pieces were studied this was based on the consideration that different operation distances would result in different light regimes total biofilm culture areas and nutrient loading rates thus affecting the nutrient removal efficiency and algal biomass production during each batch culture 30 l bg 11 medium was added into each tank with an operation depth of 11 cm meanwhile three types of algal cultures with each 100 ml were added to seed the vertical components since bacteria can encourage algal immigration onto substrata flemming and wingender 2010 hodoki 2005 100 ml filtrated by filter paper unsterile wastewater from the primary sedimentation tank of long wang zui wastewater treatment plant in wuhan china was also added into the system to promote algal biofilm formation the corresponding dry bacteria biomass content was determined as 0 011 0 009 g according to the method listed in the supplementary material then the experiment was started after seeding for 24 h during the whole experiment the initial ph of the medium wastewater was adjusted to 6 8 0 2 and the rotating speed of the rotator was set at 20 rpm min 1 with an average medium flow velocity of 11 cm s 1 the temperature was controlled at about 28 2 c by air conditioner and the water evaporation lose was balanced daily with deionized water besides the tank was also aerated with 0 05 co2 with a flow rate of 6 l min 1 2 3 mechanical harvester for potential scale up a mechanical harvester for the harvest of algal biofilm from the vab enhanced raceway on full scale was designed as shown in fig 2 two plastic augers are driven by a motor and continuously scrap the biomass off the vertical algal biofilm on both sides and the biomass is collected into the hoppers meanwhile the harvest component assembly is slowly displaced along the length of the raceway pond through the orbit during harvesting and thus can achieve continuous harvest 2 4 algal biofilm cultivation and wastewater treatment 2 4 1 attached algal growth test twelve types of materials were tested to evaluate the ability of supporting the attached algal growth including coral velvet long 1 coral velvet short 2 pleuche 3 cotton linen 4 coarse linen 5 fine linen 6 cotton duct 7 polyester cotton duct 8 gauze 9 non woven fabric 10 organza 11 pearl ice silk 12 each with four replicates details of the materials are listed in the supplementary material table s1 figs s1 s2 s3 and s4 biofilm cultivation was processed using bg 11 medium with the operation distance of 6 cm the preliminary screening of the twelve materials was processed for ten days then the further screening of the suitable materials was processed for eight days with three batches and fresh materials were used each time nutrition supplement was conducted by daily replacing the medium at a 20 exchange ratio besides preliminary study found that some materials had a weight loss during the cultivation process so the system was also run for 10 day at the same conditions mentioned above without inoculating algal cultures to test the duration of the materials 2 4 2 synthetic wastewater treatment the selected suitable material was further used as biofilm carrier for synthetic wastewater treatment after inoculating for 24 h bg 11 medium was discarded and 30 l synthetic wastewater was added in the tank for the treatment two kinds of synthetic wastewater wastewater a ww a and wastewater b ww b were used the composition are listed in table s2 ww a was prepared based on the primary settled sewage composition from long wang zui wastewater treatment plant ww b was prepared based on the piggery wastewater composition from a hog farm in suizhou city hubei province china after treatment the used carriers were cleanly washed and autoclaved 121 c 30 min for the next batch cultivation 2 5 analytical method 2 5 1 light dilution the light dilution rate at different operation distances was defined following the description in the study of liu et al 2013 1 r l s m s a where s m and s a are the material surface area both sides and biofilm culture area 2 20 40 cm2 inside the raceway pond respectively the corresponding theoretical received light intensity of algal biofilm was obtained using eq 2 2 l l 0 r l where l 0 is the provided light intensity equal to 425 μmol m 2s 1 2 5 2 biofilm production and nutrients analysis during the attached algal growth test some carriers like cotton duct and gauze were decomposed and it is difficult to harvest the algal biomass through scrapping indeed carriers with biofilm attached on it were together harvested and oven dried at 103 c for 24 h biomass production and productivity were obtained using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 biomass production w w 0 022 4 biomass production w w 0 022 t where w is the dry weight of raw material w is the total dry weight of material and biofilm after cultivation 0 022 is the plan view surface area of a single biofilm component on both sides t is the culture period during wastewater treatment biofilm was sampled through scrapping by a plastic ruler every two days and at least four biofilm components were harvested randomly after the harvest the components were fixed back into the system samples were oven dried at 103 c for 24 h and the biomass production and productivity were calculated as follows 5 biomass production based on material surface area w b 0 022 6 biomass productivity based on material surface area w b 0 022 t 7 biomass production based on land footprint area w b r l 0 022 8 biomass productivity based on land footprint area w b r l 0 022 t where w b is the dry weight of the harvested biofilm during the duration test materials were oven dried at 75 c and weighted before and after experiment the mass lose percentage of the material was obtained according to the following formula 9 material mass lose percentage w w 1 w 100 where w 1 is the material dry weight after duration test meanwhile 20 ml wastewater was also sampled every day from each tank for the nutrients analysis samples were first filtered through a 0 45 μm filter millipore corporation usa and then the concentrations of n no3 n nh4 tn total nitrogen tp total phosphorus and cod chemical oxygen demand were measured according to astm standards astm d6508 for n no3 analysis astm d6919 for n nh4 analysis astm d8001 for tn and tp analysis astm d1252 for cod analysis the ph and dissolved oxygen do concentration in the system were daily measured with a ph electrode fe20 mettler toledo usa and a dissolved oxygen analyzer f4 mettler toledo usa respectively percentage removal and daily maximum removal rate of nutrients were calculated using eq 10 and eq 11 10 percentage removal c 0 c min c 0 100 11 daily maximum removal rate max c i c i 1 30 0 16 i 1 t where c 0 and c i are the nutrient concentrations at day 0 and day i respectively c min is the minimum nutrient concentrations during the process 30 l and 0 16 m2 are the wastewater volume and biofilm culture footprint area in the system respectively in addition this study was based on batch mode and during the experiments algal growth ceased when the nutrient level stabilized but the system continued to operate for a certain period this largely lowered the values of nutrient removal rate and biomass productivity due to the prolonged time in order to obtain the actual nutrient removal rate and biomass productivity during the major stage of nutrient removal values were re calculated based on the time when the level was stabilized details are documented in the supplementary material 2 5 3 biomass composition and fatty acid methyl ester fame content analysis after each batch study biofilm was harvested and freeze dried for composition analysis samples were grinded and sieved to gain a particle size below 74 μm then the total lipid crude protein and carbohydrate content were determined following the method by zhang et al 2017 the fame of the harvested algal biomass were prepared according to an one step extraction transesterification method by indarti et al 2005 the composition and content of fame were determined by the combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a gc and 5975c ms agilent technologies usa equipped with a fid detector and a db 5 ms capillary column agilent technologies usa the injector and detector temperatures were set at 300 and 280 c respectively measurements were conducted using helium as carrier gas 1 5 ml min 1 and temperature was programed as 100 c 5 min 10 c min 1 to 180 c 2 c min 1 to 210 c 3 min the compounds were identified via the nist mass spectral search program zhu et al 2013 and quantified by comparing the peak area with that of 9 12 15 octadecatrienoic acid methyl ester which was remained as internal standard added before esterification 2 6 statistical analysis all the analytic experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate analysis of variance anova was carried out wherever applicable 3 results 3 1 attached carrier materials test algal biomass production using the selected 12 materials as carriers is shown in fig 3 a and fig s6a coral velvet long as the carrier achieved the highest productivity 7 11 g m 2 day 1 followed pleuche coral velvet short and organza with the productivity of 3 39 3 22 2 95 and 2 86 g m 2 day 1 respectively for the rest materials they proved to be unsuitable as the biofilm carriers in addition it is worth to be noted that the productivity of cotton linen cotton duct and gauze was negative fig 3b illustrates the results of material duration test and mass loss only occurred with cotton linen 3 90 cotton duct 16 41 and gauze 44 57 as carriers possible reason lied in the fact that they had been degraded during the cultivation as they were all composed of cotton which could be utilized as organic carbon by some microorganisms zhang et al 2017 meanwhile the secreted enzymes by algal cells might also lead to the degradation of the three materials during the biofilm cultivation indeed it was the degradation of the three materials that caused the corresponding negative biomass productivity furthermore the formation of bacteria biofilm possibly contributed to the weight increase of the rest materials during the duration test and this would further promote the algal cell attachment remarkably hodoki 2005 and partially contribute to the biofilm biomass in this study the dilution rate at distance of 2 4 6 and 8 cm was 8 8 4 4 3 3 and 2 2 fig 4 respectively the corresponding theoretical received light intensity of algal biofilm was 48 30 96 59 128 79 and 193 18 μmol m 2s 1 fig 4 respectively under the operation distance of 6 cm coral velvet long always gained significantly higher biomass productivity 6 95 8 11 g m 2 day 1 than coral velvet short pleuche and coarse linen during the three batches cultivation fig 3c such result was equivalent to biomass footprint productivity of 22 94 26 75 g m 2 day 1 calculated using eq 8 which is much higher than 3 51 g m 2 day 1 in the study of gross et al 2013 and 5 5 g m 2 day 1 in the study of christenson and sims 2012 fig s1 shows the coral velvet long before and after algal attachment compared to the other materials figs s2 and s3 coral velvet long was abundant with long villus on both sides which could not only provide more surfaces available for cell attachment but act as filters for the capture of algal cells from the flowing medium as well besides those long villus could also strengthen biofilms structure by cross linking the biofilm matrix zhang et al 2017 these reasons might together contribute to the extraordinary performance of coral velvet long moreover esem images fig s4 of coral velvet long after 0 30 60 90 120 days utilization demonstrated that almost no degradation happened to the villus as time increased which indicated the good durability of this material during algal biofilm cultivation thus coral velvet long was selected as the carrier for further wastewater treatment experiment 3 2 algal biofilm growth biofilm pictures with ww a as the medium are shown in fig 5 the cells were attached to the materials and formed stable robust and bottle green biofilm besides almost no suspended algal cells were measured throughout the experiment the growth characteristics of algal biofilm are shown in fig 6 fig 6a and b illustrate the results which were calculated based on the material surface area for system running with ww a under four distances fig 6a algal biofilm experienced a rapid growth in the first two days then it followed by a stationary phase at the 4th day expect distance 8 cm finally similar biomass production was obtained at the distance of 4 25 88 g m 2 6 27 04 g m 2 and 8 cm 24 86 g m 2 where the biomass was significantly larger than that with the distance of 2 cm 12 07 g m 2 in terms of ww b fig 6b biomass production was continuously increased for six days a significantly increase in the first two days followed by the stationary phase after ten days the distance of 2 4 6 and 8 cm obtained four dramatically different productivities reaching 21 03 36 78 40 31 and 54 02 g m 2 respectively almost twice of those yielded in ww a fig 6c and d demonstrate the production results calculated based on land area and the time curves of biomass production were similar to those in fig 6a and b however the difference between the four distances dramatically changed under both wastewaters distance 2 and 4 cm achieved the largest production 106 30 and 113 88 g m 2 respectively when treating ww a followed 6 cm 89 24 g m 2 and 8 cm 54 70 g m 2 for ww b the production of 2 cm 185 08 g m 2 was the largest followed by 4 cm 161 85 g m 2 6 cm 133 04 g m 2 and 8 cm 118 84 g m 2 such results were equivalent to the productivities of 6 84 14 24 g m 2 day 1 for ww a and 11 88 18 51 g m 2 day 1 for ww b which were significantly larger than those reported by shi et al 2014 who achieved 6 30 g m 2 day 1 biomass during wastewater treatment by vertical biofilm algal biomass productivity during the major nutrient removal stage was listed in table s3 from the listed data in table s3 productivities of 8 58 25 57 g m 2 day 1 for ww a and 19 01 27 18 g m 2 day 1 for ww b were obtained which were comparable to those high productive pilot scale algal biofilm systems e g 31 00 g m 2 day 1 in rabr system christenson and sims 2012 and 10 45 g m 2 day 1 in rab system gross et al 2015 3 3 nutrients removal in the synthetic wastewater fig 7 shows the change of cod concentration with time in ww a fig 7a and ww b fig 7b cod was drastically reduced to under 21 33 mg l 1 under the four distances in the first day in ww a afterwards the concentration stayed at the similar level more than 90 of cod could be removed under four distances table 1 in terms of ww b cod concentration decreased rapidly to 362 mg l 1 from 2188 02 mg l 1 in the first four days and then stabilized for distance 2 4 and 6 cm cod experienced a significantly faster removal in the first two days with the average removal rate of nearly 191 72 g m 2 day 1 at distance 8 cm fig 11 the final cod removal efficiencies were 2 cm 86 81 4 cm 91 89 6 cm 97 17 8 cm 98 28 in addition cod removal rate of ww b was remarkably larger than that of ww a due to the corresponding higher concentration 2188 02 mg l 1 in ww b vs 131 42 mg l 1 in ww a for example daily maximum cod removal rate of ww b under four distances was 78 88 249 19 g m 2 day 1 based on land area fig 10 significantly larger than that obtained with ww a 20 78 22 47 g m 2 day 1 fig 8 indicates the variation in nitrogen removal with time in ww a and ww b nh4 n and tn concentrations exhibited a similar trend to those observed from cod in both wastewater with the large proportions of the removal occurring during the first three days when treated with ww a over 90 of nh4 n and 78 of tn were removed at the distance of 2 4 and 8 cm with system running at the distance of 6 cm obtained the best nitrogen removal efficiency 99 39 for nh4 n and 89 06 for tn more than 90 of the nh4 n could be reduced at distance 2 93 95 4 94 47 and 6 cm 97 82 when treated with ww b while system running at distance 8 cm could only remove 83 50 nh4 n compared to ww b tn removal efficiency of ww a was dropped off as listed in table 1 while system running at distance 6 cm performed best 81 69 for tn the tendencies for the no3 n removal in two wastewater were totally different no3 n in ww a was continuously reduced with the average removal rate of nearly 0 23 g m 2 day 1 fig 11 under four distances for ww b concentration of no3 n sharply decreased from 70 mg l 1 to 20 30 mg l 1 under four distances in the first three days and then remained stable when the experiments came to an end distance 6 cm obtained the largest no3 n removal efficiency 82 19 in ww a and 82 23 in ww b in addition similar to the results of cod removal nitrogen removal rate in ww b was significantly larger than that in ww a due to the corresponding different nutrients concentrations fig 10 fig 9 represents the concentration change of phosphorus with time in ww a fig 9a and ww b fig 9b tp in ww a was continuously removed with the average removal rate of nearly 0 13 g m 2 day 1 under four distances for tp in ww b concentration decreased gradually in the first six days and then stayed at similar level with the distance of 2 cm and 6 cm experienced an obvious faster removal removal rate 6 66 and 7 22 g m 2 day 1 respectively in the first days more than 90 table 1 of tp was finally removed in both wastewater with distance 6 cm achieving the largest removal efficiency 96 82 in ww a and 95 38 in ww b these were significantly larger than the results of li et al 2011 who treated autoclave centrate 79 0 and raw centrate 80 9 indicating the outstanding phosphorus removal performance of the vab enhanced raceway the average nutrient removal rate in ww a and ww b during the major stage of nutrient removal was calculated as shown in fig 11 operation distance at 6 cm performed best under both wastewater i e tn tp and cod removal rate of 0 76 0 14 and 22 47 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 2 96 2 86 and 123 19 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively these values were comparable to 3 20 0 41 and 43 g m 2 day 1 for n p and cod removal which obtained by boelee et al 2014 during the treatment there was no evident difference in ph and do among different operation distance in both wastewater fig 12 meanwhile ph and do both experienced a simultaneous increase in both wastewaters from 6 8 to above 9 for ph and from 7 0 to above 9 5 mg l 1 for do fig 12 actually this increase was mainly caused by algal photosynthesis which assimilated inorganic carbon and produced oxygen ge and champagne 2016 3 4 chemical composition of the algal biomass chemical composition of the harvested algal biofilm after wastewater treatment is shown in fig 13 a ww a and 13b ww b lipid content in the biomass in ww a under four distances ranged from 12 52 to 19 86 in the following relationship 2 cm 19 86 6 cm 14 32 8 cm 12 82 4 cm 12 52 in terms of ww b lipid content did not vary remarkably at distance 4 6 and 8 cm 11 61 11 96 with distance 2 cm dramatically larger 14 32 than the rest obviously compared to ww a as the nutrients level increased the lipid contents in ww b decreased but the carbohydrate content increased algal biomass protein content in both wastewater under four distances is higher than the lipid and carbohydrate and the highest values occurred at distance 8 cm 42 61 in ww a and 41 97 in ww b high crude proteins content indicated that the harvested biomass could be a suitable feed for animals and aquaculture salama et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 lipid protein and carbohydrate productivities of the harvested algal biomass in both wastewater are illustrated in fig 13c ww a and 13d ww b as the operation distance increased lipid productivity decreased in both wastewater maximum lipid productivity occurred at distance 2 cm about 2 64 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 2 65 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively system running at distance 4 cm achieved the highest carbohydrate productivities 4 71 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 6 49 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively while the highest protein productivity occurred at 4 cm 5 36 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 2 cm 7 62 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively 3 5 fame composition and biodiesel productivity in this study the fame composition of the harvested biomass mainly consisted of c16 0 hexadecanoic acid methyl ester c16 1 9 hexadecenoic acid methyl ester and c18 2 9 12 octadecadienoic acid methyl ester as listed in table 2 when the nutrient loading rate increased the contents of c16 0 decreased but the c16 1 increased under four operation distances operation distance 2 cm generated the highest fame yield with 1 86 of dry weight during the treatment of ww a apart from that fame yields with 1 73 1 84 and 1 79 were respectively achieved at distance 4 6 and 8 cm in ww a while fame yields with 0 96 1 12 1 09 and 1 41 were respectively achieved at distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm in ww b compared to ww a fame yield significantly dropped off as the nutrient loading rate increased in ww b and this difference further resulted in the difference of biodiesel productivity among the two wastewater about 247 15 246 27 205 24 and 122 39 mg m 2 day 1 fame was accordingly produced at distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm during the treatment of ww a and only 177 68 181 27 145 01 and 167 56 mg m 2 day 1 fame was accordingly produced at distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm during the treatment of ww b small distance like 2 and 4 cm both showed higher biodiesel potentials than the larger one 4 discussion 4 1 algal biofilm growth in this study the organic carbon was mainly composed of glucose and algal cells like chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus could grow faster and yield more biomass in mixotrophic conditions by utilizing both glucose and inorganic carbon as carbon sources ge and champagne 2016 li et al 2011 yun et al 2015 this possibly contributed to the fast growth of the algal biofilm in the early period however biomass production in ww b was significantly larger than that in ww a this might owe to the significantly higher nutrients level in ww b which promoted the biofilm growth and especially the high cod level existed might promote the algal heterotrophic growth besides the switch of algal cells from mixotrophic to autotrophic growth could also be observed at the moment when cod level was stabilized both ph and do experienced a rapid increase on the 4th day in ww a and 6th day in ww b fig 12 which was mainly due to the enhanced photosynthesis induced by the transformation of algal cells growth conditions from mixotrophic to autotrophic state as photosynthesis was promoted the uptake rate of inorganic carbon was increased and more oxygen was released resulting in the rapid increase of ph and do liu et al 2016 during later stage the nutrients levels n p and cod were all significantly decreased in both wastewaters e g tn decreased from 31 53 to 32 11 to below 10 mg l in ww a and from 99 81 to 100 78 to below 30 mg l in ww b this might lead to the lack of nutrients in ww a and the decline of mass transfer rate of nutrient n p and cod into the cells in ww b which might further cause the biofilm growth cessation in the system as shown in fig 5 biofilm gradually turned from green to yellow at distance 8 cm in ww a which indicated the lack of nitrogen as chlorophyll in algal cells was degraded to provide nitrogen for the growth jiang et al 2011 4 2 nutrients removal in the synthetic wastewater sharply degrading of cod is in consistent with the fast growth of algal biofilm in both wastewater figs 6 and 7 mainly owing to the introduced bacteria and the mixotrophic growth of algal cells apart from the cod removal nitrogen and phosphorus were also effectively removed in both wastewater through the vab enhanced raceway maximum daily tn and tp daily uptake rates fig 10 in both wastewater were significantly larger than the rates of 1 0 g m 2 day 1 for nitrogen and 0 13 g m 2 day 1 for phosphorus which obtained by boelee et al 2011 in this study bacteria was introduced to facilitate algal cells immigration onto carrier materials it also has positive effect on the algal growth and nutrients removal bacteria growth could provide co2 as well as decrease o2 inhibition for algal growth bai et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 and enhance algal metabolism by releasing growth promoting factors zhu et al 2013 as algal growth was promoted the rapid removals of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater were achieved nitrogen and phosphorus were the important elements for the algal growth and metabolism zhang et al 2018 when cod was sharply decreased the concentrations of tn and tp were also rapidly dropped off after stabilization of the cod concentration the removal of tn and tp as well as the growth rate of biofilm slowed down such phenomenon signified that cod removal promoted the removal of tn and tp in both wastewater this was mainly attributed to that cod in wastewater promoted the growth and metabolism of algal cells which further enhanced the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus algal cells commonly preferred nh4 n to no3 n for growth because less energy is needed during ammonium assimilation ge and champagne 2016 and this possibly contributed to the sharp decrease of nh4 n in both wastewater meanwhile such property of algae might also lead to the totally different tendency of no3 n removal in two types of wastewater compared to no3 n nh4 n was insufficient in ww b e g nh4 n no3 n was 1 39 in ww a and 0 49 in ww b this possibly caused the sharp decrease of both nh4 n and no3 n in ww b as nh4 n was insufficient for the rapid growth of biofilm in addition the denitrification might occur in the system and be restricted in ww a as cod was limited but proceeded in ww b as cod was sufficient which might also lead to the slow rapid no3 n removal in the two types of wastewater by the end of the experiment the theory amount of phosphorus assimilated by a gram of biofilm biomass was accordingly 0 063 0 072 0 091 and 0 095 g g for the distance of 2 4 6 and 8 cm in the treatment of ww b fig s7 however algal biomass traditionally contains only 0 5 3 3 phosphorus li et al 2011 such phenomenon signified the occurrence of phosphorus precipitation during the treatment which was induced by the high ph 8 5 liu et al 2016 indeed algal metabolic assimilation and phosphorus precipitation together contributed to the phosphorus removal in the vab enhanced raceway 4 3 effect of operation distance in this study system operation distance had significant effects on the biofilm production and nutrients removal efficiency distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm had about 1 408 0 704 0 528 and 0 352 m2 material surface for cell attachment on a land footprint area of 0 16 m2 in the vab enhanced raceway more surface was provided for cells attachment at small operation distance which largely magnified the corresponding footprint productivity however this larger biofilm surface area would result in lower received light intensity fig 4 of vertical biofilm and small nutrients loading on unit material surface leading to small biomass production based on material surface as illustrated in fig 5 when the operation distance was 2 cm light could hardly penetrate the gap between the components and reach on the biofilm surface as distance increased from 2 to 4 and 6 cm the light intensity received by the vertical biofilm was increased leading to an increase of photosynthesis rate and a higher biomass yield but in fact as distance further increased the light intensity received by the biofilm surface would not further increase and light energy was wasted because it directly penetrated on the bottom of the pond with distance at 8 cm fig 5 dark green biofilm occurred at the bottom of the pond and it did not consist of the biomass production during the harvest this might also contribute to the lowest footprint biomass production of distance at 8 cm additionally the nutrient loading rate on unit material surface area was increased as the distance increased leading to the enhanced nutrient uptake and photosynthesis efficiency and further nutrient removal table 1 boelee et al 2011 as shown in fig s7 the amount of nutrients removed by a gram of biomass was increased as the increase of operation distance but as further increase of the distance the provided biofilm culture surface area decreased and the received light intensity of algal biofilm changed marginally so the total amount of the nutrients removed would be limited due to the significantly lower biomass footprint production fig 6 leading to the decreased nutrients removal efficiency vertical biofilm could enlarge the total biomass culture area on unit land area to a great extent and thus the biofilm cultivation efficiency and the pollutant loading rate g m 2 day 1 were improved while the limitation of large land requirement for scale up could be cracked in addition the change of culture condition and wastewater type could be well handled through adjusting the distance between the components indeed the wastewater treatment efficiency of traditional raceway pond would be significantly improved after the enhancement by vertical biofilm in this study 6 cm was the optimal operation distance under the pond depth of 11 cm for efficient nutrients removal and biodiesel production however the optimal operation distance would be different due to the change of the pond depth culture condition and wastewater type in large scale and need to be further detected for a specific condition 4 4 lipid and biodiesel production ge and champagne 2016 found that algal lipid content decreased as the increase of nutrients levels during the diluted centrate wastewater treatment using suspended chlorella vulgaris increase of nutrients loading in the diluted piggery wastewater also induced the decline of algal lipid content in the study of zhu et al 2013 similarly in this study ww b with higher nutrients level obtained lower lipid content compared to ww a lower strength of the wastewater generally led to lower nutrients level in the later period due to the assimilate effect of algal cells nitrogen or phosphorus starvation could commonly trigger the lipid accumulation ge and champagne 2016 lower nutrients level 17 33 mg l 1 cod 10 mg l 1 tn and 0 43 mg l 1 tp at day 4 in ww a in later period might have triggered the lipid accumulation due to nutrient starvation and resulted in the above higher lipid content compared to ww b after wastewater treatment the lipid content in algal biomass of this study was similar to 11 2 christenson and sims 2012 and 9 johnson and wen 2010 both of which were obtained using algal biofilm but significantly lower than 33 91 45 81 zhu et al 2013 and 30 8 35 yun et al 2015 both of which were obtained through suspended algal algal species difference might contribute to this difference since different algal species commonly generated significantly different lipid contents besides since higher light intensity generally promoted lipid accumulation ooms et al 2016 the shadowing effect caused by the cells on or near the surface of the biofilm would lead cells at or near the bottom in the dim light or dark conditions and this would cause lower lipid content valenzuela and mazurie 2012 zhang et al 2017 thus the commonly lower lipid content in the algal biofilm compared to the suspended culture more importantly the composition of bacteria in the biofilm might also lead to this lower lipid content zhang et al 2017 2018 however do continuously increased during the treatments which might be due to that the consumption of oxygen was significantly lower than the production of it this well indicated that bacteria content was significantly low in the biofilm and algal phototrophic activity is dominant over 80 88 of fame was composed of c16 c18 short carbon chains indicating the suitability of harvested algal biomass for biodiesel production yun et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 besides fame was mainly composed of saturated fatty acids methyl ester 45 65 with c16 0 percentage in the range of 44 22 49 06 in ww a and 34 34 44 95 in ww b followed by polyenoic fatty acids methyl ester 19 05 26 76 which mainly contained c18 2 16 30 19 84 in ww a and 15 95 24 94 in ww b obviously as the nutrient loading rate increased the fame became unsaturated which will lead to the lower pour point of the produced biodiesel and improve the feasibility of using it in cold areas miranda et al 2017 however an increase in the unsaturation level of fatty acids might also lead to the oxidative deterioration of the produced biodiesel zhou et al 2017 4 5 potentials for scale up of vab enhanced raceway in this study extraordinary nutrients removal efficiencies were achieved by the vab enhanced raceway during the treatment of two types of synthetic wastewater indicating the feasibility of this new technology for the treatment of wide ranges of wastewaters based on the calculated data about the average nutrient removal rate fig 11 and biomass productivity table s3 during the major stage of nutrient removal continuous operation of the magnified system in practice at operation distance 6 cm could remove about 1 08 104 kg ha 1 tn 1 04 104 kg ha 1 tp and 4 50 105 kg ha 1 cod from wastewater in one year corresponding to an algal biomass production of 7 73 104 kg ha 1 in addition the yielded biomass could well compensate for expenses related to the operation of the system based on the measured fame content 1 09 at distance 6 cm with ww b the system could yield 8 43 102 kg ha 1 of biodiesel in one year meanwhile about 2 66 104 kg ha 1 of protein and 3 33 104 kg ha 1 of carbohydrate could also be generated during the treatment which could be possibly utilized as animal feed and for fermentation to produce bioethanol or hydrogen miranda et al 2017 besides the pond depth could be larger in practice due to no suspended algal cells that enhanced the light penetration in the pond thus the theory values calculated above could be larger owing to the enlarged biofilm surface area on unit land area meanwhile the biomass at full scale could also be harvested by the designed harvester fig 2 automatically fig s8 illustrated a proposed scale up scheme for the vab enhanced raceway consequently using this new technology for amplified wastewater treatment in practice is a win win strategy which can not only effectively remove pollutants from wastewater but also productively generate algal biomass for protein carbohydrate and biodiesel production 5 conclusion coral velvet with 5 8 mm long villus was supposed to be the optimal biofilm carrier in the vab enhanced raceway about 86 61 98 28 of cod 73 68 89 06 of tn and 89 85 96 82 of tp were removed in two synthetic wastewaters and nutrient removal efficiency was first increased and then decreased as operation distance increased higher nutrient concentration led to lower treatment efficiency and lower biodiesel productivity but higher biomass productivity algal biomass footprint production was decreased as the increase of distance and distance at 2 cm obtained the highest productivity 18 51 g m 2 day 1 with ww b as well as the highest biodiesel productivity 247 15 mg m 2 day 1 with ww a operation distance at 6 cm was the optimal when the wastewater treatment and algal biomass production were comprehensively balanced this study introduced and proved a newer simplified and cost effective way for wastewater treatment coupled with algal based biofuel production and the findings will be critical in the scale up of this technology acknowledgements this

19565,a win win strategy by the integration of wastewater treatment with value added products production through a vertical algal biofilm enhanced raceway was investigated in the present study raceway pond was enhanced by vertically setting the biofilm in the system with a certain interval distance that could be adjusted for different light conditions and wastewater types two types of synthetic wastewater were treated with suitability proven materials as biofilm carriers under four operation distances composition of the harvested algal biomass was analyzed coral velvet with 5 8 mm length villus was the optimal carrier since it was durable and with high biomass productivity 6 95 8 11 g m 2 day 1 nutrients in the wastewaters were efficiently removed with the cod tn and tp reduction of over 86 61 73 68 and 89 85 respectively wastewater with the low nutrients concentration experienced lower biomass and lipid productivity but larger biodiesel productivity and higher nutrient removal efficiency in addition as the operation distance increased wastewater treatment efficiency was first increased but then decreased while algal biomass footprint production was decreased differences in nutrients removal efficiencies were mainly due to the distance difference which caused different biofilm culture surface areas and light regimes the optimal operation distance as a function of the efficient nutrient removal and biodiesel production in this study was 6 cm graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal biomass biofilm carrier biodiesel mechanical harvester wastewater 1 introduction owing to the global industrialization and living standard enhancement of mankind wastewater generation is sharply increased in recent years zeng et al 2015 discarding of wastewater into environment without any treatment or inefficient pollutant removal is harmful to the water body soil and even the atmosphere zeng et al 2015 wastewater treatment could be conducted by chemical physical and biological methods treating wastewater via aerobic process is energy exhaustive and inefficient in nitrogen and phosphorus removal and it also generates huge amount of sludge which needs large input for the management salama et al 2017 besides nutrient removal via nitrification denitrification membrane separation and chemical precipitation is also energy and or resource intensive especially for the treatment of industrial wastewaters hu et al 2017 however wastewater is an excellent medium for algal growth by providing nitrogen phosphorus and carbon source mu et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 and many algal species could grow in industrial wastewater which has poisonous and harmful substances like heavy metals raslavicius et al 2018 wastewater treatment via microalgae cultivation is a win win strategy for not only producing algal biomass for the algal based clean energy production miranda et al 2017 ooms et al 2016 but also saving plenty of money related to the removal of nitrogen phosphorus etc rawat et al 2013 algae are efficient in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater sharp et al 2017 su et al 2011 traditional algal based wastewater treatment system involves raceway pond multi layer open pond like bioreactors and different types of closed bioreactors de vree et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 among these systems raceway pond is believed to be the most feasible and cost effective facility to treat large amounts of wastewater due to its lower capital cost easier to scale up and higher treatment volume compared to other techniques zhou et al 2013 however traditional raceway ponds with suspended algal culture have various limitations 1 limited light penetration due to the self shadowing effect wang et al 2015 2 inefficient photosynthesis 3 energy consuming and expensive for harvesting the suspended algal biomass christenson and sims 2012 and 4 deteriorated effluent quality induced by inefficient harvest of the biomass zhou et al 2014 these drawbacks greatly limit its upscaling algal biofilm systems have the advantages that cells can be grown as biofilm so no separation of algal biomass from wastewater is needed before discharging the effluent and biomass can be just harvested by scrapping which largely reduces the downstream processing costs meanwhile higher light penetration efficiency exists during the attached cultivation wang et al 2015 algal biofilm based wastewater treatment systems have been widely reported and some examples are rotating disks christenson and sims 2012 algal turf scrubber mulbry and wilkie 2001 rotating algal biofilm reactor christenson and sims 2012 and horizontal biofilm reactor boelee et al 2011 however these systems are either inefficient in algal biomass production and wastewater treatment due to the limited biofilm culture surface on unit land footprint or poor in cell attachment due to the moving and folding of the carrier materials besides biofilm is more susceptible to the changed light condition because light directly penetrates on its surface and cannot be diluted in these systems therefore a new kind of vertical algal biofilm enhanced raceway pond vab enhanced raceway has been developed for efficient wastewater treatment and algal biomass production algal cells are attached to the carrier materials which are vertically set inside the raceway pond and biomass is just harvested through scrapping with no need of the separation of algal biomass from the effluent in addition such vertical strategy can also largely increase the biofilm growth area on the unit land footprint area meanwhile incident light can be well diluted to adapt to different light conditions by adjusting the distance between the vertical biofilms and thus photo limitation and photo inhibition are under control hence the objectives of this study were to 1 prove the concept of the vab system and determine the optimal materials for algal attachment 2 detect the optimal operation conditions 3 estimate the productivities of algal biomass lipid and biodiesel and 4 specify the scale up possibility of the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal strains and subculture the microalgae scenedesmus obliquus fachb 416 chlorella vulgaris fachb 32 and oscillatoria tenuis fachb 1052 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences pr china were involved in this study prior to each batch of study all species were grown in 150 ml autoclaved bg 11 medium under a light intensity of 200 μmol m 2s 1 with a light dark cycle of 14 10 h on an orbital shaker 60 rpm at 25 2 c the cultures were then used for inoculation into the vab enhanced raceway when the optical density od685 reached about 1 0 1 5 after cultivation for four to six days 2 2 laboratory scale vab enhanced raceway pond in this study vab enhanced raceway pond was constructed with a raceway pond a rotator and a couple of vertical algal biofilm components fig 1 a two identical vab enhanced raceways were designed the rotator was constructed with a motor 220 v 60 w 51k90 120a a xin li china and four paddle impellers fig 1a the raceway pond was built with 70 cm length 40 cm width and 15 cm height fig 1b algal biofilm growth area was set in the middle of the raceway pond with an area of 2 20 40 cm2 and illuminated with led lights under light intensity of 425 μmol m 2s 1 in a light dark cycle of 14 10 h growth area was further divided into eight parts for simplified sampling procedure by ten biofilm support brackets fig 1c which were fixed at the bottom of the pond each part own an area of 20 10 cm2 fig 1b materials used for algal attachment were first divided into 10 11 cm2 and then were fixed onto two straight stainless steel wires with the length of 12 cm diameter of 2 mm to form a biofilm component fig 1c then the components were vertically positioned in the supporting brackets parallel to each other after each batch culture the materials were cleanly washed with deionized water for the next batch cultivation each component was considered as a sample and the distance between each component can be adjusted to dilute the incident light to obtain suitable light intensity for algal growth during this study distances of 2 4 6 and 8 cm between each component corresponding to the total amount of components about 64 32 24 and 16 pieces were studied this was based on the consideration that different operation distances would result in different light regimes total biofilm culture areas and nutrient loading rates thus affecting the nutrient removal efficiency and algal biomass production during each batch culture 30 l bg 11 medium was added into each tank with an operation depth of 11 cm meanwhile three types of algal cultures with each 100 ml were added to seed the vertical components since bacteria can encourage algal immigration onto substrata flemming and wingender 2010 hodoki 2005 100 ml filtrated by filter paper unsterile wastewater from the primary sedimentation tank of long wang zui wastewater treatment plant in wuhan china was also added into the system to promote algal biofilm formation the corresponding dry bacteria biomass content was determined as 0 011 0 009 g according to the method listed in the supplementary material then the experiment was started after seeding for 24 h during the whole experiment the initial ph of the medium wastewater was adjusted to 6 8 0 2 and the rotating speed of the rotator was set at 20 rpm min 1 with an average medium flow velocity of 11 cm s 1 the temperature was controlled at about 28 2 c by air conditioner and the water evaporation lose was balanced daily with deionized water besides the tank was also aerated with 0 05 co2 with a flow rate of 6 l min 1 2 3 mechanical harvester for potential scale up a mechanical harvester for the harvest of algal biofilm from the vab enhanced raceway on full scale was designed as shown in fig 2 two plastic augers are driven by a motor and continuously scrap the biomass off the vertical algal biofilm on both sides and the biomass is collected into the hoppers meanwhile the harvest component assembly is slowly displaced along the length of the raceway pond through the orbit during harvesting and thus can achieve continuous harvest 2 4 algal biofilm cultivation and wastewater treatment 2 4 1 attached algal growth test twelve types of materials were tested to evaluate the ability of supporting the attached algal growth including coral velvet long 1 coral velvet short 2 pleuche 3 cotton linen 4 coarse linen 5 fine linen 6 cotton duct 7 polyester cotton duct 8 gauze 9 non woven fabric 10 organza 11 pearl ice silk 12 each with four replicates details of the materials are listed in the supplementary material table s1 figs s1 s2 s3 and s4 biofilm cultivation was processed using bg 11 medium with the operation distance of 6 cm the preliminary screening of the twelve materials was processed for ten days then the further screening of the suitable materials was processed for eight days with three batches and fresh materials were used each time nutrition supplement was conducted by daily replacing the medium at a 20 exchange ratio besides preliminary study found that some materials had a weight loss during the cultivation process so the system was also run for 10 day at the same conditions mentioned above without inoculating algal cultures to test the duration of the materials 2 4 2 synthetic wastewater treatment the selected suitable material was further used as biofilm carrier for synthetic wastewater treatment after inoculating for 24 h bg 11 medium was discarded and 30 l synthetic wastewater was added in the tank for the treatment two kinds of synthetic wastewater wastewater a ww a and wastewater b ww b were used the composition are listed in table s2 ww a was prepared based on the primary settled sewage composition from long wang zui wastewater treatment plant ww b was prepared based on the piggery wastewater composition from a hog farm in suizhou city hubei province china after treatment the used carriers were cleanly washed and autoclaved 121 c 30 min for the next batch cultivation 2 5 analytical method 2 5 1 light dilution the light dilution rate at different operation distances was defined following the description in the study of liu et al 2013 1 r l s m s a where s m and s a are the material surface area both sides and biofilm culture area 2 20 40 cm2 inside the raceway pond respectively the corresponding theoretical received light intensity of algal biofilm was obtained using eq 2 2 l l 0 r l where l 0 is the provided light intensity equal to 425 μmol m 2s 1 2 5 2 biofilm production and nutrients analysis during the attached algal growth test some carriers like cotton duct and gauze were decomposed and it is difficult to harvest the algal biomass through scrapping indeed carriers with biofilm attached on it were together harvested and oven dried at 103 c for 24 h biomass production and productivity were obtained using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 biomass production w w 0 022 4 biomass production w w 0 022 t where w is the dry weight of raw material w is the total dry weight of material and biofilm after cultivation 0 022 is the plan view surface area of a single biofilm component on both sides t is the culture period during wastewater treatment biofilm was sampled through scrapping by a plastic ruler every two days and at least four biofilm components were harvested randomly after the harvest the components were fixed back into the system samples were oven dried at 103 c for 24 h and the biomass production and productivity were calculated as follows 5 biomass production based on material surface area w b 0 022 6 biomass productivity based on material surface area w b 0 022 t 7 biomass production based on land footprint area w b r l 0 022 8 biomass productivity based on land footprint area w b r l 0 022 t where w b is the dry weight of the harvested biofilm during the duration test materials were oven dried at 75 c and weighted before and after experiment the mass lose percentage of the material was obtained according to the following formula 9 material mass lose percentage w w 1 w 100 where w 1 is the material dry weight after duration test meanwhile 20 ml wastewater was also sampled every day from each tank for the nutrients analysis samples were first filtered through a 0 45 μm filter millipore corporation usa and then the concentrations of n no3 n nh4 tn total nitrogen tp total phosphorus and cod chemical oxygen demand were measured according to astm standards astm d6508 for n no3 analysis astm d6919 for n nh4 analysis astm d8001 for tn and tp analysis astm d1252 for cod analysis the ph and dissolved oxygen do concentration in the system were daily measured with a ph electrode fe20 mettler toledo usa and a dissolved oxygen analyzer f4 mettler toledo usa respectively percentage removal and daily maximum removal rate of nutrients were calculated using eq 10 and eq 11 10 percentage removal c 0 c min c 0 100 11 daily maximum removal rate max c i c i 1 30 0 16 i 1 t where c 0 and c i are the nutrient concentrations at day 0 and day i respectively c min is the minimum nutrient concentrations during the process 30 l and 0 16 m2 are the wastewater volume and biofilm culture footprint area in the system respectively in addition this study was based on batch mode and during the experiments algal growth ceased when the nutrient level stabilized but the system continued to operate for a certain period this largely lowered the values of nutrient removal rate and biomass productivity due to the prolonged time in order to obtain the actual nutrient removal rate and biomass productivity during the major stage of nutrient removal values were re calculated based on the time when the level was stabilized details are documented in the supplementary material 2 5 3 biomass composition and fatty acid methyl ester fame content analysis after each batch study biofilm was harvested and freeze dried for composition analysis samples were grinded and sieved to gain a particle size below 74 μm then the total lipid crude protein and carbohydrate content were determined following the method by zhang et al 2017 the fame of the harvested algal biomass were prepared according to an one step extraction transesterification method by indarti et al 2005 the composition and content of fame were determined by the combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a gc and 5975c ms agilent technologies usa equipped with a fid detector and a db 5 ms capillary column agilent technologies usa the injector and detector temperatures were set at 300 and 280 c respectively measurements were conducted using helium as carrier gas 1 5 ml min 1 and temperature was programed as 100 c 5 min 10 c min 1 to 180 c 2 c min 1 to 210 c 3 min the compounds were identified via the nist mass spectral search program zhu et al 2013 and quantified by comparing the peak area with that of 9 12 15 octadecatrienoic acid methyl ester which was remained as internal standard added before esterification 2 6 statistical analysis all the analytic experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate analysis of variance anova was carried out wherever applicable 3 results 3 1 attached carrier materials test algal biomass production using the selected 12 materials as carriers is shown in fig 3 a and fig s6a coral velvet long as the carrier achieved the highest productivity 7 11 g m 2 day 1 followed pleuche coral velvet short and organza with the productivity of 3 39 3 22 2 95 and 2 86 g m 2 day 1 respectively for the rest materials they proved to be unsuitable as the biofilm carriers in addition it is worth to be noted that the productivity of cotton linen cotton duct and gauze was negative fig 3b illustrates the results of material duration test and mass loss only occurred with cotton linen 3 90 cotton duct 16 41 and gauze 44 57 as carriers possible reason lied in the fact that they had been degraded during the cultivation as they were all composed of cotton which could be utilized as organic carbon by some microorganisms zhang et al 2017 meanwhile the secreted enzymes by algal cells might also lead to the degradation of the three materials during the biofilm cultivation indeed it was the degradation of the three materials that caused the corresponding negative biomass productivity furthermore the formation of bacteria biofilm possibly contributed to the weight increase of the rest materials during the duration test and this would further promote the algal cell attachment remarkably hodoki 2005 and partially contribute to the biofilm biomass in this study the dilution rate at distance of 2 4 6 and 8 cm was 8 8 4 4 3 3 and 2 2 fig 4 respectively the corresponding theoretical received light intensity of algal biofilm was 48 30 96 59 128 79 and 193 18 μmol m 2s 1 fig 4 respectively under the operation distance of 6 cm coral velvet long always gained significantly higher biomass productivity 6 95 8 11 g m 2 day 1 than coral velvet short pleuche and coarse linen during the three batches cultivation fig 3c such result was equivalent to biomass footprint productivity of 22 94 26 75 g m 2 day 1 calculated using eq 8 which is much higher than 3 51 g m 2 day 1 in the study of gross et al 2013 and 5 5 g m 2 day 1 in the study of christenson and sims 2012 fig s1 shows the coral velvet long before and after algal attachment compared to the other materials figs s2 and s3 coral velvet long was abundant with long villus on both sides which could not only provide more surfaces available for cell attachment but act as filters for the capture of algal cells from the flowing medium as well besides those long villus could also strengthen biofilms structure by cross linking the biofilm matrix zhang et al 2017 these reasons might together contribute to the extraordinary performance of coral velvet long moreover esem images fig s4 of coral velvet long after 0 30 60 90 120 days utilization demonstrated that almost no degradation happened to the villus as time increased which indicated the good durability of this material during algal biofilm cultivation thus coral velvet long was selected as the carrier for further wastewater treatment experiment 3 2 algal biofilm growth biofilm pictures with ww a as the medium are shown in fig 5 the cells were attached to the materials and formed stable robust and bottle green biofilm besides almost no suspended algal cells were measured throughout the experiment the growth characteristics of algal biofilm are shown in fig 6 fig 6a and b illustrate the results which were calculated based on the material surface area for system running with ww a under four distances fig 6a algal biofilm experienced a rapid growth in the first two days then it followed by a stationary phase at the 4th day expect distance 8 cm finally similar biomass production was obtained at the distance of 4 25 88 g m 2 6 27 04 g m 2 and 8 cm 24 86 g m 2 where the biomass was significantly larger than that with the distance of 2 cm 12 07 g m 2 in terms of ww b fig 6b biomass production was continuously increased for six days a significantly increase in the first two days followed by the stationary phase after ten days the distance of 2 4 6 and 8 cm obtained four dramatically different productivities reaching 21 03 36 78 40 31 and 54 02 g m 2 respectively almost twice of those yielded in ww a fig 6c and d demonstrate the production results calculated based on land area and the time curves of biomass production were similar to those in fig 6a and b however the difference between the four distances dramatically changed under both wastewaters distance 2 and 4 cm achieved the largest production 106 30 and 113 88 g m 2 respectively when treating ww a followed 6 cm 89 24 g m 2 and 8 cm 54 70 g m 2 for ww b the production of 2 cm 185 08 g m 2 was the largest followed by 4 cm 161 85 g m 2 6 cm 133 04 g m 2 and 8 cm 118 84 g m 2 such results were equivalent to the productivities of 6 84 14 24 g m 2 day 1 for ww a and 11 88 18 51 g m 2 day 1 for ww b which were significantly larger than those reported by shi et al 2014 who achieved 6 30 g m 2 day 1 biomass during wastewater treatment by vertical biofilm algal biomass productivity during the major nutrient removal stage was listed in table s3 from the listed data in table s3 productivities of 8 58 25 57 g m 2 day 1 for ww a and 19 01 27 18 g m 2 day 1 for ww b were obtained which were comparable to those high productive pilot scale algal biofilm systems e g 31 00 g m 2 day 1 in rabr system christenson and sims 2012 and 10 45 g m 2 day 1 in rab system gross et al 2015 3 3 nutrients removal in the synthetic wastewater fig 7 shows the change of cod concentration with time in ww a fig 7a and ww b fig 7b cod was drastically reduced to under 21 33 mg l 1 under the four distances in the first day in ww a afterwards the concentration stayed at the similar level more than 90 of cod could be removed under four distances table 1 in terms of ww b cod concentration decreased rapidly to 362 mg l 1 from 2188 02 mg l 1 in the first four days and then stabilized for distance 2 4 and 6 cm cod experienced a significantly faster removal in the first two days with the average removal rate of nearly 191 72 g m 2 day 1 at distance 8 cm fig 11 the final cod removal efficiencies were 2 cm 86 81 4 cm 91 89 6 cm 97 17 8 cm 98 28 in addition cod removal rate of ww b was remarkably larger than that of ww a due to the corresponding higher concentration 2188 02 mg l 1 in ww b vs 131 42 mg l 1 in ww a for example daily maximum cod removal rate of ww b under four distances was 78 88 249 19 g m 2 day 1 based on land area fig 10 significantly larger than that obtained with ww a 20 78 22 47 g m 2 day 1 fig 8 indicates the variation in nitrogen removal with time in ww a and ww b nh4 n and tn concentrations exhibited a similar trend to those observed from cod in both wastewater with the large proportions of the removal occurring during the first three days when treated with ww a over 90 of nh4 n and 78 of tn were removed at the distance of 2 4 and 8 cm with system running at the distance of 6 cm obtained the best nitrogen removal efficiency 99 39 for nh4 n and 89 06 for tn more than 90 of the nh4 n could be reduced at distance 2 93 95 4 94 47 and 6 cm 97 82 when treated with ww b while system running at distance 8 cm could only remove 83 50 nh4 n compared to ww b tn removal efficiency of ww a was dropped off as listed in table 1 while system running at distance 6 cm performed best 81 69 for tn the tendencies for the no3 n removal in two wastewater were totally different no3 n in ww a was continuously reduced with the average removal rate of nearly 0 23 g m 2 day 1 fig 11 under four distances for ww b concentration of no3 n sharply decreased from 70 mg l 1 to 20 30 mg l 1 under four distances in the first three days and then remained stable when the experiments came to an end distance 6 cm obtained the largest no3 n removal efficiency 82 19 in ww a and 82 23 in ww b in addition similar to the results of cod removal nitrogen removal rate in ww b was significantly larger than that in ww a due to the corresponding different nutrients concentrations fig 10 fig 9 represents the concentration change of phosphorus with time in ww a fig 9a and ww b fig 9b tp in ww a was continuously removed with the average removal rate of nearly 0 13 g m 2 day 1 under four distances for tp in ww b concentration decreased gradually in the first six days and then stayed at similar level with the distance of 2 cm and 6 cm experienced an obvious faster removal removal rate 6 66 and 7 22 g m 2 day 1 respectively in the first days more than 90 table 1 of tp was finally removed in both wastewater with distance 6 cm achieving the largest removal efficiency 96 82 in ww a and 95 38 in ww b these were significantly larger than the results of li et al 2011 who treated autoclave centrate 79 0 and raw centrate 80 9 indicating the outstanding phosphorus removal performance of the vab enhanced raceway the average nutrient removal rate in ww a and ww b during the major stage of nutrient removal was calculated as shown in fig 11 operation distance at 6 cm performed best under both wastewater i e tn tp and cod removal rate of 0 76 0 14 and 22 47 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 2 96 2 86 and 123 19 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively these values were comparable to 3 20 0 41 and 43 g m 2 day 1 for n p and cod removal which obtained by boelee et al 2014 during the treatment there was no evident difference in ph and do among different operation distance in both wastewater fig 12 meanwhile ph and do both experienced a simultaneous increase in both wastewaters from 6 8 to above 9 for ph and from 7 0 to above 9 5 mg l 1 for do fig 12 actually this increase was mainly caused by algal photosynthesis which assimilated inorganic carbon and produced oxygen ge and champagne 2016 3 4 chemical composition of the algal biomass chemical composition of the harvested algal biofilm after wastewater treatment is shown in fig 13 a ww a and 13b ww b lipid content in the biomass in ww a under four distances ranged from 12 52 to 19 86 in the following relationship 2 cm 19 86 6 cm 14 32 8 cm 12 82 4 cm 12 52 in terms of ww b lipid content did not vary remarkably at distance 4 6 and 8 cm 11 61 11 96 with distance 2 cm dramatically larger 14 32 than the rest obviously compared to ww a as the nutrients level increased the lipid contents in ww b decreased but the carbohydrate content increased algal biomass protein content in both wastewater under four distances is higher than the lipid and carbohydrate and the highest values occurred at distance 8 cm 42 61 in ww a and 41 97 in ww b high crude proteins content indicated that the harvested biomass could be a suitable feed for animals and aquaculture salama et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 lipid protein and carbohydrate productivities of the harvested algal biomass in both wastewater are illustrated in fig 13c ww a and 13d ww b as the operation distance increased lipid productivity decreased in both wastewater maximum lipid productivity occurred at distance 2 cm about 2 64 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 2 65 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively system running at distance 4 cm achieved the highest carbohydrate productivities 4 71 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 6 49 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively while the highest protein productivity occurred at 4 cm 5 36 g m 2 day 1 in ww a and 2 cm 7 62 g m 2 day 1 in ww b respectively 3 5 fame composition and biodiesel productivity in this study the fame composition of the harvested biomass mainly consisted of c16 0 hexadecanoic acid methyl ester c16 1 9 hexadecenoic acid methyl ester and c18 2 9 12 octadecadienoic acid methyl ester as listed in table 2 when the nutrient loading rate increased the contents of c16 0 decreased but the c16 1 increased under four operation distances operation distance 2 cm generated the highest fame yield with 1 86 of dry weight during the treatment of ww a apart from that fame yields with 1 73 1 84 and 1 79 were respectively achieved at distance 4 6 and 8 cm in ww a while fame yields with 0 96 1 12 1 09 and 1 41 were respectively achieved at distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm in ww b compared to ww a fame yield significantly dropped off as the nutrient loading rate increased in ww b and this difference further resulted in the difference of biodiesel productivity among the two wastewater about 247 15 246 27 205 24 and 122 39 mg m 2 day 1 fame was accordingly produced at distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm during the treatment of ww a and only 177 68 181 27 145 01 and 167 56 mg m 2 day 1 fame was accordingly produced at distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm during the treatment of ww b small distance like 2 and 4 cm both showed higher biodiesel potentials than the larger one 4 discussion 4 1 algal biofilm growth in this study the organic carbon was mainly composed of glucose and algal cells like chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus could grow faster and yield more biomass in mixotrophic conditions by utilizing both glucose and inorganic carbon as carbon sources ge and champagne 2016 li et al 2011 yun et al 2015 this possibly contributed to the fast growth of the algal biofilm in the early period however biomass production in ww b was significantly larger than that in ww a this might owe to the significantly higher nutrients level in ww b which promoted the biofilm growth and especially the high cod level existed might promote the algal heterotrophic growth besides the switch of algal cells from mixotrophic to autotrophic growth could also be observed at the moment when cod level was stabilized both ph and do experienced a rapid increase on the 4th day in ww a and 6th day in ww b fig 12 which was mainly due to the enhanced photosynthesis induced by the transformation of algal cells growth conditions from mixotrophic to autotrophic state as photosynthesis was promoted the uptake rate of inorganic carbon was increased and more oxygen was released resulting in the rapid increase of ph and do liu et al 2016 during later stage the nutrients levels n p and cod were all significantly decreased in both wastewaters e g tn decreased from 31 53 to 32 11 to below 10 mg l in ww a and from 99 81 to 100 78 to below 30 mg l in ww b this might lead to the lack of nutrients in ww a and the decline of mass transfer rate of nutrient n p and cod into the cells in ww b which might further cause the biofilm growth cessation in the system as shown in fig 5 biofilm gradually turned from green to yellow at distance 8 cm in ww a which indicated the lack of nitrogen as chlorophyll in algal cells was degraded to provide nitrogen for the growth jiang et al 2011 4 2 nutrients removal in the synthetic wastewater sharply degrading of cod is in consistent with the fast growth of algal biofilm in both wastewater figs 6 and 7 mainly owing to the introduced bacteria and the mixotrophic growth of algal cells apart from the cod removal nitrogen and phosphorus were also effectively removed in both wastewater through the vab enhanced raceway maximum daily tn and tp daily uptake rates fig 10 in both wastewater were significantly larger than the rates of 1 0 g m 2 day 1 for nitrogen and 0 13 g m 2 day 1 for phosphorus which obtained by boelee et al 2011 in this study bacteria was introduced to facilitate algal cells immigration onto carrier materials it also has positive effect on the algal growth and nutrients removal bacteria growth could provide co2 as well as decrease o2 inhibition for algal growth bai et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 and enhance algal metabolism by releasing growth promoting factors zhu et al 2013 as algal growth was promoted the rapid removals of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater were achieved nitrogen and phosphorus were the important elements for the algal growth and metabolism zhang et al 2018 when cod was sharply decreased the concentrations of tn and tp were also rapidly dropped off after stabilization of the cod concentration the removal of tn and tp as well as the growth rate of biofilm slowed down such phenomenon signified that cod removal promoted the removal of tn and tp in both wastewater this was mainly attributed to that cod in wastewater promoted the growth and metabolism of algal cells which further enhanced the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus algal cells commonly preferred nh4 n to no3 n for growth because less energy is needed during ammonium assimilation ge and champagne 2016 and this possibly contributed to the sharp decrease of nh4 n in both wastewater meanwhile such property of algae might also lead to the totally different tendency of no3 n removal in two types of wastewater compared to no3 n nh4 n was insufficient in ww b e g nh4 n no3 n was 1 39 in ww a and 0 49 in ww b this possibly caused the sharp decrease of both nh4 n and no3 n in ww b as nh4 n was insufficient for the rapid growth of biofilm in addition the denitrification might occur in the system and be restricted in ww a as cod was limited but proceeded in ww b as cod was sufficient which might also lead to the slow rapid no3 n removal in the two types of wastewater by the end of the experiment the theory amount of phosphorus assimilated by a gram of biofilm biomass was accordingly 0 063 0 072 0 091 and 0 095 g g for the distance of 2 4 6 and 8 cm in the treatment of ww b fig s7 however algal biomass traditionally contains only 0 5 3 3 phosphorus li et al 2011 such phenomenon signified the occurrence of phosphorus precipitation during the treatment which was induced by the high ph 8 5 liu et al 2016 indeed algal metabolic assimilation and phosphorus precipitation together contributed to the phosphorus removal in the vab enhanced raceway 4 3 effect of operation distance in this study system operation distance had significant effects on the biofilm production and nutrients removal efficiency distance 2 4 6 and 8 cm had about 1 408 0 704 0 528 and 0 352 m2 material surface for cell attachment on a land footprint area of 0 16 m2 in the vab enhanced raceway more surface was provided for cells attachment at small operation distance which largely magnified the corresponding footprint productivity however this larger biofilm surface area would result in lower received light intensity fig 4 of vertical biofilm and small nutrients loading on unit material surface leading to small biomass production based on material surface as illustrated in fig 5 when the operation distance was 2 cm light could hardly penetrate the gap between the components and reach on the biofilm surface as distance increased from 2 to 4 and 6 cm the light intensity received by the vertical biofilm was increased leading to an increase of photosynthesis rate and a higher biomass yield but in fact as distance further increased the light intensity received by the biofilm surface would not further increase and light energy was wasted because it directly penetrated on the bottom of the pond with distance at 8 cm fig 5 dark green biofilm occurred at the bottom of the pond and it did not consist of the biomass production during the harvest this might also contribute to the lowest footprint biomass production of distance at 8 cm additionally the nutrient loading rate on unit material surface area was increased as the distance increased leading to the enhanced nutrient uptake and photosynthesis efficiency and further nutrient removal table 1 boelee et al 2011 as shown in fig s7 the amount of nutrients removed by a gram of biomass was increased as the increase of operation distance but as further increase of the distance the provided biofilm culture surface area decreased and the received light intensity of algal biofilm changed marginally so the total amount of the nutrients removed would be limited due to the significantly lower biomass footprint production fig 6 leading to the decreased nutrients removal efficiency vertical biofilm could enlarge the total biomass culture area on unit land area to a great extent and thus the biofilm cultivation efficiency and the pollutant loading rate g m 2 day 1 were improved while the limitation of large land requirement for scale up could be cracked in addition the change of culture condition and wastewater type could be well handled through adjusting the distance between the components indeed the wastewater treatment efficiency of traditional raceway pond would be significantly improved after the enhancement by vertical biofilm in this study 6 cm was the optimal operation distance under the pond depth of 11 cm for efficient nutrients removal and biodiesel production however the optimal operation distance would be different due to the change of the pond depth culture condition and wastewater type in large scale and need to be further detected for a specific condition 4 4 lipid and biodiesel production ge and champagne 2016 found that algal lipid content decreased as the increase of nutrients levels during the diluted centrate wastewater treatment using suspended chlorella vulgaris increase of nutrients loading in the diluted piggery wastewater also induced the decline of algal lipid content in the study of zhu et al 2013 similarly in this study ww b with higher nutrients level obtained lower lipid content compared to ww a lower strength of the wastewater generally led to lower nutrients level in the later period due to the assimilate effect of algal cells nitrogen or phosphorus starvation could commonly trigger the lipid accumulation ge and champagne 2016 lower nutrients level 17 33 mg l 1 cod 10 mg l 1 tn and 0 43 mg l 1 tp at day 4 in ww a in later period might have triggered the lipid accumulation due to nutrient starvation and resulted in the above higher lipid content compared to ww b after wastewater treatment the lipid content in algal biomass of this study was similar to 11 2 christenson and sims 2012 and 9 johnson and wen 2010 both of which were obtained using algal biofilm but significantly lower than 33 91 45 81 zhu et al 2013 and 30 8 35 yun et al 2015 both of which were obtained through suspended algal algal species difference might contribute to this difference since different algal species commonly generated significantly different lipid contents besides since higher light intensity generally promoted lipid accumulation ooms et al 2016 the shadowing effect caused by the cells on or near the surface of the biofilm would lead cells at or near the bottom in the dim light or dark conditions and this would cause lower lipid content valenzuela and mazurie 2012 zhang et al 2017 thus the commonly lower lipid content in the algal biofilm compared to the suspended culture more importantly the composition of bacteria in the biofilm might also lead to this lower lipid content zhang et al 2017 2018 however do continuously increased during the treatments which might be due to that the consumption of oxygen was significantly lower than the production of it this well indicated that bacteria content was significantly low in the biofilm and algal phototrophic activity is dominant over 80 88 of fame was composed of c16 c18 short carbon chains indicating the suitability of harvested algal biomass for biodiesel production yun et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 besides fame was mainly composed of saturated fatty acids methyl ester 45 65 with c16 0 percentage in the range of 44 22 49 06 in ww a and 34 34 44 95 in ww b followed by polyenoic fatty acids methyl ester 19 05 26 76 which mainly contained c18 2 16 30 19 84 in ww a and 15 95 24 94 in ww b obviously as the nutrient loading rate increased the fame became unsaturated which will lead to the lower pour point of the produced biodiesel and improve the feasibility of using it in cold areas miranda et al 2017 however an increase in the unsaturation level of fatty acids might also lead to the oxidative deterioration of the produced biodiesel zhou et al 2017 4 5 potentials for scale up of vab enhanced raceway in this study extraordinary nutrients removal efficiencies were achieved by the vab enhanced raceway during the treatment of two types of synthetic wastewater indicating the feasibility of this new technology for the treatment of wide ranges of wastewaters based on the calculated data about the average nutrient removal rate fig 11 and biomass productivity table s3 during the major stage of nutrient removal continuous operation of the magnified system in practice at operation distance 6 cm could remove about 1 08 104 kg ha 1 tn 1 04 104 kg ha 1 tp and 4 50 105 kg ha 1 cod from wastewater in one year corresponding to an algal biomass production of 7 73 104 kg ha 1 in addition the yielded biomass could well compensate for expenses related to the operation of the system based on the measured fame content 1 09 at distance 6 cm with ww b the system could yield 8 43 102 kg ha 1 of biodiesel in one year meanwhile about 2 66 104 kg ha 1 of protein and 3 33 104 kg ha 1 of carbohydrate could also be generated during the treatment which could be possibly utilized as animal feed and for fermentation to produce bioethanol or hydrogen miranda et al 2017 besides the pond depth could be larger in practice due to no suspended algal cells that enhanced the light penetration in the pond thus the theory values calculated above could be larger owing to the enlarged biofilm surface area on unit land area meanwhile the biomass at full scale could also be harvested by the designed harvester fig 2 automatically fig s8 illustrated a proposed scale up scheme for the vab enhanced raceway consequently using this new technology for amplified wastewater treatment in practice is a win win strategy which can not only effectively remove pollutants from wastewater but also productively generate algal biomass for protein carbohydrate and biodiesel production 5 conclusion coral velvet with 5 8 mm long villus was supposed to be the optimal biofilm carrier in the vab enhanced raceway about 86 61 98 28 of cod 73 68 89 06 of tn and 89 85 96 82 of tp were removed in two synthetic wastewaters and nutrient removal efficiency was first increased and then decreased as operation distance increased higher nutrient concentration led to lower treatment efficiency and lower biodiesel productivity but higher biomass productivity algal biomass footprint production was decreased as the increase of distance and distance at 2 cm obtained the highest productivity 18 51 g m 2 day 1 with ww b as well as the highest biodiesel productivity 247 15 mg m 2 day 1 with ww a operation distance at 6 cm was the optimal when the wastewater treatment and algal biomass production were comprehensively balanced this study introduced and proved a newer simplified and cost effective way for wastewater treatment coupled with algal based biofuel production and the findings will be critical in the scale up of this technology acknowledgements this

19566,soil passage of pretreated surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms is a highly efficient process under oxic conditions reducing microorganism concentrations about 8 log10 within tens of meters however under anoxic conditions it has been shown that removal of microorganisms can be limited very much setback distances for adequate protection of natural groundwater may therefore be too short if anoxic conditions apply because removal of microorganisms under suboxic conditions is unknown this research investigated removal of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 by soil passage under suboxic conditions at field scale at the field location dune area one injection well and six monitoring wells were installed at different depths along three suboxic flow lines where oxygen concentrations ranged from 0 4 to 1 7 mg l and nitrate concentrations ranged from 13 to 16 mg l prd1 and ms2 were injected directly at the corresponding depths and their removal in each flow line was determined the highest bacteriophage removal was observed in the top layer with about 9 log removal of ms2 and 7 log removal of prd1 after 16 meters of aquifer transport less removal was observed at 12 m below surface probably due to a higher groundwater velocity in this coarser grained layer ms2 was removed more effectively than prd1 under all conditions due to short travel times inactivation of the phages was limited and the reported log removal was mainly associated with attachment of phages to the aquifer matrix this study shows that attachment of ms2 and prd1 is similar for oxic and suboxic sandy aquifers and therefore setback distances used for sandy aquifers under oxic and suboxic conditions provide a similar level of safety sticking efficiency and the attachment rate coefficient as measures for virus attachment were evaluated as a function of the physico chemical conditions graphical abstract image keywords virus removal suboxic soil passage drinking water 1 introduction soil passage of pretreated surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms is frequently applied in drinking water production and takes place during artificial recharge of groundwater aquifers bouwer 2002 riverbank filtration stuyfzand 1989a tufenkji et al 2002 and specifically in the netherlands in dune infiltration stuyfzand 1989b 1999 during soil passage pathogenic microorganisms are removed by attachment of the microorganisms to soil particles and by inactivation or die off bradford et al 2014 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the combination of virus persistence in the aquatic environment their ease of being transported with the water and through soil and filter media and their infectivity make viruses a significant microbial hazard for drinking water safety schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 have been used extensively as model viruses in field and laboratory studies schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 bacteriophage ms2 is a group i f specific bacteriophage it is icosahedral with a diameter of 26 nm and has a low isoelectric point of 3 5 implying it has a negative surface charge under most conditions as schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 have reviewed in most soils it therefore attaches less than or as poor as other negatively charged viruses for example a coxsackievirus b4 attaches as poor as ms2 whereas the less negatively charged poliovirus 1 attaches much more schijven et al 2003 at low temperatures it is relatively persistent but much less so at temperatures above 10 c harvey and ryan 2004 and schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 reviewed literature on the use of bacteriophage prd1 as a model virus it is an icosahedral bacteriophage with a diameter of 62 nm it attaches about as poorly as ms2 it has the advantage over ms2 that it is much more persistent in fact more than most viruses bertrand et al 2012 the combination of these two properties make it an excellent precautions model virus prd1 has structural and functional similarities with mammalian adenoviruses in field studies on oxic dune infiltration schijven et al 1999 and anoxic deep well injection with water containing oxygen schijven et al 2000 in sandy aquifers it was demonstrated that removal of bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 as model viruses was very effective about 8 log10 removal was achieved after 30 m and 38 m of soil passage respectively these studies also showed that virus removal was nonlinear with travel distance i e most of the removal took place during the first tens of metres of soil passage thereof removal was less efficient in the deep well injection study this nonlinear trend in removal with travel distance was ascribed to the presence of ferric oxyhydroxides in the oxic zone over the first meters of soil passage that provided favourable sites for virus attachment and absence of these attachment sites in the anoxic zone that entails the residual travel distance schijven et al 2000 schijven et al 2006 2010 used the virus attachment and inactivation data from those field sites schijven et al 1999 2000 to calculate setback distances for protection of natural groundwater against virus contamination from leaking sewers in order to comply with a maximum infection risk of one per ten thousand persons per year virus removal by soil passage and hence setback distance is highly sensitive to the values of virus attachment and inactivation schijven et al 2006 if geochemical conditions at a natural groundwater abstraction site are unknown it is suggested to apply the conservative value for virus attachment the conservative value for virus attachment in a sandy aquifer originates from measurements in the anoxic zone of the deep well injection site schijven et al 2000 and expressed as a sticking efficiency yao et al 1971 it was in the order of 10 5 this low sticking efficiency was confirmed in another field study under anoxic conditions where in anoxic sandy soil only a little more than 2 log removal of ms2 was observed after 30 meters of soil passage van der wielen et al 2008 note that favourable sites for attachment in the form of metal oxyhydroxides are absent under anoxic conditions in addition favourable sites for attachment may be absent or low when they are blocked e g by organic matter pieper et al 1997 ryan et al 1999 or at high ph and or low ionic strength schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the required setback distances under anoxic conditions were calculated to correspond to travel times of 110 days to one year instead of the currently applied 60 days if it can be demonstrated that when conditions in an aquifer are less unfavourable for virus removal than abovementioned a smaller setback distance may be sufficient to produce safe drinking water from groundwater schijven et al 2006 in the netherlands redox conditions in abstracted groundwater vary from sub oxic to deeply anoxic or constitute a mixture of these conditions most groundwater is anoxic o2 0 5 mg l no3 0 5 mg l and mn2 and fe2 0 1 mg l to deeply anoxic as anoxic but with significant sulphate reduction or methane production in the central and eastern part of the netherlands with most of the phreatic sandy aquifers about one fifth of the abstracted groundwater is suboxic 1 mg l o2 80 saturation and no3 1 mg l oxic water is characterised by 1 mg l o2 and 1 mg l no3 table 1 gives some exploitation data for the four major groundwater production areas in the netherlands in 2008 mendizabal and stuyfzand 2009 the field studies of schijven et al 1999 2000 and van der wielen et al 2008 provide estimates for virus attachment in sandy aquifers under oxic and anoxic conditions under oxic conditions attachment conditions is favourable and therefore virus removal is efficient whereas under anoxic conditions virus attachment is poor with considerable implications for the size of groundwater protection zones this finding was supported by column studies under oxic and anoxic conditions where in line with the field studies less adsorption was observed under anoxic conditions frohnert et al 2014 these studies show that redox conditions play an important role in attachment of viruses but has been investigated so far under only under oxic and anoxic conditions suboxic conditions are common but the efficiency of virus removal under these conditions is unknown therefore the current study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by investigating virus attachment under suboxic conditions at field scale to that aim transport of bacteriophages prd1 and ms2 as model viruses was studied at field scale in a dune area with artificial recharge of groundwater under suboxic conditions in a sandy aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field study was performed in the amsterdam water supply dunes at about 15 km southwest of amsterdam the area is in use by drinking water company waternet for infiltration of pretreated river water to be recovered and post treated to drinking water quality 61 mm3 y the water infiltrates in 40 infiltration ponds and is after soil passage collected in drains and open canals from where it is transported to the drinking water production plant for further treatment the experimental site was located between infiltration pond 6 and a collection canal the horizontal distance between infiltration pond 6 and the drainage canal is 101 m the water level of the infiltration pond is about 5 2 m above the level of the canal the groundwater table is about 2 m below soil surface and groundwater with low oxygen levels were found between 10 m and 12 m below soil surface soil surface and water tables are related to nap normal amsterdams peil normal amsterdam level a zero reference level at this location 10 meter below surface relates to nap 6 5 m 2 2 the aquifer and its monitoring wells the aquifer consists of sand 97 6 and 2 4 of clay and silt there are occasional layers of intact shells at various depths around monitoring well pl3 nearby filter screens 2 and 3 the soil contained with 93 4 sand 3 3 silt and 3 1 clay more clay and silt than measured around the other monitoring well suggesting local heterogeneity nearby pl3 the porosity of the aquifer is 0 38 the median grain size varies between 0 24 and 0 30 mm the ph of the groundwater was 7 9 and water temperature during injection of the bacteriophages was 15 2 c the soil organic matter som varied between 0 24 and 0 47 cation exchange capacity varied between 8 and 23 meq kg 1 geochemical analysis of the soil is described in table 3 a description of the drillhole columns is added in fig 1 six monitoring wells pl2 pl7 were installed in line with the groundwater flow direction at 2 5 m 5 m 10 m 18 m 28 m and 32 m distance from the injection well pl1 with filters screens of 0 25 m length at 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap fig 2 outside the central line of supposed groundwater flow four additional monitoring wells pd9 pd11 were installed for monitoring bacteriophages that could follow flow paths slightly deviating from the central line the injection filter screen was 3 m in length with a diameter of 28 cm and was divided into three sections each 1 m in length the depth of each section corresponded with the depths of the screens of the monitoring wells table 2 the reason for injection and monitoring at three different depths was to encompass the desired suboxic conditions which could not be predicted exactly before the installation of the wells suboxic conditions were determined based on the oxygen levels in the groundwater of the injection well and the monitoring wells prior to the start of the experiment with a concentration of respectively 1 7 0 7 and 0 8 mg l o2 at 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap in the injection well suboxic conditions were confirmed at 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap while at 6 5 m below nap the conditions where close to suboxic downstream of the injection well in pl2 to pl6 the oxygen concentration remained suboxic with 0 7 and 0 8 mg l at 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap at 6 5 m below nap the oxygen concentration downstream of the injection well gradually decreased to suboxic with a concentration of 0 5 mg l oxygen in monitoring well pl6 2 3 salt tracing salt tracing was conducted in order to estimate interstitial flow velocity and medium dispersivity in relatively homogeneous sandy aquifers the flow velocity of a salt tracer and its dispersivity are considered to be representative for virus particles schijven et al 1999 2000 van der wielen et al 2008 each injection filter section was connected to a separate 1000 l water tank that was filled with water taken from the corresponding aquifer depth oxygen levels in the tanks were kept as constant as possible by means of a constant flow of nitrogen gas initial oxygen levels of 1 9 0 9 and 0 8 mg l in tanks 1 2 and 3 respectively dropped to 0 8 0 4 and 0 4 mg l after 48 h of injecting a solution of 0 9 g l sodium chloride was injected during 48 h from the water tanks with a flow rate of 12 9 l h the transport of the sodium chloride was monitored in 15 min intervals by measuring electric conductivity ec with calibrated ctd divers in the monitoring wells the ec data were used to construct salt tracer breakthrough curves 2 4 bacteriophages preparation injection and monitoring a high titer bacteriophage

obtained from the national institute of public health and the environment bilthoven the netherlands rivm a high titer suspension of 5 4 109 pfu ml of prd1 was prepared according to iso10705 1 1995 initial concentration of the bacteriophages in the injection tanks was aimed at about 108 and 107 pfu ml for ms2 and prd1 respectively of each tank daily samples were taken to determine initial concentrations of the bacteriophages both bacteriophages were injected simultaneously at a flow rate of 12 9 l h for 64 h each of the 3 filter screens of the monitoring wells was equipped with a tube for sampling the other end of each tube was placed at about 75 m downstream the experimental area to avoid cross contamination this area was 4 m lower than the monitoring wells therefore the tubes could take water from the screens by using the natural gradient as driving force the end of each tube was connected to a metal sampling tap that was flame sterilized before taking a sample each sample was taken at a rate of 1 l min whereby the first 6 l about three times the tube volume were discarded to obtain a representative sample from the well the monitoring wells were sampled for ms2 and prd1 at regular intervals up to forty days after injection bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 were enumerated as described in iso 10705 1 1995 using s typhimurium wg49 as the host for ms2 and s typhimurium lt2 as the host for prd1 nalidixic acid was omitted for prd1 2 5 inactivation of ms2 and prd1 in groundwater inactivation of free ms2 and prd1 was determined in groundwater from the experimental site to that aim samples were collected from the three screens of monitoring well 2 after 2 5 m of soil passage when peak breakthrough concentrations were expected the samples were collected in eight bottles per screen depth that were filled completely and stored in the lab at the corresponding groundwater temperature of 15 c during 70 days a bottle per screen depth was taken at regular intervals to enumerate ms2 and prd1 bacteriophages as described above 2 6 conceptual model the major processes included in the mathematical model of our field study are advection hydrodynamic dispersion attachment detachment and inactivation given the hydrodynamics of the experimental site and the placement of the filter screens in the monitoring wells the flow of water from well to well was assumed to be one dimensional the governing equations for an advection dispersion model including reversible adsorption to two types of kinetic sites 1 and 2 and inactivation of free and attached bacteriophages in the case of uniform one dimensional flow are as follows schijven et al 2002 and including blocking of sites 1 and 2 sasidharan et al 2014 1 c t ρ b n s 1 t s 2 t x α l v c x v c x μ l c ρ b n μ s 1 s 1 2

the inactivation rate coefficients of free and attached bacteriophages respectively day 1 subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two different kinetic sites s max is the maximum solid phase concentration of attached bacteriophages to site 1 when the value of s max is large the blocking function equations 2 and 3 approaches the value of 1 and time dependent deposition behaviour becomes irrelevant sites of type 2 are characterised by fast attachment and fast detachment for that reason inactivation of attached bacteriophages to site 2 does not need to be considered schijven et al 2002 2 7 parameter estimation porewater velocities v and dispersity values α l of were estimated by fitting the breakthrough curves btcs from the salt tracing using hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 simunek et al 2005 the duration of the salt tracer injection and the salt concentration at the injection point were used as boundary condition for the btcs at the three depths of the first well pl2 1 pl2 2 and pl2 3 for the next wells the breakthrough concentration data of the upgradient wells at the corresponding depths were taken as boundary condition the reason for this well to well approach is explained below with the fitting of the virus btcs the inactivation rate coefficients μ l of the bacteriophages in the water phase were estimated by linear regression of the time series of the log concentration of the bacteriophages from the groundwater collected from well 2 the slopes of tails of the breakthrough curves btcs for the bacteriophages represent the inactivation rate coefficients μ s of the attached bacteriophages schijven et al 1999 these inactivation rate coefficients were estimated for each bacteriophage for all btcs also by linear regression analysis whether μ s values differ or did not differ between btcs was determined for each bacteriophage by likelihood ratio testing cox and hinkley 1974 using hydrus 1d attachment and detachment rate coefficients were estimated by fitting the btcs of the logarithmic virus concentrations to the two site kinetic model with and without blocking as well as to the one site kinetic model with and without blocking in addition assuming that favourable attachment is irreversible and unfavourable attachment is reversible also the models with reversible attachment to site 1 and irreversible attachment to site 2 with and without blocking were tested sasidharan et al 2014 commonly logarithmic transformation of the btc concentrations provide a better fit of the tail of the btc schijven et al 2002 like for the salt tracer duration and concentration of the bacteriophages at the injection point were used as boundary conditions for the btcs at the three depths of the first well pl21 pl22 and pl23 for the following wells the breakthrough concentration data of the previous wells at the corresponding depths were taken as boundary condition the estimates of the attachment and detachment rate coefficients from well to well may be correlated with hydrochemical conditions at the respective monitoring wells to investigate whether blocking played a role and whether two site kinetics were required to describe the breakthrough curves adequately the akaike s information criterion aic was used hydrus 1d provides values of aic that make model selection possible given the availability of data that make up the btc a model with less parameters like one site kinetic and no blocking may be sufficient to describe the btc in this regard the model with the lowest aic value was chosen as the best model in the case of equal aic values the model with the least number of parameters the simpler model was chosen colloid filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004 was used to express virus attachment to site 1 in terms of sticking efficiency 4 α 2 3 d c 1 n k a 1 v 1 η 0 where α is the sticking efficiency dc is the grain size diameter n is the porosity and η 0 is the single collector contact efficiency 2 8 regression analysis in order to investigate the dependence of the sticking efficiency on the physico chemical conditions multivariate regression analysis in combination with best model selection was conducted with the linear model function lm and the step function of the statistical package r version 3 2 2 in which terms were removed based on aic comparison with parameter k 3 84 venables and ripley 2002 this means that selected models with one parameter degree of freedom difference are compared by their likelihood values on a 5 chi square distribution basis a logit transformation of the response variable sticking efficiency α was applied because α needs to stay between 0 and 1 logit α log α 1 α 3 results 3 1 nacl as conservative tracer and parameter estimation before the injection of the bacteriophages nacl was injected as conservative tracer to confirm the flow direction of the water and determine the residence time from the injection well to the monitoring wells furthermore the breakthrough curves of nacl obtained from the monitoring wells were used to determine interstitial flow velocity dispersivity and dilution from the injection well to the monitoring well fitting of the nacl breakthrough curves using hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 resulted in values for pore water velocity and dispersivity table 2 fig 3 depicts the fitted salt tracer breakthrough curves the curves are fitted generally well except the irregularities of the climbing limbs at pl2 2 and pl2 3 could not be captured probably some physical heterogeneity plays a role here the dispersivity values listed in table for pd11 1 pd11 2 and pl5 3 were taken from fitting the bacteriophage breakthrough curves using the flow velocities from the salt tracer at the corresponding depths average porewater velocity was estimated to be 1 1 m d at depths of nap 6 5 and 7 5 m and 2 1 m d at nap 8 5 m apparently at nap 8 5 m hydraulic conductivity is about twice as high derived dispersivities were generally small but larger at nap 8 5 m the combination of layers with higher clay and silt contents table 3 and layers of intact shells with higher hydraulic conductivity suggests the presence of preferential flow patterns at this depth 3 2 description of breakthrough of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 initial concentrations of the bacteriophages at the injection well are included in table 2 these concentrations were constant during the 64 h injection for presentation of the bacteriophage btcs all bacteriophage breakthrough concentrations were normalised with the initial concentrations at the injection well due to the higher groundwater flow velocity at nap 8 5 m the bacteriophages injected at this depth were diluted by groundwater after injection table 2 all btcs are characterised by a climbing limb a peak concentration a declining limb and finally a gradually declining tail fig 4 judged from the lack of a maximum concentration plateau a steady state condition was not achieved the normalised peak concentration values log 10 c max c 0 provide therefore an indication of the log removal of the bacteriophages fig 5 presents log 10 c max c 0 values corrected for dilution of the bacteriophages versus travel distance for the two bacteriophages and for the three depths along which bacteriophage breakthrough was monitored the oxygen concentration in the upper layer nap 6 5 m was between 1 1 and 1 7 mg l o2 while oxygen concentration in the middle and lower layer was below 1 mg l o2 the removal of both phages was not identical in the upper and middle layer and the difference in oxygen concentration might play a role but physical heterogeneity in the aquifers soil is expected to be a larger factor affecting removal than the small oxygen concentration difference between these layers specifically around pl3 located 5 meter downstream of the injection point the soil samples showed a deviating composition when compared to the other soil samples table 3 and fig 1 and this is reflected in the large difference in removal efficiencies after 5 meters of soil passage the pore water velocity was with 2 1 m d at nap 8 5 substantially higher than the pore water velocity of 1 1 m d at nap 7 5 and 6 5 m a higher pore water velocity was associated with less removal at all sampling points and for both phages furthermore prd1 removal is less than ms2 removal over 16 m and depending on the depth prd1 is removed 4 7 2 log10 and ms2 is removed 8 5 9 1 log10 which is highly efficient in pl5 18 meters downstream of the injection prd1 was found only in the layer at nap 8 5 m in the additional three monitoring wells beyond pl5 more than 18 m no bacteriophages were detected 3 3 inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 in groundwater to determine the inactivation of ms2 and prd1 samples were collected after 2 5 m of soil passage from the three different filter screens due to removal in the first 2 5 meters the initial concentration was in the range of 9 4 105 3 5 107 pfu ml for ms2 and 3 0 105 1 6 106 pfu ml for prd1 inactivation of the bacteriophages was monitored for 70 days fig 6 the inactivation rate coefficients of ms2 and prd1 μ l assuming first order inactivation were on average log10 0 14 day 1 and 0 06 day 1 respectively 3 4 inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 attached to soil from likelihood ratio testing the first order inactivation rate coefficient for the solid phase μs of pdr1 was 0 092 day 1 that applied to all btcs of prd1 for ms2 the likelihood ratio testing gave two different values of 0 23 day 1 and 0 15 day 1 the higher value applied to the btcs at pl32 pl23 pl33 pl43 and pd113 the second well at nap 7 5 m and all wells at nap 8 5 m whereas the lower value applied to the btcs at pl21 pl31 pl41 pd111 pl22 pl42 and pd112 all wells at nap 6 5 m and 7 5 m depth except pl32 3 5 attachment and detachment rate coefficients of ms2 and prd1 table 4 presents the estimated parameter values associated with attachment and detachment for ten of the twelve ms2 btcs and for eight of the twelve prd1 btcs r2 values are 79 or above up to 99 which is satisfactorily r2 values are lower for the btcs at larger distances and with fewer data that also represent lower virus number concentrations note that in general estimates of k a1 and k d1 are fairly accurate standard error one order of magnitude less than the estimate whereas estimates of k a2 and k d2 may be quite inaccurate standard error in the same order of magnitude as the estimate all btcs were fitted on the basis of log transformed concentrations except for the btc of ms2 at pl31 where no log transformation led to a visually much better fit with a higher r2 based on lowest aic value as model selection criterion a model including s max2 was not selected for any of the btcs for ms2 the one site kinetic model was selected for wells pl4 1 pd11 1 pl3 2 pl4 2 and pd11 2 the two site kinetic model was selected for wells pl2 1 pl3 1 pl2 2 pl2 3 pl3 3 and pl4 3 for well pd11 3 only attachment to site 1 needed to be estimated estimation of s max1 was included for wells pl3 1 pl2 2 and pl3 2 for prd1 based on the lowest aic the one site kinetic model was selected for wells pl2 1 pl4 1 pd11 1 pl2 2 pl3 2 pd11 2 and pl5 3 the two site kinetic model was selected for wells pl3 1 pl4 2 pl2 3 and pl3 3 for wells pl4 1 pl4 3 and pd11 3 only attachment to site 1 needed to be estimated estimation of s max1 was included for wells pl2 2 and pl3 2 the finding that a one site kinetic model was sufficient to describe a btc instead of a two site kinetic model may be determined by the shape of the btc but also may be due to the fact that the data did not bare enough additional information relative to that from the btc of the preceding well to make this distinction fewer data and or more random error especially at larger travel distances some of the btcs were described well enough by attachment rate coefficient k a1 only a meaningful estimate of detachment could not be made in these cases similarly the btcs for which an estimate of s max1 was obtained indicated that blocking was occurring those btcs for which an estimate of s max1 was not needed indicated that blocking did not play a role but absence of blocking is not conclusive so blocking was indicated for both bacteriophages at wells pl22 and pl32 with a lower s max1 for well pl32 and lower s max1 values for prd1 than for ms2 for ms2 blocking was also indicated for well p31 with an even lower s max1 value 3 6 relation between geochemistry and sticking efficiency or the attachment rate coefficient table 5 lists the variables and their interactions that were are included in the selected regression model for the sticking efficiency and attachment rate coefficient for both models the included variables are bacteriophage clay content silt content cation exchange capacity calcium and the fe and mn oxalates clay content silt content cec and content of iron and aluminium oxides are all highly correlated with each other best model selection in r accounts for high collinearity nevertheless given the high collinearity and the limited number of data predictions of sticking efficiency values was not considered relevant here the regression analysis was only used to distinguish the most important variables affecting attachment expressed in the sticking efficiency note that in the model for sticking efficiency bacteriophage is not a significant term but is nevertheless part of the model selection based on likelihood ratios as selection criterion in the model for k att bacteriophages are a significant term indicating less attachment of prd1 than of ms2 as apparent in fig 5 4 discussion the geochemical analyses confirmed that the field study was conducted under suboxic conditions i e less than 1 mg l o2 at this low oxygen conditions efficient removal of bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 was observed in this sandy aquifer over a distance of about 16 m 9 1 log10 removal for ms2 and 7 2 log10 removal for prd1 was demonstrated in the top layer the lowest layer at nap 8 5 m showed over this same distance a removal of 8 5 log10 for ms2 and 4 0 log10 for prd1 the higher pore water velocity in this layer results in less removal of the bacteriophages and this is in line with previous studies pang 2009 table 4 also lists the estimated sticking efficiency values for ms2 at well pd11 1 the sticking efficiency is very low 6 2 10 6 also for prd1 at well pl4 1 it is low 6 3 10 5 otherwise the values of the sticking efficiency range from 0 25 10 3 to 2 3 10 3 for ms2 and from 0 33 10 3 to 1 4 10 3 for prd1 note that a sticking efficiency of 10 3 implies that only one of every thousand collisions between bacteriophage particles and soil grain surfaces results in attachment but given many collisions there is enough attachment to cause this efficient removal with the knowledge that under anoxic conditions virus removal is poor with associated sticking efficiency values in the order of 10 5 and that it is efficient under oxic conditions with sticking efficiency values in the order of 10 3 schijven et al 2000 this study adding data about virus removal under suboxic conditions is a meaningful addition to our knowledge apparently under suboxic conditions virus removal is as efficient as under oxic conditions this implies that for protection of natural groundwater under suboxic conditions a setback distance corresponding to a travel time of 60 days is sufficient in this study ms2 showed more attachment than prd1 table 4 and fig 4 in a previous field study in a dune area close to castricum it was shown that attachment of ms2 was approximately the same as prd1 schijven et al 1999 2000a and similar sticking efficiencies for both bacteriophages were described ionic strength of the water influences attachment of bacteriophages but not on an identical manner for ms2 and prd1 at low ionic strength adhesion of ms2 to a positively charged hydrophobic membrane was higher than prd1 while at higher ionic strength the opposite was observed dika et al 2015 comparing the ionic strength of the aquifer water of castricum schijven et al 2000 with the ionic strength of the aquifer water of this study shows that the ec in castricum was 914 μs cm 1 while the ec of the water at the site in this study was 720 μs cm 1 this might favour attachment of ms2 above prd1 and could explain why attachment of ms2 is higher than prd1 at this experimental site with residence times of about 15 days in the aquifer at nap 6 5 and 7 5 m and about 7 days at nap 8 5 m to the monitoring well at 16 m downstream of injection only a small part of the total virus reduction is caused by inactivation a period of 15 days in groundwater of 15 c decreases the ms2 population approximately 2 log by inactivation while the prd1 population decreases by 0 8 log inactivation in water in the aquifer at nap 6 5 m containing an oxygen concentration between 1 1 and 1 7 ml l proceeded slightly faster than in water with oxygen levels below 1 0 mg l at nap 7 5 and 8 5 fig 6 this is in agreement with previous observations where inactivation proceeded less fast under anoxic conditions frohnert et al 2014 van der wielen et al 2008 gordon and toze 2003 predictions of virus attachment with the regression model were not given because of the limited set of data twelve sticking efficiency values for each phage and ten different conditions the physico chemical conditions and the parameters describing transport of the bacteriophages inactivation attachment detachment and blocking indicated heterogeneities in the form of hydraulic conductivity with preferential flow paths at different depths regression analysis identified content of the bacteriophage clay content and the metal oxides as the most important physico chemical conditions affecting virus attachment to soil within the range of these conditions of the field study according to the regression model bacteriophage prd1 attaches less than ms2 the calcium content and iron and manganese oxides are indicated to increase virus attachment abudalo et al 2005 higher contents of calcium ions and metal oxides are expected to do this by providing favourable sites for attachment schijven et al 2000 it is unclear why this seems to be the opposite for aluminium oxides it should be noted that the chemical conditions in this field study did not vary over a wide range and that redox conditions were suboxic or very close to at all monitoring wells nevertheless the physico chemical conditions and the parameters describing transport of the bacteriophages inactivation attachment detachment and blocking indicated heterogeneities in the form of hydraulic conductivity with preferential flow paths at different depths specifically in the lower layer at nap 8 5 m areas containing intact shells were found furthermore around monitoring well pl3 5 meters downstream of injection a clearly deviating soil composition was observed contain a significantly higher clay content at nap 7 5 and 8 5 m but a lower clay content at nap 6 5 m apparently local heterogeneity can considerably impact the removal of viruses ms2 is removed more than prd1 especially between five and ten meters of travel distance fig 5 5 conclusions this study shows that virus removal by soil passage under suboxic conditions is equally effective as under oxic conditions in contrast to much lower virus removal under anoxic conditions this implies that for protection of natural groundwater under suboxic conditions a setback distance similar to oxic conditions and corresponding to a travel time of 60 days is adequate to ensure sufficient protection against virus contamination ms2 was removed more efficiently than prd1 after 16 meter of aquifer transport 9 1 log10 removal for ms2 and 7 2 log10 removal for prd1 was demonstrated in the top layer while over this same distance in the layer located 2 meter below the top layer a removal of 8 5 log10 for ms2 and 4 0 log10 for prd1 was demonstrated apparently prd1 is a more conservative model virus than ms2 not only because it inactivates slower it also attaches less the lower removal in the lower layer was ascribed to the almost 2 times higher average porewater velocity acknowledgements this study was financed by the dutch

19566,soil passage of pretreated surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms is a highly efficient process under oxic conditions reducing microorganism concentrations about 8 log10 within tens of meters however under anoxic conditions it has been shown that removal of microorganisms can be limited very much setback distances for adequate protection of natural groundwater may therefore be too short if anoxic conditions apply because removal of microorganisms under suboxic conditions is unknown this research investigated removal of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 by soil passage under suboxic conditions at field scale at the field location dune area one injection well and six monitoring wells were installed at different depths along three suboxic flow lines where oxygen concentrations ranged from 0 4 to 1 7 mg l and nitrate concentrations ranged from 13 to 16 mg l prd1 and ms2 were injected directly at the corresponding depths and their removal in each flow line was determined the highest bacteriophage removal was observed in the top layer with about 9 log removal of ms2 and 7 log removal of prd1 after 16 meters of aquifer transport less removal was observed at 12 m below surface probably due to a higher groundwater velocity in this coarser grained layer ms2 was removed more effectively than prd1 under all conditions due to short travel times inactivation of the phages was limited and the reported log removal was mainly associated with attachment of phages to the aquifer matrix this study shows that attachment of ms2 and prd1 is similar for oxic and suboxic sandy aquifers and therefore setback distances used for sandy aquifers under oxic and suboxic conditions provide a similar level of safety sticking efficiency and the attachment rate coefficient as measures for virus attachment were evaluated as a function of the physico chemical conditions graphical abstract image keywords virus removal suboxic soil passage drinking water 1

microorganisms are removed by attachment of the microorganisms to soil particles and by inactivation or die off bradford et al 2014 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the combination of virus persistence in the aquatic environment their ease of being transported with the water and through soil and filter media and their infectivity make viruses a significant microbial hazard for drinking water safety schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 have been used extensively as model viruses in field and laboratory studies schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 bacteriophage ms2 is a group i f specific bacteriophage it is icosahedral with a diameter of 26 nm and has a low isoelectric point of 3 5 implying it has a negative surface charge under most conditions as schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 have reviewed in most soils it therefore attaches less than or as poor as other negatively charged viruses for example a coxsackievirus b4 attaches as poor as ms2 whereas the less negatively charged poliovirus 1 attaches much more schijven et al 2003 at low temperatures it is relatively persistent but much less so at temperatures above 10 c harvey and ryan 2004 and schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 reviewed literature on the use of bacteriophage prd1 as a model virus it is an icosahedral bacteriophage with a diameter of 62 nm it attaches about as poorly as ms2 it has the advantage over ms2 that it is much more persistent in fact more than most viruses bertrand et al 2012 the combination of these two properties make it an excellent precautions model virus prd1 has structural and functional similarities with mammalian adenoviruses in field studies on oxic dune infiltration schijven et al 1999 and anoxic deep well injection with water containing oxygen schijven et al 2000 in sandy aquifers it was demonstrated that removal of bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 as model viruses was very effective about 8 log10 removal was achieved after 30 m and 38 m of soil passage respectively these studies also showed that virus removal was nonlinear with travel distance i e most of the removal took place during the first tens of metres of soil passage thereof removal was less efficient in the deep well injection study this nonlinear trend in removal with travel distance was ascribed to the presence of ferric oxyhydroxides in the oxic zone over the first meters of soil passage that provided favourable sites for virus attachment and absence of these attachment sites in the anoxic zone that entails the residual travel distance schijven et al 2000 schijven et al 2006 2010 used the virus attachment and inactivation data from those field sites schijven et al 1999 2000 to calculate setback distances for protection of natural groundwater against virus contamination from leaking sewers in order to comply with a maximum infection risk of one per ten thousand persons per year virus removal by soil passage and hence setback distance is highly sensitive to the values of virus attachment and inactivation schijven et al 2006 if geochemical conditions at a natural groundwater abstraction site are unknown it is suggested to apply the conservative value for virus attachment the conservative value for virus attachment in a sandy aquifer originates from measurements in the anoxic zone of the deep well injection site schijven et al 2000 and expressed as a sticking efficiency yao et al 1971 it was in the order of 10 5 this low sticking efficiency was confirmed in another field study under anoxic conditions where in anoxic sandy soil only a little more than 2 log removal of ms2 was observed after 30 meters of soil passage van der wielen et al 2008 note that favourable sites for attachment in the form of metal oxyhydroxides are absent under anoxic conditions in addition favourable sites for attachment may be absent or low when they are blocked e g by organic matter pieper et al 1997 ryan et al 1999 or at high ph and or low ionic strength schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the required setback distances under anoxic conditions were calculated to correspond to travel times of 110 days to one year instead of the currently applied 60 days if it can be demonstrated that when conditions in an aquifer are less unfavourable for virus removal than abovementioned a smaller setback distance may be sufficient to produce safe drinking water from groundwater schijven et al 2006 in the netherlands redox conditions in abstracted groundwater vary from sub oxic to deeply anoxic or constitute a mixture of these conditions most groundwater is anoxic o2 0 5 mg l no3 0 5 mg l and mn2 and fe2 0 1 mg l to deeply anoxic as anoxic but with significant sulphate reduction or methane production in the central and eastern part of the netherlands with most of the phreatic sandy aquifers about one fifth of the abstracted groundwater is suboxic 1 mg l o2 80 saturation and no3 1 mg l oxic water is characterised by 1 mg l o2 and 1 mg l no3 table 1 gives some exploitation data for the four major groundwater production areas in the netherlands in 2008 mendizabal and stuyfzand 2009 the field studies of schijven et al 1999 2000 and van der wielen et al 2008 provide estimates for virus attachment in sandy aquifers under oxic and anoxic conditions under oxic conditions attachment conditions is favourable and therefore virus removal is efficient whereas under anoxic conditions virus attachment is poor with considerable implications for the size of groundwater protection zones this finding was supported by column studies under oxic and anoxic conditions where in line with the field studies less adsorption was observed under anoxic conditions frohnert et al 2014 these studies show that redox conditions play an important role in attachment of viruses but has been investigated so far under only under oxic and anoxic conditions suboxic conditions are common but the efficiency of virus removal under these conditions is unknown therefore the current study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by investigating virus attachment under suboxic conditions at field scale to that aim transport of bacteriophages prd1 and ms2 as model viruses was studied at field scale in a dune area with artificial recharge of groundwater under suboxic conditions in a sandy aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field study was performed in the amsterdam water supply dunes at about 15 km southwest of amsterdam the area is in use by drinking water company waternet for infiltration of pretreated river water to be recovered and post treated to drinking water quality 61 mm3 y the water infiltrates in 40 infiltration ponds and is after soil passage collected in drains and open canals from where it is transported to the drinking water production plant for further treatment the experimental site was located between infiltration pond 6 and a collection canal the horizontal distance between infiltration pond 6 and the drainage canal is 101 m the water level of the infiltration pond is about 5 2 m above the level of the canal the groundwater table is about 2 m below soil surface and groundwater with low oxygen levels were found between 10 m and 12 m below soil surface soil surface and water tables are related to nap normal amsterdams peil normal amsterdam level a zero reference level at this location 10 meter below surface relates to nap 6 5 m 2 2 the aquifer and its monitoring wells the aquifer consists of sand 97 6 and 2 4 of clay and silt there are occasional layers of intact shells at various depths around monitoring well pl3 nearby filter screens 2 and 3 the soil contained with 93 4 sand 3 3 silt and 3 1 clay more clay and silt than measured around the other monitoring well suggesting local heterogeneity nearby pl3 the porosity of the aquifer is 0 38 the median grain size varies between 0 24 and 0 30 mm the ph of the groundwater was 7 9 and water temperature during injection of the bacteriophages was 15 2 c the soil organic matter som varied between 0 24 and 0 47 cation exchange capacity varied between 8 and 23 meq kg 1 geochemical analysis of the soil is described in table 3 a description of the drillhole columns is added in fig 1 six monitoring wells pl2 pl7 were installed in line with the groundwater flow direction at 2 5 m 5 m 10 m 18 m 28 m and 32 m distance from the injection well pl1 with filters screens of 0 25 m length at 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap fig 2 outside the central line of supposed groundwater flow four additional monitoring wells pd9 pd11 were installed for monitoring bacteriophages that could follow flow paths slightly deviating from the central line the injection filter screen was 3 m in length with a diameter of 28 cm and was divided into three sections each 1 m in length the depth of each section corresponded with the depths of the screens of the monitoring wells table 2 the reason for injection and monitoring at three different depths was to encompass the desired suboxic conditions which could not be predicted exactly before the installation of the wells suboxic conditions were determined based on the oxygen levels in the groundwater of the injection well and the monitoring wells prior to the start of the experiment with a concentration of respectively 1 7 0 7 and 0 8 mg l o2 at 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap in the injection well suboxic conditions were confirmed at 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap while at 6 5 m below nap the conditions where close to suboxic downstream of the injection well in pl2 to pl6 the oxygen concentration remained suboxic with 0 7 and 0 8 mg l at 7 5 and 8 5 m below nap at 6 5 m below nap the oxygen concentration downstream of the injection well gradually decreased to suboxic with a concentration of 0 5 mg l oxygen in monitoring well pl6 2 3 salt tracing salt tracing was conducted in order to estimate interstitial flow velocity and medium dispersivity in relatively homogeneous sandy aquifers the flow velocity of a salt tracer and its dispersivity are considered to be representative for virus particles schijven et al 1999 2000 van der wielen et al 2008 each injection filter section was connected to a separate 1000 l water tank that was filled with water taken from the corresponding aquifer depth oxygen levels in the tanks were kept as constant as possible by means of a constant flow of nitrogen gas initial oxygen levels of 1 9 0 9 and 0 8 mg l in tanks 1 2 and 3 respectively dropped to 0 8 0 4 and 0 4 mg l after 48 h of injecting a solution of 0 9 g l sodium chloride was injected during 48 h from the water tanks with a flow rate of 12 9 l h the transport of the sodium chloride was monitored in 15 min intervals by measuring electric conductivity ec with calibrated ctd divers in the monitoring wells the ec data were used to construct salt tracer breakthrough curves 2 4 bacteriophages preparation injection and monitoring a high titer bacteriophage suspension of ms2 was obtained from gap environmental services london canada at a concentration of 9 1 1010 plaque forming units pfu ml bacteriophage prd1 and host strain s typhimurium lt2 were obtained from the national institute of public health and the environment bilthoven the netherlands rivm a high titer suspension of 5 4 109 pfu ml of prd1 was prepared according to iso10705 1 1995 initial concentration of the bacteriophages in the injection tanks was aimed at about 108 and 107 pfu ml for ms2 and prd1 respectively of each tank daily samples were taken to determine initial concentrations of the bacteriophages both bacteriophages were injected simultaneously at a flow rate of 12 9 l h for 64 h each of the 3 filter screens of the monitoring wells was equipped with a tube for sampling the other end of each tube was placed at about 75 m downstream the experimental area to avoid cross contamination this area was 4 m lower than the monitoring wells therefore the tubes could take water from the screens by using the natural gradient as driving force the end of each tube was connected to a metal sampling tap that was flame sterilized before taking a sample each sample was taken at a rate of 1 l min whereby the first 6 l about three times the tube volume were discarded to obtain a representative sample from the well the monitoring wells were sampled for ms2 and prd1 at regular intervals up to forty days after injection bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 were enumerated as described in iso 10705 1 1995 using s typhimurium wg49 as the host for ms2 and s typhimurium lt2 as the host for prd1 nalidixic acid was omitted for prd1 2 5 inactivation of ms2 and prd1 in groundwater inactivation of free ms2 and prd1 was determined in groundwater from the experimental site to that aim samples were collected from the three screens of monitoring well 2 after 2 5 m of soil passage when peak breakthrough concentrations were expected the samples were collected in eight bottles per screen depth that were filled completely and stored in the lab at the corresponding groundwater temperature of 15 c during 70 days a bottle per screen depth was taken at regular intervals to enumerate ms2 and prd1 bacteriophages as described above 2 6 conceptual model the major processes included in the mathematical model of our field study are advection hydrodynamic dispersion attachment detachment and inactivation given the hydrodynamics of the experimental site and the placement of the filter screens in the monitoring wells the flow of water from well to well was assumed to be one dimensional the governing equations for an advection dispersion model including reversible adsorption to two types of kinetic sites 1 and 2 and inactivation of free and attached bacteriophages in the case of uniform one dimensional flow are as follows schijven et al 2002 and including blocking of sites 1 and 2 sasidharan et al 2014 1 c t ρ b n s 1 t s 2 t x α l v c x v c x μ l c ρ b n μ s 1 s 1 2

v is the mean interstitial water velocity m day ρ b is the dry bulk density kg m3 n is the porosity k a and k d are the attachment and detachment rate coefficients respectively day 1 μ l and μ s are the inactivation rate coefficients of free and attached bacteriophages respectively day 1 subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two different kinetic sites s max is the maximum solid phase concentration of attached bacteriophages to site 1 when the value of s max is large the blocking function equations 2 and 3 approaches the value of 1 and time dependent deposition behaviour becomes irrelevant sites of type 2 are characterised by fast attachment and fast detachment for that reason inactivation of attached bacteriophages to site 2 does not need to be considered schijven et al 2002 2 7 parameter estimation porewater velocities v and dispersity values α l of were estimated by fitting the breakthrough curves btcs from the salt tracing using hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 simunek et al 2005 the duration of the salt tracer injection and the salt concentration at the injection point were used as boundary condition for the btcs at the three depths of the first well pl2 1 pl2 2 and pl2 3 for the next wells the breakthrough concentration data of the upgradient wells at the corresponding depths were taken as boundary condition the reason for this well to well approach is explained below with the fitting of the virus btcs the inactivation rate coefficients μ l of the bacteriophages in the water phase were estimated by linear regression of the time series of the log concentration of the bacteriophages from the groundwater collected from well 2 the slopes of tails of the breakthrough curves btcs for the bacteriophages represent the inactivation rate coefficients μ s of the attached bacteriophages schijven et al 1999 these inactivation rate coefficients were estimated for each bacteriophage for all btcs also by linear regression analysis whether μ s values differ or did not differ between btcs was determined for each bacteriophage by likelihood ratio testing cox and hinkley 1974 using hydrus 1d attachment and detachment rate coefficients were estimated by fitting the btcs of the logarithmic virus concentrations to the two site kinetic model with and without blocking as well as to the one site kinetic model with and without blocking in addition assuming that favourable attachment is irreversible and unfavourable attachment is reversible also the models with reversible attachment to site 1 and irreversible attachment to site 2 with and without blocking were tested sasidharan et al 2014 commonly logarithmic transformation of the btc concentrations provide a better fit of the tail of the btc schijven et al 2002 like for the salt tracer duration and concentration of the bacteriophages at the injection point were used as boundary conditions for the btcs at the three depths of the first well pl21 pl22 and pl23 for the following wells the breakthrough concentration data of the previous wells at the corresponding depths were taken as boundary condition the estimates of the attachment and detachment rate coefficients from well to well may be correlated with hydrochemical conditions at the respective monitoring wells to investigate whether blocking played a role and whether two site kinetics were required to describe the breakthrough curves adequately the akaike s information criterion aic was used hydrus 1d provides values of aic that make model selection possible given the availability of data that make up the btc a model with less parameters like one site kinetic and no blocking may be sufficient to describe the btc in this regard the model with the lowest aic value was chosen as the best model in the case of equal aic values the model with the least number of parameters the simpler model was chosen colloid filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004 was used to express virus attachment to site 1 in terms of sticking efficiency 4 α 2 3 d c 1 n k a 1 v 1 η 0 where α is the sticking efficiency dc is the grain size diameter n is the porosity and η 0 is the single collector contact efficiency 2 8 regression analysis in order to investigate the dependence of the sticking efficiency on the physico chemical conditions multivariate regression analysis in combination with best model selection was conducted with the linear model function lm and the step function of the statistical package r version 3 2 2 in which terms were removed based on aic comparison with parameter k 3 84 venables and ripley 2002 this means that selected models with one parameter degree of freedom difference are compared by their likelihood values on a 5 chi square distribution basis a logit transformation of the response variable sticking efficiency α was applied because α needs to stay between 0 and 1 logit α log α 1 α 3 results 3 1 nacl as conservative tracer and parameter estimation before the injection of the bacteriophages nacl was injected as conservative tracer to confirm the flow direction of the water and determine the residence time from the injection well to the monitoring wells furthermore the breakthrough curves of nacl obtained from the monitoring wells were used to determine interstitial flow velocity dispersivity and dilution from the injection well to the monitoring well fitting of the nacl breakthrough curves using hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 resulted in values for pore water velocity and dispersivity table 2 fig 3 depicts the fitted salt tracer breakthrough curves the curves are fitted generally well except the irregularities of the climbing limbs at pl2 2 and pl2 3 could not be captured probably some physical heterogeneity plays a role here the dispersivity values listed in table for pd11 1 pd11 2 and pl5 3 were taken from fitting the bacteriophage breakthrough curves using the flow velocities from the salt tracer at the corresponding depths average porewater velocity was estimated to be 1 1 m d at depths of nap 6 5 and 7 5 m and 2 1 m d at nap 8 5 m apparently at nap 8 5 m hydraulic conductivity is about twice as high derived dispersivities were generally small but larger at nap 8 5 m the combination of layers with higher clay and silt contents table 3 and layers of intact shells with higher hydraulic conductivity suggests the presence of preferential flow patterns at this depth 3 2 description of breakthrough of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 initial concentrations of the bacteriophages at the injection well are included in table 2 these concentrations were constant during the 64 h injection for presentation of the bacteriophage btcs all bacteriophage breakthrough concentrations were normalised with the initial concentrations at the injection well due to the higher groundwater flow velocity at nap 8 5 m the bacteriophages injected at this depth were diluted by groundwater after injection table 2 all btcs are characterised by a climbing limb a peak concentration a declining limb and finally a gradually declining tail fig 4 judged from the lack of a maximum concentration plateau a steady state condition was not achieved the normalised peak concentration values log 10 c max c 0 provide therefore an indication of the log removal of the bacteriophages fig 5 presents log 10 c max c 0 values corrected for dilution of the bacteriophages versus travel distance for the two bacteriophages and for the three depths along which bacteriophage breakthrough was monitored the oxygen concentration in the upper layer nap 6 5 m was between 1 1 and 1 7 mg l o2 while oxygen concentration in the middle and lower layer was below 1 mg l o2 the removal of both phages was not identical in the upper and middle layer and the difference in oxygen concentration might play a role but physical heterogeneity in the aquifers soil is expected to be a larger factor affecting removal than the small oxygen concentration difference between these layers specifically around pl3 located 5 meter downstream of the injection point the soil samples showed a deviating composition when compared to the other soil samples table 3 and fig 1 and this is reflected in the large difference in removal efficiencies after 5 meters of soil passage the pore water velocity was with 2 1 m d at nap 8 5 substantially higher than the pore water velocity of 1 1 m d at nap 7 5 and 6 5 m a higher pore water velocity was associated with less removal at all sampling points and for both phages furthermore prd1 removal is less than ms2 removal over 16 m and depending on the depth prd1 is removed 4 7 2 log10 and ms2 is removed 8 5 9 1 log10 which is highly efficient in pl5 18 meters downstream of the injection prd1 was found only in the layer at nap 8 5 m in the additional three monitoring wells beyond pl5 more than 18 m no bacteriophages were detected 3 3 inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 in groundwater to determine the inactivation of ms2 and prd1 samples were collected after 2 5 m of soil passage from the three different filter screens due to removal in the first 2 5 meters the initial concentration was in the range of 9 4 105 3 5 107 pfu ml for ms2 and 3 0 105 1 6 106 pfu ml for prd1 inactivation of the bacteriophages was monitored for 70 days fig 6 the inactivation rate coefficients of ms2 and prd1 μ l assuming first order inactivation were on average log10 0 14 day 1 and 0 06 day 1 respectively 3 4 inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 and prd1 attached to soil from likelihood ratio testing the first order inactivation rate coefficient for the solid phase μs of pdr1 was 0 092 day 1 that applied to all btcs of prd1 for ms2 the likelihood ratio testing gave two different values of 0 23 day 1 and 0 15 day 1 the higher value applied to the btcs at pl32 pl23 pl33 pl43 and pd113 the second well at nap 7 5 m and all wells at nap 8 5 m whereas the lower value applied to the btcs at pl21 pl31 pl41 pd111 pl22 pl42 and pd112 all wells at nap 6 5 m and 7 5 m depth except pl32 3 5 attachment and detachment rate coefficients of ms2 and prd1 table 4 presents the estimated parameter values associated with attachment and detachment for ten of the twelve ms2 btcs and for eight of the twelve prd1 btcs r2 values are 79 or above up to 99 which is satisfactorily r2 values are lower for the btcs at larger distances and with fewer data that also represent lower virus number concentrations note that in general estimates of k a1 and k d1 are fairly accurate standard error one order of magnitude less than the estimate whereas estimates of k a2 and k d2 may be quite inaccurate standard error in the same order of magnitude as the estimate all btcs were fitted on the basis of log transformed concentrations except for the btc of ms2 at pl31 where no log transformation led to a visually much better fit with a higher r2 based on lowest aic value as model selection criterion a model including s max2 was not selected for any of the btcs for ms2 the one site kinetic model was selected for wells pl4 1 pd11 1 pl3 2 pl4 2 and pd11 2 the two site kinetic model was selected for wells pl2 1 pl3 1 pl2 2 pl2 3 pl3 3 and pl4 3 for well pd11 3 only attachment to site 1 needed to be estimated estimation of s max1 was included for wells pl3 1 pl2 2 and pl3 2 for prd1 based on the lowest aic the one site kinetic model was selected for wells pl2 1 pl4 1 pd11 1 pl2 2 pl3 2 pd11 2 and pl5 3 the two site kinetic model was selected for wells pl3 1 pl4 2 pl2 3 and pl3 3 for wells pl4 1 pl4 3 and pd11 3 only attachment to site 1 needed to be estimated estimation of s max1 was included for wells pl2 2 and pl3 2 the finding that a one site kinetic model was sufficient to describe a btc instead of a two site kinetic model may be determined by the shape of the btc but also may be due to the fact that the data did not bare enough additional information relative to that from the btc of the preceding well to make this distinction fewer data and or more random error especially at larger travel distances some of the btcs were described well enough by attachment rate coefficient k a1 only a meaningful estimate of detachment could not be made in these cases similarly the btcs for which an estimate of s max1 was obtained indicated that blocking was occurring those btcs for which an estimate of s max1 was not needed indicated that blocking did not play a role but absence of blocking is not conclusive so blocking was indicated for both bacteriophages at wells pl22 and pl32 with a lower s max1 for well pl32 and lower s max1 values for prd1 than for ms2 for ms2 blocking was also indicated for well p31 with an even lower s max1 value 3 6 relation between geochemistry and sticking efficiency or the attachment rate coefficient table 5 lists the variables and their interactions that were are included in the selected regression model for the sticking efficiency and attachment rate coefficient for both models the included variables are bacteriophage clay content silt content cation exchange capacity calcium and the fe and mn oxalates clay content silt content cec and content of iron and aluminium oxides are all highly correlated with each other best model selection in r accounts for high collinearity nevertheless given the high collinearity and the limited number of data predictions of sticking efficiency values was not considered relevant here the regression analysis was only used to distinguish the most important variables affecting attachment expressed in the sticking efficiency note that in the model for sticking efficiency bacteriophage is not a significant term but is nevertheless part of the model selection based on likelihood ratios as selection criterion in the model for k att bacteriophages are a significant term indicating less attachment of prd1 than of ms2 as apparent in fig 5 4 discussion the geochemical analyses confirmed that the field study was conducted under suboxic conditions i e less than 1 mg l o2 at this low oxygen conditions efficient removal of bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 was observed in this sandy aquifer over a distance of about 16 m 9 1 log10 removal for ms2 and 7 2 log10 removal for prd1 was demonstrated in the top layer the lowest layer at nap 8 5 m showed over this same distance a removal of 8 5 log10 for ms2 and 4 0 log10 for prd1 the higher pore water velocity in this layer results in less removal of the bacteriophages and this is in line with previous studies pang 2009 table 4 also lists the estimated sticking efficiency values for ms2 at well pd11 1 the sticking efficiency is very low 6 2 10 6 also for prd1 at well pl4 1 it is low 6 3 10 5 otherwise the values of the sticking efficiency range from 0 25 10 3 to 2 3 10 3 for ms2 and from 0 33 10 3 to 1 4 10 3 for prd1 note that a sticking efficiency of 10 3 implies that only one of every thousand collisions between bacteriophage particles and soil grain surfaces results in attachment but given many collisions there is enough attachment to cause this efficient removal with the knowledge that under anoxic conditions virus removal is poor with associated sticking efficiency values in the order of 10 5 and that it is efficient under oxic conditions with sticking efficiency values in the order of 10 3 schijven et al 2000 this study adding data about virus removal under suboxic conditions is a meaningful addition to our knowledge apparently under suboxic conditions virus removal is as efficient as under oxic conditions this implies that for protection of natural groundwater under suboxic conditions a setback distance corresponding to a travel time of 60 days is sufficient in this study ms2 showed more attachment than prd1 table 4 and fig 4 in a previous field study in a dune area close to castricum it was shown that attachment of ms2 was approximately the same as prd1 schijven et al 1999 2000a and similar sticking efficiencies for both bacteriophages were described ionic strength of the water influences attachment of bacteriophages but not on an identical manner for ms2 and prd1 at low ionic strength adhesion of ms2 to a positively charged hydrophobic membrane was higher than prd1 while at higher ionic strength the opposite was observed dika et al 2015 comparing the ionic strength of the aquifer water of castricum schijven et al 2000 with the ionic strength of the aquifer water of this study shows that the ec in castricum was 914 μs cm 1 while the ec of the water at the site in this study was 720 μs cm 1 this might favour attachment of ms2 above prd1 and could explain why attachment of ms2 is higher than prd1 at this experimental site with residence times of about 15 days in the aquifer at nap 6 5 and 7 5 m and about 7 days at nap 8 5 m to the monitoring well at 16 m downstream of injection only a small part of the total virus reduction is caused by inactivation a period of 15 days in groundwater of 15 c decreases the ms2 population approximately 2 log by inactivation while the prd1 population decreases by 0 8 log inactivation in water in the aquifer at nap 6 5 m containing an oxygen concentration between 1 1 and 1 7 ml l proceeded slightly faster than in water with oxygen levels below 1 0 mg l at nap 7 5 and 8 5 fig 6 this is in agreement with previous observations where inactivation proceeded less fast under anoxic conditions frohnert et al 2014 van der wielen et al 2008 gordon and toze 2003 predictions of virus attachment with the regression model were not given because of the limited set of data twelve sticking efficiency values for each phage and ten different conditions the physico chemical conditions and the parameters describing transport of the bacteriophages inactivation attachment detachment and blocking indicated heterogeneities in the form of hydraulic conductivity with preferential flow paths at different depths regression analysis identified content of the bacteriophage clay content and the metal oxides as the most important physico chemical conditions affecting virus attachment to soil within the range of these conditions of the field study according to the regression model bacteriophage prd1 attaches less than ms2 the calcium content and iron and manganese oxides are indicated to increase virus attachment abudalo et al 2005 higher contents of calcium ions and metal oxides are expected to do this by providing favourable sites for attachment schijven et al 2000 it is unclear why this seems to be the opposite for aluminium oxides it should be noted that the chemical conditions in this field study did not vary over a wide range and that redox conditions were suboxic or very close to at all monitoring wells nevertheless the physico chemical conditions and the parameters describing transport of the bacteriophages inactivation attachment detachment and blocking indicated heterogeneities in the form of hydraulic conductivity with preferential flow paths at different depths specifically in the lower layer at nap 8 5 m areas containing intact shells were found furthermore around monitoring well pl3 5 meters downstream of injection a clearly deviating soil composition was observed contain a significantly higher clay content at nap 7 5 and 8 5 m but a lower clay content at nap 6 5 m apparently local heterogeneity can considerably impact the removal of viruses ms2 is removed more than prd1 especially between five and ten meters of travel distance fig 5 5 conclusions this study shows that virus removal by soil passage under suboxic conditions is equally effective as under oxic conditions in contrast to much lower virus removal under anoxic conditions this implies that for protection of natural groundwater under suboxic conditions a setback distance similar to oxic conditions and corresponding to a travel time of 60 days is adequate to ensure sufficient protection against virus contamination ms2 was removed more efficiently than prd1 after 16 meter of aquifer transport 9 1 log10 removal for ms2 and 7 2 log10 removal for prd1 was demonstrated in the top layer while over this same distance in the layer located 2 meter below the top layer a removal of 8 5 log10 for ms2 and 4 0 log10 for prd1 was demonstrated apparently prd1 is a more conservative model virus than ms2 not only because it inactivates slower it also attaches less the lower removal in the lower layer was ascribed to the almost 2 times higher average porewater velocity acknowledgements this study was financed by the dutch

19567,the effects of ozone biologically activated carbon o3 bac treatment with various phosphate doses 0 0 3 or 0 6 mg l were investigated on the formation of disinfection by products dbps and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens ops in drinking water distribution systems dwdss simulated by annular reactors ars it was found that the lowest dbps and the highest inactivation of ops such as mycobacterium spp mycobacterium avium aeromonas spp pseudomonas aeruginosa and hartmanella vermiformis occurred in the effluent of the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition based on the results of different characterization techniques for the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate enhanced o3 bac treatment dissolved organic carbon in the influent exhibited the lowest concentration and most stable fraction due to the improved biodegradation effect moreover the total amount of suspended extracellular polymeric substances eps in the bulk water of the ar decreased greatly resulting in the lowest chlorine consumption and dbps formation in the ar in fourier transform infrared spectra of the suspended eps the amide ii band 1600 1500 cm 1 disappeared and the protein polysaccharide ratio decreased remarkably indicating the destruction of protein and a decrease in hydrophobicity moreover β sheets and α helices in the protein secondary structures were degraded while the random coils increased sharply as phosphate addition increased to 0 6 mg l inhibiting microbial aggregation and hence weakening the chlorine resistance capability thus most of the ops in suspended biofilms were more easily inactivated by residual chlorine resulting in the lowest ops occurrence in the effluent of the ar our findings indicated that enhancing the efficiency of the bac filter by adding phosphate is a promising method for improving water quality in dwdss graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products opportunistic pathogens bac extracellular polymeric substances biofilm drinking water distribution systems 1 introduction the presence of microbial based problems in drinking water distribution systems dwdss is an emerging area of concern generally the water at consumers taps has a lower quality than the finished water after treatment due to bacterial regrowth and proliferation of opportunistic pathogens ops wang et al 2013a 2013b to reduce risk chlorine has been widely used as a microbial disinfectant since early in the 20th century because of its relatively low cost and ability to maintain a disinfectant residual throughout dwdss however the disinfection of drinking water hailed as a public health triumph of the twentieth century brings more daunting human challenges chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom to produce harmful disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas which are suspected human carcinogens richardson et al 2007 moreover nom from human origin or natural processes is present in all natural waters and plays an important role in many natural and engineered processes kwon et al 2005 therefore chlorine that was introduced to inhibit microbial regrowth unexpectedly created new human carcinogen dbps in addition dwdss actually harbor an astounding array of microorganisms although disinfection can reduce the abundance of bacteria efficiently recently ops such as mycobacterium avium pseudomonas aeruginosa hartmanella vermiformis and acanthamoeba spp have become emerging public health concerns due to a large number of outbreaks and elevated clinical cases wang et al 2012 2013b in contrast to fecal source pathogens which are easily killed by disinfectants opportunistic pathogens naturally colonize persist and multiply in dwdss even in the presence of high disinfectant residuals because they share a large number of characteristics such as biofilm formation extracellular polymeric substance eps production disinfectant resistance growth in amoebae growth at low organic carbon concentrations etc wang et al 2012 falkinham 2015 in dwds more than 90 of the total biomass can be found growing attached to pipe walls with only up to 5 of the biomass freely suspended in the bulk water liu et al 2014 actually the biofilms in dwdss are divided into suspended biofilms in bulk water and attached biofilms on pipe walls xue et al 2012 liu et al 2014 since eps known as the major constituent of biofilms have many roles including enhancing bacterial adhesion and providing a protective barrier as well as adsorbing and storing nutrients for biofilm growth chlorine disinfection is problematic and ineffective for the control of ops in dwdss the combination of ozonation and biologically activated carbon bac technology prior to chlorination has been widely used as the main advanced drinking water treatment process to improve water quality treguer et al 2010 it has been proven that ozone has the capacity to oxidize dbp precursors de vera et al 2015 inactivate resistant pathogenic microorganisms von gunten 2003 reduce refractory dissolved organic carbon doc and generate more biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc which promotes biological growth in the downstream distribution system or bac surface treguer et al 2010 granular activated carbon gac was originally designed to remove organic matter by adsorption due to its large specific surface area and well developed pore structure buchanan et al 2008 simpson 2008 bac filtration has proven to be able to significantly remove natural organic matter and disinfection by product precursors simpson 2008 eliminate pathogenic microorganisms hijnen et al 2010 and play a primary role in shaping the distribution system bacterial community pinto et al 2012 wang et al 2013a however previous studies focused only on improving nom removal and changing the microbial properties in bac filters by some efforts such as optimizing the ozone dose treguer et al 2010 changing the flow direction han et al 2013 adding phosphate etc nishijima et al 1997 it has been overlooked that enhancing nom removal in the bac filter may limit microbial regrowth in dwdss due to the fact that more assimilable organic carbon aoc which would serve as a growth substrate for downstream microbes can be removed before flowing into dwdss meanwhile a change in the microorganisms detached from a bac filter could influence the bacterial community in dwdss because bac filters and dwdss are equivalent to two sequential microbiological systems to our knowledge few studies have been conducted thus far to characterize the effect of enhanced o3 bac filters on water quality microbial regrowth and even ops occurrence in downstream dwdss in this study the effect of the enhancement of o3 bac filters by phosphate addition on dbps and ops occurrence in dwdss was investigated the characterization and structure of doc was clarified by specific ultraviolet absorbance high performance size exclusion chromatography and excitation emission matrix fluorescence measurements meanwhile we conducted extracellular polymeric substance eps extraction and analysis to characterize the condition of suspended biofilms and attached biofilms heterotrophic plate counts hpc to quantify viable heterotrophic bacterial populations and propidium monoazide pma treatment coupled with quantitative real time pcr pma qpcr to enumerate the total living bacteria and opportunistic pathogens in dwdss a preliminary effort to identify a correlation among water quality microbial biomass and eps in dwdss was undertaken 2 materials and methods 2 1

dwdss wang et al 2017b in the ars there were two concentric glass cylinders and a rotating inner drum with 20 cast iron coupons mounted on it each coupon had an exposed surface area of 17 5 cm2 for biofilm growth prior to use the surface of each cast iron coupon was polished with 1200 grit emery paper rinsed with sterile deionized water and degreased in acetone followed by sterilizing in 70 ethanol for 10 h and then dried aseptically in a laminar flow cabinet the ars were established in parallel and operated at a rotational speed of 50 rpm which translated to a shear stress of 0 25 n m2 corresponding to a flow rate of around 0 3 m sec in a 100 mm diameter smooth pipe the hydraulic retention time hrt for the reactors was 6 h which translated to a total flow rate of 2 8 ml min into the

solution of naclo different amounts of naclo were dosed into the water to maintain similar influent residual chlorine concentrations about 2 8 mg cl2 l during the whole experiment the chlorine concentration was measured using a hanna spectrophotometer hi93711 italy huang et al 2017 moreover before flowing into the ars the chlorine treated waters entered an organic glass vessel as a simulated reservoir with 4 h hrt to maintain sufficient contact between water and disinfectant the calculated concentration time value ct10 was around 65 28 mg min l finally the effluent of the reservoir flowed into the ars before phosphate addition the three ars had been run under the same conditions for around one year as shown in fig s2 the corrosion rate effluent total iron and doc concentrations of the three ars gradually stabilized at similar values during approximately one year running time indicating that they were close to steady state the corrosion rate was represented by the corrosion current density obtained from tafel analysis of polarization curves for the tested coupons from the three ars zhu et al 2014 then the raw waters flowing into the three ars were directly treated with phosphate addition at three different concentrations for about 6 months prior to the first water and biofilm sampling event in order to guarantee data replication another two samplings were performed 3 months and six months after the first sampling the average of all the detected experimental data from the three replications was calculated error bars represented the relative standard deviation rsd from the average of three replications n 3 the concentrations of the phosphate dosed in this study were 0 0 3 and 0 6 mg na2hpo4 l fig s1 which is by regulation the maximum allowable level jang et al 2012 2 3 water quality analysis the tested raw water table s1 was treated by chemical precipitation and flocculation polyaluminium chloride and ferric sulfate settling and sand filtration prior to entering the biologically activated carbon filter in a drinking water treatment plant in northern china using surface water as source water doc and uv254 were analyzed via a total organic carbon analyzer phoenix 8000 tekmar dohrmann usa and uv spectroscopy respectively after filtration hijnen et al 2018 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva was calculated by multiplying the ratio of uv254 to doc by a conversion factor of 100 the procedure for bdoc determination followed a technique using sand fixed bacteria escobar and randall 1999 the content of aoc was analyzed by previous developed methods van der kooij et al 1982 thms and haas were analyzed according to usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 respectively the molecular weight of the nom fraction was obtained via high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec in a system equipped with a thermo biobasic sec 300 column 150 mm 7 8 mm thermo scientific and uv detector 1200 agilent excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem measurements were conducted using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent technologies differences of water quality parameters were analyzed using analysis of variance anova with a significance threshold of α 0 05 the detailed information on the aoc thms haas and eem measurement process is shown in supporting information 2 4 pma treatment dna extraction and quantitative real time pcr pma is a dye that penetrates membrane damaged cells and binds with dna the pma bound dna cannot be amplified in the following qpcr therefore pma is often applied to quantify the dna from live bacteria and characterize the changes of viable bacterial communities chiao et al 2014 gensberger et al 2014 the water and biofilm samples were subjected to pma treatment by incubating the polycarbonate membrane filters in 50 μm pma solution fig s3 s4 the detailed process of pma treatment of samples and determination of optimal pma concentration are given in the supporting information after pma treatment dna extraction was conducted using a fastdna spin kit for soil following the manufacturer s instructions all dna samples were stored at 80 c for future use quantitative pcr qpcr targeting 16s rrna and opportunistic pathogens was performed via a 7300 qpcr system and the 7300 system sds software applied biosystems the detailed analysis procedures are described in table s2 2 5 eps extraction and analysis the eps of the biofilm samples were extracted using the ultrasonication centrifugation method developed by previous researchers zhang et al 2014 han et al 2017 the detailed extraction procedures are described in supporting information the polysaccharide content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard the humic substances and the protein content were determined using a modified lowry method with humic acid and bovine serum albumin as standards the zeta potentials of different eps samples were determined using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk the contributions of different eps samples to the aggregation of particles were obtained by performing an eps flocculating test the flocculating efficiency was determined in a kaolin suspension zhang et al 2014 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem results were combined for further component analysis of eps yin et al 2015 jia et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of organic matter in water fig 1 shows the changes in the mean doc bdoc and aoc concentrations in different waters with different concentrations of phosphate added with no phosphate addition doc in raw water rw was around 1 87 mg l increasing slightly to 2 16 mg l after ozonation which possibly came from the desorption of doc adsorbed on suspended particles after oxidation by ozone subsequently the doc decreased sharply after bac filtration and chlorination and finally decreased to 0 74 mg l in the effluent of the ar it was reported that high molecular weight mw organic matter can be converted into lower mw organic matter with fracture of partial chemical bond due to chlorination resulting in a slight decrease of doc tian et al 2013 wang et al 2017a moreover chlorine produces aoc from doc which stimulates microbial growth as chlorine concentration subsides fisher et al 2017 in the simulated reservoir before ars fig s1 the remaining chlorine resistant bacteria could contribute to a large portion of doc removal by biodegradation during 4 h retention time hence the doc concentration of the influent of ars was lower than that of o3 bac filtered water obfw with increasing phosphate addition the doc in rw and ozonated water ow barely exhibited any change however much more doc removal 66 35 0 6 mg l phosphate addition was observed in the bac filter consequently doc in the influent and effluent of the ar decreased to around 0 6 mg l the same change processes were observed for bdoc and aoc concentrations fig 1b and c the removal of bdoc increased from 32 64 to 95 16 and the removal of aoc increased from 61 80 to 88 04 in the bac filter with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l which was attributed to a better biodegradation effect the results above indicated that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient on the growth of bacteria in the bac filter sang et al 2003 in contrast the consumption of doc and especially bdoc and aoc in the ar decreased sharply with increasing phosphate addition doc particularly bdoc and aoc has been considered as one of the main factors for microbial regrowth in dwdss escobar et al 2001 these results indicated that with phosphate addition the biodegradation role of the bac filter was enhanced resulting in more bdoc being consumed while the regrowth of microorganisms in dwdss was inhibited by maintaining a relatively low organic carbon level 3 2 chlorine consumption and disinfection by products formation to maintain the same residual chlorine concentration about 2 8 mg l in the influent of the ar the required initial chlorine dosage concentration increased markedly from 3 34 to 4 24 mg l with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l fig 2 a within 4 h reaction time in a simulated reservoir before the ars fig s1 generally chlorine consumption is mainly due to reaction with doc and inactivation of microorganisms doc in the obfw was lowest with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition therefore the increase of the chlorine dose mainly contributed to the inactivation of microorganisms because phosphate addition could enhance microbial growth and metabolic activity in the bac filter nishijima et al 1997 conversely in the effluent of the ar the chlorine concentration increased sharply from 0 073 to 1 629 mg l with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l indicating a decline of chlorine consumption in the ar within 6 h hydraulic retention time with higher phosphate addition which was consistent with the lower doc consumption in the ar fig 1a with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l the concentration of thms in influent decreased from 19 55 μg l to 8 52 μg l and that in effluent decreased from 10 94 μg l to 5 67 μg l fig 2b the same change process was observed for haas fig 2c indicating that phosphate addition could inhibit dbps formation remarkably as expected the amount of chlorinated dbps was much higher than brominated dbps because there was little bromide around 0 05 mg l in the raw water table s1 and the decreases of thms and haas accompanying phosphate addition were mainly attributed to chloroform chcl3 and chloroacetic acid mcaa in addition the decreases in thms and haas from influent to effluent in the ars were mainly attributed to biodegradation wang et al 2017b c suva has proven to be the most widely used parameter for predicting dbps formation potential in drinking water treatment hua et al 2015 as expected the suva of obfw decreased from 0 2643 to 0 1639 l mg m with increasing phosphate addition table s3 indicating that the aromaticity of doc in ow was degraded markedly in the bac filter comparison of the molecular weight mw distribution of obfw showed that a larger amount of the high mw hmw fraction 500 da was removed in the bac filter due to phosphate addition fig s5 the hmw fraction of the doc was the major source of uv254 which generally includes the precursors of dbps gan et al 2013 concurrently the low mw lmw fraction 500 da of doc increased as phosphate addition increased from 0 to 0 6 mg l moreover the lmw fraction of doc after biodegradation represented metabolic products of microorganisms living in the bac han et al 2013 the results above indicated that higher dbps precursors removal in the bac filter might be attributed to removal of the hmw fraction of doc in addition eem measurements were used to characterize doc fractions defined into five regions including aromatic proteins ap regions i and ii ex 250 nm em 350 nm fulvic acid like substances fa region iii ex 250 nm em 350 nm soluble microbial byproduct like substances smp region iv ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and humic acid like substances ha region v ex 280 nm em 380 nm yang et al 2008 two main peaks can be easily identified from the fluorescence spectra of obfw without phosphate addition namely ex em 305 325 420 440 nm peak a and ex em 220 235 405 445 nm peak b fig s6 the two peaks were assigned to ha substances peak a and fa substances peak b which are major precursors of dbps formation it was observed that peak a and peak b declined greatly with phosphate addition moreover the fluorescence regional integration fri method was employed to quantify the variations of fluorescent organic species from the five regions under different levels of phosphate addition fig s7 and fri parameters are shown in table s4 obviously phosphate addition resulted in remarkable decreases of ap fa and ha in the bac filter the aromatic proteins are also important precursors of dbps formation and can be easily decomposed by the microorganisms yang et al 2015 over all doc and especially dbps precursors were significantly removed in the bac filter with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition due to an enhanced biodegradation effect resulting in lower chlorine consumption and dbps formation in downstream dwdss 3 3 total bacteria and heterotrophic plate count as shown in fig 3 with increasing phosphate addition the 16s rrna gene copy numbers in rw and ow increased slightly and that in obfw increased greatly from 8 73 104 to 1 36 106 gene copies ml because addition of phosphorus to the raw water can stimulate bacteria growth and improve the biodegradation of organic substances in biological systems sang et al 2003 li et al 2010 correspondingly 0 6 mg l phosphate addition resulted in the lowest level of 16s rrna genes after chlorination in the influents of the ar indicating that most of the bacteria in the obfw were inactivated by chlorine in a previous work the addition of phosphate did increase the disinfection efficiency of chlorine liu et al 2016 which probably contributed to the decline of microbial biomass due to chlorine similarly the 16s rrna genes maintained the lowest level 1 07 103 gene copies ml in the effluent of the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition verifying the lowered microbial metabolic activity in the dwdss the results of hpc in water were in agreement with 16s rrna gene copy numbers except that hpc in ow and influents of the ar were not detected due to the strong sterilization effects of ozonation and chlorination fig 3b most notably 0 6 mg l phosphate addition resulted in aoc and hpc in effluents decreasing to 6 97 μg l and 0 fig 1c respectively which were consistent with the previous conclusion that the regrowth of heterotrophic bacteria could be prevented with an aoc concentration of 10 μg l or less van der kooij 1992 therefore the lower microbial biomass was in accordance with the lower chlorine consumption in the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition in contrast as phosphate addition increased the 16s rrna gene copy numbers and hpc in biofilms on the cast iron pipe decreased slightly from 1 22 109 to 4 84 108 gene copies g and from 2 31 105 to 1 08 104 cfu cm2 respectively indicating the relative stability of the biofilms fig 3c the results indicated that the microbial biomass in the bulk water of the ar was more easily influenced by external factors compared to the attached biofilms on the cast iron pipes the increased resistance of bacteria within attached biofilms was in part due to the eps matrix produced which can retain and store compounds including nutrients to provide food reserves for microbial members during a starvation period as well as bind and inactivate disinfectants such as chlorine liu et al 2016 3 4 opportunistic pathogens occurrence the living legionella spp mycobacterium spp m avium aeromonas spp pseudomonas aeruginosa acanthamoeba spp and hartmanella vermiformis in the effluents and attached biofilms on cast iron pipe were enumerated using pma qpcr fig 4 with no phosphate addition the gene copy numbers of living legionella spp mycobacterium spp m avium aeromonas spp p aeruginosa acanthamoeba spp and h vermiformis in the effluent of ar were 5 52 102 2 64 101 1 86 101 4 22 4 60 101 2 97 102 4 92 101 gene copies ml respectively clearly the abundances of most ops decreased sharply with increasing phosphate addition finally living mycobacterium spp m avium aeromonas spp p aeruginosa and h vermiformis were not observed and the living legionella spp and acanthamoeba spp stabilized at 3 18 102 and 2 67 102 gene copies ml respectively co culturing with an amoeba host has been confirmed to increase the virulence of legionella pneumophila wang et al 2013b in particular intracellular replication within an amoeba host such as acanthamoeba is now thought to be a prerequisite for legionella growth in oligotrophic environments wang et al 2013b moreover the regrowth amount effluent influent of ops in the ar as determined by pma qpcr decreased remarkably with increasing phosphate fig s8 therefore the results above indicated that the occurrences of most ops were suppressed in the effluent of ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition whether they existed in bulk water or on the suspended biofilm however in the attached biofilms on cast iron pipes the phosphate addition did not make a significant difference in the levels of the above ops except m avium fig 4b according to previous reports ops share a number of characteristics such as disinfectant resistance biofilm formation and growth in amoebae which directly contribute to their survival growth and persistence in dwdss falkinham 2015 since the biofilms were composed of microbial cells embedded in a gelatinous matrix of eps which could provide protection for the microbial community from adverse environmental conditions wang et al 2013b liu et al 2016 the occurrence of ops stabilization in attached biofilms on cast iron pipes was probably due to the stable status of ops enclosed in eps similarly it was deduced that the eps from suspended biofilms in bulk water was possibly largely destroyed by the high residual chlorine concentration due to phosphate addition resulting in the inactivation of most live ops in the ar 3 5 characterization of extracellular polymeric substances in dwdss generally eps enclosed microbial colonies can be detached from attached biofilms on pipes to the bulk water in dwdss especially in the presence of chlorine xue et al 2012 fig 5 a shows the contents and constituents of eps extracted from suspended biofilms in the bulk water of ar with different phosphate addition levels clearly 0 6 mg l phosphate addition resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of suspended eps including humic substances protein pn and polysaccharide ps moreover the protein polysaccharide pn ps ratio decreased sharply from 1 28 to 0 45 as phosphate addition increased from 0 to 0 6 mg l polysaccharides have a high molecular weight and the long carbon backbone and side chains of polysaccharides can provide numerous binding sites for bacterial cells yuan et al 2011 as expected the lowest biomass was in accordance with the lowest ps amount in the effluent of the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition fig 3a in addition it is well known that the protein content has a much stronger correlation than the polysaccharide content with the surface properties such as the hydrophobicity and surface charge of microbial aggregates liao et al 2001 a lower pn ps ratio in the eps corresponded to a more negatively charged surface and lower hydrophobicity thereby inhibiting the formation of stable microbial flocs fig 5b shows the zeta potentials of the suspended eps and their flocculating efficiency in kaolin suspension the zeta potentials and flocculating efficiencies both followed the order of 0 mg l 0 3 mg l 0 6 mg l which was consistent with the trend of the pn ps ratio therefore the eps from suspended biofilms with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition exhibited the weakest microbial cell aggregation capability furthermore ftir analysis was conducted to identify the functional groups present in eps extracted from suspended biofilms in the bulk water of ar fig 6 in the eps sample without phosphate addition the peaks at 2852 and 2918 cm 1 were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric ch2 stretching vibrations of alkyl chains respectively yin et al 2015 the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 was attributable to the co stretching vibrations of peptide groups in proteins and was observed to be present in all of the eps samples and the amide ii band 1600 1500 cm 1 was due to n h bending and cn stretching vibrations in proteins the bands at 1475 cm 1 and 1412 cm 1 corresponded to ch bending and cn stretching vibrations of proteins respectively which may arise from the amide ii band you et al 2015 the signal from 1150 to 1000 cm 1 was assigned to polysaccharides with phosphate addition 0 3 and 0 6 mg l the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 for proteins and the signal for polysaccharides barely changed indicating that the proteins and polysaccharides were stable fractions of eps liu et al 2013 it is noteworthy to mention however that the amide ii band 1600 1500 cm 1 disappeared with phosphate addition indicating that the structure of the proteins was partially broken more detailed information on the protein secondary structures was obtained from the derivative spectra which were subsequently employed in curve fitting of the original spectra presented in fig 6 it can be observed that the amide i band in the spectrum for suspended eps with no phosphate addition contained aggregated strands 1620 1610 cm 1 β sheets 1630 1624 cm 1 random coils 1645 1637 cm 1 α helices 1657 1649 cm 1 3 turn helices 1672 1664 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheets 1688 1681 cm 1 moreover β sheets were dominant 31 63 among these secondary structures in the amide i band which was consistent with many other studies yin et al 2015 han et al 2017 with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l the proportion of β sheets and α helices in all secondary structures decreased sharply from 31 63 to 18 61 and 23 85 to 0 respectively indicating that the secondary structures of β sheets and α helices were degraded significantly under 0 6 mg l phosphate addition by contrast random coils gradually became dominant 48 32 in the amide i band with phosphate addition increasing to 0 6 mg l table s5 previous studies have reported that aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation of bacterial cells could be enhanced by certain protein secondary structures especially β sheets and α helices while they were depressed by random coils yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 jia et al 2017 therefore the capacities of aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation of bacterial cells suspended in bulk water of ar were weakest with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition in addition eem spectra of the three eps samples are shown in fig s9 two main peaks can be easily identified from the fluorescence spectra of all three samples namely ex em 310 320 430 440 nm peak a and ex em 225 235 430 440 nm peak b peak a and peak b were related to humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances respectively as shown in table s6 the intensities of peak a and peak b decreased remarkably with increasing phosphate concentration which was consistent with the decrease in the total amount of eps fig 5a it was reported that a blue shift of peaks was associated with a reduction in the number of aromatic rings or a decrease in the conjugated bonds in a chain structure valencia et al 2013 in this study the blue shift of peak b was probably related to the destruction of the amide ii band and the secondary structure of β sheets and α helices further verifying the conclusions above table s6 therefore the eps from suspended biofilms with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition exhibited the weakest microbial cell aggregation capability and hydrophobicity resulting in a sharp decrease in chlorine resistance ability xue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the results were attributed to the efficient inactivation of most living ops in the ar for the attached biofilms on cast iron pipes the amount of eps decreased constantly with increasing phosphate addition moreover the decline of ps was much higher than that of pn resulting in the pn ps ratio increasing sharply from 0 51 to 1 20 fig s10a consistently the zeta potential and flocculating efficiency increased from 11 16 mv to 6 99 mv and from 18 24 to 28 31 respectively indicating weaker electrostatic repulsion and stronger flocculation capability with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition fig s10b consequently the hydrophobicity and flocculating efficiency of microbial flocs attached on cast iron pipes increased greatly causing stronger resistance to the chlorine in water which could also contribute to decline of chlorine consumption and dbps formation fig 2 nevertheless the structure and composition of attached eps did not change greatly under all phosphate addition conditions as seen by comparing ftir spectra fig s11a the results verified that the structure of eps from the attached biofilms was hardly changed by the higher residual chlorine concentration 1 629 mg l though the amount of eps decreased remarkably in the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition it has been verified that the penetration rate of chlorine into biofilms is slower than the reaction rate with the organic matter in the surface layers of biofilms causing relatively stable eps within the attached biofilms stewart et al 2001 liu et al 2016 in addition the proportion of β sheets and α helices increased remarkably from 16 83 to 28 22 and from 25 53 to 37 17 respectively fig s11 and table s7 the inner hydrophobic groups could be more easily exposed due to the β sheets secondary structure in extracellular protein resulting in the surface of the bacterial community showing higher hydrophobicity jia et al 2017 in addition it could enhance cell to cell aggregation and form stronger microbial colonies making them undergo further adaptation to life in large aggregates according to eem spectra peak c ex em 215 225 290 295 was only detected in the attached eps with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition fig s12 and table s8 based on previous studies peak c has been attributed to protein like substances yang et al 2008 which was further proof of the protective role of protein known as the major constituent of biofilms eps could also adsorb and store nutrients for biofilm growth to resist low organic concentrations xue et al 2012 the above results verified that the characteristics of attached eps protected bacterial cells in attached biofilms including ops from being influenced by the chlorine in bulk water the microbial carbon content including pure bacterial cells and the eps containing polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids has been recently shown to act as a precursor for dbps formation in dwdss abokifa et al 2016 hence the detachment of biomass from the biofilm matrix can contribute to the total budget of dbps precursors as noted by abokifa et al the contribution of bacteria derived precursors was found to reach a maximum of 12 of the total formed thms consequently lower microbial biomass and eps content could also contribute to lower chlorine consumption and dbps concentration in the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition 4 conclusions bac and dwdss are equivalent to two sequential microbial systems the efficiency of the bac filter was enhanced by adding phosphate to raw water resulting in lower organic carbon concentrations and lower amounts of dbps precursors moreover the total amount of suspended eps in bulk water in the ar including humic substances protein and polysaccharide decreased remarkably causing higher chlorine residual and lower dbps concentrations in the suspended eps the amide ii band disappeared and the pn ps ratio decreased remarkably due to 0 6 mg l phosphate addition indicating the destruction of protein and a decrease in hydrophobicity moreover for the protein secondary structures of suspended eps β sheets and α helices were degraded while the random coils increased sharply inhibiting microbial aggregation and hence weakening their chlorine resistance capability therefore phosphate enhanced o3 bac is a good approach to inhibit dbps formation and ops occurrence in dwdss

19567,the effects of ozone biologically activated carbon o3 bac treatment with various phosphate doses 0 0 3 or 0 6 mg l were investigated on the formation of disinfection by products dbps and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens ops in drinking water distribution systems dwdss simulated by annular reactors ars it was found that the lowest dbps and the highest inactivation of ops such as mycobacterium spp mycobacterium avium aeromonas spp pseudomonas aeruginosa and hartmanella vermiformis occurred in the effluent of the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition based on the results of different characterization techniques for the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate enhanced o3 bac treatment dissolved organic carbon in the influent exhibited the lowest concentration and most stable fraction due to the improved biodegradation effect moreover the total amount of suspended extracellular polymeric substances eps in the bulk water of the ar decreased greatly resulting in the lowest chlorine consumption and dbps formation in the ar in fourier transform infrared spectra of the suspended eps the amide ii band 1600 1500 cm 1 disappeared and the protein polysaccharide ratio decreased remarkably indicating the destruction of protein and a decrease in hydrophobicity moreover β sheets and α helices in the protein secondary structures were degraded while the random coils increased sharply as phosphate addition increased to 0 6 mg l inhibiting microbial aggregation and hence weakening the chlorine resistance capability thus most of the ops in suspended biofilms were more easily inactivated by residual chlorine resulting in the lowest ops occurrence in the effluent of the ar our findings indicated that enhancing the efficiency of the bac filter by adding phosphate is a promising method for improving water quality in dwdss graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products opportunistic pathogens bac extracellular polymeric substances biofilm drinking water distribution systems 1 introduction the presence of microbial based problems in drinking water distribution systems dwdss is an emerging area of concern generally the water at consumers taps has a lower quality than the finished water after treatment due to bacterial regrowth and proliferation of opportunistic pathogens ops wang et al 2013a 2013b to reduce risk chlorine has been widely used as a microbial disinfectant since early in the 20th century because of its relatively low cost and ability to maintain a disinfectant residual throughout dwdss however the disinfection of drinking water hailed as a public health triumph of the twentieth century brings more daunting human challenges chlorine can react with natural organic matter nom to produce harmful disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas which are suspected human carcinogens richardson et al 2007 moreover nom from human origin or natural processes is present in all natural waters and plays an important role in many natural and engineered processes kwon et al 2005 therefore chlorine that was introduced to inhibit microbial regrowth unexpectedly created new human carcinogen dbps in addition dwdss actually harbor an astounding array of microorganisms although disinfection can reduce the abundance of bacteria efficiently recently ops such as mycobacterium avium pseudomonas aeruginosa hartmanella vermiformis and acanthamoeba spp have become emerging public health concerns due to a large number of outbreaks and elevated clinical cases wang et al 2012 2013b in contrast to fecal source pathogens which are easily killed by disinfectants opportunistic pathogens naturally colonize persist and multiply in dwdss even in the presence of high disinfectant residuals because they share a large number of characteristics such as biofilm formation extracellular polymeric substance eps production disinfectant resistance growth in amoebae growth at low organic carbon concentrations etc wang et al 2012 falkinham 2015 in dwds more than 90 of the total biomass can be found growing attached to pipe walls with only up to 5 of the biomass freely suspended in the bulk water liu et al 2014 actually the biofilms in dwdss are divided into suspended biofilms in bulk water and attached biofilms on pipe walls xue et al 2012 liu et al 2014 since eps known as the major constituent of biofilms have many roles including enhancing bacterial adhesion and providing a protective barrier as well as adsorbing and storing nutrients for biofilm growth chlorine disinfection is problematic and ineffective for the control of ops in dwdss the combination of ozonation and biologically activated carbon bac technology prior to chlorination has been widely used as the main advanced drinking water treatment process to improve water quality treguer et al 2010 it has been proven that ozone has the capacity to oxidize dbp precursors de vera et al 2015 inactivate resistant pathogenic microorganisms von gunten 2003 reduce refractory dissolved organic carbon doc and generate more biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc which promotes biological growth in the downstream distribution system or bac surface treguer et al 2010 granular activated carbon gac was originally designed to remove organic matter by adsorption due to its large specific surface area and well developed pore structure buchanan et al 2008 simpson 2008 bac filtration has proven to be able to significantly remove natural organic matter and disinfection by product precursors simpson 2008 eliminate pathogenic microorganisms hijnen et al 2010 and play a primary role in shaping the distribution system bacterial community pinto et al 2012 wang et al 2013a however previous studies focused only on improving nom removal and changing the microbial properties in bac filters by some efforts such as optimizing the ozone dose treguer et al 2010 changing the flow direction han et al 2013 adding phosphate etc nishijima et al 1997 it has been overlooked that enhancing nom removal in the bac filter may limit microbial regrowth in dwdss due to the fact that more assimilable organic carbon aoc which would serve as a growth substrate for downstream microbes can be removed before flowing into dwdss meanwhile a change in the microorganisms detached from a bac filter could influence the bacterial community in dwdss because bac filters and dwdss are equivalent to two sequential microbiological systems to our knowledge few studies have been conducted thus far to characterize the effect of enhanced o3 bac filters on water quality microbial regrowth and even ops occurrence in downstream dwdss in this study the effect of the enhancement of o3 bac filters by phosphate addition on dbps and ops occurrence in dwdss was investigated the characterization and structure of doc was clarified by specific ultraviolet absorbance high performance size exclusion chromatography and excitation emission matrix fluorescence measurements meanwhile we conducted extracellular polymeric substance eps extraction and analysis to characterize the condition of suspended biofilms and attached biofilms heterotrophic plate counts hpc to quantify viable heterotrophic bacterial populations and propidium monoazide pma treatment coupled with quantitative real time pcr pma qpcr to enumerate the total living bacteria and opportunistic pathogens in dwdss a preliminary effort to identify a correlation among water quality microbial biomass and eps in dwdss was undertaken 2 materials and methods 2 1

dwdss wang et al 2017b in the ars there were two concentric glass cylinders and a rotating inner drum with 20 cast iron coupons mounted on it each coupon had an exposed surface area of 17 5 cm2 for biofilm growth prior to use the surface of each cast iron coupon was polished with 1200 grit emery paper rinsed with sterile deionized water and degreased in acetone followed by sterilizing in 70 ethanol for 10 h and then dried aseptically in a laminar flow cabinet the ars were established in parallel and operated at a rotational speed of 50 rpm which translated to a shear stress of 0 25 n m2 corresponding to a flow rate of around 0 3 m sec in a 100 mm diameter smooth pipe the hydraulic retention time hrt for the reactors was 6 h which translated to a total flow rate of 2 8 ml min into the ars the schematic of the experimental set up is shown in fig s1 first raw water was treated with o3 at a contact time of 12 min followed by bac adsorption in acrylic columns with diameter and height of 4 cm and 20 cm at room temperature approximately 25 c the empty bed contact time and loading rate were 20 min and 11 94 m h ozonation was carried out with a 6 l reactor approximately 46 mg of gaseous o3 l 1 oxygen ozone was bubbled into the reactor through the porous plate at the reactor bottom at a flow rate of 200 ml min 1 the transferred ozone dose in the water was approximately 2 18 mg o3 mg doc the bac units were backwashed using ultrapure water one time a month the water flowing from bac units was treated with free chlorine to represent disinfection chlorine was dosed from a stock solution of naclo different amounts of naclo were dosed into the water to maintain similar influent residual chlorine concentrations about 2 8 mg cl2 l during the whole experiment the chlorine concentration was measured using a hanna spectrophotometer hi93711 italy huang et al 2017 moreover before flowing into the ars the chlorine treated waters entered an organic glass vessel as a simulated reservoir with 4 h hrt to maintain sufficient contact between water and disinfectant the calculated concentration time value ct10 was around 65 28 mg min l finally the effluent of the reservoir flowed into the ars before phosphate addition the three ars had been run under the same conditions for around one year as shown in fig s2 the corrosion rate effluent total iron and doc concentrations of the three ars gradually stabilized at similar values during approximately one year running time indicating that they were close to steady state the corrosion rate was represented by the corrosion current density obtained from tafel analysis of polarization curves for the tested coupons from the three ars zhu et al 2014 then the raw waters flowing into the three ars were directly treated with phosphate addition at three different concentrations for about 6 months prior to the first water and biofilm sampling event in order to guarantee data replication another two samplings were performed 3 months and six months after the first sampling the average of all the detected experimental data from the three replications was calculated error bars represented the relative standard deviation rsd from the average of three replications n 3 the concentrations of the phosphate dosed in this study were 0 0 3 and 0 6 mg na2hpo4 l fig s1 which is by regulation the maximum allowable level jang et al 2012 2 3 water quality analysis the tested raw water table s1 was treated by chemical precipitation and flocculation polyaluminium chloride and ferric sulfate settling and sand filtration prior to entering the biologically activated carbon filter in a drinking water treatment plant in northern china using surface water as source water doc and uv254 were analyzed via a total organic carbon analyzer phoenix 8000 tekmar dohrmann usa and uv spectroscopy respectively after filtration hijnen et al 2018 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva was calculated by multiplying the ratio of uv254 to doc by a conversion factor of 100 the procedure for bdoc determination followed a technique using sand fixed bacteria escobar and randall 1999 the content of aoc was analyzed by previous developed methods van der kooij et al 1982 thms and haas were analyzed according to usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 respectively the molecular weight of the nom fraction was obtained via high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec in a system equipped with a thermo biobasic sec 300 column 150 mm 7 8 mm thermo scientific and uv detector 1200 agilent excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem measurements were conducted using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent technologies differences of water quality parameters were analyzed using analysis of variance anova with a significance threshold of α 0 05 the detailed information on the aoc thms haas and eem measurement process is shown in supporting information 2 4 pma treatment dna extraction and quantitative real time pcr pma is a dye that penetrates membrane damaged cells and binds with dna the pma bound dna cannot be amplified in the following qpcr therefore pma is often applied to quantify the dna from live bacteria and characterize the changes of viable bacterial communities chiao et al 2014 gensberger et al 2014 the water and biofilm samples were subjected to pma treatment by incubating the polycarbonate membrane filters in 50 μm pma solution fig s3 s4 the detailed process of pma treatment of samples and determination of optimal pma concentration are given in the supporting information after pma treatment dna extraction was conducted using a fastdna spin kit for soil following the manufacturer s instructions all dna samples were stored at 80 c for future use quantitative pcr qpcr targeting 16s rrna and opportunistic pathogens was performed via a 7300 qpcr system and the 7300 system sds software applied biosystems the detailed analysis procedures are described in table s2 2 5 eps extraction and analysis the eps of the biofilm samples were extracted using the ultrasonication centrifugation method developed by previous researchers zhang et al 2014 han et al 2017 the detailed extraction procedures are described in supporting information the polysaccharide content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard the humic substances and the protein content were determined using a modified lowry method with humic acid and bovine serum albumin as standards the zeta potentials of different eps samples were determined using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk the contributions of different eps samples to the aggregation of particles were obtained by performing an eps flocculating test the flocculating efficiency was determined in a kaolin suspension zhang et al 2014 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem results were combined for further component analysis of eps yin et al 2015 jia et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of organic matter in water fig 1 shows the changes in the mean doc bdoc and aoc concentrations in different waters with different concentrations of phosphate added with no phosphate addition doc in raw water rw was around 1 87 mg l increasing slightly to 2 16 mg l after ozonation which possibly came from the desorption of doc adsorbed on suspended particles after oxidation by ozone subsequently the doc decreased sharply after bac filtration and chlorination and finally decreased to 0 74 mg l in the effluent of the ar it was reported that high molecular weight mw organic matter can be converted into lower mw organic matter with fracture of partial chemical bond due to chlorination resulting in a slight decrease of doc tian et al 2013 wang et al 2017a moreover chlorine produces aoc from doc which stimulates microbial growth as chlorine concentration subsides fisher et al 2017 in the simulated reservoir before ars fig s1 the remaining chlorine resistant bacteria could contribute to a large portion of doc removal by biodegradation during 4 h retention time hence the doc concentration of the influent of ars was lower than that of o3 bac filtered water obfw with increasing phosphate addition the doc in rw and ozonated water ow barely exhibited any change however much more doc removal 66 35 0 6 mg l phosphate addition was observed in the bac filter consequently doc in the influent and effluent of the ar decreased to around 0 6 mg l the same change processes were observed for bdoc and aoc concentrations fig 1b and c the removal of bdoc increased from 32 64 to 95 16 and the removal of aoc increased from 61 80 to 88 04 in the bac filter with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l which was attributed to a better biodegradation effect the results above indicated that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient on the growth of bacteria in the bac filter sang et al 2003 in contrast the consumption of doc and especially bdoc and aoc in the ar decreased sharply with increasing phosphate addition doc particularly bdoc and aoc has been considered as one of the main factors for microbial regrowth in dwdss escobar et al 2001 these results indicated that with phosphate addition the biodegradation role of the bac filter was enhanced resulting in more bdoc being consumed while the regrowth of microorganisms in dwdss was inhibited by maintaining a relatively low organic carbon level 3 2 chlorine consumption and disinfection by products formation to maintain the same residual chlorine concentration about 2 8 mg l in the influent of the ar the required initial chlorine dosage concentration increased markedly from 3 34 to 4 24 mg l with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l fig 2 a within 4 h reaction time in a simulated reservoir before the ars fig s1 generally chlorine consumption is mainly due to reaction with doc and inactivation of microorganisms doc in the obfw was lowest with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition therefore the increase of the chlorine dose mainly contributed to the inactivation of microorganisms because phosphate addition could enhance microbial growth and metabolic activity in the bac filter nishijima et al 1997 conversely in the effluent of the ar the chlorine concentration increased sharply from 0 073 to 1 629 mg l with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l indicating a decline of chlorine consumption in the ar within 6 h hydraulic retention time with higher phosphate addition which was consistent with the lower doc consumption in the ar fig 1a with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l the concentration of thms in influent decreased from 19 55 μg l to 8 52 μg l and that in effluent decreased from 10 94 μg l to 5 67 μg l fig 2b the same change process was observed for haas fig 2c indicating that phosphate addition could inhibit dbps formation remarkably as expected the amount of chlorinated dbps was much higher than brominated dbps because there was little bromide around 0 05 mg l in the raw water table s1 and the decreases of thms and haas accompanying phosphate addition were mainly attributed to chloroform chcl3 and chloroacetic acid mcaa in addition the decreases in thms and haas from influent to effluent in the ars were mainly attributed to biodegradation wang et al 2017b c suva has proven to be the most widely used parameter for predicting dbps formation potential in drinking water treatment hua et al 2015 as expected the suva of obfw decreased from 0 2643 to 0 1639 l mg m with increasing phosphate addition table s3 indicating that the aromaticity of doc in ow was degraded markedly in the bac filter comparison of the molecular weight mw distribution of obfw showed that a larger amount of the high mw hmw fraction 500 da was removed in the bac filter due to phosphate addition fig s5 the hmw fraction of the doc was the major source of uv254 which generally includes the precursors of dbps gan et al 2013 concurrently the low mw lmw fraction 500 da of doc increased as phosphate addition increased from 0 to 0 6 mg l moreover the lmw fraction of doc after biodegradation represented metabolic products of microorganisms living in the bac han et al 2013 the results above indicated that higher dbps precursors removal in the bac filter might be attributed to removal of the hmw fraction of doc in addition eem measurements were used to characterize doc fractions defined into five regions including aromatic proteins ap regions i and ii ex 250 nm em 350 nm fulvic acid like substances fa region iii ex 250 nm em 350 nm soluble microbial byproduct like substances smp region iv ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and humic acid like substances ha region v ex 280 nm em 380 nm yang et al 2008 two main peaks can be easily identified from the fluorescence spectra of obfw without phosphate addition namely ex em 305 325 420 440 nm peak a and ex em 220 235 405 445 nm peak b fig s6 the two peaks were assigned to ha substances peak a and fa substances peak b which are major precursors of dbps formation it was observed that peak a and peak b declined greatly with phosphate addition moreover the fluorescence regional integration fri method was employed to quantify the variations of fluorescent organic species from the five regions under different levels of phosphate addition fig s7 and fri parameters are shown in table s4 obviously phosphate addition resulted in remarkable decreases of ap fa and ha in the bac filter the aromatic proteins are also important precursors of dbps formation and can be easily decomposed by the microorganisms yang et al 2015 over all doc and especially dbps precursors were significantly removed in the bac filter with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition due to an enhanced biodegradation effect resulting in lower chlorine consumption and dbps formation in downstream dwdss 3 3 total bacteria and heterotrophic plate count as shown in fig 3 with increasing phosphate addition the 16s rrna gene copy numbers in rw and ow increased slightly and that in obfw increased greatly from 8 73 104 to 1 36 106 gene copies ml because addition of phosphorus to the raw water can stimulate bacteria growth and improve the biodegradation of organic substances in biological systems sang et al 2003 li et al 2010 correspondingly 0 6 mg l phosphate addition resulted in the lowest level of 16s rrna genes after chlorination in the influents of the ar indicating that most of the bacteria in the obfw were inactivated by chlorine in a previous work the addition of phosphate did increase the disinfection efficiency of chlorine liu et al 2016 which probably contributed to the decline of microbial biomass due to chlorine similarly the 16s rrna genes maintained the lowest level 1 07 103 gene copies ml in the effluent of the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition verifying the lowered microbial metabolic activity in the dwdss the results of hpc in water were in agreement with 16s rrna gene copy numbers except that hpc in ow and influents of the ar were not detected due to the strong sterilization effects of ozonation and chlorination fig 3b most notably 0 6 mg l phosphate addition resulted in aoc and hpc in effluents decreasing to 6 97 μg l and 0 fig 1c respectively which were consistent with the previous conclusion that the regrowth of heterotrophic bacteria could be prevented with an aoc concentration of 10 μg l or less van der kooij 1992 therefore the lower microbial biomass was in accordance with the lower chlorine consumption in the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition in contrast as phosphate addition increased the 16s rrna gene copy numbers and hpc in biofilms on the cast iron pipe decreased slightly from 1 22 109 to 4 84 108 gene copies g and from 2 31 105 to 1 08 104 cfu cm2 respectively indicating the relative stability of the biofilms fig 3c the results indicated that the microbial biomass in the bulk water of the ar was more easily influenced by external factors compared to the attached biofilms on the cast iron pipes the increased resistance of bacteria within attached biofilms was in part due to the eps matrix produced which can retain and store compounds including nutrients to provide food reserves for microbial members during a starvation period as well as bind and inactivate disinfectants such as chlorine liu et al 2016 3 4 opportunistic pathogens occurrence the living legionella spp mycobacterium spp m avium aeromonas spp pseudomonas aeruginosa acanthamoeba spp and hartmanella vermiformis in the effluents and attached biofilms on cast iron pipe were enumerated using pma qpcr fig 4 with no phosphate addition the gene copy numbers of living legionella spp mycobacterium spp m avium aeromonas spp p aeruginosa acanthamoeba spp and h vermiformis in the effluent of ar were 5 52 102 2 64 101 1 86 101 4 22 4 60 101 2 97 102 4 92 101 gene copies ml respectively clearly the abundances of most ops decreased sharply with increasing phosphate addition finally living mycobacterium spp m avium aeromonas spp p aeruginosa and h vermiformis were not observed and the living legionella spp and acanthamoeba spp stabilized at 3 18 102 and 2 67 102 gene copies ml respectively co culturing with an amoeba host has been confirmed to increase the virulence of legionella pneumophila wang et al 2013b in particular intracellular replication within an amoeba host such as acanthamoeba is now thought to be a prerequisite for legionella growth in oligotrophic environments wang et al 2013b moreover the regrowth amount effluent influent of ops in the ar as determined by pma qpcr decreased remarkably with increasing phosphate fig s8 therefore the results above indicated that the occurrences of most ops were suppressed in the effluent of ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition whether they existed in bulk water or on the suspended biofilm however in the attached biofilms on cast iron pipes the phosphate addition did not make a significant difference in the levels of the above ops except m avium fig 4b according to previous reports ops share a number of characteristics such as disinfectant resistance biofilm formation and growth in amoebae which directly contribute to their survival growth and persistence in dwdss falkinham 2015 since the biofilms were composed of microbial cells embedded in a gelatinous matrix of eps which could provide protection for the microbial community from adverse environmental conditions wang et al 2013b liu et al 2016 the occurrence of ops stabilization in attached biofilms on cast iron pipes was probably due to the stable status of ops enclosed in eps similarly it was deduced that the eps from suspended biofilms in bulk water was possibly largely destroyed by the high residual chlorine concentration due to phosphate addition resulting in the inactivation of most live ops in the ar 3 5 characterization of extracellular polymeric substances in dwdss generally eps enclosed microbial colonies can be detached from attached biofilms on pipes to the bulk water in dwdss especially in the presence of chlorine xue et al 2012 fig 5 a shows the contents and constituents of eps extracted from suspended biofilms in the bulk water of ar with different phosphate addition levels clearly 0 6 mg l phosphate addition resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of suspended eps including humic substances protein pn and polysaccharide ps moreover the protein polysaccharide pn ps ratio decreased sharply from 1 28 to 0 45 as phosphate addition increased from 0 to 0 6 mg l polysaccharides have a high molecular weight and the long carbon backbone and side chains of polysaccharides can provide numerous binding sites for bacterial cells yuan et al 2011 as expected the lowest biomass was in accordance with the lowest ps amount in the effluent of the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition fig 3a in addition it is well known that the protein content has a much stronger correlation than the polysaccharide content with the surface properties such as the hydrophobicity and surface charge of microbial aggregates liao et al 2001 a lower pn ps ratio in the eps corresponded to a more negatively charged surface and lower hydrophobicity thereby inhibiting the formation of stable microbial flocs fig 5b shows the zeta potentials of the suspended eps and their flocculating efficiency in kaolin suspension the zeta potentials and flocculating efficiencies both followed the order of 0 mg l 0 3 mg l 0 6 mg l which was consistent with the trend of the pn ps ratio therefore the eps from suspended biofilms with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition exhibited the weakest microbial cell aggregation capability furthermore ftir analysis was conducted to identify the functional groups present in eps extracted from suspended biofilms in the bulk water of ar fig 6 in the eps sample without phosphate addition the peaks at 2852 and 2918 cm 1 were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric ch2 stretching vibrations of alkyl chains respectively yin et al 2015 the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 was attributable to the co stretching vibrations of peptide groups in proteins and was observed to be present in all of the eps samples and the amide ii band 1600 1500 cm 1 was due to n h bending and cn stretching vibrations in proteins the bands at 1475 cm 1 and 1412 cm 1 corresponded to ch bending and cn stretching vibrations of proteins respectively which may arise from the amide ii band you et al 2015 the signal from 1150 to 1000 cm 1 was assigned to polysaccharides with phosphate addition 0 3 and 0 6 mg l the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 for proteins and the signal for polysaccharides barely changed indicating that the proteins and polysaccharides were stable fractions of eps liu et al 2013 it is noteworthy to mention however that the amide ii band 1600 1500 cm 1 disappeared with phosphate addition indicating that the structure of the proteins was partially broken more detailed information on the protein secondary structures was obtained from the derivative spectra which were subsequently employed in curve fitting of the original spectra presented in fig 6 it can be observed that the amide i band in the spectrum for suspended eps with no phosphate addition contained aggregated strands 1620 1610 cm 1 β sheets 1630 1624 cm 1 random coils 1645 1637 cm 1 α helices 1657 1649 cm 1 3 turn helices 1672 1664 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheets 1688 1681 cm 1 moreover β sheets were dominant 31 63 among these secondary structures in the amide i band which was consistent with many other studies yin et al 2015 han et al 2017 with phosphate addition increasing from 0 to 0 6 mg l the proportion of β sheets and α helices in all secondary structures decreased sharply from 31 63 to 18 61 and 23 85 to 0 respectively indicating that the secondary structures of β sheets and α helices were degraded significantly under 0 6 mg l phosphate addition by contrast random coils gradually became dominant 48 32 in the amide i band with phosphate addition increasing to 0 6 mg l table s5 previous studies have reported that aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation of bacterial cells could be enhanced by certain protein secondary structures especially β sheets and α helices while they were depressed by random coils yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 jia et al 2017 therefore the capacities of aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation of bacterial cells suspended in bulk water of ar were weakest with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition in addition eem spectra of the three eps samples are shown in fig s9 two main peaks can be easily identified from the fluorescence spectra of all three samples namely ex em 310 320 430 440 nm peak a and ex em 225 235 430 440 nm peak b peak a and peak b were related to humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances respectively as shown in table s6 the intensities of peak a and peak b decreased remarkably with increasing phosphate concentration which was consistent with the decrease in the total amount of eps fig 5a it was reported that a blue shift of peaks was associated with a reduction in the number of aromatic rings or a decrease in the conjugated bonds in a chain structure valencia et al 2013 in this study the blue shift of peak b was probably related to the destruction of the amide ii band and the secondary structure of β sheets and α helices further verifying the conclusions above table s6 therefore the eps from suspended biofilms with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition exhibited the weakest microbial cell aggregation capability and hydrophobicity resulting in a sharp decrease in chlorine resistance ability xue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the results were attributed to the efficient inactivation of most living ops in the ar for the attached biofilms on cast iron pipes the amount of eps decreased constantly with increasing phosphate addition moreover the decline of ps was much higher than that of pn resulting in the pn ps ratio increasing sharply from 0 51 to 1 20 fig s10a consistently the zeta potential and flocculating efficiency increased from 11 16 mv to 6 99 mv and from 18 24 to 28 31 respectively indicating weaker electrostatic repulsion and stronger flocculation capability with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition fig s10b consequently the hydrophobicity and flocculating efficiency of microbial flocs attached on cast iron pipes increased greatly causing stronger resistance to the chlorine in water which could also contribute to decline of chlorine consumption and dbps formation fig 2 nevertheless the structure and composition of attached eps did not change greatly under all phosphate addition conditions as seen by comparing ftir spectra fig s11a the results verified that the structure of eps from the attached biofilms was hardly changed by the higher residual chlorine concentration 1 629 mg l though the amount of eps decreased remarkably in the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition it has been verified that the penetration rate of chlorine into biofilms is slower than the reaction rate with the organic matter in the surface layers of biofilms causing relatively stable eps within the attached biofilms stewart et al 2001 liu et al 2016 in addition the proportion of β sheets and α helices increased remarkably from 16 83 to 28 22 and from 25 53 to 37 17 respectively fig s11 and table s7 the inner hydrophobic groups could be more easily exposed due to the β sheets secondary structure in extracellular protein resulting in the surface of the bacterial community showing higher hydrophobicity jia et al 2017 in addition it could enhance cell to cell aggregation and form stronger microbial colonies making them undergo further adaptation to life in large aggregates according to eem spectra peak c ex em 215 225 290 295 was only detected in the attached eps with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition fig s12 and table s8 based on previous studies peak c has been attributed to protein like substances yang et al 2008 which was further proof of the protective role of protein known as the major constituent of biofilms eps could also adsorb and store nutrients for biofilm growth to resist low organic concentrations xue et al 2012 the above results verified that the characteristics of attached eps protected bacterial cells in attached biofilms including ops from being influenced by the chlorine in bulk water the microbial carbon content including pure bacterial cells and the eps containing polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids has been recently shown to act as a precursor for dbps formation in dwdss abokifa et al 2016 hence the detachment of biomass from the biofilm matrix can contribute to the total budget of dbps precursors as noted by abokifa et al the contribution of bacteria derived precursors was found to reach a maximum of 12 of the total formed thms consequently lower microbial biomass and eps content could also contribute to lower chlorine consumption and dbps concentration in the ar with 0 6 mg l phosphate addition 4 conclusions bac and dwdss are equivalent to two sequential microbial systems the efficiency of the bac filter was enhanced by adding phosphate to raw water resulting in lower organic carbon concentrations and lower amounts of dbps precursors moreover the total amount of suspended eps in bulk water in the ar including humic substances protein and polysaccharide decreased remarkably causing higher chlorine residual and lower dbps concentrations in the suspended eps the amide ii band disappeared and the pn ps ratio decreased remarkably due to 0 6 mg l phosphate addition indicating the destruction of protein and a decrease in hydrophobicity moreover for the protein secondary structures of suspended eps β sheets and α helices were degraded while the random coils increased sharply inhibiting microbial aggregation and hence weakening their chlorine resistance capability therefore phosphate enhanced o3 bac is a good approach to inhibit dbps formation and ops occurrence in dwdss

19568,knowledge of leveraging biomass characteristics is essential for achieving a microbial community with a desired structure to optimize anaerobic bioreactor performance this study investigates the successive granule transformations in a high rate anaerobic system with intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in organic loading rates olrs by establishing the correlations between the granule microstructures and reactor operating parameters over the course of a 196 day lab scale trial the granules were visualized in various stages using scanning electron microscopy and digital image processing was applied for further quantifying their surface properties correlation analyses revealed that irregularities of the granule microstructures surface properties specific surface area and pore volume emerged at stage 4 when the olr was 13 31 kg cod m3 day and in stage 5 in the absence of gas sparging the loading ratio substrate surface loading to upward velocity was identified to be the main parameter controlling the granule transformations and the surface structures were classified into three categories for further interpretation confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses showed that the granule core started to hollow out from stage 4 it is also found that a rough granule surface helped accelerate the growth of the granular diameter under gas sparging overall this study not only establish quantitative correlations between the granules microstructures and reactor operating parameters but also shed light on the use of intermittent gas sparging to control the surface properties of anaerobic granules in high rate anaerobic bioreactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic bioreactor uasb intermittent gas sparging granular sludge biofilm surface characterization 1 introduction anaerobic biotechnology offers a way to convert waste to resources and is thus important for the sustainable management of organic matter in wastewater treatment verstraete et al 2005 the successful development of high rate anaerobic bioreactors not only leads to a lower cost and a smaller footprint but more importantly provides people with great incentives to contribute towards a more sustainable society zeeman and lettinga 1999 batstone and keller 2001 verstraete 2013 in recent years the upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor has continued to gain attention for use in treating various types of wastewater mainly because it generates anaerobic granular sludge leading to a highly efficient and compact system with low energy requirements lettinga et al 1980 schmidt and ahring 1996 van lier et al 2015 when treating domestic sewage the conventional uasb reactor is able to achieve an organic loading rate olr of 2 0 3 5 kg cod m3 day chernicharo et al 2015 however if the olr is increased to 8 64 kg cod m3 day which is significantly greater than the typical loading biofilm would continue to grow unchecked on the granule surfaces and the sludge bed would eventually clog up tsui et al 2016 in most cases an improved degree of mixing is able to prevent sludge bed clogging and leading to a more efficient substrate transport from the bulk liquid phase to the microbial aggregates biofilm phase as the main variable in the design of uasb reactors upward velocity must be sufficiently maintained at all times to ensure an adequate degree of liquid shear mixing for an effective sludge bed expansion pereboom and vereijken 1994 lettinga et al 2001 however upward velocity cannot be too high either or else there would be unwanted hydraulic short circuiting and unnecessary biomass washout van haandel et al 2006 the range of upward velocities and thus the possible extent of shear that would prevent sludge bed clogging in uasb reactors are in fact quite narrow the design issue becomes even more challenging when dealing with dilute organic wastewater with lower gas production rates to locate a possible solution tsui et al 2016 have recently introduced intermittent gas sparging 10 s per hour to regularly disaggregate sludge and provide an alternative source of shear for suppressing biofilm overgrowth on granule surfaces while also enhancing external mass transfer they have successfully achieved a much higher olr of 13 31 kg cod m3 day in a sulfidogenic anaerobic uasb without clogging up the sludge bed for an operation period of 146 days gas sparging may open up a window of opportunity for developing more robust energy efficient uasb or other types of anaerobic biotechnologies provided that the following key questions are answered what is the role of gas sparging in anaerobic granular systems specifically besides causing overgrowth biofilm to disintegrate how does gas sparging affect the surface properties of granules verstraete 2013 on the other hand although anaerobic granules have been researched extensively most studies are either focused on single stage granule characterization or have only monitored the early self immobilization process while ignoring the continuous transformations in the granule microstructure investigations are needed to reveal how such transformations affect the surface properties of granules as well as what the critical functions of intermittent gas sparging are the findings will inform new methods for developing high rate anaerobic bioreactors in general several types of anaerobic granules exist and they are applied in the areas of methane gas production hydrogen fermentation biogenic sulfide production for the removal and recovery of heavy metal alphenaar 1994 noike and mizuno 2000 lewis 2010 and mainstream saline sewage treatment wang et al 2009 tsui et al 2016 among the various types of granules sulfidogenic granules are the only ones to generate a dissolved metabolite sulfide at neutral ph while other types of granules produce methane and hydrogen gas as their major energy yields the fact that little to no gas is produced in sulfidogenic environments offers a unique opportunity to examine the role of gas sparging with minimal interference therefore the main objective of this study is to investigate granule transformations in a super high rate sulfidogenic system with an olr of 13 31 kg cod m3 day through establishing the correlation between the surface properties and microstructures of granules the result contributes to a better understanding of anaerobic granules so that relevant approaches or the ranges of important variables can be identified to control the granule quality in any high rate anaerobic bioreactor 2 methods

efficiency with incoming wastewater as well as metabolic mass transfer and overall biological activity lemaire et al 2008 over a 196 day period of lab scale reactor operation the changes in operating conditions which are shown in table 1 resulted in a continuous transformation of the granular morphology fig 1 in general from stages 1 4 the granules displayed rough surfaces with porous channel like structures of a spherical or elliptical shape fig 1a b c d while the granules in stage 5 showed a more compact structure with a smoother surface fig 1e for comparison fig 1f shows a sem image of a granule by hao et al 2013 who applied higher upward velocity through effluent recirculation for liquid shear but without gas sparging figs 2 and 5 establish the correlations among sludge settleability svi5 particle size specific surface area and pore volume moreover the data from the first four stages were best fit correlated in simple exponential equations and forecasted the trend in stage 5 to reveal any patterns or discrepancies in the trends 3 1 1 sludge settleability and surface structures svi5 is an important indicator for biomass retention and effluent turbidity in upflow type bioreactors factors that influence drag in the settling process include particle size specific gravity particle deformability surface roughness and pore volume coulson et al 1993 johnson et al 1996 liu et al 2005 for the five stages the specific gravity of sulfidogenic granules was determined to vary from 1 065 to 1 072 and the ash content was between 15 and 20 where a significant accumulation of the inorganics was not observed starting from an initial value of 31 ml g svi5 continued to improve with a strong correlation with the average particle size and achieved a minimum of 15 ml g with an average granular diameter of 873 μm in this study despite the abrupt changes in the microstructure both the surface area and the pore volume in stages 4 and 5 fig 5a and b svi5 was barely affected as can be seen in fig 2a from the perspective of reactor operation simplicity the average particle size alone seems to be sufficient for predicting svi5 regardless of the granular morphology or other physical characteristics grotenhuis et al 1991 discovered a positive relationship between the influent substrate concentration and the anaerobic granule diameter anaerobic granules are commonly observed in uasb for high organic strength 1 kg cod l wastewater and when effluent recirculation creates high liquid upward velocity while granulation with a weak hydrodynamic shear force is rarely reported alphenaar et al 1993 o flaherty et al 1997 by treating wastewater of 330 mg cod l under intermittent gas sparging this study confirms the importance of substrate loading but additionally develops analysis and establishes quantitative correlations fig 2b and c shows that the substrate loading on the granule surface and the upward velocity inside the reactor are positively correlated with the increase in granule diameter in all stages a larger substrate surface loading and a higher upward velocity both resulted in a higher rate of increase in the granule diameter fig 2d the sulfidogenic granules grew from an initial average diameter of 366 μm in stage 1 863 μm at the end of stage 4 and remained almost unchanged throughout stage 5 in contrast hao et al 2013 operated a steady state sulfidogenic system without intermittent gas sparging for more than 500 days which resulted in sulfidogenic granules with smooth surfaces and only small changes in size over time the average diameter ranged between 400 and 500 μm besides the substrate surface loading and upward velocity the surfaces roughness also seems to play a pivotal role in the fast and continuous growth in the granular diameter compared with attached growth system very little emphasis has been given to the surface structure of suspended sludge or self immobilized granules more often than not the analysis relies on qualitative approaches such as microscope imaging as in fig 1 for descriptions which may sometimes be difficult for others to interpret and thus prevent comparisons to be made to investigate the surface structure and its transformation the surface topographies of granules in each stage were first visualized in fig 3 according to iso 4287 2000 standard structural assessment was then applied for quantification of the surface topographies making use of roughness waviness and form error parameters table 2 such quantitative analysis has been intensively adopted in surface engineering batalha and stipkovic filho 2001 grzesik and wanat 2005 bruzzone et al 2008 it can be seen from table 2 and fig 3 that surface roughness rq and ra decreased continuously from stages 1 5 to measure the symmetry of the profile about the mean line rsk can better reflect the occasional deep valleys or high peaks than either ra or rq gadelmawla et al 2002 profiles with a larger number of deep valleys result in a more negative rsk in table 2 the continuous increase in rsk suggests that deep valleys on the granule surface gradually became less deep over time especially from stage 3 to stage 5 moreover the rv values show that the deepest valley also became more shallow overall based on the values of surface roughness rq and ra and the presence of deep valleys rsk and rv three distinct granule surface structures were observed in stages 1 3 stage 4 and stage 5 gjaltema et al 1997 studied the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and particle collisions on biofilm formation where an increased surface roughness of the carriers could promote biofilm accumulation similarly in self immobilized granular sludge systems the rough surfaces of granules in stages 1 4 might also benefit biomass accumulation by improving svi5 granules with smooth surfaces such as those in stage 5 in this study and those in the study by hao et al 2013 tend to remain relatively unchanged in terms of their diameter throughout operation despite the similarity between the surface topographies seen in stage 4 fig 3d and the study by hao et al 2013 fig 3f the quantitative analysis characterizes fig 3f having much smaller values in rq ra and less negative rv and it should thereby be more similar to the case of stage 5 but a positive rsk fig 3e table 2 profiles with valleys filled in or high peaks would have a positive rsk fig 4 thus when gas sparging was applied intermittently the granules tended to have rougher surfaces higher rq and ra values with deeper valleys more negative rv values considering that those deep valleys are channels being responsible for metabolic mass transport the changes in the surface structure in stages 4 and 5 raise concerns about substrate transfer resistance toward the granule core in the next section the granule microstructure and relevant control variables are further investigated and discussed 3 1 2 variable affecting the granule microstructure the two macroscopic structural parameters of specific surface area and pore volume are commonly used to characterize the overall granule microstructure and quantify its contact efficiencies with incoming wastewater and metabolic mass transfer di iaconi et al 2006 lemaire et al 2008 in the correlation analysis fig 5 a and b irregularities were observed in the pore volume in stages 4 and 5 and the specific surface area in stage 5 tsui et al 2016 reported that under a high olr of 8 64 kg cod m3 day and in the absence of gas sparging a biofilm formed on the granule surface which may explain the deviations of the specific surface area and pore volume in stage 5 however it is worth noting that the granule pore volume also underwent irregular changes in stage 4 as shown in fig 5b and it deviated differently in trend compared with stage 5 the biofilm morphology in aerobic systems is largely influenced by the surface substrate loading and the detachment forces applied tijhuis et al 1996 kwok et al 1998 in this granular uasb system the detachment forces were mainly derived from the liquid shear due to upward velocity and the liquid shear as well as granule abrasion due to gas sparging so for greater insight fig 5c and d correlate a variable of loading ratio a ratio of surface substrate loading to upward velocity where the latter represents the detachment forces for the study of their combined effect on the granule specific surface area and porosity in this way the granule transformations in the five stages can be further interpreted based on the schematic representation of the three biofilm categories described by van loosdrecht et al 1995 fig 6 in stages 1 3 with a loading ratio of 29 8 39 2 kg cod m2 d per m d upflow under a relatively low surface substrate loading and extra shear detachment forces promoted by gas sparging the granule surfaces mostly showed a heterogeneous and porous structure in stage 4 loading ratio of 49 5 kg cod m2 d per m d upflow in which the surface substrate loading was further increased the surface started to yield smooth and strong biofilms in stage 5 in the absence of gas sparging for shear promotion the dominance of the low detachment forces in the loading ratio led to smoother granule surfaces with a loading ratio of 21 8 kg cod m2 d per m d upflow and biofilm overgrowth as has also been observed by tsui et al 2016 in granular biofilm the adhesion of cells to the substratum is an irreversible process schmidt and ahring 1996 hulshoff et al 2004 identifying the ranges of the loading ratio with or without intermittent gas sparging could be helpful in developing an advanced warning index for operational decision making e g applying gas sparging adjusting organic loading rate or upward velocity etc before the granule quality and hence the uasb performance starts to deteriorate under high shear and high loading conditions granules of the type seen in stage 4 are usually formed with the characteristics of high strength and low porosity zheng and yu 2007 lemaire et al 2008 the main concern is that the low porosity for large aggregates is related to the increase in diffusion limitation where the restrictive transport of the substrate and metabolic products is conjectured to occur within granules and may further lead to a less diverse microbial community morgenroth and wilderer 2000 di iaconi et al 2006 elenter et al 2007 generally it would be desired to maintain a porous granule surface structure as to reduce the chance of diffusion limitation tsui et al 2016 reported that the external mass transfer resistance caused by overgrowth biofilm resulted in substrate limitations inside the granule core followed by an endogenous respiration of the hydrolyzed extracellular polymeric substances eps leading to hollow granules the interactive 3d surface plot in fig 7 reveal gradually disappearing channels for diffusion in granules over stages in fact with the increasing diffusion resistance from stages 3 4 substrate depleted regions might have already started forming in these stages resulting in tiny localized hollows inside the granule core before biofilm overgrowth even came into play at stage 5 the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm images of sectioned granules in stages 4 and 5 were further processed in 8 bit and 1 bit color to visualize the hollows inside the granule core fig 8 the tiny hollows in fig 8a could be responsible for the irregular increase in granule pore volume in stage 4 seen in fig 5b interestingly regardless of the extra increase in pore volume the granule porosity in stage 4 still showed a decrease in fig 3d under a high substrate surface loading rate the rapid growth in granule diameter in stage 4 likely caused most of the change in overall porosity compared with sulfidogenic granules special attention must be paid in methanogenic and hydrogen fermentation systems because any accumulation of gaseous metabolites inside the granule core can trigger granule lifting flotation and eventually an unwanted biomass washout 3 2 intermittent mixing in anaerobic system in full scale practice of anaerobic digestion the energy demand for mixing could significantly contribute up to 54 to the total energy demand of plant dachs and rehm 2006 by changing the mixing mode power reduction of 29 could be achieved if intermittent mixing in the basis of 2 hr mixing and 1 hr pausing was applied instead of continuous mixing kowalczyk 2012 meanwhile several studies reported that intermittent mixing could enhance performance of anaerobic digestion when compared to continuous one lin and pearce 1991 stroot et al 2001 kaparaju et al 2008 rico et al 2011 this study adopted a much shorter mixing duration of 10 s hr which was previously identified by authors experimental observation as the minimal time for effective disaggregation of clogged granules as well as improving its external mass transfer in a high rate uasb while an effluent recirculation is mainly used for solid recycling tsui et al 2016 however the practical selection of intermittent mixing duration in each individual setup should also be dependent on multiple factors such as specific purpose type of mixing applied reactor geometry influent type total solid content etc under the use of intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in olrs this study further identified the parameter of loading ratio in uasb on top of existing variables so far have been reported and the ratio highly correlates with granule surface properties even though the narrow range of gas flow rate optimization seems to have a little effect on overall mixing dead zone reduction in anaerobic system karim et al 2004 attention should still be given to define some critical values of the gas sparging loading that would transit the mixing pattern from one regime to another if related optimization or scale up work is needed it is because such unintentional changes in mixing pattern might significantly alter liquid shear and degree of particle attrition thereby the total surface shear developed on granules which has been shown to greatly affect granule surface structures in this study otherwise the thoughtless changes may pose difficulty or even prejudice for subsequent analysis comparison and conclusion 4 conclusions over the course of a 196 day lab scale trial granules in a high rate sulfidogenic system continued to show transformations of their surface properties and microstructure quantitative analyses were conducted to identify factors affecting the transformations under the influence of intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in olr the following conclusions are made digital image processing and knowledge of surface engineering make the exercise of comparing different granule surface structures more objective by enabling the quantification of surface topographies given that granules have rough surfaces a high substrate surface loading and a high upward velocity can lead to a rapid and continuous growth in granule size to improve biomass retention the loading ratio i e the ratio of substrate surface loading rate and the upflow velocity where the latter represents the applied detachment forces is the parameter controlling the surface properties and microstructure of the granules in high rate granular uasb besides relying on upward velocity for shear to control the loading ratio intermittent gas sparging could also be an effective way to promote liquid shear and granule attrition to alter the surface structure

19568,knowledge of leveraging biomass characteristics is essential for achieving a microbial community with a desired structure to optimize anaerobic bioreactor performance this study investigates the successive granule transformations in a high rate anaerobic system with intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in organic loading rates olrs by establishing the correlations between the granule microstructures and reactor operating parameters over the course of a 196 day lab scale trial the granules were visualized in various stages using scanning electron microscopy and digital image processing was applied for further quantifying their surface properties correlation analyses revealed that irregularities of the granule microstructures surface properties specific surface area and pore volume emerged at stage 4 when the olr was 13 31 kg cod m3 day and in stage 5 in the absence of gas sparging the loading ratio substrate surface loading to upward velocity was identified to be the main parameter controlling the granule transformations and the surface structures were classified into three categories for further interpretation confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses showed that the granule core started to hollow out from stage 4 it is also found that a rough granule surface helped accelerate the growth of the granular diameter under gas sparging overall this study not only establish quantitative correlations between the granules microstructures and reactor operating parameters but also shed light on the use of intermittent gas sparging to control the surface properties of anaerobic granules in high rate anaerobic bioreactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic bioreactor uasb intermittent gas sparging granular sludge biofilm surface characterization 1 introduction anaerobic biotechnology offers a way to convert waste to resources and is thus important for the sustainable management of organic matter in wastewater treatment verstraete et al 2005 the successful development of high rate anaerobic bioreactors not only leads to a lower cost and a smaller footprint but more importantly provides people with great incentives to contribute towards a more sustainable society zeeman and lettinga 1999 batstone and keller 2001 verstraete 2013 in recent years the upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor has continued to gain attention for use in treating various types of wastewater mainly because it generates anaerobic granular sludge leading to a highly efficient and compact system with low energy requirements lettinga et al 1980 schmidt and ahring 1996 van lier et al 2015 when treating domestic sewage the conventional uasb reactor is able to achieve an organic loading rate olr of 2 0 3 5 kg cod m3 day chernicharo et al 2015 however if the olr is increased to 8 64 kg cod m3 day which is significantly greater than the typical loading biofilm would continue to grow unchecked on the granule surfaces and the sludge bed would eventually clog up tsui et al 2016 in most cases an improved degree of mixing is able to prevent sludge bed clogging and leading to a more efficient substrate transport from the bulk liquid phase to the microbial aggregates biofilm phase as the main variable in the design of uasb reactors upward velocity must be sufficiently maintained at all times to ensure an adequate degree of liquid shear mixing for an effective sludge bed expansion pereboom and vereijken 1994 lettinga et al 2001 however upward velocity cannot be too high either or else there would be unwanted hydraulic short circuiting and unnecessary biomass washout van haandel et al 2006 the range of upward velocities and thus the possible extent of shear that would prevent sludge bed clogging in uasb reactors are in fact quite narrow the design issue becomes even more challenging when dealing with dilute organic wastewater with lower gas production rates to locate a possible solution tsui et al 2016 have recently introduced intermittent gas sparging 10 s per hour to regularly disaggregate sludge and provide an alternative source of shear for suppressing biofilm overgrowth on granule surfaces while also enhancing external mass transfer they have successfully achieved a much higher olr of 13 31 kg cod m3 day in a sulfidogenic anaerobic uasb without clogging up the sludge bed for an operation period of 146 days gas sparging may open up a window of opportunity for developing more robust energy efficient uasb or other types of anaerobic biotechnologies provided that the following key questions are answered what is the role of gas sparging in anaerobic granular systems specifically besides causing overgrowth biofilm to disintegrate how does gas sparging affect the surface properties of granules verstraete 2013 on the other hand although anaerobic granules have been researched extensively most studies are either focused on single stage granule characterization or have only monitored the early self immobilization process while ignoring the continuous transformations in the granule microstructure investigations are needed to reveal how such transformations affect the surface properties of granules as well as what the critical functions of intermittent gas sparging are the findings will inform new methods for developing high rate anaerobic bioreactors in general several types of anaerobic granules exist and they are applied in the areas of methane gas production hydrogen fermentation biogenic sulfide production for the removal and recovery of heavy metal alphenaar 1994 noike and mizuno 2000 lewis 2010 and mainstream saline sewage treatment wang et al 2009 tsui et al 2016 among the various types of granules sulfidogenic granules are the only ones to generate a dissolved metabolite sulfide at neutral ph while other types of granules produce methane and hydrogen gas as their major energy yields the fact that little to no gas is produced in sulfidogenic environments offers a unique opportunity to examine the role of gas sparging with minimal interference therefore the main objective of this study is to investigate granule transformations in a super high rate sulfidogenic system with an olr of 13 31 kg cod m3 day through establishing the correlation between the surface properties and microstructures of granules the result contributes to a better understanding of anaerobic granules so that relevant approaches or the ranges of important variables can be identified to control the granule quality in any high rate anaerobic bioreactor 2 methods

terms of their diameter throughout operation despite the similarity between the surface topographies seen in stage 4 fig 3d and the study by hao et al 2013 fig 3f the quantitative analysis characterizes fig 3f having much smaller values in rq ra and less negative rv and it should thereby be more similar to the case of stage 5 but a positive rsk fig 3e table 2 profiles with valleys filled in or high peaks would have a positive rsk fig 4 thus when gas sparging was applied intermittently the granules tended to have rougher surfaces higher rq and ra values with deeper valleys more negative rv values considering that those deep valleys are channels being responsible for metabolic mass transport the changes in the surface structure in stages 4 and 5 raise concerns about substrate transfer resistance toward the granule core in the next section the granule microstructure and relevant control variables are further investigated and discussed 3 1 2 variable affecting the granule microstructure the two macroscopic structural parameters of specific surface area and pore volume are commonly used to characterize the overall granule microstructure and quantify its contact efficiencies with incoming wastewater and metabolic mass transfer di iaconi et al 2006 lemaire et al 2008 in the correlation analysis fig 5 a and b irregularities were observed in the pore volume in stages 4 and 5 and the specific surface area in stage 5 tsui et al 2016 reported that under a high olr of 8 64 kg cod m3 day and in the absence of gas sparging a biofilm formed on the granule surface which may explain the deviations of the specific surface area and pore volume in stage 5 however it is worth noting that the granule pore volume also underwent irregular changes in stage 4 as shown in fig 5b and it deviated differently in trend compared with stage 5 the biofilm morphology in aerobic systems is largely influenced by the surface substrate loading and the detachment forces applied tijhuis et al 1996 kwok et al 1998 in this granular uasb system the detachment forces were mainly derived from the liquid shear due to upward velocity and the liquid shear as well as granule abrasion due to gas sparging so for greater insight fig 5c and d correlate a variable of loading ratio a ratio of surface substrate loading to upward velocity where the latter represents the detachment forces for the study of their combined effect on the granule specific surface area and porosity in this way the granule transformations in the five stages can be further interpreted based on the schematic representation of the three biofilm categories described by van loosdrecht et al 1995 fig 6 in stages 1 3 with a loading ratio of 29 8 39 2 kg cod m2 d per m d upflow under a relatively low surface substrate loading and extra shear detachment forces promoted by gas sparging the granule surfaces mostly showed a heterogeneous and porous structure in stage 4 loading ratio of 49 5 kg cod m2 d per m d upflow in which the surface substrate loading was further increased the surface started to yield smooth and strong biofilms in stage 5 in the absence of gas sparging for shear promotion the dominance of the low detachment forces in the loading ratio led to smoother granule surfaces with a loading ratio of 21 8 kg cod m2 d per m d upflow and biofilm overgrowth as has also been observed by tsui et al 2016 in granular biofilm the adhesion of cells to the substratum is an irreversible process schmidt and ahring 1996 hulshoff et al 2004 identifying the ranges of the loading ratio with or without intermittent gas sparging could be helpful in developing an advanced warning index for operational decision making e g applying gas sparging adjusting organic loading rate or upward velocity etc before the granule quality and hence the uasb performance starts to deteriorate under high shear and high loading conditions granules of the type seen in stage 4 are usually formed with the characteristics of high strength and low porosity zheng and yu 2007 lemaire et al 2008 the main concern is that the low porosity for large aggregates is related to the increase in diffusion limitation where the restrictive transport of the substrate and metabolic products is conjectured to occur within granules and may further lead to a less diverse microbial community morgenroth and wilderer 2000 di iaconi et al 2006 elenter et al 2007 generally it would be desired to maintain a porous granule surface structure as to reduce the chance of diffusion limitation tsui et al 2016 reported that the external mass transfer resistance caused by overgrowth biofilm resulted in substrate limitations inside the granule core followed by an endogenous respiration of the hydrolyzed extracellular polymeric substances eps leading to hollow granules the interactive 3d surface plot in fig 7 reveal gradually disappearing channels for diffusion in granules over stages in fact with the increasing diffusion resistance from stages 3 4 substrate depleted regions might have already started forming in these stages resulting in tiny localized hollows inside the granule core before biofilm overgrowth even came into play at stage 5 the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm images of sectioned granules in stages 4 and 5 were further processed in 8 bit and 1 bit color to visualize the hollows inside the granule core fig 8 the tiny hollows in fig 8a could be responsible for the irregular increase in granule pore volume in stage 4 seen in fig 5b interestingly regardless of the extra increase in pore volume the granule porosity in stage 4 still showed a decrease in fig 3d under a high substrate surface loading rate the rapid growth in granule diameter in stage 4 likely caused most of the change in overall porosity compared with sulfidogenic granules special attention must be paid in methanogenic and hydrogen fermentation systems because any accumulation of gaseous metabolites inside the granule core can trigger granule lifting flotation and eventually an unwanted biomass washout 3 2 intermittent mixing in anaerobic system in full scale practice of anaerobic digestion the energy demand for mixing could significantly contribute up to 54 to the total energy demand of plant dachs and rehm 2006 by changing the mixing mode power reduction of 29 could be achieved if intermittent mixing in the basis of 2 hr mixing and 1 hr pausing was applied instead of continuous mixing kowalczyk 2012 meanwhile several studies reported that intermittent mixing could enhance performance of anaerobic digestion when compared to continuous one lin and pearce 1991 stroot et al 2001 kaparaju et al 2008 rico et al 2011 this study adopted a much shorter mixing duration of 10 s hr which was previously identified by authors experimental observation as the minimal time for effective disaggregation of clogged granules as well as improving its external mass transfer in a high rate uasb while an effluent recirculation is mainly used for solid recycling tsui et al 2016 however the practical selection of intermittent mixing duration in each individual setup should also be dependent on multiple factors such as specific purpose type of mixing applied reactor geometry influent type total solid content etc under the use of intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in olrs this study further identified the parameter of loading ratio in uasb on top of existing variables so far have been reported and the ratio highly correlates with granule surface properties even though the narrow range of gas flow rate optimization seems to have a little effect on overall mixing dead zone reduction in anaerobic system karim et al 2004 attention should still be given to define some critical values of the gas sparging loading that would transit the mixing pattern from one regime to another if related optimization or scale up work is needed it is because such unintentional changes in mixing pattern might significantly alter liquid shear and degree of particle attrition thereby the total surface shear developed on granules which has been shown to greatly affect granule surface structures in this study otherwise the thoughtless changes may pose difficulty or even prejudice for subsequent analysis comparison and conclusion 4 conclusions over the course of a 196 day lab scale trial granules in a high rate sulfidogenic system continued to show transformations of their surface properties and microstructure quantitative analyses were conducted to identify factors affecting the transformations under the influence of intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in olr the following conclusions are made digital image processing and knowledge of surface engineering make the exercise of comparing different granule surface structures more objective by enabling the quantification of surface topographies given that granules have rough surfaces a high substrate surface loading and a high upward velocity can lead to a rapid and continuous growth in granule size to improve biomass retention the loading ratio i e the ratio of substrate surface loading rate and the upflow velocity where the latter represents the applied detachment forces is the parameter controlling the surface properties and microstructure of the granules in high rate granular uasb besides relying on upward velocity for shear to control the loading ratio intermittent gas sparging could also be an effective way to promote liquid shear and granule attrition to alter the surface structure

19569,decades of studies on endocrine disruption have suggested the need to manage the release of key estrogens from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp however the proposed thresholds are below the detection limits of most routine chemical analysis thereby restricting the ability of watershed managers to assess the environmental exposure appropriately in this study we demonstrated the utility of a mechanistic model to address the data gaps on estrogen exposure concentrations of the prominent estrogenic contaminants in wastewaters estrone estradiol and ethinylestradiol were simulated in the grand river in southern ontario canada for nine years including a period when major wwtp upgrades occurred the predicted concentrations expressed as total estrogenicity e2 equivalent concentrations were contrasted to a key estrogenic response i e intersex in rainbow darter etheostoma caeruleum a wild sentinel fish species a predicted total estrogenicity in the river of 10 ng l e2 equivalents was associated with high intersex incidence and severity whereas concentrations 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents were associated with minimal intersex expression exposure to a predicted river concentration of 0 4 ng l e2 equivalents the environmental quality standard eqs proposed by the european union for estradiol was associated with 34 95 ci 30 38 intersex incidence and a very low severity score of 0 6 95 ci 0 5 0 7 this exposure is not predicted to cause adverse effects in rainbow darter the analyses completed in this study were only based on the predicted presence of three major estrogens e1 e2 ee2 so caution must be exercised when interpreting the results nevertheless this study illustrates the use of models for exposure assessment especially when measured data are not available graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogen intersex water quality model exposure assessment wastewater rainbow darter 1 introduction the exposure of fish to endocrine active chemicals eacs has been shown globally to have deleterious consequences for reproductive health brian et al 2005 kime 1999 nash et al 2004 tyler and routledge 1998 one of the most frequent observations is the feminization of male fish with vitellogenin induction production of estrogen dependent protein and intersex ova testis as examples of changes reported jordan et al 2016 progress in analytical chemistry has enabled the detection of eacs at very low concentrations benotti et al 2008 carballa et al 2004 lópez roldán et al 2010 however the proposed environmental quality standards eqs by the european union eu for some eacs such as estradiol e2 and ethinylestradiol ee2 are only 0 4 and 0 035 ng l respectively european commission 2012 these concentrations are below the current detection limits of most routine analytical methods as a result some studies have utilized biological assessments i e bioassays to quantify exposures to eacs busch et al 2016 coleman et al 2004 escher et al 2013 marinho et al 2013 neale et al 2017 ohko et al 2002 bioassay techniques examine the combined biological activity in a mixture and can provide an indication of the potential responses in organisms exposed to complex mixtures without identifying the specific chemicals despite the considerable chemical and bioanalytical monitoring of eacs in effluents and receiving environments worldwide agunbiade and moodley 2016 escher et al 2013 leusch et al 2014 servos et al 2005 xu et al 2007 there is still limited information to assess the spatial or temporal concentrations of eacs in receiving waters where technical challenges e g detection limits and cost are important considerations roig and d aco 2016 in the absence of such data the modeling of environmental systems can be used as an alternative approach to characterize fish exposure to eacs roig and d aco 2016 zhang et al 2015 models can be applied to evaluate current and future mitigation strategies for eliminating the target compounds through scenario testing kehrein et al 2015 and assist in the design of effective monitoring programs roig and d aco 2016 furthermore models can be employed to assess the potential relationship of stressor concentrations to observed effects in the wild jobling et al 2006 2009 numerous models have already been developed in recent years to predict the fate and transport of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products arlos et al 2014 balaam et al 2010 dale et al 2015 grechi et al 2016 kehrein et al 2015 field investigations on the incidence and severity of intersex in male rainbow darter etheostoma caeruleum in the grand river watershed southern ontario have been ongoing since 2007 hicks et al 2017 the presence of severe intersex in rainbow darter has been linked to poor reproductive success fuzzen et al 2015 with potential negative impacts on the fish population however a direct link between the exposure to specific compounds and intersex is very difficult to establish as the effluent composition and fate of eacs in the receiving environments are complex the potential of natural estrogens e2 and estrone e1 and synthetic estrogens ee2 to cause endocrine disruption in fish has dominated many laboratory and field studies in recent years corcoran et al 2010 desbrow et al 1998 jobling et al 2006 kidd et al 2007 palace et al 2009 the effects directed analysis eda of the two major wwtp effluents in the grand river suggested that the total estrogenicity was mainly contributed by e1 e2 and ee2 based on a receptor agonist screen assay yeast estrogen screen yes arlos et al 2018 however there are many other eacs entering the receiving environment e g estrogens from diffuse sources that can interfere with the endocrine function in fish some responses including intersex may also be caused by androgen antagonists jobling et al 2009 or chemicals such as metformin antidiabetic that may work through mechanisms other than receptor binding niemuth and klaper 2015 also the fate of other eacs may be correlated with the estrogen exposure making it difficult to generate direct cause and effect relationships the current modeling work is focused on three major estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 identified in the prior eda as important contributors to the total estrogenicity in the effluents in this study the concentrations of e1 e2 and ee2 were simulated along the grand river where the widespread presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products has been documented arlos et al 2015 the modeled reach also includes areas that were previously predicted via models to have elevated levels of estrogens grill et al 2016 hosseini et al 2012 a major upgrade in one of the treatment plants kitchener wwtp has resulted in major effluent quality changes during the study period but minimal data in effluents were available especially during the pre upgrade period when the environmental exposure to municipal wastewater derived estrogens was likely at its peak this scenario additionally provides a unique opportunity to apply models that can help assess the efficiency of wwtp upgrades the overall goals of this study were to estimate the concentrations of select eacs e1 e2 and ee2 in the grand river through mechanistic water quality modeling and to determine whether the exposure to these key estrogens is consistent with the observed responses intersex in wild fish 2 methodology 2 1 study site the grand river watershed in southern ontario 6 800 km2 drains into lake erie and is inhabited by close to 1 million people in addition to the non point sources from numerous agricultural activities 70 of total land use the watershed also receives inputs from 30 wwtps the grand river has also been extensively investigated for several biological effect endpoints on fish health since the late 2000s bahamonde et al 2014 fuzzen et al 2015 2016 tanna et al 2013 tetreault et al 2011 2013 in this study 80 km of the grand river was modeled starting below a regulated water reservoir shand dam to an area that is 2 km above the grand and speed river confluence fig 1 a this section captures both agriculture and urban gradients in the watershed and incorporates the inputs from two major waterloo and kitchener and two smaller elora and fergus wwtps table s1 in 2012 kitchener wwtp underwent major process upgrades including improved aeration nitrification and replacement of chlorination de chlorination with uv effluent disinfection 2 2 modeling strategy the water quality modeling included three separate components 1 source 2 transport and fate and 3 effects as outlined in fig s1 the source modeling predicted the effluent concentrations from the target wwtps and was completed as detailed in arlos et al 2018 the transport and fate component simulated the distribution of target eacs in the study area and was completed using a mechanistic water quality model finally the effects component evaluated the potential relationship between the predicted river concentrations derived from the transport and fate model component and field recorded intersex conditions due to their relatively high site fidelity hicks and servos 2017 and constant exposure to wwtp effluents throughout their life cycle data on rainbow darter were considered suitable for quantifying the exposure impacts the intersex data for rainbow darter at nine sites in the grand river watershed 2007 2015 were based on the same samples compiled by hicks et al 2017 and were used in the concentration response regression analysis see section 2 5 the selection of these sites is also described in detail in hicks et al 2017 a similar approach to arlos et al 2014 was employed to simulate estrogen concentrations in the grand river the water quality simulation program developed by the us environmental protection agency wasp version 7 3 was used as the model platform this model was employed in a recent study to describe the distribution of frequently detected pharmaceuticals with varying physical chemical properties downstream of the kitchener wwtp 10 km reach arlos et al 2014 the model has already been calibrated for compounds that spanned the properties of those examined in the current study and was found to provide robust mechanistic predictions of pharmaceutical fate and transport arlos et al 2014 the following major steps were completed to predict the river concentrations discretization of the river network simulation of river transport mechanisms i e advection testing of the transport processes using a tracer compound chloride and integration of organic compound modeling through the addition of significant in river fate mechanisms e g biodegradation and photolysis the first three steps were iterative in nature and were deemed as crucial in establishing a baseline model that accurately represented the mathematical structure of the system as detailed in arlos et al 2014 the final discretized model involved 50 segments fig 1b described in the supplementary material section a and only the aqueous phase was considered in the discretization i e no bottom segments included advection is the primary transport process in rivers and is driven by water flows the internal flows in wasp under the kinematic wave flow option were propagated using manning s equation section b supplementary material the model was initially set up to describe water movement and its accuracy was cross checked against the measured hydro geometry data such as water levels and flows measured water level data for segments 12 21 and 37 were used for river transport calibration the finalized input parameters associated with the hydro geometry and river transport are found in the supplementary material table s2 in addition to examining the model s accuracy in simulating water movement via measured water levels and flows chloride was also used to determine the non reactive constituent transport within the network since chloride is conservative its assimilation in the river system is achieved via advection significant point sources of chloride in the river network come from urbanized creeks laurel and schneider creeks and the wwtps observed chloride values at segments 12 21 23 32 42 and 50 were used to calibrate the transport component and were taken from ontario s provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn database https www ontario ca data provincial stream water quality monitoring network and previous monitoring work completed in the central grand river tables s3 and s4 2 2 1 modeling of target estrogens the major inputs of target estrogens into the studied reach of the grand river were from the four wwtps although the tributaries one river and four creeks included in the modeled network may be receiving small amounts of estrogens from the surrounding agricultural lands i e municipal biosolids manure applications no chemical and bioassay data for the study period are currently available to confirm this however data collected in the upstream reaches above segment 12 where the land use is predominantly agricultural suggest low occurrence and severity of intersex hicks et al 2017 hence it was assumed that the tributaries have negligible contributions of e1 e2 and ee2 the concentration profiles of the target estrogens in the kitchener and waterloo wwtp effluents were developed previously arlos et al 2018 that employed population demographics usage and excretion rates and removal through the plant to estimate effluent data a similar approach was completed for the effluents from the fergus and elora wwtps the simulation of the transport and fate of the target eacs was completed by initially considering them as conservative contaminants transport as a primary mechanism and sequentially adding fate mechanisms responsible for their distribution in the aquatic environment chapra 1997 suggested that sorption is minimal when the target compounds have log octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow that are 4 5 and the suspended solids concentrations range from 1 50 mg l the estrogens examined in this study have log kow s that are 4 5 and the average suspended solids concentration in various segments ranged from 6 to 23 mg l pwqmn data set from 2007 2014 hence sorption was not simulated in this study this decision was consistent with the results of jurgens et al 1999 who reported that estrogens in riverine environments are typically present in the dissolved phase in addition a previous modeling study by arlos et al 2014 in the grand river found that inclusion of sorption had a minimal effect on the fate of modeled pharmaceuticals with log kow of 3 2 4 8 hence only biodegradation and photolysis were deemed to be significant in the assimilation of estrogens in the aquatic environment balaam et al 2010 jürgens et al 2002 lin and reinhard 2005 biodegradation and photolysis processes were initialized using the approach described by arlos et al 2014 briefly biodegradation was modeled as a first order reaction and literature derived kinetic rate constants table s5 were initially corrected based on the river temperature table s6 temperature profiles for each segment were taken from the nearest pwqmn site photolysis was also modeled as a first order reaction and the range of rate constants was derived from the literature table s5 2 3 model performance measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d and the percent bias pbias have been recommended by moriasi et al 2007 table s7 and were used to evaluate the performance of the transport portion of the model these criteria however are not applicable for simulations that have a limited number of measured data points 50 hence a statistical test was completed using either the pearson or spearman correlation tests measured vs predicted depending on the normality of the datasets table s8 an additional performance test using the percent difference criteria donigian 2002 was also used to support the results of the correlation analysis table s7 these quantitative performance measures were used in addition to a subjective comparison of observed and predicted time series plots data were not available for all target estrogens in the modeled reach hence the quality of the simulation of estrogen fate mechanisms was conducted by assessing the effects portion of the model described in the next section 2 4 linking predicted concentrations exposure and intersex conditions effects although feminization of male rainbow darter has been observed at different levels of biological organization in the grand river fuzzen et al 2016 hicks et al 2017 marjan et al 2017 tetreault et al 2011 intersex has been found to be the most consistently observed endpoint related to reproductive changes downstream of municipal wwtps fuzzen et al 2016 hicks et al 2017 evaluated intersex incidence and severity from 2007 to 2015 at nine different sites fig 1 including periods prior to and after the kitchener wwtp upgrades this dataset was used as the primary biological response to which the predicted eac concentrations were compared it was assumed that the critical window of exposure for adult rainbow darter occurs during their gonadal recrudescence late spring to summer hicks et al 2017 hence the predicted river eac concentrations from june to august were averaged at the nine sites to provide the exposure conditions for the fish collected in the fall sampling event of that same year and the spring sampling of the following year the predicted concentrations were converted to total estrogenicity eeq using 1 e e q c i e e f i where c i is the predicted concentration e e f i is the estrogenicity equivalency factor that describes the potency of the estrogens relative to e2 eefs of 0 3 1 and 1 23 were used for e1 e2 and ee2 respectively the eefs reflect the average potency associated with the yeast estrogen screen yes assay as compiled by jarošová et al 2014 however there may be differences in the responses of different species and endpoints for each of the estrogens of interest and this could slightly alter the interpretation of results eefs for yes were presented because the measured data for selected wwtp effluents in the study see arlos et al 2018 were acquired using the yes assay although several estrogens in municipal wastewater effluent such as estriol e3 bpa and octyl nonylphenols may contribute to the total estrogenicity a previous study employing an eda of kitchener and waterloo wwtps found that the estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 dominated the total estrogenicity arlos et al 2018 one of the simplest ways to describe the relationships between exposure conditions and effects is through a dose response model barnthouse 1992 the observed intersex incidence and severity were related to the predicted eeq values using the four parameter hill equation described by equation 2 2 r e s p o n s e min m a x m i n 1 10 f e e q h where the response is either intersex incidence or severity min and max are the lowest and highest expected responses f is the response halfway between the min and max often described as ec50 and h is the hillslope parameter that describes the steepness of the curve the term intersex incidence refers to the percentage of fish with at least one oocyte female ovarian tissue in the male testis for intersex incidence the maximum response was set to 100 i e all male fish collected were intersex whereas the minimum was set to 0 i e all male fish collected identified as normal males by comparison the intersex severity describes the degree of feminization in each animal and is scored from 0 to 7 with 0 describing a normal male whereas 7 is used for normal female bahamonde et al 2015 although rare the highest recorded severity in rainbow darter was 6 hicks et al 2017 so the minimum and maximum levels of severity in rainbow darter were set to 0 and 6 respectively prism 7 graphpad software inc was used to fit the regression model equation 2 to the data i e predicted estrogenicity and intersex and the goodness of fit r2 was employed to determine the quality of the fit between the predicted river concentrations and intersex data 3 results and discussion 3 1 river hydro geometry and transport processes the suitability of model discretization hydro geometry and transport conditions was verified through the simulation of water levels and chloride concentrations at select sites the results for three sites are shown in fig 2 and the remainder is found in the supplementary material figs s2 s4 a graphical comparison of the calibrated model simulations with the measured data shows that the hydro geometry and water movement within the network were well characterized by the model as depicted by its ability to describe both high and low flow conditions fig 2a also the nse d pbias metrics for the calibration sites had ratings ranging from satisfactory to very good table 1 which further supported the prediction accuracy however there were some periods in segment 12 when the water levels were under predicted unsatisfactory table 1 however visual and statistical comparisons of observed and predicted water flows were completed for segments 12 21 and 37 and found to demonstrate an acceptable level of model performance satisfactory to very good ratings for nse d and pbias fig s2 the good agreement between the observed and simulated chloride concentrations fig 2b and c table 1 further supported the conclusion that the hydro geometry and transport conditions in the model adequately represented the conditions in the field in particular the model captured the different ranges of chloride concentrations measured in different segments fig s3 as similarly observed for water level simulation there was no significant correlation between the measured and predicted concentrations for segment 12 when the model performance was evaluated statistically table 1 however the mean percent differences for all the sites were within the calibration tolerances for water quality modeling donigian 2002 suggesting that the tracer contaminant simulation was acceptable for the purposes of this study table 1 3 2 modeling the river concentrations of eacs the concentrations of estrogens in the river were first simulated conservatively assuming no degradation in the reach and biodegradation and photolysis loss mechanisms were subsequently added as measured eac concentrations in the river were not available improvements in the r2 value a goodness of fit measure derived from the relationship between simulated concentrations and the intersex response data equation 2 were used as the calibration target under the conservative approach an r2 value of 0 755 was derived when the concentrations predicted by the model were fitted against the field recorded intersex incidence fig 3 a a similar r2 value 0 799 was also obtained for the intersex severity response fig 3b although these results were deemed to be indicative of a good fit the addition of biodegradation and photolysis mechanisms was examined to assess whether the predictions could be improved it was found that the addition of these processes did not significantly change the results see table s11 for statistical analysis the temperature corrected biodegradation rate constants literature derived in surface water were relatively low for all the target compounds table s6 and the model was found to be insensitive to any factors expected to impact the biodegradation temperature correction coefficient rate constants a similar trend was observed when photolysis was added to the model again this was attributed to the relatively low photodegradation rate constants literature derived that were employed for the target compounds this observation was consistent with the environmental fate modeling study of pharmaceuticals in the grand river during a low flow condition downstream of kitchener wwtp arlos et al 2014 this prior study demonstrated that the first order photolysis rate constant must be greater than 3 d 1 before photolysis became a significant mechanism in the fate and transport of pharmaceuticals within the modeled reach with varying physical chemical properties the simulations additionally revealed that considerably large values for biodegradation and photolysis rate constants would be required before substantial changes in estrogenicity were predicted fig s5 these exceptionally high values were unrealistic when compared to the range of values reported in the literature hence the results under a conservative simulation were used to discuss the subsequent sections 3 3 temporal patterns and relationship with flows the predicted concentrations of the target estrogens 2007 2015 at sites immediately downstream of the two major wwtps waterloo and kitchener are presented in fig 4 e1 was predicted to be the most abundant and contributed on average 51 and 65 of the total estrogenicity below the kitchener segment 42 and waterloo segment 23 wwtps respectively by contrast ee2 most potent of the estrogens only contributed 17 and 18 of the total estrogenicity in the river segments immediately below kitchener and waterloo wwtps respectively historically less attention has been given to e1 due to its lower potency relative to e2 and ee2 however as observed by this modeling study and many monitoring surveys worldwide blazer et al 2014 ma et al 2016 matthiessen et al 2006 sarmah et al 2006 e1 can be present at much higher concentrations than its more potent counterparts ankley et al 2017 observed that fish fathead minnow can convert e1 to e2 more potent estrogen suggesting that an exposure to high concentrations of e1 should also be considered when assessing the risks of estrogen exposure since only contaminant transport conditions were simulated in the model the impact of river flow on predicted estrogenicity concentrations in the river is evident low flow periods had high predicted concentrations and vice versa fig 4 furthermore as the removal rates in the river via biodegradation and photolysis were determined to be minimal the critical exposure conditions are controlled by dilution and will likely occur during low flows fig 4 the average predicted total estrogenicity that corresponded to flows that were less than or equal to the normal low flow 11 m3 s was 0 45 ng l s 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents immediately downstream of waterloo wwtp segment 23 the corresponding average predicted estrogenicity below the kitchener wwtp segment 42 at similar flow conditions 11 m3 s was 3 4 ng l s 0 9 ng l e2 equivalents prior to the wwtp upgrade and was reduced to 0 7 ng l s 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents post upgrade this result suggests that the partial process upgrades fig 4b improved the water quality downstream of kitchener wwtp 3 4 spatial patterns of estrogen exposure in addition to simulating time varying conditions the model was also employed to resolve the spatial patterns in response to the changes in the river e g dilution change in contaminant loadings after the upgrades the spatial analysis was provided for low flow conditions as these could lead to critical exposures a representative low flow event 11 m3 s during the pre upgrade period may 20 2012 was compared with a post upgrade low flow condition june 11 2014 these dates were chosen such that the waterloo wwtp operations and river flows were similar to avoid issues associated with river dilution see table s9 only low levels of estrogenicity were predicted in the first 50 km of the modeled section in response to the minimal release of estrogens from the two smaller upstream wwtps fergus and elora by contrast elevated estrogenicity concentrations were predicted below the waterloo wwtp outfall and they persisted until segment 50 last modeled segment at 1 6 ng l e2 equivalents on may 20 2012 fig 5 a the highest estrogenicity concentrations were predicted immediately below the kitchener wwtp during low flow periods up to 6 ng l e2 equivalents pre upgrade however the estrogenicity concentrations at all segments downstream of this plant were substantially reduced to 0 5 ng l e2 segment 50 when the process upgrades were implemented june 11 2014 fig 5b it was observed that the 20 km distance between waterloo and kitchener wwtp provided limited dilution of estrogens discharged by the waterloo wwtp during the low flow period evident by the unchanged spatial profile between the two plants fig 5 if the kitchener wwtp source was removed from the model an estrogenicity concentration of approximately 0 3 ng l e2 equivalents was predicted at segment 50 most downstream modeled segment because of the inputs from the upstream waterloo outfall this simulation suggests that although some of the estrogenicity in the river below the kitchener outfall was due to the kitchener effluent post upgrade it appears that 60 of the exposure at segment 50 could be from the upstream waterloo effluent low flow only table s10 hicks et al 2017 showed low levels of incidence and severity of intersex in rainbow darter have persisted downstream of the waterloo outfall with similar levels below the kitchener outfall after the upgrades to determine the impact of future process upgrades at the waterloo wwtp a removal efficiency through the plant of 95 was implemented in the model and the concentrations of estrogens were simulated the results of this simulation revealed that under a low flow scenario june 11 2014 the predicted estrogenicity would be reduced to 0 2 ng l e2 equivalents overall the modeling of the key estrogens in the grand river is useful in evaluating the efficiency of the current wwtp operation during a critical exposure condition low flow these concentrations were assessed along with the intersex conditions in the grand river to determine whether the estrogen exposures across many sites are consistent with the observed biological responses 3 5 potential linkages to biological effects observed in the field the concentration response curve fig 3 is a fitted four parameter hill model that employs the predicted total estrogenicity derived from the river model equation 1 and the intersex responses collected in the field i e incidence and severity establishing a relationship between predicted environmental concentrations and observed biological responses contributes to a weight of evidence that helps assess the potential for wastewater contaminants that are difficult to measure to alter the biological endpoints in receiving environments however the findings presented here must be interpreted with some caution as only three estrogens i e e1 e2 and ee2 were considered and their predicted river concentrations were not verified due to some limitations in the analytical method although a direct causal relationship is not established the model provided predictions that fit very well with the observed intersex data for wild fish fig 3 the potential and limitations of water quality modeling in exposure assessments are further discussed in sections 3 7 and 3 8 below the concentration response relationship fig 3a suggests that a predicted river total estrogenicity of 10 ng l would be associated with the feminization of 93 95 ci 89 97 of adult male rainbow darter corresponding to a predicted mean intersex severity score of 4 95 ci 3 6 4 4 severely intersex fish have scores of 4 6 bahamonde et al 2013 although an estrogenicity of 10 ng l e2 equivalents was never predicted at any river sites in the grand river the high incidence of intersex 80 100 that was mostly observed downstream of kitchener wwtp segment 41 pre upgrade corresponded to an average predicted total estrogenicity of 2 5 ng l e2 equivalents ranging from 0 8 to 6 1 ng l e2 eq fig 3a the average background intersex conditions of the upstream segments 7 12 and urban segment 19 reference sites were calculated to be 7 4 s 6 and 0 1 s 0 1 for intersex incidence and severity dataset from hicks et al 2017 after the kitchener wwtp upgrade the predicted estrogenicity at segment 41 immediately below the kitchener outfall ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 ng l e2 equivalents this predicted concentration was associated with 11 95 ci 7 15 to 43 95 ci 39 48 intersex incidence with a severity of 0 1 95 ci 0 03 0 17 to 0 8 95 ci 0 7 0 9 based on the established relationship fig 3 the post upgrade simulations suggest that the levels are approaching the background conditions the predictions also represented a major improvement in exposure conditions associated with wwtp upgrades that were primarily intended for the removal of conventional contaminants e g total suspended solids ammonia the waterloo wwtp will continue to contribute to the total estrogenicity but once upgrades at both plants have been implemented i e 95 removal of estrogens is anticipated the corresponding average estrogenicity in the river below the kitchener wwtp segment 41 was predicted to be 0 2 ng l e2 equivalents this concentration would correspond to low intersex incidence 20 with 95 ci 16 24 and severity scores 0 3 with 95 ci 0 2 0 4 the model equation 2 predictions are consistent with a laboratory experiment by fuzzen personal communication november 13 2017 wherein 10 ng l ee2 12 3 ng l e2 equivalents in yes resulted in 100 female population was observed in larval fish rainbow darter in a separate experiment fuzzen 2016 this concentration also significantly reduced the fertilization success in adult males a similar observation 100 female population was observed by lange et al 2009 when rutilus rutilus roach were exposed to 4 ng l ee2 5 0 ng l e2 equivalents in yes for 2 years furthermore kidd et al 2007 observed a population collapse in fathead minnows exposed to 5 ng l ee2 6 2 ng l e2 equivalents in yes in a whole lake experiment whereas a life cycle exposure of the same fish species to 1 ng l of ee2 reduced male secondary characteristics parrott and blunt 2005 this study provides additional support for previous work that indicated a potential relationship between estrogen exposure and intersex jobling et al 2006 examined the relationship between the modeled total estrogenicity and observed intersex in wild fish population roach in the uk they estimated that river sites with estrogenicities ranging from 1 to 10 ng l e2 equivalents will cause an intersex incidence of 22 in a wild roach population they categorized this exposure condition as medium risk whereas sites with 10 ng l e2 equivalents were considered as having high risk by contrast the current study indicates that a predicted concentration of 1 10 ng l of e2 equivalents was associated with an intersex incidence between 53 and 100 with a severity level ranging from moderate to highly severe conditions the inconsistency between the jobling et al 2006 results and those of the current study may be attributed to the species difference rainbow darter vs roach as well as the procedures employed in estimating the in river estrogen concentrations steady state vs time variable model it could also be associated with other estrogenic chemicals present in the effluent fernandez et al 2007 assessed the estrogenicity in canadian wastewaters using in vitro bioassays and detected total estrogenicities ranging from 9 to 106 ng l e2 equivalents early studies by ternes et al 1999 detected 3 ng l 6 ng l and 9 ng l median concentrations of e1 e2 and ee2 respectively in canadian effluents after incorporating a 10 or even 100 fold dilution factor it can be expected that low to moderate levels of intersex may still be associated with many effluents in canada however the relatively steep concentration response curve fig 3 suggests that improved treatment can dramatically reduce the intersex incidence and severity in watersheds as has been observed in the grand river hicks et al 2017 3 6 comparison with recommended thresholds of exposure caldwell et al 2012 determined the predicted no effects concentration pnecs of 6 2 0 1 and 60 ng l for e1 e2 ee2 and e3 respectively based on the species sensitivity distribution ssd approach similarly the eu derived an eqs of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l for e2 and ee2 respectively considering only the recommended thresholds for e2 from both studies an estrogenicity level of 2 ng l and 0 4 ng l e2 equivalents would be associated with 72 95 ci 66 78 and 34 95 ci 29 37 intersex incidence in rainbow darter respectively and correspond to severity scores of 1 95 95 ci 1 8 2 1 moderate and 0 60 95 ci 0 5 0 7 low despite a high incidence of intersex being associated with these predicted concentrations in the grand river adverse impact on rainbow darter reproduction was estimated to occur only at very severe levels severity score of 4 6 fuzzen et al 2015 again the results from such analyses should be treated with utmost caution given that the relationships in the current study are based on a limited number of eacs e1 e2 and ee2 that were predicted rather than measured nevertheless this study demonstrates the potential use of the recommended thresholds from the literature when assessing potential adverse impacts resulting from estrogen exposure when an in vitro bioassay was employed in water quality monitoring jarošová et al 2014 recommended a safe level of total estrogenicity of 0 1 0 4 ng l e2 equivalents for effluent dominated streams close to 100 effluent contribution another study determined a similar effect based trigger value of 0 5 ng l e2 equivalents when using the er calux estrogen screen assay van der oost et al 2017 the exposure of rainbow darter to the trigger value reported in the literature for surface water 0 5 ng l would be associated with 41 95 ci 36 4 45 6 intersex incidence and a low severity score of 0 77 95 ci 0 65 0 89 furthermore it appears that for both intersex incidence and severity an estrogenicity of 0 1 ng l would be associated with relatively low occurrence up to 10 and severity conditions in rainbow darter fig 3 whether this level 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents should be set as a more stringent threshold for estrogenicity still requires additional studies employing both field and laboratory techniques that test several ecologically relevant endpoints 3 7 potential contribution of other causal agents previous studies in the literature have indicated that compounds other than e1 e2 and ee2 can induce intersex for example triclosan anti androgen and a non point source pollutant equol soybean isoflavone derivative have been specifically indicated as potential agents causing endocrine disruptive effects in the wild jobling et al 2009 rostkowski et al 2011 wang et al 2016 a previous study conducted by our research group arlos et al 2015 on antiandrogens detected the presence of triclosan downstream of wwtps but it rapidly degraded over a short distance 5 km during a low flow sampling event this result suggested that triclosan may not be persistent in the grand river but this observation requires further investigation also pollution stemming from nonpoint sources is significant in the grand river watershed 70 agricultural land use especially in the spring loomer et al 2015 however this study assumed that the critical window of exposure to compounds causing intersex occurs when rainbow darter build their gonads in the summer months june to august hence the timing of exposure may be an important factor to consider obviously the possibility of other compounds causing or contributing to intersex is not being eliminated however the model results are informative and can assist with future hypothesis driven studies related to estrogen exposure other potential causal agents can be additionally modeled to determine whether a relationship with intersex could also be observed potentially enhancing the current model predictions 3 8 overall implications of the model on exposure assessment exposure assessment quantifies the magnitude frequency and duration of exposure in an environmental compartment and is a key element in the risk characterization of estrogens the assessment is often completed using advanced analytical chemistry techniques and bioassays that detect the total biological activity such as estrogenicity these methods can be limited by sampling logistics analytical methods and cost as in the case of the grand river and other river systems environmental samples to assess previous exposure conditions pre upgrade were also not available chemical measurements would have helped to validate some of the assumptions e g fate mechanisms non point sources and or refine the predictions the estrogens in the river are at extremely low concentrations which is a significant challenge in the chemical analysis e g detection limits in addition there can be limitations with the analytical detection using lc ms ms methods that are prone to matrix interferences in dirty municipal wastewater samples although modeling is not a complete substitute for chemical and bioassay measurements it is a viable option to supplement the current lack of exposure data further investigation and validation of the model are warranted but the conservative estimates presented in this study suggest that the select estrogens are likely associated or at least correlated with the observed intersex in wild fish in the grand river 4 conclusions the concentrations of e1 e2 and ee2 compounds that contribute a large fraction of municipal wastewater derived total estrogenicity in surface waters were predicted using a mechanistic water quality model transport conditions appear to play a major role in the spatial and temporal distribution of the target estrogens in the grand river while fate mechanisms such as biodegradation and photolysis likely have minimal influence the relationships between the predicted exposure concentrations during the period of gonadal recrudescence for rainbow darter and intersex incidence and severity were also developed using the four parameter hill concentration response model a predicted estrogenicity level of 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents in river water was associated with up to 10 intersex incidence and a low severity score of 1 which is unlikely to impact the rainbow darter reproductive health this work is consistent with the recommended thresholds for exposure but additional work is required to validate the assumptions employed in the model even with the limitations identified modeling contributes to the better understanding of risk and evaluation of potential remedial actions and is a valuable tool that can be applied to estimate environmental exposure acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge that some data on wwtps used in this study was provided under a data sharing agreement

19569,decades of studies on endocrine disruption have suggested the need to manage the release of key estrogens from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp however the proposed thresholds are below the detection limits of most routine chemical analysis thereby restricting the ability of watershed managers to assess the environmental exposure appropriately in this study we demonstrated the utility of a mechanistic model to address the data gaps on estrogen exposure concentrations of the prominent estrogenic contaminants in wastewaters estrone estradiol and ethinylestradiol were simulated in the grand river in southern ontario canada for nine years including a period when major wwtp upgrades occurred the predicted concentrations expressed as total estrogenicity e2 equivalent concentrations were contrasted to a key estrogenic response i e intersex in rainbow darter etheostoma caeruleum a wild sentinel fish species a predicted total estrogenicity in the river of 10 ng l e2 equivalents was associated with high intersex incidence and severity whereas concentrations 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents were associated with minimal intersex expression exposure to a predicted river concentration of 0 4 ng l e2 equivalents the environmental quality standard eqs proposed by the european union for estradiol was associated with 34 95 ci 30 38 intersex incidence and a very low severity score of 0 6 95 ci 0 5 0 7 this exposure is not predicted to cause adverse effects in rainbow darter the analyses completed in this study were only based on the predicted presence of three major estrogens e1 e2 ee2 so caution must be exercised when interpreting the results nevertheless this study illustrates the use of models for exposure assessment especially when measured data are not available graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogen intersex water quality model exposure assessment wastewater rainbow darter 1 introduction the exposure of fish to endocrine active chemicals eacs has been shown globally to have deleterious consequences for reproductive health brian et al 2005 kime 1999 nash et al 2004 tyler and routledge 1998 one of the most frequent observations is the feminization of male fish with vitellogenin induction production of estrogen dependent protein and intersex ova testis as examples of changes reported jordan et al 2016 progress in analytical chemistry has enabled the detection of eacs at very low concentrations benotti et al 2008 carballa et al 2004 lópez roldán et al 2010 however the proposed environmental quality standards eqs by the european union eu for some eacs such as estradiol e2 and ethinylestradiol ee2 are only 0 4 and 0 035 ng l respectively european commission 2012 these concentrations are below the current detection limits of most routine analytical methods as a result some studies have utilized biological assessments i e bioassays to quantify exposures to eacs busch et al 2016 coleman et al 2004 escher et al 2013 marinho et al 2013 neale et al 2017 ohko et al 2002 bioassay techniques examine the combined biological activity in a mixture and can provide an indication of the potential responses in organisms exposed to complex mixtures without identifying the specific chemicals despite the considerable chemical and bioanalytical monitoring of eacs in effluents and receiving environments worldwide agunbiade and moodley 2016 escher et al 2013 leusch et al 2014 servos et al 2005 xu et al 2007 there is still limited information to assess the spatial or temporal concentrations of eacs in receiving waters where technical challenges e g detection limits and cost are important considerations roig and d aco 2016 in the absence of such data the modeling of environmental systems can be used as an alternative approach to characterize fish exposure to eacs roig and d aco 2016 zhang et al 2015 models can be applied to evaluate current and future mitigation strategies for eliminating the target compounds through scenario testing kehrein et al 2015 and assist in the design of effective monitoring programs roig and d aco 2016 furthermore models can be employed to assess the potential relationship of stressor concentrations to observed effects in the wild jobling et al 2006 2009 numerous models have already been developed in recent years to predict the fate and transport of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products arlos et al 2014 balaam et al 2010 dale et al 2015 grechi et al 2016 kehrein et al 2015 field investigations on the incidence and severity of intersex in male rainbow darter etheostoma caeruleum in the grand river watershed southern ontario have been ongoing since 2007 hicks et al 2017 the presence of severe intersex in rainbow darter has been linked to poor reproductive success fuzzen et al 2015 with potential negative impacts on the fish population however a direct link between the exposure to specific compounds and intersex is very difficult to establish as the effluent composition and fate of eacs in the receiving environments are complex the potential of natural estrogens e2 and estrone e1 and synthetic estrogens ee2 to cause endocrine disruption in fish has dominated many laboratory and field studies in recent years corcoran et al 2010 desbrow et al 1998 jobling et al 2006 kidd et al 2007 palace et al 2009 the effects directed analysis eda of the two major wwtp effluents in the grand river suggested that the total estrogenicity was mainly contributed by e1 e2 and ee2 based on a receptor agonist screen assay yeast estrogen screen yes arlos et al 2018 however there are many other eacs entering the receiving environment e g estrogens from diffuse sources that can interfere with the endocrine function in fish some responses including intersex may also be caused by androgen antagonists jobling et al 2009 or chemicals such as metformin antidiabetic that may work through mechanisms other than receptor binding niemuth and klaper 2015 also the fate of other eacs may be correlated with the estrogen exposure making it difficult to generate direct cause and effect relationships the current modeling work is focused on three major estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 identified in the prior eda as important contributors to the total estrogenicity in the effluents in this study the concentrations of e1 e2 and ee2 were simulated along the grand river where the widespread presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products has been documented arlos et al 2015 the modeled reach also includes areas that were previously predicted via models to have elevated levels of estrogens grill et al 2016 hosseini et al 2012 a major upgrade in one of the treatment plants kitchener wwtp has resulted in major effluent quality changes during the study period but minimal data in effluents were available especially during the pre upgrade period when the environmental exposure to municipal wastewater derived estrogens was likely at its peak this scenario additionally provides a unique opportunity to apply models that can help assess the efficiency of wwtp upgrades the overall goals of this study were to estimate the concentrations of select eacs e1 e2 and ee2 in the grand river through mechanistic water quality modeling and to determine whether the exposure to these key estrogens is consistent with the observed responses intersex in wild fish 2 methodology 2 1 study site the grand river watershed in southern ontario 6 800 km2 drains into lake erie and is inhabited by close to 1 million people in addition to the non point sources from numerous agricultural activities 70 of total land use the watershed also receives inputs from 30 wwtps the grand river has also been extensively investigated for several biological effect endpoints on fish health since the late 2000s bahamonde et al 2014 fuzzen et al 2015 2016 tanna et al 2013 tetreault et al 2011 2013 in this study 80 km of the grand river was modeled starting below a regulated water reservoir shand dam to an area that is 2 km above the grand and speed river confluence fig 1 a this section captures both agriculture and urban gradients in the watershed and incorporates the inputs from two major waterloo and kitchener and two smaller elora and fergus wwtps table s1 in 2012 kitchener wwtp underwent major process upgrades including improved aeration nitrification and replacement of chlorination de chlorination with uv effluent disinfection 2 2 modeling strategy the water quality modeling included three separate components 1 source 2 transport and fate and 3 effects as outlined in fig s1 the source modeling predicted the effluent concentrations from the target wwtps and was completed as detailed in arlos et al 2018 the transport and fate component simulated the distribution of target eacs in the study area and was completed using a mechanistic water quality model finally the effects component evaluated the potential relationship between the predicted river concentrations derived from the transport and fate model component and field recorded intersex conditions due to their relatively high site fidelity hicks and servos 2017 and constant exposure to wwtp effluents throughout their life cycle data on rainbow darter were considered suitable for quantifying the exposure impacts the intersex data for rainbow darter at nine sites in the grand river watershed 2007 2015 were based on the same samples compiled by hicks et al 2017 and were used in the concentration response regression analysis see section 2 5 the selection of these sites is also described in detail in hicks et al 2017 a similar approach to arlos et al 2014 was employed to simulate estrogen concentrations in the grand river the water quality simulation program developed by the us environmental protection agency wasp version 7 3 was used as the model platform this model was employed in a recent study to describe the distribution of frequently detected pharmaceuticals with varying physical chemical properties downstream of the kitchener wwtp 10 km reach arlos et al 2014 the model has already been calibrated for compounds that spanned the properties of those examined in the current study and was found to provide robust mechanistic predictions of pharmaceutical fate and transport arlos et al 2014 the following major steps were completed to predict the river concentrations discretization of the river network simulation of river transport mechanisms i e advection testing of the transport processes using a tracer compound chloride and integration of organic compound modeling through the addition of significant in river fate mechanisms e g biodegradation and photolysis the first three steps were iterative in nature and were deemed as crucial in establishing a baseline model that accurately represented the mathematical structure of the system as detailed in arlos et al 2014 the final discretized model involved 50 segments fig 1b described in the supplementary material section a and only the aqueous phase was considered in the discretization i e no bottom segments included advection is the primary transport process in rivers and is driven by water flows the internal flows in wasp under the kinematic wave flow option were propagated using manning s equation section b supplementary material the model was initially set up to describe water movement and its accuracy was cross checked against the measured hydro geometry data such as water levels and flows measured water level data for segments 12 21 and 37 were used for river transport calibration the finalized input parameters associated with the hydro geometry and river transport are found in the supplementary material table s2 in addition to examining the model s accuracy in simulating water movement via measured water levels and flows chloride was also used to determine the non reactive constituent transport within the network since chloride is conservative its assimilation in the river system is achieved via advection significant point sources of chloride in the river network come from urbanized creeks laurel and schneider creeks and the wwtps observed chloride values at segments 12 21 23 32 42 and 50 were used to calibrate the transport component and were taken from ontario s provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn database https www ontario ca data provincial stream water quality monitoring network and previous monitoring work completed in the central grand river tables s3 and s4 2 2 1 modeling of target estrogens the major inputs of target estrogens into the studied reach of the grand river were from the four wwtps although the tributaries one river and four creeks included in the modeled network may be receiving small amounts of estrogens from the surrounding agricultural lands i e municipal biosolids manure applications no chemical and bioassay data for the study period are currently available to confirm this however data collected in the upstream reaches above segment 12 where the land use is predominantly agricultural suggest low occurrence and severity of intersex hicks et al 2017 hence it was assumed that the tributaries have negligible contributions of e1 e2 and ee2 the concentration profiles of the target estrogens in the kitchener and waterloo wwtp effluents were developed previously arlos et al 2018 that employed population demographics usage and excretion rates and removal through the plant to estimate effluent data a similar approach was completed for the effluents from the fergus and elora wwtps the simulation of the transport and fate of the target eacs was completed by initially considering them as conservative contaminants transport as a primary mechanism and sequentially adding fate mechanisms responsible for their distribution in the aquatic environment chapra 1997 suggested that sorption is minimal when the target compounds have log octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow that are 4 5 and the suspended solids concentrations range from 1 50 mg l the estrogens examined in this study have log kow s that are 4 5 and the average suspended solids concentration in various segments ranged from 6 to 23 mg l pwqmn data set from 2007 2014 hence sorption was not simulated in this study this decision was consistent with the results of jurgens et al 1999 who reported that estrogens in riverine environments are typically present in the dissolved phase in addition a previous modeling study by arlos et al 2014 in the grand river found that inclusion of sorption had a minimal effect on the fate of modeled pharmaceuticals with log kow of 3 2 4 8 hence only biodegradation and photolysis were deemed to be significant in the assimilation of estrogens in the aquatic environment balaam et al 2010 jürgens et al 2002 lin and reinhard 2005 biodegradation and photolysis processes were initialized using the approach described by arlos et al 2014 briefly biodegradation was modeled as a first order reaction and literature derived kinetic rate constants table s5 were initially corrected based on the river temperature table s6 temperature profiles for each segment were taken from the nearest pwqmn site photolysis was also modeled as a first order reaction and the range of rate constants was derived from the literature table s5 2 3 model performance measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d and the percent bias pbias have been recommended by moriasi et al 2007 table s7 and were used to evaluate the performance of the transport portion of the model these criteria however are not applicable for simulations that have a limited number of measured data points 50 hence a statistical test was completed using either the pearson or spearman correlation tests measured vs predicted depending on the normality of the datasets table s8 an additional performance test using the percent difference criteria donigian 2002 was also used to support the results of the correlation analysis table s7 these quantitative performance measures were used in addition to a subjective comparison of observed and predicted time series plots data were not available for all target estrogens in the modeled reach hence the quality of the simulation of estrogen fate mechanisms was conducted by assessing the effects portion of the model described in the next section 2 4 linking predicted concentrations exposure and intersex conditions effects although feminization of male rainbow darter has been observed at different levels of biological organization in the grand river fuzzen et al 2016 hicks et al 2017 marjan et al 2017 tetreault et al 2011 intersex has been found to be the most consistently observed endpoint related to reproductive changes downstream of municipal wwtps fuzzen et al 2016 hicks et al 2017 evaluated intersex incidence and severity from 2007 to 2015 at nine different sites fig 1 including periods prior to and after the kitchener wwtp upgrades this dataset was used as the primary biological response to which the predicted eac concentrations were compared it was assumed that the critical window of exposure for adult rainbow darter occurs during their gonadal recrudescence late spring to summer hicks et al 2017 hence the predicted river eac concentrations from june to august were averaged at the nine sites to provide the exposure conditions for the fish collected in the fall sampling event of that same year and the spring sampling of the following year the predicted concentrations were converted to total estrogenicity eeq using 1 e e q c i e e f i where c i is the predicted concentration e e f i is the estrogenicity equivalency factor that describes the potency of the estrogens relative to e2 eefs of 0 3 1 and 1 23 were used for e1 e2 and ee2 respectively the eefs reflect the average potency associated with the yeast estrogen screen yes assay as compiled by jarošová et al 2014 however there may be differences in the responses of different species and endpoints for each of the estrogens of interest and this could slightly alter the interpretation of results eefs for yes were presented because the measured data for selected wwtp effluents in the study see arlos et al 2018 were acquired using the yes assay although several estrogens in municipal wastewater effluent such as estriol e3 bpa and octyl nonylphenols may contribute to the total estrogenicity a previous study employing an eda of kitchener and waterloo wwtps found that the estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 dominated the total estrogenicity arlos et al 2018 one of the simplest ways to describe the relationships between exposure conditions and effects is through a dose response model barnthouse 1992 the observed intersex incidence and severity were related to the predicted eeq values using the four parameter hill equation described by equation 2 2 r e s p o n s e min m a x m i n 1 10 f e e q h where the response is either intersex incidence or severity min and max are the lowest and highest expected responses f is the response halfway between the min and max often described as ec50 and h is the hillslope parameter that describes the steepness of the curve the term intersex incidence refers to the percentage of fish with at least one oocyte female ovarian tissue in the male testis for intersex incidence the maximum response was set to 100 i e all male fish collected were intersex whereas the minimum was set to 0 i e all male fish collected identified as normal males by comparison the intersex severity describes the degree of feminization in each animal and is scored from 0 to 7 with 0 describing a normal male whereas 7 is used for normal female bahamonde et al 2015 although rare the highest recorded severity in rainbow darter was 6 hicks et al 2017 so the minimum and maximum levels of severity in rainbow darter were set to 0 and 6 respectively prism 7 graphpad software inc was used to fit the regression model equation 2 to the data i e predicted estrogenicity and intersex and the goodness of fit r2 was employed to determine the quality of the fit between the predicted river concentrations and intersex data 3 results and discussion 3 1 river hydro geometry and transport processes the suitability of model discretization hydro geometry and transport conditions was verified through the simulation of water levels and chloride concentrations at select sites the results for three sites are shown in fig 2 and the remainder is found in the supplementary material figs s2 s4 a graphical comparison of the calibrated model simulations with the measured data shows that the hydro geometry and water movement within the network were well characterized by the model as depicted by its ability to describe both high and low flow conditions fig 2a also the nse d pbias metrics for the calibration sites had ratings ranging from satisfactory to very good table 1 which further supported the prediction accuracy however there were some periods in segment 12 when the water levels were under predicted unsatisfactory table 1 however visual and statistical comparisons of observed and predicted water flows were completed for segments 12 21 and 37 and found to demonstrate an acceptable level of model performance satisfactory to very good ratings for nse d and pbias fig s2 the good agreement between the observed and simulated chloride concentrations fig 2b and c table 1 further supported the conclusion that the hydro geometry and transport conditions in the model adequately represented the conditions in the field in particular the model captured the different ranges of chloride concentrations measured in different segments fig s3 as similarly observed for water level simulation there was no significant correlation between the measured and predicted concentrations for segment 12 when the model performance was evaluated statistically table 1 however the mean percent differences for all the sites were within the calibration tolerances for water quality modeling donigian 2002 suggesting that the tracer contaminant simulation was acceptable for the purposes of this study table 1 3 2 modeling the river concentrations of eacs the concentrations of estrogens in the river were first simulated conservatively assuming no degradation in the reach and biodegradation and photolysis loss mechanisms were subsequently added as measured eac concentrations in the river were not available improvements in the r2 value a goodness of fit measure derived from the relationship between simulated concentrations and the intersex response data equation 2 were used as the calibration target under the conservative approach an r2 value of 0 755 was derived when the concentrations predicted by the model were fitted against the field recorded intersex incidence fig 3 a a similar r2 value 0 799 was also obtained for the intersex severity response fig 3b although these results were deemed to be indicative of a good fit the addition of biodegradation and photolysis mechanisms was examined to assess whether the predictions could be improved it was found that the addition of these processes did not significantly change the results see table s11 for statistical analysis the temperature corrected biodegradation rate constants literature derived in surface water were relatively low for all the target compounds table s6 and the model was found to be insensitive to any factors expected to impact the biodegradation temperature correction coefficient rate constants a similar trend was observed when photolysis was added to the model again this was attributed to the relatively low photodegradation rate constants literature derived that were employed for the target compounds this observation was consistent with the environmental fate modeling study of pharmaceuticals in the grand river during a low flow condition downstream of kitchener wwtp arlos et al 2014 this prior study demonstrated that the first order photolysis rate constant must be greater than 3 d 1 before photolysis became a significant mechanism in the fate and transport of pharmaceuticals within the modeled reach with varying physical chemical properties the simulations additionally revealed that considerably large values for biodegradation and photolysis rate constants would be required before substantial changes in estrogenicity were predicted fig s5 these exceptionally high values were unrealistic when compared to the range of values reported in the literature hence the results under a conservative simulation were used to discuss the subsequent sections 3 3 temporal patterns and relationship with flows the predicted concentrations of the target estrogens 2007 2015 at sites immediately downstream of the two major wwtps waterloo and kitchener are presented in fig 4 e1 was predicted to be the most abundant and contributed on average 51 and 65 of the total estrogenicity below the kitchener segment 42 and waterloo segment 23 wwtps respectively by contrast ee2 most potent of the estrogens only contributed 17 and 18 of the total estrogenicity in the river segments immediately below kitchener and waterloo wwtps respectively historically less attention has been given to e1 due to its lower potency relative to e2 and ee2 however as observed by this modeling study and many monitoring surveys worldwide blazer et al 2014 ma et al 2016 matthiessen et al 2006 sarmah et al 2006 e1 can be present at much higher concentrations than its more potent counterparts ankley et al 2017 observed that fish fathead minnow can convert e1 to e2 more potent estrogen suggesting that an exposure to high concentrations of e1 should also be considered when assessing the risks of estrogen exposure since only contaminant transport conditions were simulated in the model the impact of river flow on predicted estrogenicity concentrations in the river is evident low flow periods had high predicted concentrations and vice versa fig 4 furthermore as the removal rates in the river via biodegradation and photolysis were determined to be minimal the critical exposure conditions are controlled by dilution and will likely occur during low flows fig 4 the average predicted total estrogenicity that corresponded to flows that were less than or equal to the normal low flow 11 m3 s was 0 45 ng l s 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents immediately downstream of waterloo wwtp segment 23 the corresponding average predicted estrogenicity below the kitchener wwtp segment 42 at similar flow conditions 11 m3 s was 3 4 ng l s 0 9 ng l e2 equivalents prior to the wwtp upgrade and was reduced to 0 7 ng l s 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents post upgrade this result suggests that the partial process upgrades fig 4b improved the water quality downstream of kitchener wwtp 3 4 spatial patterns of estrogen exposure in addition to simulating time varying conditions the model was also employed to resolve the spatial patterns in response to the changes in the river e g dilution change in contaminant loadings after the upgrades the spatial analysis was provided for low flow conditions as these could lead to critical exposures a representative low flow event 11 m3 s during the pre upgrade period may 20 2012 was compared with a post upgrade low flow condition june 11 2014 these dates were chosen such that the waterloo wwtp operations and river flows were similar to avoid issues associated with river dilution see table s9 only low levels of estrogenicity were predicted in the first 50 km of the modeled section in response to the minimal release of estrogens from the two smaller upstream wwtps fergus and elora by contrast elevated estrogenicity concentrations were predicted below the waterloo wwtp outfall and they persisted until segment 50 last modeled segment at 1 6 ng l e2 equivalents on may 20 2012 fig 5 a the highest estrogenicity concentrations were predicted immediately below the kitchener wwtp during low flow periods up to 6 ng l e2 equivalents pre upgrade however the estrogenicity concentrations at all segments downstream of this plant were substantially reduced to 0 5 ng l e2 segment 50 when the process upgrades were implemented june 11 2014 fig 5b it was observed that the 20 km distance between waterloo and kitchener wwtp provided limited dilution of estrogens discharged by the waterloo wwtp during the low flow period evident by the unchanged spatial profile between the two plants fig 5 if the kitchener wwtp source was removed from the model an estrogenicity concentration of approximately 0 3 ng l e2 equivalents was predicted at segment 50 most downstream modeled segment because of the inputs from the upstream waterloo outfall this simulation suggests that although some of the estrogenicity in the river below the kitchener outfall was due to the kitchener effluent post upgrade it appears that 60 of the exposure at segment 50 could be from the upstream waterloo effluent low flow only table s10 hicks et al 2017 showed low levels of incidence and severity of intersex in rainbow darter have persisted downstream of the waterloo outfall with similar levels below the kitchener outfall after the upgrades to determine the impact of future process upgrades at the waterloo wwtp a removal efficiency through the plant of 95 was implemented in the model and the concentrations of estrogens were simulated the results of this simulation revealed that under a low flow scenario june 11 2014 the predicted estrogenicity would be reduced to 0 2 ng l e2 equivalents overall the modeling of the key estrogens in the grand river is useful in evaluating the efficiency of the current wwtp operation during a critical exposure condition low flow these concentrations were assessed along with the intersex conditions in the grand river to determine whether the estrogen exposures across many sites are consistent with the observed biological responses 3 5 potential linkages to biological effects observed in the field the concentration response curve fig 3 is a fitted four parameter hill model that employs the predicted total estrogenicity derived from the river model equation 1 and the intersex responses collected in the field i e incidence and severity establishing a relationship between predicted environmental concentrations and observed biological responses contributes to a weight of evidence that helps assess the potential for wastewater contaminants that are difficult to measure to alter the biological endpoints in receiving environments however the findings presented here must be interpreted with some caution as only three estrogens i e e1 e2 and ee2 were considered and their predicted river concentrations were not verified due to some limitations in the analytical method although a direct causal relationship is not established the model provided predictions that fit very well with the observed intersex data for wild fish fig 3 the potential and limitations of water quality modeling in exposure assessments are further discussed in sections 3 7 and 3 8 below the concentration response relationship fig 3a suggests that a predicted river total estrogenicity of 10 ng l would be associated with the feminization of 93 95 ci 89 97 of adult male rainbow darter corresponding to a predicted mean intersex severity score of 4 95 ci 3 6 4 4 severely intersex fish have scores of 4 6 bahamonde et al 2013 although an estrogenicity of 10 ng l e2 equivalents was never predicted at any river sites in the grand river the high incidence of intersex 80 100 that was mostly observed downstream of kitchener wwtp segment 41 pre upgrade corresponded to an average predicted total estrogenicity of 2 5 ng l e2 equivalents ranging from 0 8 to 6 1 ng l e2 eq fig 3a the average background intersex conditions of the upstream segments 7 12 and urban segment 19 reference sites were calculated to be 7 4 s 6 and 0 1 s 0 1 for intersex incidence and severity dataset from hicks et al 2017 after the kitchener wwtp upgrade the predicted estrogenicity at segment 41 immediately below the kitchener outfall ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 ng l e2 equivalents this predicted concentration was associated with 11 95 ci 7 15 to 43 95 ci 39 48 intersex incidence with a severity of 0 1 95 ci 0 03 0 17 to 0 8 95 ci 0 7 0 9 based on the established relationship fig 3 the post upgrade simulations suggest that the levels are approaching the background conditions the predictions also represented a major improvement in exposure conditions associated with wwtp upgrades that were primarily intended for the removal of conventional contaminants e g total suspended solids ammonia the waterloo wwtp will continue to contribute to the total estrogenicity but once upgrades at both plants have been implemented i e 95 removal of estrogens is anticipated the corresponding average estrogenicity in the river below the kitchener wwtp segment 41 was predicted to be 0 2 ng l e2 equivalents this concentration would correspond to low intersex incidence 20 with 95 ci 16 24 and severity scores 0 3 with 95 ci 0 2 0 4 the model equation 2 predictions are consistent with a laboratory experiment by fuzzen personal communication november 13 2017 wherein 10 ng l ee2 12 3 ng l e2 equivalents in yes resulted in 100 female population was observed in larval fish rainbow darter in a separate experiment fuzzen 2016 this concentration also significantly reduced the fertilization success in adult males a similar observation 100 female population was observed by lange et al 2009 when rutilus rutilus roach were exposed to 4 ng l ee2 5 0 ng l e2 equivalents in yes for 2 years furthermore kidd et al 2007 observed a population collapse in fathead minnows exposed to 5 ng l ee2 6 2 ng l e2 equivalents in yes in a whole lake experiment whereas a life cycle exposure of the same fish species to 1 ng l of ee2 reduced male secondary characteristics parrott and blunt 2005 this study provides additional support for previous work that indicated a potential relationship between estrogen exposure and intersex jobling et al 2006 examined the relationship between the modeled total estrogenicity and observed intersex in wild fish population roach in the uk they estimated that river sites with estrogenicities ranging from 1 to 10 ng l e2 equivalents will cause an intersex incidence of 22 in a wild roach population they categorized this exposure condition as medium risk whereas sites with 10 ng l e2 equivalents were considered as having high risk by contrast the current study indicates that a predicted concentration of 1 10 ng l of e2 equivalents was associated with an intersex incidence between 53 and 100 with a severity level ranging from moderate to highly severe conditions the inconsistency between the jobling et al 2006 results and those of the current study may be attributed to the species difference rainbow darter vs roach as well as the procedures employed in estimating the in river estrogen concentrations steady state vs time variable model it could also be associated with other estrogenic chemicals present in the effluent fernandez et al 2007 assessed the estrogenicity in canadian wastewaters using in vitro bioassays and detected total estrogenicities ranging from 9 to 106 ng l e2 equivalents early studies by ternes et al 1999 detected 3 ng l 6 ng l and 9 ng l median concentrations of e1 e2 and ee2 respectively in canadian effluents after incorporating a 10 or even 100 fold dilution factor it can be expected that low to moderate levels of intersex may still be associated with many effluents in canada however the relatively steep concentration response curve fig 3 suggests that improved treatment can dramatically reduce the intersex incidence and severity in watersheds as has been observed in the grand river hicks et al 2017 3 6 comparison with recommended thresholds of exposure caldwell et al 2012 determined the predicted no effects concentration pnecs of 6 2 0 1 and 60 ng l for e1 e2 ee2 and e3 respectively based on the species sensitivity distribution ssd approach similarly the eu derived an eqs of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l for e2 and ee2 respectively considering only the recommended thresholds for e2 from both studies an estrogenicity level of 2 ng l and 0 4 ng l e2 equivalents would be associated with 72 95 ci 66 78 and 34 95 ci 29 37 intersex incidence in rainbow darter respectively and correspond to severity scores of 1 95 95 ci 1 8 2 1 moderate and 0 60 95 ci 0 5 0 7 low despite a high incidence of intersex being associated with these predicted concentrations in the grand river adverse impact on rainbow darter reproduction was estimated to occur only at very severe levels severity score of 4 6 fuzzen et al 2015 again the results from such analyses should be treated with utmost caution given that the relationships in the current study are based on a limited number of eacs e1 e2 and ee2 that were predicted rather than measured nevertheless this study demonstrates the potential use of the recommended thresholds from the literature when assessing potential adverse impacts resulting from estrogen exposure when an in vitro bioassay was employed in water quality monitoring jarošová et al 2014 recommended a safe level of total estrogenicity of 0 1 0 4 ng l e2 equivalents for effluent dominated streams close to 100 effluent contribution another study determined a similar effect based trigger value of 0 5 ng l e2 equivalents when using the er calux estrogen screen assay van der oost et al 2017 the exposure of rainbow darter to the trigger value reported in the literature for surface water 0 5 ng l would be associated with 41 95 ci 36 4 45 6 intersex incidence and a low severity score of 0 77 95 ci 0 65 0 89 furthermore it appears that for both intersex incidence and severity an estrogenicity of 0 1 ng l would be associated with relatively low occurrence up to 10 and severity conditions in rainbow darter fig 3 whether this level 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents should be set as a more stringent threshold for estrogenicity still requires additional studies employing both field and laboratory techniques that test several ecologically relevant endpoints 3 7 potential contribution of other causal agents previous studies in the literature have indicated that compounds other than e1 e2 and ee2 can induce intersex for example triclosan anti androgen and a non point source pollutant equol soybean isoflavone derivative have been specifically indicated as potential agents causing endocrine disruptive effects in the wild jobling et al 2009 rostkowski et al 2011 wang et al 2016 a previous study conducted by our research group arlos et al 2015 on antiandrogens detected the presence of triclosan downstream of wwtps but it rapidly degraded over a short distance 5 km during a low flow sampling event this result suggested that triclosan may not be persistent in the grand river but this observation requires further investigation also pollution stemming from nonpoint sources is significant in the grand river watershed 70 agricultural land use especially in the spring loomer et al 2015 however this study assumed that the critical window of exposure to compounds causing intersex occurs when rainbow darter build their gonads in the summer months june to august hence the timing of exposure may be an important factor to consider obviously the possibility of other compounds causing or contributing to intersex is not being eliminated however the model results are informative and can assist with future hypothesis driven studies related to estrogen exposure other potential causal agents can be additionally modeled to determine whether a relationship with intersex could also be observed potentially enhancing the current model predictions 3 8 overall implications of the model on exposure assessment exposure assessment quantifies the magnitude frequency and duration of exposure in an environmental compartment and is a key element in the risk characterization of estrogens the assessment is often completed using advanced analytical chemistry techniques and bioassays that detect the total biological activity such as estrogenicity these methods can be limited by sampling logistics analytical methods and cost as in the case of the grand river and other river systems environmental samples to assess previous exposure conditions pre upgrade were also not available chemical measurements would have helped to validate some of the assumptions e g fate mechanisms non point sources and or refine the predictions the estrogens in the river are at extremely low concentrations which is a significant challenge in the chemical analysis e g detection limits in addition there can be limitations with the analytical detection using lc ms ms methods that are prone to matrix interferences in dirty municipal wastewater samples although modeling is not a complete substitute for chemical and bioassay measurements it is a viable option to supplement the current lack of exposure data further investigation and validation of the model are warranted but the conservative estimates presented in this study suggest that the select estrogens are likely associated or at least correlated with the observed intersex in wild fish in the grand river 4 conclusions the concentrations of e1 e2 and ee2 compounds that contribute a large fraction of municipal wastewater derived total estrogenicity in surface waters were predicted using a mechanistic water quality model transport conditions appear to play a major role in the spatial and temporal distribution of the target estrogens in the grand river while fate mechanisms such as biodegradation and photolysis likely have minimal influence the relationships between the predicted exposure concentrations during the period of gonadal recrudescence for rainbow darter and intersex incidence and severity were also developed using the four parameter hill concentration response model a predicted estrogenicity level of 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents in river water was associated with up to 10 intersex incidence and a low severity score of 1 which is unlikely to impact the rainbow darter reproductive health this work is consistent with the recommended thresholds for exposure but additional work is required to validate the assumptions employed in the model even with the limitations identified modeling contributes to the better understanding of risk and evaluation of potential remedial actions and is a
