14580,the environmental concerns for treating cyanide containing wastewater via adsorption technology has been advancing which resulting in the need for a robust yet simple method synthetic zeolite was used as a suitable adsorbent for cyanide removal due to its excellent surface properties in this study the modification of zeolite was made by iron doping to trigger a better adsorption performance then the comparison between the effectiveness of each zeolite follows subsequently sem xrd and bet analyses were employed to study the adsorbents characteristics cyanide uptake experiments were conducted by a batch technique for certain contact times at room temperature while adsorbent dose and agitation speed were set constant the results showed that before the equilibrium iron doped zeolite removed 20 more cyanide by following the pseudo second order kinetic model than raw zeolite which fits the pseudo first order model langmuir model was better in describing the adsorption behavior of cyanide onto iron modified synthetic zeolite the maximum uptake capacity of cyanide onto iron zeolite was known as 33 978 mg g 1 keywords cyanide removal zeolite iron doping kinetic model adsorption 1 introduction cyanide is a chemical compound that has been commonly used in several industrial processes as well as gold and silver extraction 1 gold cyanidation which was established as macarthur forrest process in 1887 has been applied as the main and the most economical technique for gold extraction it is popular due to the high effectiveness of cyanide as the leaching agent in alkaline condition 2 however the prospect of using cyanidation technique for extracting gold from the ores is in doubt owing to the tremendous potential risk of cyanide toxicity to the environment 3 some options for removing cyanide from effluents in gold mining have been proposed based on chemical physical biological and even adsorption techniques 4 in recent years adsorption process has received more interests for cyanide removal from wastewater because this simple method does not require hazardous chemicals in operation 5 this technique is quite promising since there are abundant candidate materials that could be potentially developed as the adsorbents for eliminating cyanide 6 researchers have investigated and reported some materials including plain and iron impregnated activated carbon 7 8 natural zeolite 9 ion exchange resin 10 and also bio adsorbent materials 11 12 it is known that cyanide adsorption by activated carbon has been largely practiced in mining industries 13 however the method still has some shortcomings especially on the recovery of cyanide and the low degree of carbon regeneration during the process which lead to high operating costs 14 on the other hand ion exchange material such as synthetic zeolite has been proved to overcome the cyanide recovery problem 15 the reason is that synthetic zeolite has high volumes of empty spaces with its unique property such as uniform micropore sized and its possibility to be regenerated 16 17 it also possesses the excellent flexibility to be modified with metal especially iron which has high affinity with cyanide 18 iron zeolite is likely to have more potential to be implemented for removal of cyanide from the waste effluents 19 therefore this work aims to investigate and evaluate the performances of raw and iron modified synthetic zeolites for cyanide adsorption process and to analyze the effectiveness of those zeolites regarding kinetics and isotherm behaviors 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of iron modified synthetic zeolite an mfi type of synthetic zeolite purchased from zeolyst international with a sio2 al2o3 ratio of 23 was used as raw material iron doped zeolite was prepared by modifying raw zeolite with 300 ml of aqueous solution containing 5 mmol fecl2 4h2o supplied by wako chemicals in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and agitated for 24 h at 313 k then the suspension was filtered and the solid part was calcined in a muffle oven at 773 k for 6 h in the presence of air 2 2 adsorbents characterization sem observation was conducted using analytical scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6610la to study the surface and structure of the raw and iron doped zeolites xrd analysis was then tested to confirm the result of the iron doping process for specific surface area measurement zeolite samples were degassed at 523 k for 3 h under vacuum the bet surface area was measured by bet analyzer quadrasorb si automated surface area pore size analyzer using the n2 adsorption at 77 k 20 the pore volume and average pore size were determined using t plot method 21 2 3 cyanide adsorption experiments cyanide solutions with four different initial concentrations 50 100 200 and 300 mg l 1 were prepared from 1000 mg l 1 stock before conducting cyanide uptake experiment in this study simple cyanide solution was made by adding a certain amount of sodium cyanide nacn in 100 ml of ultra pure water in the presence of sodium hydroxide naoh to keep the ph in between 10 5 11 based on the consideration of the ph in a real cyanidation process the adsorbent dose used for all experiments was fixed at 10 g l 1 as it was the optimum based on the preliminary result tests were carried out by batch technique at ambient temperature with the agitation speed of 200 rpm in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the cyanide adsorption was investigated for 72 h in each batch the effectiveness of the raw and iron doped zeolites for removing cyanide was compared by determining the final cyanide concentration in the solutions before and after treatment using carbon and nitrogen calculation measured by toc tn analyzer toc l shimadzu co desorption of cyanide from zeolites was not performed in this present study 2 4 kinetic and adsorption isotherm studies the kinetics of the process was studied by applying the adsorbed quantities of cyanide measured from experiments into two different single component kinetic models pseudo first order pfo model and pseudo second order pso model which have been mostly used and well reported in the literature 22 the quantity of cyanide adsorbed from aqueous solutions onto the adsorbents was calculated by the eq 1 as on the following 1 q e c 0 c e v m qe is the adsorption capacity in equilibrium mg g 1 c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cyanide mg l 1 respectively v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the zeolite g the adsorption isotherm analysis was performed by fitting the data of adsorbed cyanide using two mathematical expressions langmuir and freundlich isotherms table 1 showed the summary of the experimental method used in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption characteristics fig 1 showed the sem images of raw and modified iron doped zeolites as observed in fig 1 no significant difference in the morphology of untreated and iron doped zeolite was found since there was no chemical etching applied calcination process that was done to the zeolite worked to increase the porosity by evaporation of h2o trapped inside the micropores which then triggers the development and formation of a mesoporous matrix 27 the active sites of iron zeolite were obtained after thermal decomposition during the calcination 28 the uniform spherical structure of both raw and iron zeolite confirmed high surface areas which were suitable for adsorption selectivity 29 the iron doping process which was applied for modifying raw synthetic zeolite has been successfully filled the micropores and the actives sites of the zeolite the results from xrd analysis as shown in fig 2 explained that hematite fe2o3 existed in zeolite material after modification with fecl2 4h2o the presence of iron iii oxide indicated that the oxidation of iron ii ions seemed to have been occurred during the calcination process because there was oxygen content in the air this oxidation process could be prevented by calcining the iron zeolite in vacuum condition the surface characteristics of both raw and iron doped zeolites used in the experiments are reported in table 2 3 2 cyanide uptake by raw and iron doped zeolite the high volume of the porous structure and the ability to perform ion exchange are considered as the essential criteria of zeolite in adsorbing cyanide compounds as well as providing iron ion exchange the microporous and active sites which correspond to the surface sites resulted in promoting the adsorption process of cyanide those surface sites could remove cyanide either by adsorbing the compounds directly when making contact or facilitating the reaction between iron and cyanide the effect of contact time on cyanide adsorption onto zeolites were investigated for 72 h where the focus was set primarily at the first 24 h as depicted in fig 3 the cyanide removal by raw zeolite reached almost 100 for all initial cyanide concentrations after 24 h contacting time more adsorption times is needed to remove a higher initial concentration of cyanide this process would stop until the saturation of the active sites of the zeolites begins the cyanide removal performance of iron zeolite was apparently to be similar with raw zeolite as the surface characteristics of both adsorbents showed significant similarities both raw and iron zeolite removed more than 90 of cyanide concentration from the aqueous solutions however as presented in fig 1 b a higher amount of cyanide removed before 12 h before reached the equilibrium condition by iron zeolite this result implies that the presence of fe ions in the zeolite could increase the removal percentage of cyanide more than 20 from less than 50 up to 80 within 6 h of contact time the work conducted by noroozifar et al suggested that at ph around 10 5 cyanide compounds could be eliminated by iron cyanide bonding to form iron cyanide complexes the complex is either ferricyanide fe cn 6 3 or ferrocyanide fe cn 6 4 which are more stable than free cyanide 19 it is also reported that most researchers attained maximum cyanide adsorption onto different adsorbents in the ph range of 9 11 30 comparing the details of adsorption performance by the raw and iron zeolites from fig 4 it is clear that the affinity of iron cyanide was higher than the affinity between the active sites of zeolite and cyanide for all experiments tested with different initial cyanide concentration in each batch the cyanide removal process was happened faster in iron zeolite rather than raw zeolite this phenomenon was found before the equilibrium of the process which mostly occurred after contacted for 24 h the maximum adsorbed capacity of cyanide onto plain zeolite was slightly higher than the adsorption capacity of cyanide onto iron zeolite as figured out in fig 5 the equilibrium capacity of cyanide sorption of the modified zeolite decreased likely because of the iron doping process which caused the reduction of surface area of the zeolites 3 3 kinetic studies of cn adsorption onto raw and iron zeolites there are several possible mechanisms of cyanide adsorption as reported in the literature cyanide anionic functional groups binding on the surface of adsorbent 31 chemical ion exchange 30 surface precipitation and chemical reaction with surface sites of the adsorbent physical sorption 32 to understand the adsorption mechanism the kinetic study of cyanide uptake onto raw and iron zeolite was tested merely by fitting the experimental data into two single component models pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model as represented by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t 3 t q t 1 k 2 q 2 e t q e where qt qe are adsorption capacity at t and equilibrium mg g 1 respectively k is the constant of adsorption speed k1 for pfo model min 1 and k2 for pso g mg 1 min 1 t is contact time t the relationship of each component was compared statistically to find out a suitable kinetic model for explaining the cyanide uptake mechanisms the adsorption phenomena were explicitly described based on the characteristics of the model which fits with the experimental data from fig 6 it was shown that pseudo first order model lagergren first s order had a better adequacy in representing the kinetic behavior of cyanide adsorption onto raw zeolite with the average correlation coefficient r2 over 0 94 pfo relates to surface adsorption it means that either micropores or active sites over the surface of zeolites are responsible for the adsorption phenomena hence physisorption by active sites has likely happened during the cn uptake process the relationship between initial cyanide concentration and adsorption rate will not be linear when pore diffusion limits the adsorption process in this case linearity was restricted until 25 h reaction time it implies that the active sites had been saturated after 25 h table 3 showed the adsorption rate and calculated equilibrium capacity of cyanide adsorption compared to fig 6 on the other hand the cyanide adsorption onto iron zeolite known to be better explained by pseudo second order model as shown in fig 7 the plot of t qt versus t fig 7b gave a straight line with exquisite correlation coefficient as stated in table 4 thus pso is applicable to represent the adsorption kinetic of cyanide onto iron zeolite chemisorption iron cyanide complex formation likely controlled the overall adsorption rate of the process 33 and the rate was reduced with increasing cn concentration 3 4 isotherm of cn adsorption onto raw and iron zeolites the adsorption isotherm data were fitted with popular two parameter models langmuir and freundlich models as written in literature these isotherm models have been found applicable to cyanide sorption process 34 so they were employed to investigate the cyanide sorption onto iron zeolite the correlation coefficient r2 was applied to find out the best fit kinetic and isotherm models the isotherm expressions are given as in eq 4 for langmuir model and eq 5 for freundlich model 4 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m where qe represents the mass of cyanide per unit zeolite mg g 1 qm is the monolayer capacity b is the equilibrium constant and ce is the equilibrium concentration of the solution mg l 1 b was determined from the slope while qm corresponded to the intercept of the langmuir plot the langmuir isotherm is a commonly used to model the adsorption process on an entirely homogeneous surface with a negligible interaction between adsorbed molecules 35 the model assumes uniform adsorption energies onto the surface and maximum adsorption depends on the saturation level of a monolayer 5 l n q e 1 n l n c e l n k f where kf and n represent adsorption capacity and intensity respectively kf is an important constant used as a relative measure of adsorption efficiency the magnitude of n shows an indication of the favorability of adsorption values of n larger than 1 indicate the favorable nature of adsorption 36 the freundlich model is known as the earliest empirical equation and is shown to be consistent with the exponential distribution of active centers characteristic of non homogeneous surface 37 freundlich isotherm model can be applied to non ideal and reversible adsorption it is useful for the heterogeneous surface as well as multilayer sorption the isotherm constants for the above equilibrium models are shown in table 5 along with their respective r2 values fig 9 a and b showed the langmuir and freundlich isotherms for cyanide adsorption using iron zeolite respectively as informed in table 5 the r2 values for langmuir plot r2 0 991 were higher than freundlich plot r2 0 575 the finding revealed that langmuir isotherm could explain the adsorption equilibrium for the iron zeolite better the maximum adsorbed of cyanide onto iron zeolite which was 33 978 mg g 1 showed a higher number than another adsorbent s capacity 38 and can be seen in fig 8 the freundlich constant n value was 2 982 which is more than 1 therefore it indicated that iron zeolite is appropriate for cyanide adsorption it is noticed that the r2 of the langmuir plot was higher than the freundlich models hence the equilibrium adsorption of cyanide onto iron zeolite could be best fitted with the langmuir isotherm 4 conclusion the performance of raw and iron modified synthetic zeolite for adsorbing cyanide compound was compared the results revealed that iron doped zeolite has higher effectiveness for cyanide removal than raw zeolite owing to a faster adsorption speed the presence of iron in the zeolite was supposed to have a significant effect for eliminating cyanide from the solution it formed a strong complex iron cyanide though the iron content reduced the total adsorption capacity of the zeolite regarding the cyanide removal by iron modified synthetic zeolite was a chemisorption process adsorption improvement could still be enhanced by considerately changing the experimental parameters langmuir model was considered better in representing the adsorption isotherm therefore cyanide was presumed to have been adsorbed as a monolayer on adsorption sites that are homogeneously distributed over the surface of zeolite with a maximum uptake of 33 978 mg g 1 notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgment the authors greatly acknowledged the support from the indonesia endowment fund for education lpdp for providing the scholarship for the study and

established the aim of this study was to provide plant operators with a simple way to predict water quality degradation to this end simple correlations between indicators of suspended particles

increasing water stress is likely to occur due to population growth industrialization agricultural practices urbanization and climate change in southern europe for instance it is frequent to face water restrictions during summer especially in touristic areas in order to preserve the resource for potable use at the expense of recreational or even agricultural uses in parallel an increase of wastewater generation is observed due to both an increase in population and an increase of water use per person wastewater reuse defined as the use of treated municipal wastewater reclaimed water may be one of the appropriate responses to face global freshwater scarcity 1 in order to use reclaimed water for urban or agricultural purposes the quality of activated sludge secondary effluents is generally acceptable regarding to physicochemical indicators but a disinfection step is needed to remove microorganisms considering that some of them might be pathogenic for humans domestic animals or crops ultraviolet uv disinfection is now widely implemented as a tertiary treatment for wastewater reclamation indeed it is a robust and economically viable technology and it satisfactorily addresses two significant concerns about chlorination the formation of toxic by products and the low removal of protozoa as cryptosporidium 2 since the use of the provided water may have a direct impact on human health a continuous monitoring of the production process reliability is crucial the main indicator recommended is escherichia coli and other pathogens faecal indicator bacteria or pathogen surrogates 3 5 several guidelines and regulations concerning reclaimed water reuse have been adopted in the last years for agricultural or other uses each text has its own indicators and quality thresholds 3 french regulations define four quality levels depending of the use of reclaimed water considered the highest quality level applies to irrigation of all types of crops and unrestricted urban areas four microbial indicators are used e coli maximal count in treated water 250 cfu 100 ml faecal enterococci f rna coliphages and sulfilte reducing bacteria minimal log removal 4 log 6 in our study the microorganisms studied were e coli total coliforms and enterococci considering that the combination of these indicators is sufficiently representative of pathogen contamination risk 4 the impact of suspended particles on uv disinfection efficiency has been established and well documented 7 9 particles can diffuse light and reduce uv transmittance of water microorganisms can even be embedded in the particulate matter 7 9 particle microorganism association is regulated by the double layer theory 10 stating that attraction operates at two levels around the particle the secondary

influenced by several factors the principal one being the particle size bacteria are usually associated with particles larger than 10 μm 9 while viruses may be associated with smaller particles less

based on the use of a microorganism with calibrated uv inactivation response assessed with collimated beam reactor experiments 14 the inactivation observed through the uv disinfection system is compared to the calibrated uv inactivation response to establish an equivalence called reduction equivalent fluence ref this procedure of ref determination is recognized as one of the most accurate to assess the uv fluence applied in a reactor 15 in our study the microorganism chosen for ref determination was escherichia coli atcc 15597 the first step was to determine its uv inactivation constant for this purpose an overnight culture of e coli atcc 15597 was placed in incubation in luria liquid broth conda microbiology spain at 37 c during two to four hours in order to reach exponential growth phase absorbance at 600 nm above 1 this culture about 106 cfu ml was diluted in tap water in order to reach an uvt254 between 60 and 70 small volumes 15 ml of this culture were then exposed to uv

this experiment was repeated four times 2 3 uv disinfection experiments uv disinfection experiments were performed with effluents from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the south of france this wwtp was based on a conventional biological process scheme and treated mainly domestic wastewaters the pre treatment consisted on grids to eliminate macro wastes and on removal of grease and sands by

inactivation constant is very low for high ref this phenomenon is due to the fraction of microorganisms shielded from uv irradiation and it is called tailing 7 9 the uv response of microorganisms in the presence of particles can be described by combining the response of uv susceptible or free microorganisms and the response of microorganisms shielded from uv the following constants were determined fig 2 k1 inactivation constant of uv susceptible microorganisms k2 inactivation constant of microorganisms shielded from uv light tailing threshold t res40 residual colony count after exposition to a ref of 40 mj cm2 for the microorganisms studied a ref of 20 mj cm2 was considered as sufficient to obtain a maximal inactivation 7 log in pure water 17 in the presence of particles in

differences between datasets were deemed by non parametric tests wilcoxon signed rank test for paired datasets and mann whitney s test for independent datasets an alpha level of 0 05 was chosen as a threshold for significance linear regression was used to assess the strength of the relationship between two variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation constant of e coli atcc 15597 and ref determination the inactivation level of e coli atcc 15597 as a function of the uv fluence applied in the collimated beam reactor is presented in fig 3 as e coli is known to be sensitive to uv irradiation the inactivation constant was determined for uv fluences lower or equal to 15 mj cm2 in agreement with hijnen et al 17 the constant is given by the slope value of the linear regression between uv fluence and inactivation data it is independent of the water characteristics in a given range of application typically uvt254 60 as correction factors are applied during collimated beam experiments 14 for e coli atcc 15597 in our study the inactivation constant value was 0 31 0 02 cm2 mj r2 0 91 this value is in accordance with data found in the literature for various e coli strains with inactivation constant values between 0 3 and 0 6 cm2 mj 17 19 this experimental value was used to determine ref in the experimental uv reactor inactivation of e coli atcc 15597 in the experimental uv reactor was conducted with pure cultures diluted in tap water to obtain a volume of 50 l uvt254 values measured on diluted cultures for the four replicates were 64 8 67 1 67 9 and 68 6 respectively the inactivation kinetics were not significantly different between the four replicates wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 contrary to the collimated beam reactor it was not possible to apply correction factors depending to water characteristics hence the ref determined in the experimental reactor must be expressed in mj cm2 equivalent for uvt254 of 67 2 10 mm path length uv exposure times applied in the reactor 0 90 min corresponded to ref between 0 and 110 mj cm2 with a coefficient of variation of 10 based on the four replicates ref above 15 mj cm2 corresponding to the total inactivation of e coli atcc 15597 were extrapolated on a linear basis 3 2 secondary effluents characterization the range of values observed for water quality parameters measured on the activated sludge effluents used for uv disinfection experiments are presented in table 1 the secondary effluent at the outlet of the wwtp was characterized by a tss content around 2 mg l which is low in comparison with the quality threshold of 15 mg l tss defined by french regulations for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of all types of crops and unrestricted urban areas 6 this was confirmed by turbidity values under 1 ntu and uvt254 values around 70 table 1 the blending of mixed liquor from the aeration tank to the secondary effluent led to an increase of the particulate content more precisely liquor addition consisted on an input of large particles with an equivalent diameter above 25 μm table 1 and fig 4 indeed the content of particle of this size class was well correlated with tss r2 0 88 turbidity r2 0 94 and uvt254 r2 0 81 uvt254 of the filtered samples did not vary with liquor addition meaning that no significant amount of dissolved organic matter was brought by the liquor there was a significant input of iron consecutive to liquor addition but in its particulate form since the filtered iron content remained stable table 1 even if these particulate forms have an impact on uv disinfection due to scattering they are less susceptible to absorb uv light than dissolved forms of iron 20 the blending procedure implemented in this study between the mixed liquor and the secondary effluent of the wwtp may be representative of a dysfunction on the treatment process for instance it may correspond to a lack of aeration or another perturbation of the biological balance in the aerated tank which impacts the clarification step bulking or foaming phenomena and leads to the release of large particles at the outlet of the wwtp 21 3 3 impact of suspended particles on disinfection of uv susceptible microorganisms inactivation of uv susceptible microorganisms can be modeled by the inactivation constant k1 fig 2 for all the effluents studied k1 values for e coli and for the coliforms were not significantly different wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 considering the secondary effluent without addition of mixed liquor observed mean k1 values were 0 29 cm2 mj for e coli coliforms and 0 16 cm2 mj for enterococci these values were in accordance with literature data for environmental strains 17 22 23 addition of mixed liquor in the secondary effluent measured by a decrease of uvt254 resulted in decrease of k1 values a strong correlation r2 0 75 was established between the inactivation constant of uv susceptible e coli coliforms and enterococci and bulk indicators of suspended particles presence such as uvt254 fig 5 turbidity or tss this increase of uv resistance related to the presence of particles was due to two main factors uv light scattering by the particles and association of particles with bacteria 10 17 24 absorption of uv irradiation by aromatic compounds at the surface of the flocs may also occurred 25 particle size seems to be decisive to induce the shading of microorganisms madge jensen 8 observed that k1 inactivation constant of fecal coliforms associated with large particles size above 20 μm was significantly lower than for fecal coliforms associated with small flocs size under 5 μm concerning microorganisms embedded in particles azimi et al 26 established that liquor flocs are composed of an easily disinfectable loose outer shell and a physically stronger compact core inside they showed that k1 decreased significantly with increasing floc size and they hypothesized that this was due to the higher proportion on compact cores in bioflocs which reduces the uv penetration and hence increases the resistance to uv disinfection 26 industrial uv reactors are designed based on reduction equivalent fluence ref determination through biodosimetry measurements in our study ref were determined for a given water quality uvt254 of 67 2 to account for higher uv resistance decrease of k1 due to degraded water quality a correction factor has to be applied to the ref in order to estimate real uv fluences applied to the microorganisms when uvt254 decreases 26 this factor is directly proportional to the decrease of k1 based on eq 2 and on the slopes of the linear correlations presented in fig 5 it was possible to determine the relative value of ref as a function of uvt254 fig 6 data for coliforms e coli and for enterococci were gathered because no significant difference was observed between the slopes of the linear correlations presented in fig 5 wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 75 the empirical relationship presented in fig 6 may be useful to adjust the uv fluence applied in the reactor with the aim to maintain the ref defined by increasing uv lamps intensity 3 4 impact of suspended particles on disinfection of microorganisms shielded from uv light the fraction of coliforms and enterococci resistant to a ref of 40 mj cm2 was considered to be shielded from uv light and responsible for tailing spontaneous repair of uv damaged cells can occur but this phenomenon is considered as negligible in the dark 27 considering the secondary effluent without addition of mixed liquor no residual e coli colony count was observed after application of a ref of 40 mj cm2 conversely significant tailing was observed for coliforms and enterococci with res40 mean values of 6 and 2 mpn 100 ml respectively fig 7 in secondary effluents e coli is mainly in the form of dispersed mobile cells which are not prone to aggregation with particles 9 however it was observed that coliforms have an ability of self aggregation when cell density increases and in reaction to the stress induced by uv irradiation 28 in our study this phenomenon was not observed in the secondary effluent but it might be the case for other species in the coliforms group fig 7 enterococci are mainly in the form of non mobile cells and aggregated in chains and thus prone to self aggregation 29 the effect of mixed liquor blending with the secondary effluent was not significantly different regarding to the type of microorganism considered comparable value of the slope of the linear regression in fig 7 which tend to confirm that increasing aggregation was mainly due to large particles addition res40 determination for activated sludge effluents of degraded quality accounted for corrected ref using the empirical correlation presented in fig 6 a strong linear regression r2 0 85 was established between res40 and turbidity fig 7 uvt254 or tss these parameters are representative to an input of suspended particles from mixed liquor according to azimi et al 26 the fraction of microorganisms responsible for tailing is located in the compact cores of the liquor flocs larger flocs are more prone to induce tailing since they have several cores our results showed that it may be possible to predict the potential for tailing with a single indicator of suspended particles presence such as turbidity tss or uvt254 these results were obtained from a single wwtp even if the blending with mixed liquor represented several levels of degraded quality of the secondary effluent loge et al 30 developed an empirical model for coliforms to predict tailing based on the following functional form 3 n f d n 4 f a t s s a u v t 254 b where n is the effluent coliform density mpn 100 ml after exposure to a given fluence d of uv light and n a a and b are empirical coefficients whose value is equal to 1 877 101 133 0 976 and 4 053 respectively 30 comparison between the model and res40 values for coliforms is presented in fig 8 two fluences were tested to build the model 40 and 70 mj cm2 even if linear correlations were observed with res40 values in both cases r2 0 85 predicted data were closer to measured values of res40 when d 70 mj cm2 no significant difference p 0 55 than when d 40 mj cm2 significant difference p 0 05 fig 8 these results may be explained by the fact that loge et al used a mathematical simulation point source summation to determine the uv fluences applied in their reactor this method tend to overestimate the applied fluences in comparison with ref determination by biodosimetry 30 generalization of the correlations presented in this study must be done with caution as a matter of fact if the relationship between tailing and suspended solids content has been well described previously 9 17 18 22 few studies report linear correlations for instance qualls et al 18 described a correlation between the number of particles larger than 40 μm in diameter and the fraction of coliforms surviving a fluence of 26 mj cm2 with a r2 of 0 60 on a dataset gathering several types of secondary effluents the authors highlighted the influence of the suspended matter structure which may explain the weakness of their correlations more recently a significant difference was found in tailing potential between secondary effluents from activated sludge or from trickling filter treatment processes 12 even if the floc size was considered as decisive to predict tailing propensity the tailing level measured on trickling filter effluents was 2 log higher than that measured on activated sludge effluents despite the psd measurements showed that both effluents had a similar number of flocs greater than 50 μm according to azimi et al the resistance of compact cores to uv disinfection depends on their physical structure and on their chemical composition 13 26 31 the three main factors identified in order to limit tailing propensity were 1 low floc sphericity depending of operational conditions 2 high sludge retention time to induce natural decrease of microorganism cultivability and 3 presence of polyphosphate in the flocs from the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process 4 conclusion the correlations described in this study are valid for the wwtp studied and its direct application to other types of secondary effluents might not be appropriate even if our results were in accordance with the model developed by loge et al 30 from similar wwtp with activated sludge processes our study demonstrates that such correlations can be made at the scale of a wwtp and they can be used by the wastewater reclamation plant operator to predict the effect of secondary effluent quality degradation on the uv disinfection treatment process at two levels 1 to adjust the uv fluence applied in the reactor in order to maintain the ref defined by increasing uv lamps intensity 2 to define an alarm threshold above which the tailing potential compromises the reclaimed water biological quality the frequency of the measurements is a key point to ensure the reactivity of the treatment chain that is why the use of on line sensors to estimate tss turbidity and uvt254 is recommended 32 this study focuses on coliforms e coli and enterococci which are the main indicators used to assess water quality with the aim of reclamation further research is needed to study the behavior of other pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses or spores in the presence of suspended particles conflicts of interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the french

increasing water stress is likely to occur due to population growth industrialization agricultural practices urbanization and climate change in southern europe for instance it is frequent to face water restrictions during summer especially in touristic areas in order to preserve the resource for potable use at the expense of recreational or even agricultural uses in parallel an increase of wastewater generation is observed due to both an increase in population and an increase of water use per person wastewater reuse defined as the use of treated municipal wastewater reclaimed water may be one of the appropriate responses to face global freshwater scarcity 1 in order to use reclaimed water for urban or agricultural purposes the quality of activated sludge secondary effluents is generally acceptable regarding to physicochemical indicators but a disinfection step is needed to remove microorganisms considering that some of them might be pathogenic for humans domestic animals or crops ultraviolet uv disinfection is now widely implemented as a tertiary treatment for wastewater reclamation indeed it is a robust and economically viable technology and it satisfactorily addresses two significant concerns about chlorination the formation of toxic by products and the low removal of protozoa as cryptosporidium 2 since the use of the provided water may have a direct impact on human health a continuous monitoring of the production process reliability is crucial the main indicator recommended is escherichia coli and other pathogens faecal indicator bacteria or pathogen surrogates 3 5 several guidelines and regulations concerning reclaimed water reuse have been adopted in the last years for agricultural or other uses each text has its own indicators and quality thresholds 3 french regulations define four quality levels depending of the use of reclaimed water considered the highest quality level applies to irrigation of all types of crops and unrestricted urban areas four microbial indicators are used e coli maximal count in treated water 250 cfu 100 ml faecal enterococci f rna coliphages and sulfilte reducing bacteria minimal log removal 4 log 6 in our study the microorganisms studied were e coli total coliforms and enterococci considering that the combination of these indicators is sufficiently representative of pathogen contamination risk 4 the impact of suspended particles on uv disinfection efficiency has been established and well documented 7 9 particles can diffuse light and reduce uv transmittance of water microorganisms can even be embedded in the particulate matter 7 9 particle microorganism association is regulated by the double layer theory 10 stating that attraction operates at two levels around the particle the secondary energy zone 5 10 nm of the particle surface where the attraction is reversible and the primary energy zone 1 nm of the particle surface where the attraction is irreversible this mechanism is influenced by several factors the principal one being the particle size bacteria are usually associated with particles larger than 10 μm 9 while viruses may be associated with smaller particles less than 2 μm 11 recent works demonstrated that uv disinfection efficiency may be influenced by the great variability of biofloc size and structure found in secondary effluents large and compact flocs

experiments 14 for e coli atcc 15597 in our study the inactivation constant value was 0 31 0 02 cm2 mj r2 0 91 this value is in accordance with data found in the literature for various e coli strains with inactivation constant values between 0 3 and 0 6 cm2 mj 17 19 this experimental value was used to determine ref in the experimental uv reactor inactivation of e coli atcc 15597 in the experimental uv reactor was conducted with pure cultures diluted in tap water to obtain a volume of 50 l uvt254 values measured on diluted cultures for the four replicates were 64 8 67 1 67 9 and 68 6 respectively the inactivation kinetics were not significantly different between the four replicates wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 contrary to the collimated beam reactor it was not possible to apply correction factors depending to water characteristics hence the ref determined in the experimental reactor must be expressed in mj cm2 equivalent for uvt254 of 67 2 10 mm path length uv exposure times applied in the reactor 0 90 min corresponded to ref between 0 and 110 mj cm2 with a coefficient of variation of 10 based on the four replicates ref above 15 mj cm2 corresponding to the total inactivation of e coli atcc 15597 were extrapolated on a linear basis 3 2 secondary effluents characterization the range of values observed for water quality parameters measured on the activated sludge effluents used for uv disinfection experiments are presented in table 1 the secondary effluent at the outlet of the wwtp was characterized by a tss content around 2 mg l which is low in comparison with the quality threshold of 15 mg l tss defined by french regulations for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of all types of crops and unrestricted urban areas 6 this was confirmed by turbidity values under 1 ntu and uvt254 values around 70 table 1 the blending of mixed liquor from the aeration tank to the secondary effluent led to an increase of the particulate content more precisely liquor addition consisted on an input of large particles with an equivalent diameter above 25 μm table 1 and fig 4 indeed the content of particle of this size class was well correlated with tss r2 0 88 turbidity r2 0 94 and uvt254 r2 0 81 uvt254 of the filtered samples did not vary with liquor addition meaning that no significant amount of dissolved organic matter was brought by the liquor there was a significant input of iron consecutive to liquor addition but in its particulate form since the filtered iron content remained stable table 1 even if these particulate forms have an impact on uv disinfection due to scattering they are less susceptible to absorb uv light than dissolved forms of iron 20 the blending procedure implemented in this study between the mixed liquor and the secondary effluent of the wwtp may be representative of a dysfunction on the treatment process for instance it may correspond to a lack of aeration or another perturbation of the biological balance in the aerated tank which impacts the clarification step bulking or foaming phenomena and leads to the release of large particles at the outlet of the wwtp 21 3 3 impact of suspended particles on disinfection of uv susceptible microorganisms inactivation of uv susceptible microorganisms can be modeled by the inactivation constant k1 fig 2 for all the effluents studied k1 values for e coli and for the coliforms were not significantly different wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 considering the secondary effluent without addition of mixed liquor observed mean k1 values were 0 29 cm2 mj for e coli coliforms and 0 16 cm2 mj for enterococci these values were in accordance with literature data for environmental strains 17 22 23 addition of mixed liquor in the secondary effluent measured by a decrease of uvt254 resulted in decrease of k1 values a strong correlation r2 0 75 was established between the inactivation constant of uv susceptible e coli coliforms and enterococci and bulk indicators of suspended particles presence such as uvt254 fig 5 turbidity or tss this increase of uv resistance related to the presence of particles was due to two main factors uv light scattering by the particles and association of particles with bacteria 10 17 24 absorption of uv irradiation by aromatic compounds at the surface of the flocs may also occurred 25 particle size seems to be decisive to induce the shading of microorganisms madge jensen 8 observed that k1 inactivation constant of fecal coliforms associated with large particles size above 20 μm was significantly lower than for fecal coliforms associated with small flocs size under 5 μm concerning microorganisms embedded in particles azimi et al 26 established that liquor flocs are composed of an easily disinfectable loose outer shell and a physically stronger compact core inside they showed that k1 decreased significantly with increasing floc size and they hypothesized that this was due to the higher proportion on compact cores in bioflocs which reduces the uv penetration and hence increases the resistance to uv disinfection 26 industrial uv reactors are designed based on reduction equivalent fluence ref determination through biodosimetry measurements in our study ref were determined for a given water quality uvt254 of 67 2 to account for higher uv resistance decrease of k1 due to degraded water quality a correction factor has to be applied to the ref in order to estimate real uv fluences applied to the microorganisms when uvt254 decreases 26 this factor is directly proportional to the decrease of k1 based on eq 2 and on the slopes of the linear correlations presented in fig 5 it was possible to determine the relative value of ref as a function of uvt254 fig 6 data for coliforms e coli and for enterococci were gathered because no significant difference was observed between the slopes of the linear correlations presented in fig 5 wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 75 the empirical relationship presented in fig 6 may be useful to adjust the uv fluence applied in the reactor with the aim to maintain the ref defined by increasing uv lamps intensity 3 4 impact of suspended particles on disinfection of microorganisms shielded from uv light the fraction of coliforms and enterococci resistant to a ref of 40 mj cm2 was considered to be shielded from uv light and responsible for tailing spontaneous repair of uv damaged cells can occur but this phenomenon is considered as negligible in the dark 27 considering the secondary effluent without addition of mixed liquor no residual e coli colony count was observed after application of a ref of 40 mj cm2 conversely significant tailing was observed for coliforms and enterococci with res40 mean values of 6 and 2 mpn 100 ml respectively fig 7 in secondary effluents e coli is mainly in the form of dispersed mobile cells which are not prone to aggregation with particles 9 however it was observed that coliforms have an ability of self aggregation when cell density increases and in reaction to the stress induced by uv irradiation 28 in our study this phenomenon was not observed in the secondary effluent but it might be the case for other species in the coliforms group fig 7 enterococci are mainly in the form of non mobile cells and aggregated in chains and thus prone to self aggregation 29 the effect of mixed liquor blending with the secondary effluent was not significantly different regarding to the type of microorganism considered comparable value of the slope of the linear regression in fig 7 which tend to confirm that increasing aggregation was mainly due to large particles addition res40 determination for activated sludge effluents of degraded quality accounted for corrected ref using the empirical correlation presented in fig 6 a strong linear regression r2 0 85 was established between res40 and turbidity fig 7 uvt254 or tss these parameters are representative to an input of suspended particles from mixed liquor according to azimi et al 26 the fraction of microorganisms responsible for tailing is located in the compact cores of the liquor flocs larger flocs are more prone to induce tailing since they have several cores our results showed that it may be possible to predict the potential for tailing with a single indicator of suspended particles presence such as turbidity tss or uvt254 these results were obtained from a single wwtp even if the blending with mixed liquor represented several levels of degraded quality of the secondary effluent loge et al 30 developed an empirical model for coliforms to predict tailing based on the following functional form 3 n f d n 4 f a t s s a u v t 254 b where n is the effluent coliform density mpn 100 ml after exposure to a given fluence d of uv light and n a a and b are empirical coefficients whose value is equal to 1 877 101 133 0 976 and 4 053 respectively 30 comparison between the model and res40 values for coliforms is presented in fig 8 two fluences were tested to build the model 40 and 70 mj cm2 even if linear correlations were observed with res40 values in both cases r2 0 85 predicted data were closer to measured values of res40 when d 70 mj cm2 no significant difference p 0 55 than when d 40 mj cm2 significant difference p 0 05 fig 8 these results may be explained by the fact that loge et al used a mathematical simulation point source summation to determine the uv fluences applied in their reactor this method tend to overestimate the applied fluences in comparison with ref determination by biodosimetry 30 generalization of the correlations presented in this study must be done with caution as a matter of fact if the relationship between tailing and suspended solids content has been well described previously 9 17 18 22 few studies report linear correlations for instance qualls et al 18 described a correlation between the number of particles larger than 40 μm in diameter and the fraction of coliforms surviving a fluence of 26 mj cm2 with a r2 of 0 60 on a dataset gathering several types of secondary effluents the authors highlighted the influence of the suspended matter structure which may explain the weakness of their correlations more recently a significant difference was found in tailing potential between secondary effluents from activated sludge or from trickling filter treatment processes 12 even if the floc size was considered as decisive to predict tailing propensity the tailing level measured on trickling filter effluents was 2 log higher than that measured on activated sludge effluents despite the psd measurements showed that both effluents had a similar number of flocs greater than 50 μm according to azimi et al the resistance of compact cores to uv disinfection depends on their physical structure and on their chemical composition 13 26 31 the three main factors identified in order to limit tailing propensity were 1 low floc sphericity depending of operational conditions 2 high sludge retention time to induce natural decrease of microorganism cultivability and 3 presence of polyphosphate in the flocs from the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process 4 conclusion the correlations described in this study are valid for the wwtp studied and its direct application to other types of secondary effluents might not be appropriate even if our results were in accordance with the model developed by loge et al 30 from similar wwtp with activated sludge processes our study demonstrates that such correlations can be made at the scale of a wwtp and they can be used by the wastewater reclamation plant operator to predict the effect of secondary effluent quality degradation on the uv disinfection treatment process at two levels 1 to adjust the uv fluence applied in the reactor in order to maintain the ref defined by increasing uv lamps intensity 2 to define an alarm threshold above which the tailing potential compromises the reclaimed water biological quality the frequency of the measurements is a key point to ensure the reactivity of the treatment chain that is why the use of on line sensors to estimate tss turbidity and uvt254 is recommended 32 this study focuses on coliforms e coli and enterococci which are the main indicators used to assess water quality with the aim of reclamation further research is needed to study the behavior of other pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses or spores in the presence of suspended particles conflicts of interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the french

14582,dissolved organic matter dom in a full scale membrane bioreactor for domestic wastewater treatment céline jacquin noémie gambier geoffroy lesage marc heran institut européen des membranes iem umr 5635 enscm cnrs univ montpellier montpellier france institut européen des membranes iem umr 5635 enscm cnrs univ montpellier montpellier france corresponding author graphical abstract dissolved organic matter dom and active biomass concentrations from a full scale membrane bioreactor mbr treating domestic wastewater were investigated during a period of 488 days bulk dom is known to be a major membrane foulant in mbr active biomass activity which depends on operating parameter variations is a major source of dom due to soluble microbial product smp secretion to establish the link between dom active biomass concentration operating conditions and later membrane fouling heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were first quantified using respirometric measurements comparing their evolution with operating conditions and parameters using principal component analysis pca srt and temperature were identified as the parameters with the most impact on active biomass concentrations proteins from biopolymers and humic substance hs bb concentrations were quantified using a 3deem pseudo quantitative method active biomass and dom concentration fluctuations were similar confirming that dom was mainly constituted by smp produced by the active biomass and consequently dependent on srt and temperature modifications hs bb were produced eight times faster than proteins from bp and therefore accumulated faster on the membrane despite their low membrane rejection consequently large amounts of hs bb can accumulate modifying the initial membrane properties the membrane resistance evolution was dependent on proteins from biopolymers accumulation and these molecules showed no fouling propensity modifications despite seasonal variations as a consequence this study strongly emphasized the interest of using a 3deem pseudo quantitative method for on line application in order to follow the full scale mbr process and membrane fouling abbreviations 3deem three dimensional

fouling is a major limitation for the widespread application of membrane bioreactors mbr since it reduces wastewater treatment plant wwtp productivity and in the long term damages the integrity of the membrane 1 3 as the activated sludge is a very complex matrix in contact with the membrane fouling mechanisms in mbr are difficult to understand 4 deposition mechanisms are mainly dependent on size and particulate fraction is easily removed through mechanical action such as air scouring backwashing or the use of mechanical cleaning particles 5 6 dom which refers to bulk supernatant colloidal and soluble organic fraction remains in the low shear stress area close to the membrane surface this fraction is therefore more prone to the generation of significant fouling 7 bulk dom is defined as a complex and heterogeneous mixture of three different classes of compounds classified according to their origins natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products smp and xenobiotic micropollutants 8 9 however due to the intense biochemical processes in activated sludge smp are usually defined as the main dom compounds 10 2 two smp classes can be distinguished utilization associated products uap associated with substrate uptake and biomass growth and biomass associated products bap associated with biomass decay 11 smp dynamic changes therefore reflect the active biomass physiological and dynamic state one of the major challenges in the study of membrane fouling is to describe the formation of membrane foulants 3 this approach is necessary to implement strategies for fouling episode anticipation 12 active biomass is usually followed using mlvss assessments 13 14 however some studies found that mlvss is not an appropriate indicator to properly quantify active biomass indeed pajoum shariati et al 15 pointed out different biomass activities for similar mlvss values respirometric measurements can be used to quantify physiological activity 16 combined with inhibitor injection heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass activities can be assessed 17 however no direct quantification was performed using respirometric measurements to quantify dom which is mostly composed of polysaccharides proteins and humic substances 18 20 classical colorimetric methods are often used 21 22 nevertheless they were found not to be relevant for dom study due to the great deal of interference 23 other methods such as three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescent 3deem are increasingly employed to follow dom evolution in wastewater systems 24 25 to overcome a possible quenching effect 26 precautions should be taken for analysis one of which is sample filtration and dilution 25 another issue of 3deem is the lack of extraction methods of the data and the difficulty to link these data to a specific concentration 25 to address this gap a recent study highlighted that 3deem can be used for proteins from biopolymers humic substance and building block hs bb quantification and can potentially be used as an on line indicator to describe the fate and behavior of dom more precisely 27 thus to better understand the mbr process and fouling phenomena a combination of active biomass and dom characterization methods may be considered 28 indeed active biomass and consequently bulk dom depend on numerous factors feed wastewater hrt srt temperature cleaning procedures etc 18 29 since activated sludge is constituted of an ecosystem constantly adapting to environmental conditions 30 from this statement many studies have tried to identify the influence of operating parameters or feeding conditions on dom composition while comparing bulk dom from mbr treating industrial wastewater and mbr treating urban wastewater shen et al 19 identified noteworthy differences other studies also identified differences depending on the studied system due to fluctuations in operating conditions or according to the season 31 20 12 for fouling prediction different authors identified links between dom and membrane fouling indicators 32 34 for example lesjean et al 2005 33 observed a linear correlation between polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk supernatant and the membrane fouling rate dr dt besides dom concentrations it was reported that microbial community structure and metabolism modifications also lead to fluctuations in dom fouling characteristics 12 however no direct link between dom biomass activity and fouling was established for mbr at full scale activity in order to better anticipate and control fouling episodes it is of major interest to clearly identify the possible links between active biomass and dom as well as dom fouling culprits 35 from these statements this study focused on the dom fouling behavior in a full scale mbr subject to seasonal variations mbr mixed liquor and permeate were sampled to quantify the different active biomass populations and investigate their link with operating conditions dom composition and variations were then determined using the 3deem pseudo quantitative method and compared to active biomass variations using 3deem it was possible to calculate dom production rates and their accumulated mass per membrane unit in a full scale mbr operation this original approach was used to evaluate the interest of using 3deem monitoring with pseudo quantitative analysis in order to further understand and control dom membrane fouling in domestic wwtp 2 material and methods 2 1 studied mbr and samples a full scale domestic wwtp equipped with mbr located close to montpellier france was studied from march 2015 to july 2016 488 days the plant was started in 2012 and was designed to treat 13 000 m3 d of domestic wastewater the wwtp performed biological nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification and biological dephosphatation the characteristics of the wastewater at the inlet of the wwtp are presented in table 1 the wwtp is located in a tourist area where the population is sparse from october to may referred to as the low season ls during ls the plant receives about 8000 person equivalents p e and the average inlet flow rate is recorded at 2230 590 m3 d during the high season hs which takes place from june to september the wwtp receives up to 60 000 p e and the average flow rate at the inlet was recorded at 3953 1274 m3 d this wwtp was therefore designed with two biological reactor lines equipped with a common membrane separation step consisting of four mbr tanks one biological reactor line is used during ls and the two biological reactors lines are in use during hs the characteristics of biological reactors during both ls and hs are available in supplementary data table a1 between the ls and hs periods transitory periods can be observed which correspond to the progressive start up of the second line before hs or its progressive closing after hs the four mbrs were equipped with kubota submerged membrane unit smu rw400 kubota japan flat sheet microporous membranes made of chlorinated polyethylene total surface area of 16 240 m2 with an average pore size of 0 2 μm for this study only one of the four mbr was sampled hence activated sludge samples and permeate samples were regularly taken in the studied mbr tank and mbr outlet respectively activated sludge samples were then filtrated through a 1 2 μm filter to collect bulk supernatant a chemical cleaning solution was also sampled in june 2016 during the membrane chemical cleaning stage with hcl for further analysis 2 2 classical analytical methods mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured according to standard methods 12 2 3 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy 3deem analyses were performed in duplicate using a perkin elmer ls 55 spectrometer usa measurement set up and data analysis are described by jacquin et al 27 spectra are divided into four areas defined by chen et al 36 corresponding to the different group of fluorophores described in table 2 to estimate the fluorescent dom retained by the membrane a subtraction was performed between the spectrum obtained from bsmbr samples and pmbr samples to generate a new spectrum called rmbr this method allows a quick visual estimation of dom which was retained by the membrane and could therefore be implied in fouling mechanisms from dom spectra it is possible to calculate proteins from biopolymers bp and hs bb humic substances and building blocks concentrations in mgc l by calculating the volume of fluorescence φ i eq 1 in smp like and fa ha like regions and

by these arrows 42 43 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane bioreactor operating conditions fig 1 a shows the organic load total volume of the reactors and temperature during ls hs and transitory periods highlighting the second line start up or closure interestingly temperature variations followed the reactors volume trend with minimum temperatures in winter 14 c when the population was sparse and temperature rises in summer 31 c corresponding to the peak of the tourist season population increase was followed through organic load variations this parameter was multiplied by 1 7 1500 2700 kgcod d between april and july 2015 2016 justifying the second line start up this starting phase allowed better management of the wwtp since a relatively constant hrt and olr could be maintained throughout the year fig 1b and c before second line start up the operators stopped sludge removal to promote an mlss concentration increase in anticipation of mlss dilution due to the filling of the second biological tank moreover through the mlss increase the f m ratio could be maintained fig 1c and d however a sharp mlss decline still occurred temporarily during the transitory periods before hs hence the different periods especially transitory and hs periods were characterized by unsteady conditions indeed due to the specific location of the wwtp the operating parameters were constantly adjusted to the influent flow i e population variations parameters such as temperature were identified as responsible for the microbial community structure and metabolism modification 44 this is of major interest since changes in smp concentrations and composition can impact membrane fouling 20 12 from these statements the active biomass variations were studied over time and compared with operating parameter changes with times 3 2 active biomass evolution the respirometric measurements were used to further characterize mlvss composition thus active biomass concentrations were calculated according to their specificity heterotrophic bacteria xh ammonium oxidizing bacteria xaob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria xnob fig 2 shows the active biomass variations over time and table 4 gives the mean values according to the seasonal period the mlvss fraction represented 74 5 on average of the total particulate organic fraction present in the suspension mlss which is characteristic of activated sludge with low f m ratio inert accumulation within the particulate organic matter the active biomass was measured at relatively low concentrations especially during ls period indeed the total active biomass represented 13 7 of the particulate organic fraction during ls compared to 27 9 in hs mlvss is therefore not an appropriate parameter to directly quantify active biomass 15 heterotrophic bacteria were predominant as expected and represent around 8 4 and 17 8 of the particulate organic fraction during ls and hs respectively these values were in adequation with the organic load increase fig 1a reported in section 3 1 on the contrary autotrophic populations were in a minority in comparison with heterotrophic populations but the aob population was generally measured at a higher concentration than the nob population 60 20 and 41 23 of the total autotrophic biomass respectively due to their slow growth rate μmax from 0 83 to 0 99 1 d 45 autotrophic bacteria concentrations especially nob increased significantly at the beginning of an hs period this could be explained by the srt increase up to 110 d or by temperature increase stimulating the growth of bacteria and boosting their activity figs fig 1figs 1a b and fig 22a important active biomass concentrations variations were therefore observed between the different periods ls hs and transitory periods supporting the hypothesis that seasonal operating parameters change the impact of active biomass population increase and reductions in order to find the parameters with the greatest impact on these variations a pca including active biomass concentrations and the operating parameter values was performed fig 2b the pca total variance represented 66 16 shows that operating parameters didn t have the same impact on active biomass populations the small angle observed between xaob xnob and temperature variables confirms that higher temperatures induced a higher autotrophic growth rate the nitrogen load also influenced autotrophic biomass since more nitrogen is required for the autotroph metabolism surprisingly the organic load variable was not correlated with the xh variable on the contrary heterotrophic biomass was influenced by a higher srt which is consistent with the results in fig 2a where higher xh concentrations were observed during the transitory period or at the beginning of the hs period the mlvss variable was badly represented in the pca short arrow despite the small angles with autotrophic biomass variables moreover it was not correlated with xh confirming that mlvss was not appropriate to quantify active biomass finally the concentration factor srt hrt variable corresponding to a concentration factor of inert compounds in the mbr 41 did not directly influence heterotrophic nor autotrophic biomass concentration thus from pca results srt and temperature were the parameters of greatest influence on global active biomass populations while the nitrogen load mostly impacted autotrophic biomass 3 3 dom characterization fate and fouling propensities 3 3 1 dom fate in bulk supernatant to detect the active biomass impact on dom proteins from biopolymers and hs bb concentrations in the bulk supernatant calculated using eqs 2 4 were normalized by dividing them by the total active biomass concentration xtot fig 3 as already observed by sun et al 20 humic substances were the main dom constituents in the mbr bulk supernatant indeed proteins from bp were around ten times less concentrated than hs bb humic substances fig 3 high hs bb concentration is typical to mbr possessing abundant microorganisms growing at the endogenous stage low f m that produce bap containing a large proportion of humic substances 10 this is confirmed by the relatively stable ratio between dom and xtot concentrations during the whole sampling period most of the dom compounds were secreted by microorganisms and belong to the smp group which is consistent with the study of kunacheva et al 2 between april and may 2015 and 2016 despite a stable total active biomass concentration fig 2a important dom peaks for both proteins from bp and hs bb were visible fig 3 however no active biomass death or growth was involved in these excessive dom productions they must be explained by f m ratio drops observed corresponding to ol shocks observed before the beginning of a new hs fig 1a and c in this specific case active biomass was under starvation conditions probably leading to smp secretion that could be explained by more cell lysis and more intracellular compound consumption under high endogenous respiration 12 except for these peaks dom concentration variations were due to active biomass activity changes thus these variations were probably dependent on srt and temperature which were identified as the parameters impacting the microbial communities the most section 3 2 3 3 2 dom fouling propensities to estimate dom fouling propensities the spectrum corresponding to the retained dom was calculated following the procedure in section 2 3 fig 4 a and the hcl solution collected after a cleaning procedure day 256 was analyzed using 3deem fig 4b the spectrum visible in fig 4a was characterized as expected by dom fluorescing in region iv corresponding to smp like fluorophores used to quantify proteins from biopolymers due to their size 20 kda proteins from biopolymers were reported to be retained by the membrane at around 77 in a previous study 27 dom fluorescing in region i ii corresponding to prot1 2 like fluorophores was also retained by the membrane hence among dom molecules the one containing fluorophores in regions iv and i ii could be an interesting indicator to study external fouling 46 the spectrum visible in fig 4b corresponds to the hcl cleaning solution used to remove irreversible membrane fouling in this case only one fluorescence peak was observed in region v corresponding to compounds having ha like fluorophores hs bb compounds fluorescing in region iii and region v therefore had a significant contribution to the long term fouling this is consistent with results in the literature since humic substances tend to adsorb onto membrane surface due to their hydrophobic nature 35 47 membrane retentions of the two dom molecule classes were represented in fig 5 a and b interestingly no significant differences were observed between the ls and hs fig 5a and b membrane retention is not sufficient to highlight dom fouling propensity fluctuations over time as a function of operating parameters or seasonal variations higher protein from bp membrane retention was visible average value 54 in comparison with hs bb average value 13 despite higher concentrations hs bb membrane retention was lower between 0 and 25 implying a different dom biological production rate thus using eq 9 it was possible to estimate the production rate of hs bb in comparison with proteins from bp 41 the calculated production rate ratio ranged from 1 to 24 eq 9 with an average value of 8 hs bb production rate was therefore 8 times higher than the proteins from bp production rate this observation corroborates with the aforementioned hypothesis and strongly emphasizes the impact of hs bb on fouling mechanisms with an average membrane retention of 13 and a mean concentration of 5 0 mgc l around 0 65 mgc of hs bb per liter of treated water will accumulate onto and into the membrane this result confirms the impact of hs bb compounds in the long term fouling despite their low membrane rejection on the contrary proteins from bp production rate is lower as well as their concentration this is probably due to the low f m leading to protein consumption 12 however these compounds are rejected more by the membrane and can consequently have a big impact on membrane fouling due to their size 48 3 4 membrane fouling and dom accumulation membrane fouling dynamics can be observed through the evolution with time of the mean daily membrane hydraulic resistance 1 m as shown in fig 6 the membrane hydraulic resistance varied from 4 6 1011 to 4 6 1012 1 m and was controlled by the continuous supply of air to the membrane processes and chemical cleaning cc during the sampling period four chemical cleaning operations were performed cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc4 from cc1 to cc3 membrane resistance increased with time between two cleanings fig 6 these filtration periods were qualified as phase 1 cc1 cc2 and phase 2 cc2 cc3 surprisingly between cc3 and cc4 membrane resistance decreased with time this trend is abnormal in comparison to classical membrane resistance evolution 49 thus only phase 1 and phase 2 were studied in the subsequent steps of the study dom effect on membrane filtration was evaluated through hs bb and proteins from bp accumulation onto the membrane using eq 10 this equation hypothesizes that each liter of bulk supernatant filtered by the membrane will bring a dom mass equal to its concentration on membrane surface however only the rejected fraction could be accumulated on the membrane surface dom accumulations were therefore represented as a function of membrane retention in fig 7 a and b interestingly about 5 g m2 and 7 26 g m2 of proteins from bp and hs bb respectively were obtained consequently internal fouling due to hs bb cannot be neglected in membrane fouling studies and for control optimization due to high hs bb concentrations and production rates section 3 3 2 despite a lower accumulated amount of proteins from bp around 5 g m2 the trend between both filtration phases is identical this could mean that membrane resistance was mostly dependent on proteins from bp deposition this is consistent with the results obtained by jacquin et al 50 indeed dom fractions filtration sampled in the same full scale mbr has shown that proteins from bp are the main responsible of fouling by cake formation on an other hand humic substances hs bb cause more irreversible fouling due to strong interactions between hydrophobic molecules and membrane surface for both phases the accumulation sharply increased with no effect on membrane resistance but after an accumulation of 4 g m2 membrane resistance drastically increased this phenomenon was also visible in fig 7a and b corresponding to the classic tmp jump observed in mbr studies this can be explained by a two step process first a gradual deposition of dissolved foulants smp followed by cake formation that could be due to smp accumulation or to biofilm consolidation 23 51 no impact of seasonal variations was observed on proteins from bp fouling propensities since the trends were similar for both phases on the contrary a greater accumulation of hs bb was observed during phase 2 this indicates that hs bb fouling propensities could vary over time but will not significantly impact membrane resistance thus hs bb fouling cannot be monitored using only a membrane resistance indicator this strongly suggests the interest of using 3deem for on line monitoring to further understand membrane fouling 4 conclusion this study aimed to understand the possible links between the active biomass the operating parameters dom and the membrane fouling in order to enhance knowledge about fouling and its possible control using respirometric measurements it was first possible to notice that low active biomass concentrations were determined even during the high season confirming that mlvss concentration was not a relevant indicator to estimate and follow active biomass concentration in an mbr plant from the active biomass concentrations and using pca it was possible to highlight the srt and temperature influence on the microbial activity and consequently its associated production of by products smp indeed using 3deem to estimate proteins from bp and hs bb concentrations using the calibration estimated in a previous study it was possible to confirm that most of the dom including humic substances was smp products secreted by microorganisms this was confirmed by the constant ratio between dom and active biomass concentrations then from the dom concentrations and membrane retentions it was possible to observe that most of the dom was constituted of hs bb that were secreted about 8 times faster than proteins from bp despite low membrane retention the accumulated mass of hs bb per membrane unit was large mostly corresponding to internal fouling which was seasonal dependent hs bb fouling properties can therefore change with time however high hs bb concentrations are classic in low f m operated mbr to limit long term fouling it could be of major interest to decrease mlvss concentration increase f m ratio since it was directly linked to active biomass concentration finally by plotting the dom accumulation as a function of membrane resistance it was possible to hypothesize that proteins from bp accumulation were linked to a membrane resistance increase despite their low concentrations in the mbr tank interestingly regardless of the filtration phase an accumulated mass of 5 g m2 corresponded to a drastic increase in membrane resistance thus no significant fouling propensity changes were observed for proteins from bp their accumulation corresponding to external fouling is mostly due to their size and not fouling propensity modifications the interest of the 3deem calibrations was therefore highlighted however as it was specified in the paper developing this method 27 it is worthy to note that these calibrations are site specific and a new calibration should be done to apply this method for a different system acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the french water agency for supporting this study through the project enermod special thanks are

14582,dissolved organic matter dom in a full scale membrane bioreactor for domestic wastewater treatment céline jacquin noémie gambier geoffroy lesage marc heran institut européen des membranes iem umr 5635 enscm cnrs univ montpellier montpellier france institut européen des membranes iem umr 5635 enscm cnrs univ montpellier montpellier france corresponding author graphical abstract dissolved organic matter dom and active biomass concentrations from a full scale membrane bioreactor mbr treating domestic wastewater were investigated during a period of 488 days bulk dom is known to be a major membrane foulant in mbr active biomass activity which depends on operating parameter variations is a major source of dom due to soluble microbial product smp secretion to establish the link between dom active biomass concentration operating conditions and later membrane fouling heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were first quantified using respirometric measurements comparing their evolution with operating conditions and parameters using principal component analysis pca srt and temperature were identified as the parameters with the most impact on active biomass concentrations proteins from biopolymers and humic substance hs bb concentrations were quantified using a 3deem pseudo quantitative method active biomass and dom concentration fluctuations were similar confirming that dom was mainly constituted by smp produced by the active biomass and consequently dependent on srt and temperature modifications hs bb were produced eight times faster than proteins from bp and therefore accumulated faster on the membrane despite their low membrane rejection consequently large amounts of hs bb can accumulate modifying the initial membrane properties the membrane resistance evolution was dependent on proteins from biopolymers accumulation and these molecules showed no fouling propensity modifications despite seasonal variations as a consequence this study strongly emphasized the interest of using a 3deem pseudo quantitative method for on line application in order to follow the full scale mbr process and membrane fouling abbreviations 3deem three dimensional

fouling is a major limitation for the widespread application of membrane bioreactors mbr since it reduces wastewater treatment plant wwtp productivity and in the long term damages the integrity of the membrane 1 3 as the activated sludge is a very complex matrix in contact with the membrane fouling mechanisms in mbr are difficult to understand 4 deposition mechanisms are mainly dependent on size and particulate fraction is easily removed through mechanical action such as air scouring backwashing or the use of mechanical cleaning particles 5 6 dom which refers to bulk supernatant colloidal and soluble organic fraction remains in the low shear stress area close to the membrane surface this fraction is therefore more prone to the generation of significant fouling 7 bulk dom is defined as a complex and heterogeneous mixture of three different classes of compounds classified according to their origins natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products smp and xenobiotic micropollutants 8 9 however due to the intense biochemical processes in activated sludge smp are usually defined as the main dom compounds 10 2 two smp classes can be distinguished utilization associated products uap associated with substrate uptake and biomass growth and biomass associated products bap associated with biomass decay 11 smp dynamic changes therefore reflect the active biomass physiological and dynamic state one of the major challenges in the study of membrane fouling is to describe the formation of membrane foulants 3 this approach is necessary to implement strategies for fouling episode anticipation 12 active biomass is usually followed using mlvss assessments 13 14 however some studies found that mlvss is not an appropriate indicator to properly quantify active biomass indeed pajoum shariati et al 15 pointed out different biomass activities for similar mlvss values respirometric measurements can be used to quantify physiological activity 16 combined with inhibitor injection heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass activities can be assessed 17 however no direct quantification was performed using respirometric measurements to quantify dom which is mostly composed of polysaccharides proteins and humic substances 18 20 classical colorimetric methods are often used 21 22 nevertheless they were found not to be relevant for dom study due to the great deal of interference 23 other methods such as three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescent 3deem are increasingly employed to follow dom evolution in wastewater systems 24 25 to overcome a possible quenching effect 26 precautions should be taken for analysis one of which is sample filtration and dilution 25 another issue of 3deem is the lack of extraction methods of the data and the difficulty to link these data to a specific concentration 25 to address this gap a recent study highlighted that 3deem can be used for proteins from biopolymers humic substance and building block hs bb quantification and can potentially be used as an on line indicator to describe the fate and behavior of dom more precisely 27 thus to better understand the mbr process and fouling phenomena a combination of active biomass and dom characterization methods may be considered 28 indeed active biomass and consequently bulk dom depend on numerous factors feed wastewater hrt srt temperature cleaning procedures etc 18 29 since activated sludge is constituted of an ecosystem constantly adapting to environmental conditions 30 from this statement many studies have tried to identify the influence of operating parameters or feeding conditions on dom composition while comparing bulk dom from mbr treating industrial wastewater and mbr treating urban wastewater shen et al 19 identified noteworthy differences other studies also identified differences depending on the studied system due to fluctuations in operating conditions or according to the season 31 20 12 for fouling prediction different authors identified links between dom and membrane fouling indicators 32 34 for example lesjean et al 2005 33 observed a linear correlation between polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk supernatant and the membrane fouling rate dr dt besides dom concentrations it was reported that microbial community structure and metabolism modifications also lead to fluctuations in dom fouling characteristics 12 however no direct link between dom biomass activity and fouling was established for mbr at full scale activity in order to better anticipate and control fouling episodes it is of major interest to clearly identify the possible links between active biomass and dom as well as dom fouling culprits 35 from these statements this study focused on the dom fouling behavior in a full scale mbr subject to seasonal variations mbr mixed liquor and permeate were sampled to quantify the different active biomass populations and investigate their link with operating conditions dom composition and variations were then determined using the 3deem pseudo quantitative method and compared to active biomass variations using 3deem it was possible to calculate dom production rates and their accumulated mass per membrane unit in a full scale mbr operation this original approach was used to evaluate the interest of using 3deem monitoring with pseudo quantitative analysis in order to further understand and control dom membrane fouling in domestic wwtp 2 material and methods 2 1 studied mbr and samples a full scale domestic wwtp equipped with mbr located close to montpellier france was studied from march 2015 to july 2016 488 days the plant was started in 2012 and was designed to treat 13 000 m3 d of domestic wastewater the wwtp performed biological nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification and biological dephosphatation the characteristics of the wastewater at the inlet of the wwtp are presented in table 1 the wwtp is located in a tourist area where the population is sparse from october to may referred to as the low season ls during ls the plant receives about 8000 person equivalents p e and the average inlet flow rate is recorded at 2230 590 m3 d during the high season hs which takes place from june to september the wwtp receives up to 60 000 p e and the average flow rate at the inlet was recorded at 3953 1274 m3 d this wwtp was therefore designed with two biological reactor lines equipped with a common membrane separation step consisting of four mbr tanks one biological reactor line is used during ls and the two biological reactors lines are in use during hs the characteristics of biological reactors during both ls and hs are available in supplementary data table a1 between the ls and hs periods transitory periods can be observed which correspond to the progressive start up of the second line before hs or its progressive closing after hs the four mbrs were equipped with kubota submerged membrane unit smu rw400 kubota japan flat sheet microporous membranes made of chlorinated polyethylene total surface area of 16 240 m2 with an average pore size of 0 2 μm for this study only one of the four mbr was sampled hence activated sludge samples and permeate samples were regularly taken in the studied mbr tank and mbr outlet respectively activated sludge samples were then filtrated through a 1 2 μm filter to collect bulk supernatant a chemical cleaning solution was also sampled in june 2016 during the membrane chemical cleaning stage with hcl for further analysis 2 2 classical analytical methods mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured according to standard methods 12 2 3 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy 3deem analyses were performed in duplicate using a perkin elmer ls 55 spectrometer usa measurement set up and data analysis are described by jacquin et al 27 spectra are divided into four areas defined by chen et al 36 corresponding to the different group of fluorophores described in table 2 to estimate the fluorescent dom retained by the membrane a subtraction was performed between the spectrum obtained from bsmbr samples and pmbr samples to generate a new spectrum called rmbr this method allows a quick visual estimation of dom which was retained by the membrane and could therefore be implied in fouling mechanisms from dom spectra it is possible to calculate proteins from biopolymers bp and hs bb humic substances and building blocks concentrations in mgc l by calculating the volume of fluorescence φ i eq 1 in smp like and fa ha like regions and using eqs 2 4 table 3 1 φ i m f i e x e m i λ e x λ e m δ λ e x δ λ e m mf i is a multiplication factor to compare the φ i measured in the different regions despite their different measured area δlex

the milli q water raman peak area raman units 37 2 4 active biomass concentration measurements to measure microbial community respirometric activity activated sludge samples were placed in an aerated tank for 24 h without any external substrate input to ensure an endogenous state activated sludge was then transferred into a sealed bottle 250 ml where the dissolved oxygen was monitored using a dissolved oxygen do sensor oxi 340i wtw usa to calculate the oxygen uptake rate our the first step consisted of the endogenous our measurement ourtot corresponding to the total active biomass

rstudio software the pca is a statistical method allowing the representation of the studied variables as an arrow in a 2d space calculated from all variables pca representativeness is estimated by calculating the total variance represented by the two generated axes principal components the small angle between the arrows of variables indicates strong correlation between the variables represented by these arrows 42 43 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane bioreactor operating conditions fig 1 a shows the organic load total volume of the reactors and temperature during ls hs and transitory periods highlighting the second line start up or closure interestingly temperature variations followed the reactors volume trend with minimum temperatures in winter 14 c when the population was sparse and temperature rises in summer 31 c corresponding to the peak of the tourist season population increase was followed through organic load variations this parameter was multiplied by 1 7 1500 2700 kgcod d between april and july 2015 2016 justifying the second line start up this starting phase allowed better management of the wwtp since a relatively constant hrt and olr could be maintained throughout the year fig 1b and c before second line start up the operators stopped sludge removal to promote an mlss concentration increase in anticipation of mlss dilution due to the filling of the second biological tank moreover through the mlss increase the f m ratio could be maintained fig 1c and d however a sharp mlss decline still occurred temporarily during the transitory periods before hs hence the different periods especially transitory and hs periods were characterized by unsteady conditions indeed due to the specific location of the wwtp the operating parameters were constantly adjusted to the influent flow i e population variations parameters such as temperature were identified as responsible for the microbial community structure and metabolism modification 44 this is of major interest since changes in smp concentrations and composition can impact membrane fouling 20 12 from these statements the active biomass variations were studied over time and compared with operating parameter changes with times 3 2 active biomass evolution the respirometric measurements were used to further characterize mlvss composition thus active biomass concentrations were calculated according to their specificity heterotrophic bacteria xh ammonium oxidizing bacteria xaob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria xnob fig 2 shows the active biomass variations over time and table 4 gives the mean values according to the seasonal period the mlvss fraction represented 74 5 on average of the total particulate organic fraction present in the suspension mlss which is characteristic of activated sludge with low f m ratio inert accumulation within the particulate organic matter the active biomass was measured at relatively low concentrations especially during ls period indeed the total active biomass represented 13 7 of the particulate organic fraction during ls compared to 27 9 in hs mlvss is therefore not an appropriate parameter to directly quantify active biomass 15 heterotrophic bacteria were predominant as expected and represent around 8 4 and 17 8 of the particulate organic fraction during ls and hs respectively these values were in adequation with the organic load increase fig 1a reported in section 3 1 on the contrary autotrophic populations were in a minority in comparison with heterotrophic populations but the aob population was generally measured at a higher concentration than the nob population 60 20 and 41 23 of the total autotrophic biomass respectively due to their slow growth rate μmax from 0 83 to 0 99 1 d 45 autotrophic bacteria concentrations especially nob increased significantly at the beginning of an hs period this could be explained by the srt increase up to 110 d or by temperature increase stimulating the growth of bacteria and boosting their activity figs fig 1figs 1a b and fig 22a important active biomass concentrations variations were therefore observed between the different periods ls hs and transitory periods supporting the hypothesis that seasonal operating parameters change the impact of active biomass population increase and reductions in order to find the parameters with the greatest impact on these variations a pca including active biomass concentrations and the operating parameter values was performed fig 2b the pca total variance represented 66 16 shows that operating parameters didn t have the same impact on active biomass populations the small angle observed between xaob xnob and temperature variables confirms that higher temperatures induced a higher autotrophic growth rate the nitrogen load also influenced autotrophic biomass since more nitrogen is required for the autotroph metabolism surprisingly the organic load variable was not correlated with the xh variable on the contrary heterotrophic biomass was influenced by a higher srt which is consistent with the results in fig 2a where higher xh concentrations were observed during the transitory period or at the beginning of the hs period the mlvss variable was badly represented in the pca short arrow despite the small angles with autotrophic biomass variables moreover it was not correlated with xh confirming that mlvss was not appropriate to quantify active biomass finally the concentration factor srt hrt variable corresponding to a concentration factor of inert compounds in the mbr 41 did not directly influence heterotrophic nor autotrophic biomass concentration thus from pca results srt and temperature were the parameters of greatest influence on global active biomass populations while the nitrogen load mostly impacted autotrophic biomass 3 3 dom characterization fate and fouling propensities 3 3 1 dom fate in bulk supernatant to detect the active biomass impact on dom proteins from biopolymers and hs bb concentrations in the bulk supernatant calculated using eqs 2 4 were normalized by dividing them by the total active biomass concentration xtot fig 3 as already observed by sun et al 20 humic substances were the main dom constituents in the mbr bulk supernatant indeed proteins from bp were around ten times less concentrated than hs bb humic substances fig 3 high hs bb concentration is typical to mbr possessing abundant microorganisms growing at the endogenous stage low f m that produce bap containing a large proportion of humic substances 10 this is confirmed by the relatively stable ratio between dom and xtot concentrations during the whole sampling period most of the dom compounds were secreted by microorganisms and belong to the smp group which is consistent with the study of kunacheva et al 2 between april and may 2015 and 2016 despite a stable total active biomass concentration fig 2a important dom peaks for both proteins from bp and hs bb were visible fig 3 however no active biomass death or growth was involved in these excessive dom productions they must be explained by f m ratio drops observed corresponding to ol shocks observed before the beginning of a new hs fig 1a and c in this specific case active biomass was under starvation conditions probably leading to smp secretion that could be explained by more cell lysis and more intracellular compound consumption under high endogenous respiration 12 except for these peaks dom concentration variations were due to active biomass activity changes thus these variations were probably dependent on srt and temperature which were identified as the parameters impacting the microbial communities the most section 3 2 3 3 2 dom fouling propensities to estimate dom fouling propensities the spectrum corresponding to the retained dom was calculated following the procedure in section 2 3 fig 4 a and the hcl solution collected after a cleaning procedure day 256 was analyzed using 3deem fig 4b the spectrum visible in fig 4a was characterized as expected by dom fluorescing in region iv corresponding to smp like fluorophores used to quantify proteins from biopolymers due to their size 20 kda proteins from biopolymers were reported to be retained by the membrane at around 77 in a previous study 27 dom fluorescing in region i ii corresponding to prot1 2 like fluorophores was also retained by the membrane hence among dom molecules the one containing fluorophores in regions iv and i ii could be an interesting indicator to study external fouling 46 the spectrum visible in fig 4b corresponds to the hcl cleaning solution used to remove irreversible membrane fouling in this case only one fluorescence peak was observed in region v corresponding to compounds having ha like fluorophores hs bb compounds fluorescing in region iii and region v therefore had a significant contribution to the long term fouling this is consistent with results in the literature since humic substances tend to adsorb onto membrane surface due to their hydrophobic nature 35 47 membrane retentions of the two dom molecule classes were represented in fig 5 a and b interestingly no significant differences were observed between the ls and hs fig 5a and b membrane retention is not sufficient to highlight dom fouling propensity fluctuations over time as a function of operating parameters or seasonal variations higher protein from bp membrane retention was visible average value 54 in comparison with hs bb average value 13 despite higher concentrations hs bb membrane retention was lower between 0 and 25 implying a different dom biological production rate thus using eq 9 it was possible to estimate the production rate of hs bb in comparison with proteins from bp 41 the calculated production rate ratio ranged from 1 to 24 eq 9 with an average value of 8 hs bb production rate was therefore 8 times higher than the proteins from bp production rate this observation corroborates with the aforementioned hypothesis and strongly emphasizes the impact of hs bb on fouling mechanisms with an average membrane retention of 13 and a mean concentration of 5 0 mgc l around 0 65 mgc of hs bb per liter of treated water will accumulate onto and into the membrane this result confirms the impact of hs bb compounds in the long term fouling despite their low membrane rejection on the contrary proteins from bp production rate is lower as well as their concentration this is probably due to the low f m leading to protein consumption 12 however these compounds are rejected more by the membrane and can consequently have a big impact on membrane fouling due to their size 48 3 4 membrane fouling and dom accumulation membrane fouling dynamics can be observed through the evolution with time of the mean daily membrane hydraulic resistance 1 m as shown in fig 6 the membrane hydraulic resistance varied from 4 6 1011 to 4 6 1012 1 m and was controlled by the continuous supply of air to the membrane processes and chemical cleaning cc during the sampling period four chemical cleaning operations were performed cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc4 from cc1 to cc3 membrane resistance increased with time between two cleanings fig 6 these filtration periods were qualified as phase 1 cc1 cc2 and phase 2 cc2 cc3 surprisingly between cc3 and cc4 membrane resistance decreased with time this trend is abnormal in comparison to classical membrane resistance evolution 49 thus only phase 1 and phase 2 were studied in the subsequent steps of the study dom effect on membrane filtration was evaluated through hs bb and proteins from bp accumulation onto the membrane using eq 10 this equation hypothesizes that each liter of bulk supernatant filtered by the membrane will bring a dom mass equal to its concentration on membrane surface however only the rejected fraction could be accumulated on the membrane surface dom accumulations were therefore represented as a function of membrane retention in fig 7 a and b interestingly about 5 g m2 and 7 26 g m2 of proteins from bp and hs bb respectively were obtained consequently internal fouling due to hs bb cannot be neglected in membrane fouling studies and for control optimization due to high hs bb concentrations and production rates section 3 3 2 despite a lower accumulated amount of proteins from bp around 5 g m2 the trend between both filtration phases is identical this could mean that membrane resistance was mostly dependent on proteins from bp deposition this is consistent with the results obtained by jacquin et al 50 indeed dom fractions filtration sampled in the same full scale mbr has shown that proteins from bp are the main responsible of fouling by cake formation on an other hand humic substances hs bb cause more irreversible fouling due to strong interactions between hydrophobic molecules and membrane surface for both phases the accumulation sharply increased with no effect on membrane resistance but after an accumulation of 4 g m2 membrane resistance drastically increased this phenomenon was also visible in fig 7a and b corresponding to the classic tmp jump observed in mbr studies this can be explained by a two step process first a gradual deposition of dissolved foulants smp followed by cake formation that could be due to smp accumulation or to biofilm consolidation 23 51 no impact of seasonal variations was observed on proteins from bp fouling propensities since the trends were similar for both phases on the contrary a greater accumulation of hs bb was observed during phase 2 this indicates that hs bb fouling propensities could vary over time but will not significantly impact membrane resistance thus hs bb fouling cannot be monitored using only a membrane resistance indicator this strongly suggests the interest of using 3deem for on line monitoring to further understand membrane fouling 4 conclusion this study aimed to understand the possible links between the active biomass the operating parameters dom and the membrane fouling in order to enhance knowledge about fouling and its possible control using respirometric measurements it was first possible to notice that low active biomass concentrations were determined even during the high season confirming that mlvss concentration was not a relevant indicator to estimate and follow active biomass concentration in an mbr plant from the active biomass concentrations and using pca it was possible to highlight the srt and temperature influence on the microbial activity and consequently its associated production of by products smp indeed using 3deem to estimate proteins from bp and hs bb concentrations using the calibration estimated in a previous study it was possible to confirm that most of the dom including humic substances was smp products secreted by microorganisms this was confirmed by the constant ratio between dom and active biomass concentrations then from the dom concentrations and membrane retentions it was possible to observe that most of the dom was constituted of hs bb that were secreted about 8 times faster than proteins from bp despite low membrane retention the accumulated mass of hs bb per membrane unit was large mostly corresponding to internal fouling which was seasonal dependent hs bb fouling properties can therefore change with time however high hs bb concentrations are classic in low f m operated mbr to limit long term fouling it could be of major interest to decrease mlvss concentration increase f m ratio since it was directly linked to active biomass concentration finally by plotting the dom accumulation as a function of membrane resistance it was possible to hypothesize that proteins from bp accumulation were linked to a membrane resistance increase despite their low concentrations in the mbr tank interestingly regardless of the filtration phase an accumulated mass of 5 g m2 corresponded to a drastic increase in membrane resistance thus no significant fouling propensity changes were observed for proteins from bp their accumulation corresponding to external fouling is mostly due to their size and not fouling propensity modifications the interest of the 3deem calibrations was therefore highlighted however as it was specified in the paper developing this method 27 it is worthy to note that these calibrations are site specific and a new calibration

14583,in this study the quality evaluation of membrane bioreactor mbr treated wastewater was performed for its reuse in irrigation in addition the qualities of mbr effluents desalinated with nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro processes were compared with the irrigation standards mbr effluent was not found as appropriate water for irrigation because of its high salinity according to water quality measurements especially sar and ec values it was considered that nf and ro permeates could decrease the soil permeability if they are used directly for irrigation according to the results of sar ec analyses the mixture of mbr effluent with ro permeate at a volume ratio of 2 1 mbr effluent ro permeate was found to be suitable for irrigation to suppress the harmful effects of mbr permeate such as salinity using such mixture could also ameliorate adverse effects of ro permeate in terms of infiltration keywords irrigation membrane bioreactor mbr nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis

sufficient only in some parts of the world it was estimated that 50 of the world population will live in water stressed regions by 2025 1 2 this shows that it is important to manage available water resources and find new sources by using advanced water treatment processes limitations of water resources lead to decrease in usage of water for irrigation purposes since other requirements are more

there is an increasing interest for the reclamation of industrial wastewaters for irrigation purposes the main driving force of this interest is harder to achieve requirements for drinking water and process water production 1 membrane bioreactor mbr systems have been used for wastewater treatment as a potential technology for especially municipal wastewater treatment mbr is an alternative biological treatment method combined with membrane filtration to conventional activated sludge process cas with its low footprint ability to operate under high total suspended solid tss and production of higher quality effluent 4 depending on the desired effluent quality industrial organizations often prefer cas over mbr due to its lower costs 5 6 on the other hand mbr effluent should be demineralized if the salinity is high prior to utilization of mbr effluent for irrigation therefore nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro processes as post treatment steps should be integrated with mbr system for demineralization recently some studies with nf and ro membranes were performed for desalination of the effluents of municipal wastewater treated with activated sludge processes 7 8 also it is known that the use of mbr prior to ro as a pre treatment unit when a biological treatment is needed gives better results than other conventional treatment combinations 9 10 some preliminary tests on the performances of integrated mbr nf and mbr ro systems were published also 11 12 there are some plants operating to produce water for agricultural irrigation purposes by the use of ro technology 13 15 there are variety of parameters to be achieved in order to obtain the optimum irrigation water such as salinity ph ionic toxicity depending on the concentrations of sodium chloride borate nitrate etc and sodium hazard on soil infiltration 16 one of the most important measures in evaluating irrigation water quality and infiltration problem potential is sodicity in water and soil stated by a dimensionless parameter which is called the sodium adsorption ratio sar and defines sodicity in terms of the relative concentration of sodium na compared to the sum of calcium ca and magnesium mg ions in a sample 17 the sar value was calculated by using eq 1 1 s a r na meq l 1 2 mg 2 ca 2 meq l similar to sar par potassium adsorption ratio is also stated as a standard sometimes and it shows the negative effects of potassium ion on soil which is calculated by using eq 2 18 2 par k meq l 1 2 mg 2 ca 2 meq l smith et al 18 stated extra parameters to evaluate the effect of water on soil properties such as monovalent cation adsorption ratio mcar and cation ratio of structural stability cross yet there are no standards about these parameters although so called toxic compounds may create harmful effects on plant most of these compounds are also required in small amounts 19 therefore it is predictable that ro permeate due to its high rejections may not be feasible to use in irrigation some studies indicated that blending mbr and ro effluents can both produce water viable for irrigation in the means of salinity and influence on soil and reduce the amount of treated wastewater discharged at the same time 16 20 the aim of this study is to identify treat and evaluate mbr treated wastewater for its reuse in agricultural irrigation in accordance with various international standards a quality analysis was performed for mbr permeate nf and ro permeates of mbr effluent and tap water control unit 2 material and methods 2 1 treatment of mbr effluents by nf and ro processes the mbr effluent was collected from the exit stream of wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industry zone located in tekeli menderes izmir the desalinated water samples of mbr effluents were obtained through a pilot scale nf ro treatment systems installed at itob wastewater treatment plant a pre treatment process was applied to mbr effluents prior to nf ro treatment system as a pre treatment method this pre treatment system includes a sand filtration unit carbon filtration unit and two inge dizzer xl 0 9 mb 60 w model uf membranes flow scheme of uf system was shown in fig 1 the nf system has three tm620n 400 model toray nf membranes while the ro system consists of three tm720d 400 model toray ro membranes both systems are connected in a pyramidal configuration where the concentrate stream of the first two membranes tm620n 400 model toray nf membrane or tm720d 400 model toray ro membrane is fed to the third membrane this configuration was selected over single membrane application due to its higher water recovery all membranes are made up of spiral wound modules properties of tm720d 400 ro and tm620 400 nf membranes were summarized in table 1 flow

conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds salinity and temperature by hq14d model hach lange ph meter and conductometer in the field monovalent and divalent cations and metals concentrations were determined by shimadzu aa 7000 model atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu ic 10ai model ion chromatography device was also used to determine the concentrations of anions while turbidity with a turbidimeter po4 p total n no3 n were measured by colorimetric methods using hach lange colorimeter boron was determined with azomethine h method spectrophotometrically while hco3 ions with acid base titration method evaluation of chemical quality for irrigational water was given in table 2 and it represents the standards given by the ministry of environment and urbanization of turkish republic aat 2010 this sar ec classification can also be shown in a graph to mark the sar ec class of any water sample easily this graph created by using sar ec values in table 2 was shown in fig 3 23 class iii area represents that this water may cause serious drop in infiltration and it is not useable for irrigation class ii area suggests that this water may have some negative effects on infiltration but it can be used with caution while class i area represents that the water will have no harmful effects on infiltration the qualities of water samples collected were evaluated by using both ministry of environment and urbanization of turkish republic standards and the ones given by u s environmental protection agency u n food and agriculture organization and world health organization standards directives 23 26 a combined criteria for agricultural irrigation water was summarized in table 3 3 results and discussion the average values of water quality parameters measured were summarized in table 4 values in this table are average of 6 measurements which belong to treated wastewaters sampled at different times between june july 2016 different types of water including tap water mbr effluent nf ro permeates and the mixture of mbr ro effluents 2 1 were analyzed and evaluated as irrigation water properties of all possible mbr ro mixture combinations from 0 to 100 mbr permeate in mixture were theoretically calculated mixing mbr effluent with ro permeate at a volume ratio of 2 1 mbr effluent ro permeate satisfied nearly all parameters and gave a second class permeability property since enhancing permeability also means higher salinity higher mbr effluent fraction and decreasing salinity lower mbr effluent fraction also means worse permeability a ratio of 2 1 mbr effluent ro permeate was selected to keep a balance between salinity and permeability mixing mbr effluent with ro permeate at 2 1 vol ratio was chosen to suppress harmful effects of mbr permeate like salinity and increase permeability of ro permeate hence to create a suitable water for irrigation measured water quality parameters for tap water mbr effluent nf ro permeates and the mixture of mbr ro effluents 2 1 were compared with the given limits 27 28 for their degrees of restriction on use for agricultural purposes it was mentioned by xu et al 29 that tds level and concentration of sodium calcium and magnesium ions of the water are the most important factors for agricultural irrigation mostly membrane treated wastewaters are capable to produce water of acceptable tds level for irrigation however membrane treated wastewater may contain much more sodium than calcium and magnesium because of the greater rejection of divalent ions than monovalent ions so this will greatly affect the sar value tolerance limit of sar value for irrigation of sensitive fruits is about 4 for general crops this limit is generally between 8 and 18 30 therefore without addition of calcium or magnesium or other applications like mixing the membrane permeates with water of different quality like mbr treated one would not be suitable for crop irrigation the normal ph range for irrigation water is from 6 to 9 as it is seen in table 4 all water types including mbr effluent nf permeate ro permeate ro mbr mixture and tap water are in the accepted range and their ph values are suitable for irrigation the most weighty water quality factor on crop productivity is the water salinity hazard which is measured by electrical conductivity ec water with high ec causes physiological drought which means inability of the plant to compete with ions in the soil solution for water and affects crop productivity as well the higher the ec the less water is available to plants even though the soil may appear wet according to the measured data the ec value of mbr effluent is too high and is not suitable for irrigation water while the ec value of ro permeate is suitable for irrigation purposes also nf permeate ro mbr mixture 2 1 and tap water are in the moderate range and these waters are also appropriate for irrigation in terms of ec values for not so sensitive plants although the most important factor in plant growth is salinity ec level of the irrigation water sodium imbalance in irrigation water can further reduce the yield under certain soil texture conditions when irrigation water has high sodium content relative to the calcium and magnesium contents water infiltration decreases this condition so called sodicity results from excessive soil accumulation of sodium sodic water is not the same as saline water sodicity causes swelling and dispersion of soil clays surface crusting and pore plugging sodicity causes a decrease in the downward movement of water into and through the soil and actively growing plants roots may not get adequate water despite pooling of water on the soil surface after irrigation as we see in table 4 the calculated sar values of mbr effluent ro permeate ro mbr mixture 2 1 and tap water are low whereas the sar value of nf permeate is high sar value alone is not enough to assess the water quality and also ec must be taken into account to determine the water class high sar value of nf permeate higher than mbr permeate is caused by its relatively low rejection of sodium and high rejection of calcium and magnesium as seen in table 4 with its 3620 μs cm of ec and 11 7 of sar value mbr effluent is a first class water in the case of soil infiltration but high ec of mbr effluent makes it unsuitable for irrigation nf permeate with its 2270 μs cm of ec and 25 77 of sar quantity third class is unsuitable for irrigation according to both soil infiltration capacity and high ec although it seems that ro permeate is in the suitable range in the case of ec when sar value is taken into account to evaluate it as irrigation water it is seen that this type of water will cause severe infiltration problems in soil third class also because of its low mineral content more fertilizer will be necessary to apply moreover using ro process will be costly because of its high energy consumption and using ro permeate as irrigation water will not be a cost effective process the mixture of mbr effluent and ro permeate at a certain proportion may satisfy requested limits much better than only mbr effluent or only ro permeate for this purpose different theoretical proportions were tried and the ratio of 2 1 ro permeate mbr effluent was found as the best option for requested water quality this mixture was classified in between first and second classes which is the optimum condition that can be satisfied from all theoretical aspects like waste management cost effectiveness tap water with its 800 μs cm of ec and 0 87 of sar value first class is suitable for its use in irrigation 4 conclusions although mbr effluent can be used as irrigation water due to its ph and sar values a high tds content of mbr effluent may adversely affect the plant growth nf permeate has moderate ec but high sar value and this will again cause permeability problems in soil so it is not appropriate for irrigation also mbr effluent and nf permeate has high amount of sodium according to standards maximum permissible amount of sodium in water is 460 ppm and more than this amount will cause sodium toxicity in plants 31 moreover ro permeate does not obey the irrigation standards both nf and ro permeates were evaluated as third class water type in respect to their ec and sar values and they could have bad effects on soil on the other hand ro mbr mixture 2 1 was considered to be more suitable due to the significant decrease in the sar and tds values both this mixture and tap water can be used for irrigation purposes the results of agricultural field tests using water with different qualities tap water mbr effluent nf ro permeate mixture of mbr ro 2 1 are still going on and will be reported soon acknowledgments this

14583,in this study the quality evaluation of membrane bioreactor mbr treated wastewater was performed for its reuse in irrigation in addition the qualities of mbr effluents desalinated with nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro processes were compared with the irrigation standards mbr effluent was not found as appropriate water for irrigation because of its high salinity according to water quality measurements especially sar and ec values it was considered that nf and ro permeates could decrease the soil permeability if they are used directly for irrigation according to the results of sar ec analyses the mixture of mbr effluent with ro permeate at a volume ratio of 2 1 mbr effluent ro permeate was found to be suitable for irrigation to suppress the harmful effects of mbr permeate such as salinity using such mixture could also ameliorate adverse effects of ro permeate in terms of infiltration keywords irrigation membrane bioreactor mbr nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis

14584,the use of iron nanoparticles in the heterogeneous fenton oxidation treatment of tannery wastewater was investigated a comparison with the conventional oxidation process involving fe ii addition was performed the main operating parameters influence such as ph temperature and reagents amount on total phenolic species total organic compounds cr vi content and chemical oxygen demand reduction

optimal conditions were assessed at h2o2 cod w w 0 5 nzvi h2o2 w w 0 75 and ph 3 achieving a total cr vi removal as well as a remarkable toc cod and phenols degradation efficiency up to 70 73 and 88

heterogeneous fenton tannery wastewater intensified process cr vi nzvi 1 introduction leather tanning industry represents one of the most present activities in the mediterranean area and it is well known that produces huge amount of liquid waste 1 about 1218 tanneries are sited on the italian territory contributing for 65 of the overall eu leather production considering that nearly one out of three skins traded between international operators is from italy 2 about 2110 mm2 of leather is produced annually in the world generating approximately 40 million l of cr polluted wastewater every year 3 since 100 110 l of water are necessary to tan 1 m2 of hides 2 chromium tanning process remains still the widest employed process with respect to vegetable one 4 because of better leather quality and stability besides the less time required from the former tanning process 5 the high concentrations of low biodegradable compounds in tannery wastewater represents a serious technological and environmental challenge for the operators because chrome tanning process hide pre treatment and post treatment require the use of several chemicals such as chromium salts bicarbonate salts inorganic and organic acids and surfactants 6 tannery wastewater tw is characterized by high values of chemical oxygen demand cod 3 10 g l 1 biological oxygen demand bod 0 5 4 g l 1 total dissolved

brown color 7 8 the complex tw composition has led researchers to develop combined and integrated processes to remove the most toxic and stable compounds before the final treating in biological reactors 7 12 chemical coagulation flocculation membrane filtration mf and advanced oxidation processes aops are the main solutions proposed and used 13 20 membrane processes demonstrated to be noticeably effective towards chromium recovery from tannery wastewaters 21 considering also the significant simultaneous cod and polyphenols removal efficiencies obtained in various studies 22 23 regarding the latter processes instead they have raised notable interest because of their flexibility effectiveness and relatively low cost 24 25 aops consist of a wide class of methods capable of generating radical species such as oh able to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants 26 generally through a radical mechanism characterized by large kinetic rate constant values 106 109 m 1 s 1 106 1012 times faster than ozone use 27 fenton is an effective aop for the degradation of toxic organic pollutants in wastewater 28 30 based on the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radical by reaction between h2o2 and fe ii 31 the fenton process main advantages are the limited inexpensive required reagents easy to store relatively safe to handle and readily available 32 this process can be carried out at ambient pressure and temperature though a relatively recent study has demonstrated that increasing temperature from 25 c to 90 c improves the total organic carbon toc removal from 28 to 80 33 on the contrary the main drawbacks involve high iron sludge production large hydrogen peroxide dosage and strongly acidic condition ph in the range 2 3 5 34 to reduce sludge production the use of iron based solid catalysts such as magnetite even in form of nanoparticles or zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi have been proposed thus conceiving a heterogeneous fenton hf process 35 36 in particular the nzvi use in wastewater treatment has already demonstrated remarkable removal efficiency towards inorganic 37 38 and organic pollutants 39 ascribable to the high chemical activity induced by the peculiar physical properties of nzvi such as the large specific surface area 40 hf using mesoporous activated carbon as heterogeneous catalyst has already been tested for tw treatment by sekaran et al 41 whereas few studies in literature deal with the traditional fenton oxidation in tw treatment 42 43 the aim of this study is to compare conventional fenton cf and hf oxidation processes in treating synthetic tw investigating the influence of the main operating parameters ph temperature fe ii h2o2 w w h2o2 cod w w and nzvi h2o2 w w ratios and testing the possibility to combine the use of both fe 0 as solid particles and fe ii as dissolved ions as catalyst for the fenton process development the last set of experiments was necessary to investigate the possibility of enhancing the conventional fenton process without the significant increase of catalyst amount typical of nzvi heterogeneous fenton 35 44 45 and also to compare the iron sludge production with the cf and hf processes to the best of the authors knowledge no studies regarding synthetic tw treatment by means of nzvi enhanced fenton process are available in the literature and the present is the first study exploring this possibility 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods all the used reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich milan all solutions were prepared with deionized water the synthetic tannery wastewater tw preparation was based on previous studies 46 47 with some variations selected amounts from stock solutions of the following reagents were used tannic acid 5 g l 1 nh4cl

measured with a crison 421 ph meter whereas cr was measured using an agilent aa duo 240 fs instrument residual hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by the colorimetric method using titanium

was performed in triplicate and the tw characterization results are reported in table 1 as average values and mean deviations nzvi used for the hf treatment was prepared according to the procedure

nanoparticles addition scheduled at 0 5 10 15 and 30 min after the treatment starting according to preliminary tests the treatment contact time was set at 2 h for cf and 1 h for hf tests necessary in both cases to reach the cod toc tp ap and cr vi residual asymptotic values in addition blank tests using only fe ii salt and hydrogen peroxide with concentrations fixed at the optimal values found in the cf and hf processes respectively and varying the solution ph in the range 2 7 were performed the results are reported as supporting information si the toc cod tp ap and cr vi were measured at the end of each test after ph adjustment to 7 to let fe iii precipitation and after centrifugation 10000 rpm 10 min and manganese oxide addition to remove residual hydrogen peroxide which remained unreacted in the samples taken from the reactor evaluating the overall treatment efficiency tre according to the following general formula 1 t r e i 100 f i n a l v a l u e i i n i t i a l v a l u e i where i stands for toc cod tp ap cr vi respectively and for the sake of clarity the following five acronyms were adopted tre for toc cre for cod tpre for tp apre for ap and cr vi re for cr vi treatment removal efficiencies at the end of each test the residual iron sludge was weighted and normalized with respect to the initial wastewater volume and total fe concentration to allow a comparison between cf and hf sludge production in addition the cr vi concentration was measured in the generated sludge after alkaline digestion according to the epa3060a method all tests and measures were carried out in triplicate and the mean values are reported data modelling and non linear data regression were accomplished in the python ver 3 6 1 environment carrying out the fitting procedure by scipy optimize curve fit function the adopted second order fitting surface equation has the general form ax 2 by 2 cxy dx ey f where a through f are constant coefficients x represents the ph and y stands for the fe ii h2o2 or the nzvi h2o2 ratio in cf and in hf data fitting respectively the scipy linalg lstsq function was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 conventional fenton test results the results obtained as function of ph and fe ii h2o2 ratio are displayed in figs 2 and 3 in a series of 3d graphs where the fitting surfaces are highlighted the analysis of figs 2 and 3 allows to draw various observations first the optimal h2o2 cod w w value is 0 75 as the obtained results clearly show in fact the removal efficiencies adopting this ratio value for each considered parameter is always larger with respect to those obtained adopting a ratio equal to 1 this implies that a h2o2 loading increase does not determine a process efficiency in any case indeed as reported by several studies 43 51 a h2o2 excess can act as a hydroxyl scavenger instead of hydroxyl radicals source and in addition interferes with the cod measure 52 furthermore the residual hydrogen peroxide measured at the end of each test was always higher when a h2o2 cod w w 1 was adopted more in detail a residual h2o2 concentration in the range 5 2 9 7 with respect to the initial amount was measured at h2o2 cod w w 0 75 whereas the h2o2 cod w w increase up to 1 00 caused a reduction in oxidant consumption whose residual concentration lays in the range 14 4 22 1 similar results were reported by hodaifa et al 50 about fenton oxidation of olive mill wastewater an optimal ph 2 5 was assessed independently upon h2o2 cod w w and observed parameter indeed the overall treatment efficiency decreases with the ph increase reaching a minimum at ph equal to 5 this result could be explained considering that ph values higher than 4 strongly enhances the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii thus quickly inducing hydroxides formation and precipitation 53 similar results are reported by shrank et al 42 who account for a maximum toc and cod removal treating a tw at ph about 3 the optimal fe ii h2o2 w w value seems to be ph dependent and varying from 0 15 in more acid environment ph 2 2 5 to 0 125 when the ph raises above 3 a possible explanation of this phenomena could be that under acidic conditions cr vi reduction from fe ii is favoured 54 causing a faster fe ii consumption by cr vi the observed cr vi reduction trend confirms this explanation the cr vi re achieves a maximum value close to 100 at ph 2 2 5 whereas at ph 4 or higher values lower than 50 were always obtained the tre cre apre and tpre trends with ph and fe ii h2o2 w w are quite similar usually toc removal is a consequence of a mineralization and vice versa whereas an absorbance decrease at 228 nm could cause both a cod and tp decrease as reported in other studies 55 a 228 nm absorbance value decrease implies the conjugated double bounds cleavage which absorb in this region because of π π transitions 56 according to the optimal operating parameter values combination previously assessed ph 2 5 fe ii h2o2 w w 0 15 h2o2 cod w w 0 75 the maximum tre cre tpre apre and cr vi re values were 58 49 65 64 77 78 87 09 99 87 respectively similar results were obtained by wang et al 57 who calculated a cre equal to 55 87 on a real tannery wastewater at ph 4 the residual oxidant concentration was only 5 2 with respect to the initial amount experimental data showed in figs 2 and 3 were well fitted by a quadratic surface equation r2 values were in the range 0 97 0 99 and the obtained coefficients are reported in the following eqs 1a 1e and 2a 2e are related to a h2o2 cod w w set at 0 75 and 1 00 respectively 1a t r e 3 24 p h

focusing on the ph and fe ii h2o2 ratio influence it is noticeable the larger relevance of the latter term with respect to the former one demonstrated by the highest coefficient value associated to fe ii h2o2 2 in particular the ph2 term is always associated with the lowest coefficient except in the last equation where is higher than the constant term more in detail independently from h2o2 cod tre is more influenced by the second term whose coefficient is always 1 2 order of magnitude higher with respect to other coefficients analogous observations could be drawn regarding cre tpre and cr vi re whereas fe ii h2o2 2 and fe ii h2o2 seem to have similar influence on apre being their coefficients of the same magnitude the optimal conditions were adopted in subsequent cf tests varying the system temperature and the obtained results are reported in fig 4 the results shown in fig 4 explain that the oxidation treatment efficiency increases at a progressively increase of the temperature similar outcomes are reported by zhang et al 58 on landfill leachate a t increase up to 37 c allowed to reach a cod removal efficiency increase of about 30 from 42 3 to 56 2 with respect to that reported at 13 c other studies on recalcitrant organic compounds such as methyl tert butyl ether mtbe also showed a fenton oxidation efficiency enhancement with the temperature increase 59 in the present case cod removal increased from 59 46 at 15 c to 67 13 at 35 c and toc removal followed a similar trend from 53 5 to 63 with the last two values very close in both trends for what concerns phenols removal an almost linear trend can be observed the increase of t from 30 to 35 c produced a tpre and apre gain of about 2 cr vi reduction efficiency always remained close to 100 independently from the temperature variation in the investigated range in table 2 the normalized iron sludge production nisp is reported as function of h2o2 cod w w and fe ii h2o2 w w ratios as expected the fe ii concentration increase leads to a larger iron sludge production in detail the normalized iron sludge production value nisp varied in the range 1 04 1 13 mg l 1 kg fe 1 the cr vi concentration measured in the alkaline extract of iron sludge was always lower than the limit detection of the method 0 05 μm 60 3 2 heterogeneous fenton test results the results obtained in the hf process are reported in figs 5 and 6 as function of ph and nzvi h2o2 w w ratio in a series of 3d graphs with highlighted the fitting surfaces preliminary tests adding only nzvi to the tw nzvi cod w w 0 5 at ph 2 5 showed significant oxidation efficiency tre and cre value reached 42 2 and 54 2 respectively tpre and apre were equal to 61 and 64 4 respectively whereas cr vi re reached 100 the latter result is completely in agreement with several studies about cr vi reduction by nzvi reported in literature 49 61 as well as about the toc cod and phenols removal in fact the nzvi oxidation by products analysis reported in recent studies 62 63 showed the presence of hydrogen peroxide and fe ii besides other compounds this implies that nzvi alone could lead to the generation of fenton process according to the following equations 3 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e i i h 2 o 2 4 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e i i h 2 2 o h 5 f e i i h 2 o 2 fe iii ho o h regarding the hf test results the analysis of figs 5 and 6 leads to important observations the optimal h2o2 cod w w value is 0 5 and the removal efficiency at this value for each parameter is always larger with respect to those obtained adopting a h2o2 cod w w value equal to 0 75 as already observed for cf the lower h2o2 cod w w assured the best performances in particular in this case a minor amount of hydrogen peroxide is required probably due to the nzvi capability to produce itself h2o2 through its oxidation as discussed previously as already observed for cf the higher h2o2 cod w w value the higher the residual oxidant concentration a residual h2o2 concentration in the range 6 4 11 7 with respect to the initial amount was measured fixing h2o2 cod w w equal to 0 5 whereas the h2o2 cod increase to 0 75 caused a reduction in the oxidant consumption whose residual concentration lays in the range 13 2 20 9 the optimal ph value is 3 independently from the h2o2 cod w w ratio and all parameters an important result observed with hf test deals with the higher tre cre tpre and apre values calculated at high ph with respect to those reported for cf for instance fixing optimal h2o2 cod w w and fe ii h2o2 w w ratios tre and cre values equal to 33 7 and 39 55 respectively were obtained by cf at ph 5 whereas in the hf process at the same ph these parameters reached 59 52 and 67 21 respectively similar results were achieved by xu and wang 64 in their study where the heterogeneous fenton oxidation of 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol showed remarkable removal efficiency total removal in 5 min up to ph 5 the optimal nzvi h2o2 w w value is 0 75 as observed in the cf process the optimal nzvi amount strongly depends on the wastewater characteristics and in literature could be found several optimal nzvi h2o2 w w values for instance in the abovementioned study of xu and wang 64 the optimal nzvi h2o2 w w value was 5 whereas yu and coworkers reported an optimal value of the same parameter equal to 0 2 to reach a cre value about 80 65 the tre cre apre and tpre trends are quite similar as already observed for cf considering both the variation with ph and nzvi h2o2 w w the cr vi re was always equal to 100 except when the initial ph was set equal to 5 in this case the cr vi removal efficiency drops to about 80 according to the optimal operating parameter values combination ph 3 nzvi h2o2 w w 0 75 h2o2 cod w w 0 5 the maximum tre cre tpre apre and cr vi re values are 70 17 73 26 87 98 97 73 99 87 respectively these values are quite higher besides the similar total cr vi removal already observed than those reported for cf process for instance the mineralization represented by tre value increased of about 1 2 fold whereas the remain parameters increased about 10 15 experimental data showed in figs 5 and 6 were well fitted by a quadratic surface equation r2 values were in the range 0 98 0 99 and the obtained coefficients are reported in the following eqs 6a 6e and 7a 7e are related to h2o2 cod w w set at 0 75 and 0 5 respectively 6a t r e 2

different influences of certain terms for instance only the first term is characterized by a coefficient with the same order magnitude independently from the individual parameter and h2o2 cod the mixed term is characterized by the lowest coefficient in 8 out of 10 eqs 6a 6d 7a 7d which usually is 4 5 order of magnitude lower than the coefficients belonging to second and fifth term nzvi h2o2 2 and nzvi h2o2 respectively more in detail fixing h2o2 cod 0 5 tre cre tpre and apre equations present the coefficient of second fourth and fifth term with the same magnitude order with respect to the constant term this result implies that the first and third term are less relevant than the previous mentioned in the other eqs 7a 7e instead the fourth term keeps its influence only in apre equation where the corresponding coefficient has the same magnitude order of those belonging to second and fifth term a different trend characterizes cr vi re parameter that independently from h2o2 cod is influenced more by the fourth and the last term the only characterized by the same and higher order of magnitude the optimal conditions were adopted in subsequent hf tests varying the system temperature producing the results reported in fig 7 as observed in the cf case the oxidation treatment efficiency increases with the temperature increase in this case cod removal increased from 60 53 at 15 c up to 77 13 at 35 c and toc removal followed a similar trend from 60 11 to 76 04 with the last two values very close in both trends regarding phenols removal apre value reached 100 whereas the tpre value at 35 c was 93 14 cr vi reduction efficiency remained close to 100 only for t equal or above 25 c whereas below this value it fells down to about 80 hf treatment demonstrated to be more temperature dependent in the investigated temperature range in particular cr vi reduction seems to be notably influenced by the temperature analogous behaviour was already observed by jabeen et al 66 who reported a cr vi removal efficiency worsening when the system t was decreased below 25 c as expected the nzvi concentration increase leads to a larger iron sludge production as reported in table 3 the normalized iron sludge production value nisp stays in the range 0 762 0 777 mg l 1 kg fe 1 a comparison among this range and that reported previously for cf 1 04 1 13 mg l 1 kg fe 1 demonstrates an additive advantage of hf process i e the lower iron sludge production about 30 less this important feature is fundamental for the process scale up because of the sludge disposal cost furthermore even though various authors 67 68 reported that the fenton iron sludge could be recycled in subsequent coagulation process the residue could not be recycled more than one time this implies that a process that generates less sludge to be disposed of is more economical convenient with respect to others producing larger sludge amounts another important result was the final ph laying in the range 8 9 and proportional to nzvi loading these results meant that no ph adjustment is necessary for iron sludge precipitation the cr vi measured in the iron sludge resulted negligible always below the limit detection of the determination method 3 3 conventional heterogeneous fenton combination though the results of heterogenous fenton oxidation tests clearly showed an overall treatment efficiency improvement of about 20 25 in a shorter time and with a minor sludge production with respect to the conventional fenton process the latter can be also considered quite satisfactory taking into account that often fenton oxidation is considered a pre treatment of a biological or other secondary treatment processes 68 indeed an important cf feature is its low cost and in addition hazardous reagents use is not required on the contrary the nzvi use is less economic with respect to ferrous salt utilization that usually is the iron precursor in nzvi synthesis 25 34 thus in order to optimize the overall treatment by taking advantages from both processes cf and hf their combination was evaluated and the results are reported in fig 8 a c the analysis of fig 8 a c leads to make the various remarks as expected nzvi addition leads to cf enhancement that resulted particularly appreciable with regard to phenols removal in fact tpre increased of about 25 30 according to optimal nzvi loading and nanoparticles addition time at whereas apre reached 100 in each test optimal nzvi h2o2 w w was 0 2 for toc and cod removal 0 25 for tp removal whereas the most effective at was 5 min after cf oxidation starting according to optimal values the obtained tre cre and tpre were 81 15 87 44 and 94 04 respectively these results show that a combination of cf and hf oxidation processes proved to be more suitable with respect to the two separate treatment the toc removal resulted 1 4 fold higher than that obtained by optimised cf and about 1 2 fold higher that reported for optimised hf similar conclusions can be drawn regarding cod and phenols removal in addition the residual oxidant concentration measured at the end of the optimal test was only 3 2 with respect to the initial hydrogen peroxide amount finally cr vi reduction efficiency reached 100 in each test experimental data showed in fig 8 a c were well fitted by a quadratic surface equation r2 values were in the range 0 94 0 99 and the obtained coefficients are reported in the following equations 8a t r e 0 005 a t 2 318 84 n z v i h 2 o 2 2 0 21 a t n z v i h 2 o 2 0 49 a t 151 69 n z v i h 2 o 2 60 17 8b c r e 0 002 a t 2

the lower coefficient values are always associated to the first third and fourth term implying that the most important terms are those related to nzvi h2o2 in detail in eqs 8a and 8b the second and the fifth coefficient values are of the same magnitude order that is 4 fold larger than the third one and 6 fold larger than the first one in eq 8c the highest coefficient value belongs to the second term with a magnitude order 7 fold larger than the first coefficient 5 fold with respect to third and fourth ones and 1 fold with respect to the constant term table 4 reports the iron sludge production in the intensified conventional fenton oxidation tests nisp values stays in the range 0 931 1 422 mg l 1 kg fe 1 showing the higher dependence of iron sludge production on the initial fe concentration than detected in the cf and hf tests however the sludge production at optimal operating conditions 1 17 mg l 1 kg fe 1 was close to that reported for cf as already observed in the cf and hf cases the cr vi measured in the iron sludge resulted negligible always below the detection limit of the determination method finally figs 9 and 10 display two possible implementation of the cf hf process in an integrated tw treatment in a membrane filtration plant the cf hf process may be integrated in a simple two phase filtration reverse osmosis membrane plant where the first step filtration unit led to separate the solid fraction from the tw and the second step nano filtr or rev osm unit a nanofiltration or reverse osmosis process led to the reduction of cod polyphenols and cr vi cr iii concentration in the permeate with a simultaneous production of a concentrate stream where the cod polyphenols and cr vi cr iii concentration is larger with respect to that of raw tw 21 23 fig 9 shows how cf hf process can be used to treat the permeate produced subsequently to a nanofiltration process of a pre treated tw for instance by a simple cf process leading to an improvement of the overall pollutants removal efficiency and to the complete reduction of residual cr vi to cr iii this solution may prevent the possibility that residual cr vi and still significant cod and polyphenols concentration may remain in the permeate once the permeate characteristics are determined it can be directly dispose of in water bodies or if necessary can be treated in a classical biological unit since the toxic cr vi should not be present neither in trace levels on the contrary fig 10 shows how cf hf process may be used to purge the concentrate produced subsequently to a reverse osmosis process of a pre treated tw usually the concentrate generated by reverse osmosis processes depending on the wastewater characteristics are significantly polluted and might require very effective process to be treated 69 71 the combination of cf and hf process may be effectively employed to purge the concentrate from reverse osmosis or other membrane processes 4 conclusions this study reports

known that produces huge amount of liquid waste 1 about 1218 tanneries are sited on the italian territory contributing for 65 of the overall eu leather production considering that nearly one out of three skins traded between international operators is from italy 2 about 2110 mm2 of leather is produced annually in the world generating approximately 40 million l of cr polluted wastewater every year 3 since 100 110 l of water are necessary to tan 1 m2 of hides 2 chromium tanning process remains still the widest employed process with respect to vegetable one 4 because of better leather quality and stability besides the less time required from the former tanning process 5 the high concentrations of low biodegradable compounds in tannery wastewater represents a serious technological and environmental challenge for the operators because chrome tanning process hide pre treatment and post treatment require the use of several chemicals such as chromium salts bicarbonate salts inorganic and organic acids and surfactants 6 tannery wastewater tw is characterized by high values of chemical oxygen demand cod 3 10 g l 1 biological oxygen demand bod 0 5 4 g l 1 total dissolved solids tds of 5 15 g l 1 total suspended solids tss of 500 300 mg l 1 cr vi 5 20 mg l 1 and cr iii 50 300 mg l 1 content and phenolic compounds concentration 100 500 mg l 1 with strong odor and dark brown color 7 8 the complex tw composition has led researchers to develop combined and integrated processes to remove the most toxic and stable compounds before the final treating in biological reactors 7 12 chemical coagulation flocculation membrane filtration mf and advanced oxidation processes aops are the main solutions proposed and used 13 20 membrane processes demonstrated to be noticeably effective towards chromium recovery from tannery wastewaters 21 considering also the significant simultaneous cod and polyphenols removal efficiencies obtained in various studies 22 23 regarding the latter processes instead they have raised notable interest because of their flexibility effectiveness and relatively low cost 24 25 aops consist of a wide class of methods capable of generating radical species such as oh able to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants 26 generally through a radical mechanism characterized by large kinetic rate constant values 106 109 m 1 s 1 106 1012 times faster than ozone use 27 fenton is an effective aop for the degradation of toxic organic pollutants in wastewater 28 30 based on the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radical by reaction between h2o2 and fe ii 31 the fenton process main advantages are the limited inexpensive required reagents easy to store relatively safe to handle and readily available 32 this process can be carried out at ambient pressure and temperature though a relatively recent study has demonstrated that increasing temperature from 25 c to 90 c improves the total organic carbon toc removal from 28 to 80 33 on the contrary the main drawbacks involve high iron sludge production large hydrogen peroxide dosage and strongly acidic condition ph in the range 2 3 5 34 to reduce sludge production the use of iron based solid catalysts such as magnetite even in form of nanoparticles or zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi have been proposed thus conceiving a heterogeneous fenton hf process 35 36 in particular the nzvi use in wastewater treatment has already demonstrated remarkable removal efficiency towards inorganic 37 38 and organic pollutants 39 ascribable to the high chemical activity induced by the peculiar physical properties of nzvi such as the large specific surface area 40 hf using mesoporous activated carbon as heterogeneous catalyst has already been tested for tw treatment by sekaran et al 41 whereas few studies in literature deal with the traditional fenton oxidation in tw treatment 42 43 the aim of this study is to compare conventional fenton cf and hf oxidation processes in treating synthetic tw investigating the influence of the main operating parameters ph temperature fe ii h2o2 w w h2o2 cod w w and nzvi h2o2 w w ratios and testing the possibility to combine the use of both fe 0 as solid particles and fe ii as dissolved ions as catalyst for the fenton process development the last set of experiments was necessary to investigate the possibility of enhancing the conventional fenton process without the significant increase of catalyst amount typical of nzvi heterogeneous fenton 35 44 45 and also to compare the iron sludge production with the cf and hf processes to the best of the authors knowledge no studies regarding synthetic tw treatment by means of nzvi enhanced fenton process are available in the literature and the present is the first study exploring this possibility 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods all the used reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich milan all solutions were prepared with deionized water the synthetic tannery wastewater tw preparation was based on previous studies 46 47 with some variations selected amounts from stock solutions of the following reagents were used tannic acid 5 g l 1 nh4cl

compounds tp uv absorbance at 228 nm ap cr vi and cr content toc cod and ph the concentration of phenolic compounds expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent gae l 1 was measured by the folin ciocalteu method 48 using a pg instruments t80 uv vis spectrophotometer uv absorbance at 228 nm was also recorded in this spectrophotometer for the cr vi measurement by diphenylcarbazide method at 540 nm according to epa 7196a 49 toc was analysed on a shimadzu toc analyzer 5000 cod was determined by the closed reflux colorimetric method 48 using the spectrophotometer previously mentioned ph was measured with a crison 421 ph meter whereas cr was measured using an agilent aa duo 240 fs instrument residual hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by the colorimetric method using titanium sulphate in virtue of its simplicity and accurate measurement titanium sulphate reacting with the h2o2 in the solution forms a yellow complex with a maximum absorbance around 410 nm 50 each analysis was performed in triplicate and the tw characterization results are reported in table 1 as average values and mean deviations nzvi used for the hf treatment was prepared according to the procedure described elsewhere 40 without the addition of any dispersing agent to prevent carbon content increase the produced nanoparticles mean size was measured by dynamic light scattering dls using the plus 90 instrument supplied by brookhaven nzvi particles showed a mean diameter equal to 97 4 nm and unimodal distribution fig 1 a these values were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy performed with the stem philips cm20 instrument fig 1b 2 2 experimental procedure wastewater samples were shaken in 150 ml flasks by an orbital shaker heidolph unimax 101 at 150 rpm and selected amounts of h2o2 105 mm 3 6 g l 1 and feso4 7h2o 13 16 mm 2 g l 1 or nzvi 17 9 mm 1 g l 1 were added from stock solutions temperature t was controlled by a thermostatic bath set at 25 c three sets of experiments were performed each addressing the different condition conceived cf hf and the combination of cf and hf where the subsequent operating parameters were varied in the reported range and their influence was investigated 1 43 cf process h2o2 cod w w 0 5 0 75 1 fe ii h2o2 w w 0 1 0 125 0 15 0 175 0 2 ph 2 2 5 3 3 74 5 varied by h2so4 1 m and naoh 1 m addition once the optimal operating conditions were

the optimal operating conditions were estimated four different temperatures were tested 15 20 30 and 35 c once the optimal operating cf parameters h2o2 cod w w fe ii h2o2 w w and ph were fixed the third set of tests was performed combining cf and hf process at 25 c the following parameters were investigated in the hereafter range cf hf combination nzvi h2o2 w w 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 and nanoparticles addition scheduled at 0 5 10 15 and 30 min after the treatment starting according to preliminary tests the treatment contact time was set at 2 h for cf and 1 h for hf tests necessary in both cases to reach the cod toc tp ap and cr vi residual asymptotic values in addition blank tests using only fe ii salt and hydrogen peroxide with concentrations fixed at the optimal values found in the cf and hf processes respectively and varying the solution ph in the range 2 7 were performed the results are reported as supporting information si the toc cod tp ap and cr vi were measured at the end of each test after ph adjustment to 7 to let fe iii precipitation and after centrifugation 10000 rpm 10 min and manganese oxide addition to remove residual hydrogen peroxide which remained unreacted in the samples taken from the reactor evaluating the overall treatment efficiency tre according to the following general formula 1 t r e i 100 f i n a l v a l u e i i n i t i a l v a l u e i where i stands for toc cod tp ap cr vi respectively and for the sake of clarity the following five acronyms were adopted tre for toc cre for cod tpre for tp apre for ap and cr vi re for cr vi treatment removal efficiencies at the end of each test the residual iron sludge was weighted and normalized with respect to the initial wastewater volume and total fe concentration to allow a comparison between cf and hf sludge production in addition the cr vi concentration was measured in the generated sludge after alkaline digestion according to the epa3060a method all tests and measures were carried out in triplicate and the mean values are reported data modelling and non linear data regression were accomplished in the python ver 3 6 1 environment carrying out the fitting procedure by scipy optimize curve fit function the adopted second order fitting surface equation has the general form ax 2 by 2 cxy dx ey f where a through f are constant coefficients x represents the ph and y stands for the fe ii h2o2 or the nzvi h2o2 ratio in cf and in hf data fitting respectively the scipy linalg lstsq function was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 conventional fenton test results the results obtained as function of ph and fe ii h2o2 ratio are displayed in figs 2 and 3 in a series of 3d graphs where the fitting surfaces are highlighted the analysis of figs 2 and 3 allows to draw various observations first the optimal h2o2 cod w w value is 0 75 as the obtained results clearly show in fact the removal efficiencies adopting this ratio value for each considered parameter is always larger with respect to those obtained adopting a ratio equal to 1 this implies that a h2o2 loading increase does not determine a process efficiency in any case indeed as reported by several studies 43 51 a h2o2 excess can act as a hydroxyl scavenger instead of hydroxyl radicals source and in addition interferes with the cod measure 52 furthermore the residual hydrogen peroxide measured at the end of each test was always higher when a h2o2 cod w w 1 was adopted more in detail a residual h2o2 concentration in the range 5 2 9 7 with respect to the initial amount was measured at h2o2 cod w w 0 75 whereas the h2o2 cod w w increase up to 1 00 caused a reduction in oxidant consumption whose residual concentration lays in the range 14 4 22 1 similar results were reported by hodaifa et al 50 about fenton oxidation of olive mill wastewater an optimal ph 2 5 was assessed independently upon h2o2 cod w w and observed parameter indeed the overall treatment efficiency decreases with the ph increase reaching a minimum at ph equal to 5 this result could be explained considering that ph values higher than 4 strongly enhances the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii thus quickly inducing hydroxides formation and precipitation 53 similar results are reported by shrank et al 42 who account for a maximum toc and cod removal treating a tw at ph about 3 the optimal fe ii h2o2 w w value seems to be ph dependent and varying from 0 15 in more acid environment ph 2 2 5 to 0 125 when the ph raises above 3 a possible explanation of this phenomena could be that under acidic conditions cr vi reduction from fe ii is favoured 54 causing a faster fe ii consumption by cr vi the observed cr vi reduction trend confirms this explanation the cr vi re achieves a maximum value close to 100 at ph 2 2 5 whereas at ph 4 or higher values lower than 50 were always obtained the tre cre apre and tpre trends with ph and fe ii h2o2 w w are quite similar usually toc removal is a consequence of a mineralization and vice versa whereas an absorbance decrease at 228 nm could cause both a cod and tp decrease as reported in other studies 55 a 228 nm absorbance value decrease implies the conjugated double bounds cleavage which absorb in this region because of π π transitions 56 according to the optimal operating parameter values combination previously assessed ph 2 5 fe ii h2o2 w w 0 15 h2o2 cod w w 0 75 the maximum tre cre tpre apre and cr vi re values were 58 49 65 64 77 78 87 09 99 87 respectively similar results were obtained by wang et al 57 who calculated a cre equal to 55 87 on a real tannery wastewater at ph 4 the residual oxidant concentration was only 5 2 with respect to the initial amount experimental data showed in figs 2 and 3 were well fitted by a quadratic surface equation r2 values were in the range 0 97 0 99 and the obtained coefficients are reported in the following eqs 1a 1e and 2a 2e are related to a h2o2 cod w w set at 0 75 and 1 00 respectively 1a t r e 3 24 p h

focusing on the ph and fe ii h2o2 ratio influence it is noticeable the larger relevance of the latter term with respect to the former one demonstrated by the highest coefficient value associated to fe ii h2o2 2 in particular the ph2 term is always associated with the lowest coefficient except in the last equation where is higher than the constant term more in detail independently from h2o2 cod tre is more influenced by the second term whose coefficient is always 1 2 order of magnitude higher with respect to other coefficients analogous observations could be drawn regarding cre tpre and cr vi re whereas fe ii h2o2 2 and fe ii h2o2 seem to have similar influence on apre being their coefficients of the same magnitude the optimal conditions were adopted in subsequent cf tests varying the system temperature and the obtained results are reported in fig 4 the results shown in fig 4 explain that the oxidation treatment efficiency increases at a progressively increase of the temperature similar outcomes are reported by zhang et al 58 on landfill leachate a t increase up to 37 c allowed to reach a cod removal efficiency increase of about 30 from 42 3 to 56 2 with respect to that reported at 13 c other studies on recalcitrant organic compounds such as methyl tert butyl ether mtbe also showed a fenton oxidation efficiency enhancement with the temperature increase 59 in the present case cod removal increased from 59 46 at 15 c to 67 13 at 35 c and toc removal followed a similar trend from 53 5 to 63 with the last two values very close in both trends for what concerns phenols removal an almost linear trend can be observed the increase of t from 30 to 35 c produced a tpre and apre gain of about 2 cr vi reduction efficiency always remained close to 100 independently from the temperature variation in the investigated range in table 2 the normalized iron sludge production nisp is reported as function of h2o2 cod w w and fe ii h2o2 w w ratios as expected the fe ii concentration increase leads to a larger iron sludge production in detail the normalized iron sludge production value nisp varied in the range 1 04 1 13 mg l 1 kg fe 1 the cr vi concentration measured in the alkaline extract of iron sludge was always lower than the limit detection of the method 0 05 μm 60 3 2 heterogeneous fenton test results the results obtained in the hf process are reported in figs 5 and 6 as function of ph and nzvi h2o2 w w ratio in a series of 3d graphs with highlighted the fitting surfaces preliminary tests adding only nzvi to the tw nzvi cod w w 0 5 at ph 2 5 showed significant oxidation efficiency tre and cre value reached 42 2 and 54 2 respectively tpre and apre were equal to 61 and 64 4 respectively whereas cr vi re reached 100 the latter result is completely in agreement with several studies about cr vi reduction by nzvi reported in literature 49 61 as well as about the toc cod and phenols removal in fact the nzvi oxidation by products analysis reported in recent studies 62 63 showed the presence of hydrogen peroxide and fe ii besides other compounds this implies that nzvi alone could lead to the generation of fenton process according to the following equations 3 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e i i h 2 o 2 4 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e i i h 2 2 o h 5 f e i i h 2 o 2 fe iii ho o h regarding the hf test results the analysis of figs 5 and 6 leads to important observations the optimal h2o2 cod w w value is 0 5 and the removal efficiency at this value for each parameter is always larger with respect to those obtained adopting a h2o2 cod w w value equal to 0 75 as already observed for cf the lower h2o2 cod w w assured the best performances in particular in this case a minor amount of hydrogen peroxide is required probably due to the nzvi capability to produce itself h2o2 through its oxidation as discussed previously as already observed for cf the higher h2o2 cod w w value the higher the residual oxidant concentration a residual h2o2 concentration in the range 6 4 11 7 with respect to the initial amount was measured fixing h2o2 cod w w equal to 0 5 whereas the h2o2 cod increase to 0 75 caused a reduction in the oxidant consumption whose residual concentration lays in the range 13 2 20 9 the optimal ph value is 3 independently from the h2o2 cod w w ratio and all parameters an important result observed with hf test deals with the higher tre cre tpre and apre values calculated at high ph with respect to those reported for cf for instance fixing optimal h2o2 cod w w and fe ii h2o2 w w ratios tre and cre values equal to 33 7 and 39 55 respectively were obtained by cf at ph 5 whereas in the hf process at the same ph these parameters reached 59 52 and 67 21 respectively similar results were achieved by xu and wang 64 in their study where the heterogeneous fenton oxidation of 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol showed remarkable removal efficiency total removal in 5 min up to ph 5 the optimal nzvi h2o2 w w value is 0 75 as observed in the cf process the optimal nzvi amount strongly depends on the wastewater characteristics and in literature could be found several optimal nzvi h2o2 w w values for instance in the abovementioned study of xu and wang 64 the optimal nzvi h2o2 w w value was 5 whereas yu and coworkers reported an optimal value of the same parameter equal to 0 2 to reach a cre value about 80 65 the tre cre apre and tpre trends are quite similar as already observed for cf considering both the variation with ph and nzvi h2o2 w w the cr vi re was always equal to 100 except when the initial ph was set equal to 5 in this case the cr vi removal efficiency drops to about 80 according to the optimal operating parameter values combination ph 3 nzvi h2o2 w w 0 75 h2o2 cod w w 0 5 the maximum tre cre tpre apre and cr vi re values are 70 17 73 26 87 98 97 73 99 87 respectively these values are quite higher besides the similar total cr vi removal already observed than those reported for cf process for instance the mineralization represented by tre value increased of about 1 2 fold whereas the remain parameters increased about 10 15 experimental data showed in figs 5 and 6 were well fitted by a quadratic surface equation r2 values were in the range 0 98 0 99 and the obtained coefficients are reported in the following eqs 6a 6e and 7a 7e are related to h2o2 cod w w set at 0 75 and 0 5 respectively 6a t r e 2

different influences of certain terms for instance only the first term is characterized by a coefficient with the same order magnitude independently from the individual parameter and h2o2 cod the mixed term is characterized by the lowest coefficient in 8 out of 10 eqs 6a 6d 7a 7d which usually is 4 5 order of magnitude lower than the coefficients belonging to second and fifth term nzvi h2o2 2 and nzvi h2o2 respectively more in detail fixing h2o2 cod 0 5 tre cre tpre and apre equations present the coefficient of second fourth and fifth term with the same magnitude order with respect to the constant term this result implies that the first and third term are less relevant than the previous mentioned in the other eqs 7a 7e instead the fourth term keeps its influence only in apre equation where the corresponding coefficient has the same magnitude order of those belonging to second and fifth term a different trend characterizes cr vi re parameter that independently from h2o2 cod is influenced more by the fourth and the last term the only characterized by the same and higher order of magnitude the optimal conditions were adopted in subsequent hf tests varying the system temperature producing the results reported in fig 7 as observed in the cf case the oxidation treatment efficiency increases with the temperature increase in this case cod removal increased from 60 53 at 15 c up to 77 13 at 35 c and toc removal followed a similar trend from 60 11 to 76 04 with the last two values very close in both trends regarding phenols removal apre value reached 100 whereas the tpre value at 35 c was 93 14 cr vi reduction efficiency remained close to 100 only for t equal or above 25 c whereas below this value it fells down to about 80 hf treatment demonstrated to be more temperature dependent in the investigated temperature range in particular cr vi reduction seems to be notably influenced by the temperature analogous behaviour was already observed by jabeen et al 66 who reported a cr vi removal efficiency worsening when the system t was decreased below 25 c as expected the nzvi concentration increase leads to a larger iron sludge production as reported in table 3 the normalized iron sludge production value nisp stays in the range 0 762 0 777 mg l 1 kg fe 1 a comparison among this range and that reported previously for cf 1 04 1 13 mg l 1 kg fe 1 demonstrates an additive advantage of hf process i e the lower iron sludge production about 30 less this important feature is fundamental for the process scale up because of the sludge disposal cost furthermore even though various authors 67 68 reported that the fenton iron sludge could be recycled in subsequent coagulation process the residue could not be recycled more than one time this implies that a process that generates less sludge to be disposed of is more economical convenient with respect to others producing larger sludge amounts another important result was the final ph laying in the range 8 9 and proportional to nzvi loading these results meant that no ph adjustment is necessary for iron sludge precipitation the cr vi measured in the iron sludge resulted negligible always below the limit detection of the determination method 3 3 conventional heterogeneous fenton combination though the results of heterogenous fenton oxidation tests clearly showed an overall treatment efficiency improvement of about 20 25 in a shorter time and with a minor sludge production with respect to the conventional fenton process the latter can be also considered quite satisfactory taking into account that often fenton oxidation is considered a pre treatment of a biological or other secondary treatment processes 68 indeed an important cf feature is its low cost and in addition hazardous reagents use is not required on the contrary the nzvi use is less economic with respect to ferrous salt utilization that usually is the iron precursor in nzvi synthesis 25 34 thus in order to optimize the overall treatment by taking advantages from both processes cf and hf their combination was evaluated and the results are reported in fig 8 a c the analysis of fig 8 a c leads to make the various remarks as expected nzvi addition leads to cf enhancement that resulted particularly appreciable with regard to phenols removal in fact tpre increased of about 25 30 according to optimal nzvi loading and nanoparticles addition time at whereas apre reached 100 in each test optimal nzvi h2o2 w w was 0 2 for toc and cod removal 0 25 for tp removal whereas the most effective at was 5 min after cf oxidation starting according to optimal values the obtained tre cre and tpre were 81 15 87 44 and 94 04 respectively these results show that a combination of cf and hf oxidation processes proved to be more suitable with respect to the two separate treatment the toc removal resulted 1 4 fold higher than that obtained by optimised cf and about 1 2 fold higher that reported for optimised hf similar conclusions can be drawn regarding cod and phenols removal in addition the residual oxidant concentration measured at the end of the optimal test was only 3 2 with respect to the initial hydrogen

the lower coefficient values are always associated to the first third and fourth term implying that the most important terms are those related to nzvi h2o2 in detail in eqs 8a and 8b the second and the fifth coefficient values are of the same magnitude order that is 4 fold larger than the third one and 6 fold larger than the first one in eq 8c the highest coefficient value belongs to the second term with a magnitude order 7 fold larger than the first coefficient 5 fold with respect to third and fourth ones and 1 fold with respect to the constant term table 4 reports the iron sludge production in the intensified conventional fenton oxidation tests nisp values stays in the range 0 931 1 422 mg l 1 kg fe 1 showing the higher dependence of iron sludge production on the initial fe concentration than detected in the cf and hf tests however the sludge production at optimal operating conditions 1 17 mg l 1 kg fe 1 was close to that reported for cf as already observed in the cf and hf cases the cr vi measured in the iron sludge resulted negligible always below the detection limit of the determination method finally figs 9 and 10 display two possible implementation of the cf hf process in an integrated tw treatment in a membrane filtration plant the cf hf process may be integrated in a simple two phase filtration reverse osmosis membrane plant where the first step filtration unit led to separate the solid fraction from the tw and the second step nano filtr or rev osm unit a nanofiltration or reverse osmosis process led to the reduction of cod polyphenols and cr vi cr iii concentration in the permeate with a simultaneous production of a concentrate stream where the cod polyphenols and cr vi cr iii concentration is larger with respect to that of raw tw 21 23 fig 9 shows how cf hf process can be used to treat the permeate produced subsequently to a nanofiltration process of a pre treated tw for instance by a simple cf process leading to an improvement of the overall pollutants removal efficiency and to the complete reduction of residual cr vi to cr iii this solution may prevent the possibility that residual cr vi and still significant cod and polyphenols concentration may remain in the permeate once the permeate characteristics are determined it can be directly dispose of in water bodies or if necessary can be treated in a classical biological unit since the toxic cr vi should not be present neither in trace levels on the contrary fig 10 shows how cf hf process may be used to purge the concentrate produced subsequently to a reverse osmosis process of a pre treated tw usually the concentrate generated by reverse osmosis processes depending on the wastewater characteristics are significantly polluted and might require very effective process to be treated 69 71 the combination of cf and hf process may be effectively employed to purge the concentrate from reverse osmosis or other membrane processes 4 conclusions this study reports the comparison among conventional and heterogeneous fenton oxidation processes in the treatment of tannery wastewater nzvi particles were produced and used as heterogeneous catalyzer in place of fe ii in fenton oxidation toc cod tp and cr vi removal efficiency were evaluated as well as the reduction of 228 nm absorbance value of uv spectra was monitored varying the main operating parameters h2o2 cod w w fe ii h2o2 w w nzvi h2o2 w w and ph heterogeneous fenton oxidation resulted more efficient and fast with respect to conventional fenton guaranteeing a total cr vi removal and remarkable toc cod and phenols degradation efficiency 70 17 73 26 and 87 98 respectively adopting optimal operating parameters value h2o2 cod w w 0 5 nzvi h2o2 w w 0 75 and ph 3 on the contrary the conventional fenton process fixing the optimal operating parameter values h2o2 cod w w 0 75 fe ii h2o2 w w 0 15 and ph 2 5 the cf hf combination process proved to be more efficient with respect to both conventional and heterogeneous ones under optimal operating parameters time of addition 5 min and nzvi h2o2 w w 0 2 a noticeable toc cod and phenols removal efficiency 81 15 87 44 and 94 04 respectively was achieved these results clearly showed that with a lower total iron amount optimal fe ii nzvi h2o2 w w 0 35 with respect to that employed in hf optimal nzvi h2o2 w w 0 75 the combination of cf and hf processes lead to higher treatment efficiency in addition the production of sludge containing iron in this combined process was close to that measured in the conventional one
