15185,desalination is the solution for water security in regions with insufficient resources this comes at high energy cost and hence improving desalination technologies translate into huge saving freeze desalination fd is emerging as an attractive low energy and less corrosion alternative to provide the needed fresh water the maturity of the heat driven cooling technology and solar cooling have given freeze desalination an additional momentum this paper summarizes the latest research progress done on fd that continues to push this technology towards deployment it gives an overview of the fd configurations and highlighting its pros and cons presents the recent experimental work that investigate the physics of the technology and reviews the latest high fidelity numerical modeling of brine freezing and salt diffusion away from crystal lattice which taps on the advanced development in computational power and multiphysics integration this enables one to identify the challenges facing fd technology and stating the prospect and foreseeable research the finding suggests that direct and indirect fd have been evolved well while the indirect is becoming the mainstream method for risk avoidance while vacuum freezing and eutectic freezing are still facing large obstacles in their application for direct fd gas hydrate combined with liquefied natural gas lng regasification has been popular topics to reduce their desalination cost simulation and modeling development in indirect fd continue to improve the knowledge of the mechanism of ice growth and salt entrapment which are key problems that need further experimental and numerical investigations nonetheless the current successful application of lng cold energy in freeze desalination the hybridization of fd with conventional desalination technologies as well as ultrasound assisted freezing are promising directions for fd commercialization keywords freeze crystallization freeze desalination crystal growth lng solutes concentration ultrasound energy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction desalination technologies are essential for providing enough water for daily life and industrial applications according to ida s water security handbook desaldata 2019 desalination is utilized in more than 100 countries and over 300 million people around the world 4 world population for their daily needs as of 2017 14e6 m3 day of fresh water was produced using a desalination capacity of almost 21 k plants worldwide desaldata 2019 as shown in fig 1 the desalination technologies can be classified into two major categories he and yan 2009 i the thermal based or phase change methods such as thermal distillation and freezing melting and ii the membrane based that does not incur phase change like reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed panagopoulos et al 2019 in distillation phase change technologies thermal energy in the form of heat is applied to evaporate the saline water which is then condensed and collected as fresh water the multi effect distillation med as well as the multi stage flash distillation msf are considered the most commercially successful distillation desalination technologies darwish 2010 membrane distillation md is also considered as thermally driven desalination technology with promising salt rejection where water vapor passes through a hydrophobic porous membrane el kadi et al 2020a 2020b other single phase membrane based technologies deploy semipermeable membranes to retain salts ions and allowing only pure water to permeate through membrane pores the separation is accomplished by high mechanical pressure of 10s of bars that electrically driven nagy 2018 tado et al 2016 ro nanofiltration nf electrodialysis ed additional to electrodialysis reversal edr represent the most commercially lucrative membrane based technologies panagopoulos et al 2019 although there had been progress in the developments of thermal and membrane based desalination technologies serious challenges are still happening for example thermal based desalination technologies utilize an overwhelming amount of thermal for freshwater production shatat and riffat 2014 for example msf distillation consumes 18 kwh m3 due to the high latent heat of evaporation of water which is near 2500 kj kg shatat and riffat 2014 williams et al 2015 el kadi and janajreh 2017 moreover corrosion is imminent at high operational temperature baig et al 2011 furthermore extremely high operating pressures of membrane based desalination is required to overcome pressure losses across the small and tortoise pores of the membrane while retaining and avoid the fouling of the solutes baker 2012 owing to hydraulic pressure limitations treating highly concentrated brine 70 g l using membrane methods is challenging davenport et al 2018 another inevitable challenge is membrane fouling which is the reason behind increasing membrane maintenance cost and energy demand mandating brine pre treatment and reducing membrane lifetime jiang et al 2017 the environmental impact for rejecting high concentration brine disposal of seawater is another challenge facing this growing desalination industry williams et al 2015 arhin et al 2016 the rejected brine concentration of common technologies is near 70 g l arnal et al 2005 and that can lead to large ecological changes on the long run while its treatment currently approximately consumes one third of the total desalination cost rahman et al 2007 gilron et al 2003 freeze desalination fd technology has the potential to avoid common desalination challenges it separates fresh water and brine by partially freezing the solution during which the new formed ice crystal progressively enlarged and displacing impurities including salts in the remaining brine solution while fresh water is obtained as of ice block badawy 2016 these crystalized ice blocks are separated from the super saline brine then washed before finally melted to provide pure water the freezing process of brine is clearly described in the binary phase diagram as shown in fig 2 in general the saline water located at point a moves down to the freezing point as the solution heat is pumped out of the brine filled container upon reaching to that point freezing starts forming solid ice and another concentrated brine solution as the solution salinity increases according to the phase diagram freezing point of the concentrated solution dips to a lower value and as the cooling source continues to pump out heat the new freezing point is surpassed and freezing progresses it can be seen that the salt always exists in the solution in the form of higher concentrated brine until it reaches to the eutectic point where nacl salt i e hydrohalite nacl 2h2o crystalizes simultaneously with ice compared with thermal and membrane based technologies fd tolerates less corrosion and scaling difficulties as a result pre treatment and maintenance of high tech desalination parts is accomplished with diminished costs desaldata 2019 johnson 1976 fd also has the potential in consuming lower energy driven by the low latent heat of fusion of ice i e 333 kj kg which counts only 17 of the required latent heat of evaporation i e 2500 kj kg el kadi and janajreh 2017 khawaji et al 2008 moreover fd is unrestricted in dealing with highly concentrated brines like those generated by md and td randall and nathoo 2015 in addition heat removal from the concentrated waste seawater can reach to the eutectic point enabling simultaneous ice and solid salts crystallization diallo et al 2015 hasan et al 2017 compared to md almost 2 3 times of salt rejection was achieved with three stages of fd naidu et al 2018 until now fd method has not been applied in commercial scale and studies are limited to laboratories and small pilot plants this is due to the incurred capital cost and complex operation of ice separation and melting processes williams et al 2015 the process of salt rejection during the freeze desalination is still far from being completely understood and when is subjected to the different process parameters one big challenge is salt entrapment between the ice crystals ensuing highly saltwater pocket during the freezing process cole and shapiro 1998 entrapment of heavy saline solution in the ice during crystallization compromises the desired lower salinity attainment of the ice crystal upon melting and results in necessary posttreatment such as ice crushing and recrystallization that rendering higher operating costs wiegandt and von berg 1980 subramani and jacangelo 2015 although studies on freeze crystallization dated back several centuries the understanding of ice crystallization and growth in a slurry mushy ice salt rejection during the process is still chaotic and unsystematic for instance the key parameters affecting the freezing time cooling rate cooling source temperature solution composition and ice quality are not available despite the numerous reports of experimental studies on fd moreover the new developments in saline diffusion in both experimental and numerical studies in the literature needs to be organized for more clear understanding of the fd process hence there is a need for a better cultivation of the reported findings on fd recent developments and inference of guidelines and suggestion for the prospects the current study is aiming at improving the understanding of freeze desalination process from experimental point view and computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling that help in developing accurate predictive and design assisted simulations a brief introduction of the fd process and its common configurations is initially introduced further literature survey of experimental studies involving fd of seawater and wastewater are reported highlighting the influence of process parameters e g freezing temperature salinity water composition on ice production rate and produced ice salinity in addition the development of numerical modelling of freezing desalination such as 1st principal models and high fidelity cfd models are also presented finally the challenges facing freeze desalination for commercialization and recommendations of future prospects are discussed 2 freeze desalination principles and configurations fd is one application of freeze crystallization technology in which a phase change process takes place through the cooling of the saline water until the freezing the liquid water into solid ice then separate and melt it as fresh water generally based on the freezing conditions and process freeze crystallization configuration can be classified into four main categories rahman et al 2006 kucera 2019 lu and xu 2010 rane and padiya 2011 namely 1 direct and 2 indirect which according to the contact between the cooling refrigerant and the solution rahman et al 2006 and 3 eutectic and 4 vacuum freezing that is based on operating conditions in desalination direct fd method operates using a refrigerant that is in intimate contact with the saline solution while in the indirect fd the refrigerant and solution are separated by a thermally conducting solid surface and the heat is transferred from the solution through the conducting surface that is cooled by circulating refrigerant in both direct fd and indirect fd the cooling temperature sets below the freezing point of the solution if the operational cooling temperature of the freezing process is further lowered reaching the eutectic point eutectic freezing ef takes place stepakoff et al 1974 barduhn 1963 pangborn 1963 barduhn and manudhane 1979 in ef the salt crystal and ice form simultaneously and these crystals can be separated by gravity nevertheless vacuum freezing method operates at high vacuum pressure to vaporize a share of the water rapidly that extracts huge amount of heat from the solution refrigeration effect and enabling freezing some remaining portion in the form of fresher ice the water vapor can be also recovered as fresh water dickey 1996 2 1 direct fd liquid refrigerant under pressure is injected into the brine solution leading to expansion and vaporization in the solution at low pressure this will lead to the absorption of a large amount of heat from the solution that enhances the cooling and arriving to its freezing point to form ice crystal schematic illustration of the direct freezing system is shown in fig 3 the advantage of direct fd is that it possesses super high surface area and high heat transfer coefficient because of the direct contact between the brine solution and the refrigerant direct contact fd is considered as the most effective fd mode xie et al 2018 hirakawa and kosugi 1981 in which insoluble refrigerants as butane and freon are evaporated when brought in contact with seawater and thus their latent heat are supplied from the brine and form ice crystals within the key parameter for direct fd is the selection of refrigerants barduhn 1968 recommended that the refrigerant should have a boiling point lower than 4 ⁰c low vapor pressure less than 2 8 atm at room temperature nontoxic immiscible and chemically stable in seawater and should not easily form hydrate during expansion besides these the price of refrigerant should not be high and easily available from commercial suppliers stepakoff and modica 1973 as direct fd has high cooling efficiency the production to the power ratio of this method is also high gibson et al 1974 however the main disadvantage of direct fd method is that refrigerant can be contaminated in the produced ice which makes it unsafe for potable water wang and chung 2012 also the use of an explosive refrigerant such as butane raises a major concern wang and chung 2012 the current research in direct fd is gradually moving towards using waste cold energy released from the regasification of lng xie et al 2018 lin et al 2017 besides the research of hydrate based desalination hydesal using hydrate former to extract fresh water from brine via the formation of hydrate crystal is becoming more popular cai et al 2016 he et al 2018 seo et al 2019 mok et al 2021 lee and park 2021 particularly the lng is demonstrated in cooling the brine and suggested to be used in the hydrate former as well as in generating the needed electricity for desalination lee and park 2021 babu et al 2018 the most pronounced developments in direct fd are summarized in table 1 2 2 indirect fd in the indirect fd fig 4 the saline and refrigerant are not contacted but separated by a solid barrier and the heat of the solution is drawn through this barrier to the refrigerant kalista et al 2018 there are two main classes of indirect fd 1 the suspension freezing process el kadi and janajreh 2017 as depicted in fig 5 and 2 the progressive freezing on cold surface in suspension crystallization the precooling saline solution is pumped through a scraped surface heat exchanger operating at low sub cooling temperature to promote nucleation of small crystals 50 µm then the slurries are pumped back into the main vessel for ice growth and the ice is separated from the slurry through a filter rahman et al 2006 suspension crystallization generally cannot reach freshwater standard 0 1 salinity as the formed ice crystals is small and salt is polluting their surfaces with no uniform freezing direction granted xie et al 2018 in addition the costs and difficulties involved for desalination by suspension to achieve freshwater standards was shown to be much higher than those required for progressive freezing yuan et al 2019 chang et al 2016 this is why current research on fd is focused on progressive freezing ahmad 2012 miyawaki et al 2005 fujioka et al 2013 in which a single ice layer is firstly formed on the cooled surface that successively grow in thickness as remaining brine in intimate contact with the ice for further crystallization the usual methods of freezing on cold surface include vertical progressive method see fig 6 a falling film method see fig 6b or on the rotating drum fig 6c the main advantage of freezing desalination on a cold plate is the higher produced ice quality as the ice is formed layer by layer in one dimensional direction which reduces impurities entrapment in between ice crystals rendering less complicated separation of ice and saline water the current studies in indirect fd are summarized in table 2 2 3 eutectic fd eutectic fd or eutectic freeze crystallization efc produces the fresh water and salt simultaneously by cooling the concentrated brine down to the eutectic freezing point refer to fig 2 the efc process was first proposed by barduhn 1963 and demonstrated by pangborn 1963 in this process as the brine is frozen into ice it commences to float and the remaining brine concentration increases gradually until reaching the eutectic point where the crystallized salts start to precipitate each at their unique eutectic temperature randall et al 2011 thereby the different density values of salts and ice will also facilitate the separation process hasan et al 2017 efd is different from the typical fd as the former requires lower temperature and ice salt separator although eutectic freezing required lower temperature the cost of eutectic fd can be lower due to highly effective separation process dickey 1996 which can be further economically favorable when two stage eutectic fd is involved schroeder 1980 eutectic fd can be one of promising solutions to treat highly concentrated waste brine from the reverse osmosis stepakoff et al 1974 recent development of efd is rather limited in literature in an early study by vaessen et al 2004 an indirect eutectic freezing was utilized on a ternary water solution including kno3 hno3 which are typically associated with sea salts authors have studied the heat transfer phenomenon inside two scraped crystallizers at different coolant flow conditions and scrapers rotational speeds results recommended turbulent flow condition for optimum heat transfer rates in another study by leyland et al 2019 ro brine na2so4 h2o was treated utilizing efc using various heat transfer rates and scraping speeds faster distribution of supersaturation state was achieved at higher rotational speeds and thus more efficient ice scraping process the authors have also highlighted the reduced occurrence of ice scaling issue when treating multi component brines compared to binary brines according to authors this is owed to the increase in the dissolved ionic concentration of aqueous electrolytes hartog et al 2019 used eutectic freezing to treat geothermal waste brine in the netherlands it was found that freezing can significantly reduce the amount of waste stream and produce usable water at significant yields of hydro halite with economic value efc process can be more useful with the rising environmental concerns on the ejected brine earlier lewis et al 2010 have investigated the potential of treating hypersaline wastewater brines using efc process as seen in fig 7 higher recovery rates of fresh water and salt is obtainable when the freezing temperature is approaching the eutectic point nevertheless up to seven washing stages were required to obtain pure ice crystals i e 20 ppm mazli et al 2020 have reported an enhancement approach to the efficiency of efc when compared to progressive freezing and suggested optimal operation parameters for its conditions the results showed an enhanced separation efficiency of efc over progressive however the latter have resulted in a better water recovery of 88 3 versus 66 for eutectic freezing the group of hasan et al 2017a 2017b have performed experimental and numerical investigations on na2so4 salt recovery from wastewater using eutectic fd process the researchers have explored the occurrence of ice scaling phenomenon in the absence of scrapers where it was inversely proportional to the driving force i e temperature gradient it was also found that the use of agitators becomes more crucial at higher driving force in addition the authors have investigated the distribution if ice crystal size at different salt concentrations and freezing temperature operating at eutectic condition larger na2so4 salt crystal sizes with narrow crystal size distribution csd was reported regardless of freezing rate as seen in fig 8 in a similar work by chivavava et al 2014 na2so4 crystal size was directly proportional to the supercooling condition and residence time when freezing in a continuous crystallizer at the eutectic temperature 2 4 vacuum fd vacuum fd contains vacuum freezing system to extract the water vapor from seawater and vapor compression systems to collect the vapor a portion of water evaporates under high vacuumed pressure by pump and the evaporating water removes the latent heat of water to start freezing of the seawater serving as the refrigerant in direct fd kalista et al 2018 the vapor and formed ice are collected to harvest the fresh water the challenges that hinder the application of vacuum fd are the associated high cost of vapor transportation operating at the sub triple point pressure this is due to the absent of reliable water freezing control the large energy consumption in compressing and collecting the water vapor kalista et al 2018 chivavava et al 2014 these unsolved challenges are the main drawback for the development of vacuum freezing on a recent published work cao and wang 2019 wang and cao 2020 have performed simultaneous seawater freezing and vaporization where pure water in form of crystallized ice and water vapor were formed under vacuum and triplet point conditions vacuum freezing was aided with enhanced nucleating agents to achieve zero thermal energy consumption similar investigation was reported back in 1984 by el nashar 1984 in which a solar assisted vacuum evaporative freezing ejector at pressure of 3 mmhg was utilized for seawater desalination summarizing it can be found that the fd is observing renascence and developments with the indirect and direct freezing are receiving much attention the eutectic freezing and vacuum freezing are continue developing at slower rates because of their inherited and unresolved challenges nevertheless vacuum assisted indirect fd was recently promoted as a promising alternative compared to normal operating pressures with high salt rejection hernández yáñez et al 2021 comparing the indirect freezing and direct freezing indirect freezing is more suitable for producing drinking water the numbers of research of indirect freezing desalination make it also possible to discuss and infer the key parameters affecting the process performance and metrics this will be discussed in next section 3 experimental development of freeze desalination as observed in the previous section most experimental efforts of fd for different water compositions have utilized indirect freeze crystallization configuration in general the success and effectiveness of fd process is tied to the operating conditions of the crystallization stage initial concentration refrigerant temperature fluid temperature subcooling degree and solution flow rate as well as the presence of seeding are examples of key operating conditions regardless of the targeted application several experimental parameters have been utilized through literature to evaluate the performance of any freeze crystallization method depending on its operating conditions and solution composition this includes the most common parameters manifested in i effective partition constant k and ii salt removal efficiency r but also others including iii crystal size iv concentration of salt in the produced ice v fresh water yield and vi ice crystal front growth rate amran et al 2016 salt removal efficiency r and effective partition constant k are frequently utilized to evaluate a desalination process r is known as the ratio of the difference between initial salinity and ice salinity to that of the initial salinity and is written in eq 1 as 1 r 1 c i c e c 0 100 where c i c e and c 0 are the ice salinity and initial salinity respectively k is known as the ratio of ice salinity c i c e to remain concentrated solution salinity c l and is written in eq 2 as 2 k c i c e c l many experimental works have been conducted to reduce the effective partition constant and enhance salt removal efficiency in this part experimental works for improving salt removal efficiency including seeking optimal operation parameters multi level successive freezing post treatment of ice and enhancement of the salt diffusion as well as mitigation salt entrapment will be reviewed fujioka et al 2013 experimentally demonstrated ice front control progressive freezing and showed that desalination efficiency can be increased by either lowering the speed of the forming ice front and the initial concentration or by increasing the circumferential velocity of the stirrer these findings are consistent with other literature which show that higher initial salinity in the brine results in a higher salinity in the formed ice htira et al 2018 el kadi and janajreh 2018 and slower cooling rate favors the formation of lower salinity crystalized ice eghtesad et al 2020 htira et al 2018 el kadi and janajreh 2018 on the other hand a substantially low freezing temperature results in increasing the cooling rate and consequently jeopardizing the purity of the produced ice mtombeni et al 2013 this is to indicate that although higher heat pumping results in increasing ice production this may come at the cost of lower ice quality eghtesad et al 2020 moreover the presence of other minerals e g fluoride was found to decrease the overall removal efficiency by 10 25 yang et al 2017 because of the imperfection of salt removal by freezing fresh water cannot be obtained from saline water by single step freezing successive freezing is one option to produce fresh water by multiple steps freezing melting cycles jayakody et al 2020 applied lng as cooling source to freeze melt the nacl solution 15 g l for desalination and after three successive cycles to obtain potable water level 1 g l the authors demonstrated achieving freshwater level by freezing nacl solution 35g l in freeze dryer within five steps badawy 2016 demonstrated freezing melting of seawater 41 g l from red sea in saudi arabia using eight steps and obtain potable water with 0 6 g l salinity however multiple freezing melting cycles increases the complexity and the associated cost of the process thereby increasing the cost of the obtained potable water on the other hand williams et al 2013 have reported an overall salt rejection of 16 4 when four successive freezing stages was performed during ro brine concentration a two stage fd process for seawater was performed utilizing both falling film and block freezing techniques to achieve 98 5 salt removal efficiency zambrano et al 2018 although multi stage freezing has illustrated promising salt rejection and water recovery it was found in a previous study by the authors of this work that higher cost is resulting when compared to conventional thermal based desalination technologies zhang et al 2021 the alternative option to obtain fresh water from freezing is the post treatment of the fresh water post treatment methods are commonly used for increasing the ice quality including washing sweating with gravity induced brine drainage centrifugation soaking and watering etc beier et al 2007 yang et al 2017 sweating was used as a posttreatment method to enhance the final water quality reaching to 0 5 g kg salt concentration as investigated by rich et al 2010 2012 likewise mandri et al 2011 found that sweating can help to drain out the trapped brine pockets nonetheless sweating oversaw losing almost 18 of the crystallized ice weight during suspension fd process as reported by mountadar et al 2019 from seawater desalination experiments washing ice with fresh water has been observed to increase salt removal efficiency by roughly 42 han et al 2017 however washing ice to achieve potable water consumes large amount of fresh water lu et al 2019 have illustrated that if a water recovery ratio of 25 is achieved the amount of salt adhesion at ice surfaces will require heavy washing process making the fd process infeasible in different attempt luo et al 2010 crushed the layered ice to open the trapped saltwater pockets followed by centrifugation to drain out the salt water and improve ice quality similarly yang et al 2018 washed the crushed ice with raw seawater before centrifugation which was proved to further improve the ice quality as an easy and economical posttreatment method in addition keeping the ice pressed for some time can significantly reduce the ice salinity which avoids water usage unlike sweating and washing method erlbeck et al 2018 the posttreatment methods are summarized in table 3 from the above literature it can be noticed that several freezing parameters and ice posttreatment were investigated in attempt to improve the ice quality it was demonstrated that impurity of obtained ice is mainly from the brine adhered to ice crystal surfaces and the brine pockets formed by the trapped brine between ice crystals in the ice blocks chen et al 2020 at higher freezing rate the rejected salt by ice crystal cannot fully diffuse from the ice surface to solution so that part of the salt is trapped between ice crystals on the contrary slow freezing rate allow the displacement and diffusion of the salt away from the ice surface into the lower salinity brine in addition for lower initial salinity brine the entrapment of the salt is less pronounced because of the low initial salinity which results in the better ice quality when compared with the high initial salinity salt diffusion and the formation of salt pockets is the root cause for the ice salinity that has not been well documented only scattered and limited work have been published on the salt diffusion during freezing castillo téllez et al 2020 reported the obtained salinity gradient from collecting and melting the initial brine at 34 5 g l nacl h2o they used different freezing temperatures 8 15 and 30 c and different crystallizer geometries they concluded that higher freezing temperature and longer crystallizer result in better ice quality due to the slow freezing rate that enables the salt ions to move towards the saline solution prior reaching solidification it was also found that the salinity increased dramatically in the last formed ice layers however detailed analysis of the salinity gradient and salt immigration were not provided or discussed in their work in the authors recent directional freezing experimental work zhang and janajreh 2021 the salt gradients of ice from the directional freezing experiments of brine under different freezing temperatures are obtained and it was found that higher freezing temperature lower freezing rate does not always produce lower salinity ice also optimal freezing temperature was found for freezing 35 g l nacl solution is around 15 c to yield the lowest salinity gradient in the first 50 ice compared to 40 25 and 10 c as shown in fig 9 this result may indicate that the salt diffusion during freezing is controlled by multiple factors and the balance of these factors may lead to optimal low salinity in the formed ice chen et al 2020 confirmed that the salt entrapment is the main source of higher salinity in the ice and they reported optimal subcooling temperature for obtaining lowest ice salinity they suggested to improve ice quality by avoiding the agglomeration of ice crystals during freezing however practical method to avoid the mentioned agglomeration was not discussed a big step forward was done by yuan et al 2020 who reported the experimental observation of ice growth and salt entrapment in the freezing experiment of 3 nacl brine solution phase field concentration field and temperature field are coupled in one numerical model in their work to simulate the freezing process in their work they stated that heterogeneous growth of dendrites during the freezing prevent the salt water that present between the dendrites from moving out and lead to the trap of high salt concentration in the melted ice their sensitivity analysis showed that subcooling degree significantly affected the salinity of the bottom formed ice the solid phase ratio as well as the height of the planar crystal this pioneering work however failed to provide recommendation for controlling the formation of salt entrapment leaving it open ended research the ongoing research aim to further improve the ice quality from the root level and this field is attracting more research interests 4 modelling development of freeze desalination despite the valuable experimental improvements done on fd technology challenges associated with understanding the phenomenon of ice growth and salt impurities are still posing a crucial drawback high fidelity cfd modeling has the precedence in providing detailed and accurate knowledge of the ice formation process at any location within the crystallizer modeling ice crystallization for desalination of brine is a multiphysics problem involving conjugated heat and mass transfer in both direct and indirect configurations heat transfers from the brine solution into the refrigerant and thus salt diffusion is promoted by the established temperature gradient heat transfers by two mechanisms i convective heat transfer to the brine solution and ii conductive heat transfer through ice crystal nonetheless indirect freezing involves another conduction mechanism through the cold wall between the brine solution and refrigerant on the other hand direct freezing involves simultaneous evaporation of refrigerant during ice crystallization modeling of such multiphysics system has been facilitated due to the availability of a board range of functional commercial cfd software nonetheless ansys fluent has caught the interest of decent number of researchers over the past decades hasan et al 2017 jayakody et al 2020 el kadi et al 2021 taghizadeh et al 2014 the governing system of equations of a typical indirect fd system of seawater can be expressed as seen in table 4 these are statement of the three conservative laws i e mass momentum energy and their derivatives such as conservation of species state equations and additional functional relationship of phase diagram observation and inference ice crystallization is governed by the solidification melting approach ansys fluent activates an enthalpy porosity technique referred as solidification melting model in which a single domain is considered rather than multiphase flow in this formulation a liquid solid mushy zone is considered in the domain to act as a porous region having a porosity defined as the liquid fraction in the range of 0 and 1 zimmermann et al 2015 the function of liquid fraction can be found from eq 3 in table 4 where t t l i q u i d u s and t s o l i d u s are the local temperature and the temperatures which bounds mushy zone between the liquid and the solid phases the mushy zone exists amongst a higher liquidus temperature t l i q u i d u s and a lower solidus temperature t s o l i d u s for a multicomponent mixture voller and prakash 1987 the two boundary temperature can be calculated by eqs 4 and 5 in these two equations t m e l t is the melting temperature of pure water k 0 is the ratio of solute mass fraction in the solid to that in the liquid at the interface k 0 y s s o l y s l i q and it is proportionally related with the initial salinity m s is the slope of the liquidus line with respect to the local solute mass fraction y s during the solidification process of the brine solution salt redistribution and segregation from solid to liquid phase is described by scheil model which assumes zero salt diffusion in the solidified zone utilizing a nonlinear relationship between the liquid fraction and interface temperature zimmermann et al 2015 therefore the modified continuity equation is shown in eq 6 in table 4 in this equation ρ is density y s l i q is the salt mass fraction in the liquid region v is the liquid velocity d s m l i q is the solute mass diffusion coefficient in the liquid region momentum equation is solved throughout the domain and consequential velocity field is distributed among the phases the basic momentum equation is modified by adding an appropriate sink term to account for pressure drop due to the phase change from water to ice voller and swaminathan 1991 the final momentum equation is shown in eq 7 where p is the static pressure μ is the molecular viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration a m u s h is the mushy zone constant and ε is a very small added number to avoid division by zero energy equation in this model is shown in eq 8 in this equation h is the overall enthalpy k is the thermal conductivity and h s j s is an addition of species transport for solidification melting problems hs is the enthalpy of salt specie and js is the diffusion mass flux of salt several numerical works have investigated the ice growth rate with the controlling conditions temperature profile qin et al 2004 and heat transfer coefficient heat transfer coefficient qin et al 2009 unsteady heat transfer qin et al 2003 and ice growth kinetics for a continuous freezing process chivavava et al 2014 genceli et al 2009 for instant the separation of binary mixture freezing for saltwater desalination using indirect fd was modeled in 2 d cfd by abid and safi 2015 who ignored the effect of ice growth kinetics jayakody et al 2018 have developed 3d cfd model to simulate a single unit of ice formation process in saline solution 1 5 4 5 salinity and validated their findings using experimental results obtained by an instrumented ice maker machine good modeling and experimental agreement were obtained showing a maximum deviation of 0 93 for the temperature change 15 for the ice salinity and 13 1 for brine salinity the volume of ice was always overestimated by the cfd model with error percentage ranging between 3 5 and 18 the modeling reveals that low cooling temperature results in a faster freezing rate and marked lowest average salinity of 0 5 at 245 k freezing temperature and ice thickness of 3 3 mm the second stage freezing of the obtained 0 5 saline was conducted as well and produced a salinity level below the stipulated potable range of 0 1 another 2 d cfd model was developed by the authors el kadi and janajreh 2018 to perform parametric studies of indirect fd in a rectangular tray in that work several parameters studied including the initial brine salinity the freezing source temperature and the initial brine temperature the results revealed that brines having lower salinities tends to produce high quality ice and lower freezing temperature leads to higher freezing rate at the cost of a lower salt removal efficiency see fig 10 moreover decreasing the subcooled temperature from 20⁰c to 0⁰c showed to significantly raising the growth rates but at the expense of reducing the removal efficiency by almost 10 in a more recent study the influence of radial and vertical indirect directional freezing was assessed in terms of effective partition coefficient and removal efficiency for seawater desalination el kadi et al 2021 a 3 d axisymmetric cylindrical crystallizer was modeled using cfd good agreement with experimental data for brine salinity of 1 7 and 3 5 is shown as in fig 11 yet with overestimation of ice salinity particularly at lower crystallinity levels this increase might be associated with low value of salt diffusion coefficient d s m l i q simulation results also showed the removal efficiency of seawater reached 44 06 and 28 3 for radial and bottom vertical freezing respectively in addition a significant increase in the removal efficiency reaching to 55 67 for a single stage freezing can be achieved when stirring is involved as seen in fig 12 the existence of a stirrer eliminates salt accumulation at crystal growth interface by creating a continuous homogenous solution during the diffusion of salts from the crystallized ice toward the concentrated brine the freezing parameters optimization is also conducted by eghtesad et al 2020 in a 2d axisymmetric hollow cylinder they implemented artificial neural network ann and multi objective optimization using genetic algorithm ga for reaching the highest ice mass at the lowest salinity two optimized parameter regions were obtained in this study to obtain the best performance for ice mass and its salinity although the parameters effects on the freezing performance have been widely studied the salt diffusion and entrapment in the crystalized ice has not been understood well recently yuan et al 2020 applied phase field method to simulate the growth of the ice crystal during fd process of binary system of water nacl in that work single nucleus crystallization multi nucleus competition crystallization and the directional competitive crystallization of the binary solutions was simulated based on numerical model coupling phase salinity and temperature fields the morphology of the ice crystal and the salt trapping mechanism inside the formed ice were expanded salt entrapment in the ice results from the heterogenous growth of multi ice dendrites between adjacent dendrites salt accumulated at the solid liquid interface hindering crystallization and brine channels formed followed by the formation of salt cells when the channels were blocked by the join of dendrites the recent and rapid development of molecular dynamics simulations have also contributed to the study of the freezing at a molecular level tsironi et al 2020 investigated the freezing process of nacl h2o solutions utilizing a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and x ray diffraction at different salt water concentrations brine rejection attributed to hexagonal ice ih formation was witnessed and nacl 2h2o hydrates was found coexist with ice ih the observation suggests that the ion inclusions due to the existence of nacl 2h2o hydrates was another source of the salt in the ice except for salt entrapment and salt adhesion on ice surface these molecular dynamics simulations estimated that the lowest salinity can be obtained in ice is 0 5 by mass due to ion inclusions table 5 summarizes the development of modelling for fd 5 current strategies and path forward 5 1 ice quality enhancement 5 1 1 nucleation and supercooling in crystallization freezing process consists of two steps namely nucleation and crystallization nucleation is the critical step which initiates the crystallization of liquid furthermore considering the composition of the liquid nucleation can be either of the two types homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation mellado and augusto 1998 the homogeneous nucleation is mostly favorable in pure systems where random but slight fluctuations of density occurs and accordingly nucleation takes place spontaneous without any preferential sites mellado and augusto 1998 heterogeneous nucleation randomly happens on preferential sites including phase boundaries wall of a container and at impurity particles and is enhanced by seeding the solution with nucleating agent the nucleation process can be explained by free energy theory as shown in the below equation mellado and augusto 1998 as well as in fig 13 kingery et al 1976 9 δ g l s 4 3 π r 3 δ g v 4 π r 2 γ where δ g l s is the net free energy of formation r is the radius of the crystal δ g v is the difference between the solid and aqueous phase free energies and γ is the interfacial tension between the ice and unfrozen phase the first term on the right side of the equation has negative sign and reflects the contribution of volume energy whereas the second term corresponds to the surface energy as the temperature of the solution decrease to below melting point water molecules are forced to be more ordered and form a stable lattice structure tleimat 1980 the free energy of this structure is described by eq 9 and increases with the structure radius firstly to reach the maximum value then decreases with structure radius the cluster radius size at maximum free energy is called critical radius r during nucleation if the structure radius exceeds r the free energy will decrease as the radius increases thus a non re dissolved structure is formed and it is called nuclei or nucleus after that the nuclei will automatically grow to form the crystal mellado and a 1998 this critical radius r is determined by the following equation tleimat 1980 10 r 2 γ t f l f δ t where the interfacial tension γ is estimated value of 22 e r g c m 2 t f is the solution s freezing temperature given in kelvin l f is volumic latent heat of fusion while the δt is the supercooling degree representing the temperature difference between freezing melting point and the actual freezing temperature this equation shows that the critical radius of a crystal varies with subcooling temperature therefore the nucleation is related to the operating conditions such as the cooling source surface temperature and solution freezing melting point in freeze desalination the existence of supercooling before the brine freezing increases the freezing desalination cost because supercooling reduces the crystallization temperature and delays the freezing supercooling occurs mainly when water is pure or lacks enough nucleus koop et al 2000 from the literature supercooling during brine freeze desalination has not been well investigated and the microphysical mechanisms of ice nucleation as well as the subsequent freezing kinetics of brine are still not clear this lack of understanding makes it difficult to control the freezing process in author s work zhang and janajreh 2021 supercooling was reported in the freezing experiment of water and sodium chloride solution 200 ml in glass jar it was found out that brine has much larger supercooling temperature than pure water fig 14 shows evolution of supercooling temperature with time during the freezing process of water droplet at 15 ⁰c chen et al 2020 reported the supercooling of 200 ml sodium chloride solution frozen in autoclave and they claimed that supercooling time of 35 g l solution can be controlled into 60 min when the supercooling degree is larger than 2 4 k these limited works considering comprehensive effects of the container surface bulk liquid volume and impurity are far from enough to understand the supercooling microphysical mechanisms droplet freezing is a promising way to understand the freezing process avoiding the effects of container surface and bulk volume barma et al 2021 tried to freeze partially individual sodium chloride solution droplets suspended in cold immiscible liquids to study the supercooling under different cooling rate droplet size and salt concentration and they developed a model to predict freezing temperature of saline droplets more research in the micro droplets freezing should be conducted to reveal the microphysical understanding of complex and stochastic freezing process as well as the desalination process of brine droplets 5 1 2 multistage freezing multistage separation has always been an efficient approach for large scale applications for fd technology to operate as a standalone a multistage is thereby necessary to achieve potable water standards according to world health organization who drinkable water must achieve a maximum salinity of 500 mg l i e 0 05 wt organization 1963 moreover multistage plants consumes lower energy and operating cost could be 50 70 lower than that of a single stage rahman et al 2007 the concept of multistage freezing for seawater desalination was first patented in 1989 by griffiths 1989 where ice purity reached up to 99 99 after utilizing four series of crystallization stages thereafter very limited work have investigated this approach for freeze desalination eghtesad et al 2020 zambrano et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 badawy 2022 salakhi et al 2022 for instant eghtesad et al 2020 showed that who standards can be achieved after three stages of indirect fd if the negative heat flux is not below 750 w m2 increase of ice production was also noticed in latter stages of the system compared to the first stage owed to the reduced salinity on successive steps another work by badawy 2022 utilizing successive freezing separation melting stages of synthetized seawater samples 4 1 nacl at temperature of 20 c was performed salinity of the produced ice see fig 15 showed an exponential decay with 8 successive freezing melting stage until reaching to a removal efficiency of 98 5 nonetheless a serious mass loss of the initial seawater feed of around 65 was present by the end of the multistage process similar approach was followed by salakhi et al 2022 with three stages of falling film freeze desalination to meet who standards of drinking water nonetheless it has been reported that higher re number of the refrigerant is favorable to water recovery but not to its salinity in a recent work by the authors four stages of freezing with 5 ice recovery at each stage was implemented to achieve potable level zhang et al 2021 from the previous attempts one can note that multistage freezing is very efficient in achieving ultrapure water nonetheless the amount of water recovery requires major attention research towards increasing the amount of ice produced in each stage with conserving the same high quality product is demanding after succeeding these two factors freeze desalination will be a powerful competitive to conventional techniques in desalination industry 5 2 energy reduction strategies thermal energy is dissipated and introduced in several steps during fd as described in fig 16 the process is initiated by sensible cooling of seawater until reaching the freezing point t f at which latent heat of fusion i e 334 kj kg is released from the system and crystallization of ice takes place eventually ice block is produced and sensible cooling is resumed until reaching to the final temperature of ice block t i at this point sensible heat is introduced to the ice block to produce water in its liquidus state t w the associated heat released input rate to the system can be estimated using eqs 11 14 11 q s 1 m c p l t l c p f t f 12 q l m δ h 13 q s 2 m c p f t f c p i t i 14 q s 3 m c p i t i c p w t w the total energy of the system is thereby expressed as 15 q t o t q s 1 q l q s 2 q s 3 where q is the heat rate kj s during sensible cooling s1 s2 and heating s3 processes as well as during latent heat release l m is the mass flow rate at each stage kg s whereas c p and t are the specific heat capacity at the initial seawater feed l freezing point f final ice block state i and melted water w δ h is the latent heat of fusion of seawater kj kg the values of the above parameters are salinity and temperature dependent eventually the electrical energy e consumed by a fd system can be estimated using the following expression 16 c o p q t o t e where cop is the coefficient of performance of refrigeration to obtain the specific energy consumption sec i e kwh m3 one should fractionate over the volume m3 although the fd process consumes less energy than thermal desalination theoretically this target has not been realized in industry yet one of the main challenges is that subcooling environment in the fd by refrigeration cycle consumes high grade energy in the form of electricity yan 2015 or refrigeration cycle with a low performance coefficient in addition the multistage freezing rather than single step freezing also increase the energy consumption and the low scale energy regeneration is painstaking and unprofitable therefore if alternative sources of lower cost energy could be utilized in freezing fd will become more feasible solar cooling technologies ajib and alahmer 2018 waste heat driven thermoacoustic refrigerator gardner and howard 2009 and lng cold energy wang and chung 2012 can be the option of energy for fd and these are detailed further in the next section 5 2 1 solar cooling a rapid research growth is seen in solar thermal cooling technology since the start of this century and is continuing to emerge the worldwide installations of solar cooling increase from 1200 mw in 2014 jakob 2016 to almost 2000 mw in 2018 iea 2019 the mediterranean countries are still the main market where italy arose as the most impressive one in 2018 driven by the high investment subsidies the middle east and australia s solar cooling markets keep growing recently raturi 2019 this rate of growth results from the technological and economic developments of solar cooling industry such as the improvement of solar collectors invention of adsorption chillers and growing market for solar thermal lazzarin and noro 2018 it may be expected that solar cooling system can be used to cool the brine to a temperature below freezing point for fd this low cost renewable energy can be used to replace the current high grade electricity that currently is used in fd pilot plants 5 2 2 waste heat driven thermoacoustic refrigerator tar tar is an emerging type of refrigerator that is capable of generating wide range of cooling capacities from 293 k down to 20 28 k mckelvey et al 1995 radebaugh et al 1990 hu et al 2007 using the thermoacoustic work tar is capable in pumping heat from low temperature region to the atmosphere to cool down the saline tar presents several outstanding advantages as wang et al 2020 i environmentally friendly by using noble gases e g helium nitrogen co2 as their working gases ii flexible driver methods these devices can be powered by electric linear compressors or be integrated to heat driven thermoacoustic heat engines iii high reliability as well as less maintenance as tar usually has no moving parts wang et al 2018 proposed one heat driven travelling wave thermoacoustic refrigerator twtar with three engine and three refrigerator cores in these experiments 4 5 kw cooling power was generated at 283 k xu et al 2020 have established a theoretical analysis of a proposed looped thermoacoustically driven refrigerator using low grade heat and 2 7 kw of cooling power was achieved at 270 k the waste heat from the industry can be reused by thermoacoustic wave refrigerator to provide cryogenic energy for fd in order to reduce the electricity consumption in fd and thereby reduce the desalination cost until now there is few research from literature to study the combination of tar and fd to reduce the fd cost which deserves more attention 5 2 3 lng cold energy and hydesal nowadays lng represents 1 3 of the natural gas trade movement internationally lin et al 2010 at lng terminals lng is re gasified and delivered to consumer terminals in the form of gas miyazaki et al 2000 during the regasification waste cold energy is released to the surrounding such as seawater or air owing to the low temperature of lng 110 k qiang et al 2005 high energy density and considering the fast increasing global lng market lng cryogenic energy is a high quality energy source cold energy from lng regasification has already been applied in some research of seawater desalination cao et al 2015 designed one flake ice maker utilizing lng cold energy and it was found that 2 kg ice was generated with 1 kg lng re gasification chang et al 2016 apply lng cold energy in seawater fd in singapore where huge lng storage market exists to achieve water with 0 3 g l salinity a hybrid desalination process comprising fd and membrane distillation processes by utilizing both waste cold energy lng and waste heat is developed by wang and chung 2012 and the system produced potable water with 71 5 water recovery using of the cold energy of lng provide triple benefits for fd in saving the electricity consumption by electrical refrigeration equipment and reducing the energy and emission of the entire process the combination of lng re gasification and fd should be vigorously developed to accelerate fd commercialization process 5 2 4 ultrasound assisted freeze desalination the application of fd is detriment by the reduced ice production at higher salinity brines meanwhile the utilization of ultrasound waves in controlling the phase transition of supercooled water to ice is proved to enhanced mass transfer between phases inada et al 2001 as discussed in section 5 1 regulating the supercooling degree of brine results in faster freezing and higher desalination efficiency in this regard ultrasonic controlled freezing reported a reduced supercooling degree during the freezing of water droplet gao et al 2019 and supercritical carbon dioxide riera et al 2004 the main idea is that ultrasonic vibration will cause the formation of cavitation within the supercooled fluid which as a result induces ice nucleation the occurrence of cavitation due to a certain ultrasound intensity is directly proportional to the maximum acoustic pressure p a m a x being greater than the critical pressure inada et al 2001 based on the dynamic instability of a single bubble cavitation appears if 17 r g 4 σ l g 3 p a m a x p v p a t m where r g is the gas bubble nucleus radius σ l g is the surface energy at liquid gas interface while p v and p a t m is the vapor and atmospheric pressure respectively nevertheless one should note that ultrasound loading time to be controlled and limited during the freezing process else continuous loading may cause deterring in the freezing performance gao et al 2022 cong et al 2021 have assessed droplet freezing with three different ultrasonic loading routes no ultrasound time controlled ultrasound and continuous ultrasound the frequency of the ultrasound was fixed at 40 000 hz and 1000 w m2 both experimental and modelling results showed that the freezing time is the lowest for the time controlled ultrasound rather than the continuous in the case of continuous loading the ultrasound is maintained even after reaching the critical point which as a result causes heat loss through cavitation instead ultrasound loading is terminated once the critical point is reached i e controlled loading route in a very recent attempt by gao et al 2022 an ultrasound assisted spray suspension freezing followed by centrifugal treatment was utilized to perform seawater desalination at first low frequency high energy lh ultrasound was used to experimentally test the freezing time of a saline droplet it was found that the freezing time has reported a 15 reduction when ultrasound intensity of 1000 w m2 was used furthermore a mathematical model was developed to simulate the suspension of the cooled saline droplets controlled by ultrasound waves with frequency ranging from 20 000 hz to 40 000 hz i e high frequency low energy hl ultrasound it was found that ultrasound can strongly affects the heat and mass transfer during the phase change process this is due to the activated cavitation effect of ultrasound eventually homogenous nucleation of ice crystals occurs the freezing rate was significantly improved at higher ultrasound loading moreover a final salinity of below 0 2 from a single stage freezing was achieved ultrasound assisted fd has a great potential to compete with conventional desalination methods with an energy consumption of 1 7 kwh m3 and water production rate of 1 8 m3 h compared to 0 3 0 4 kwh m3 and 0 97 m3 h for ro 5 7 7 8 kw m3 and 1 04 m3 h for med yet with higher production costs gao et al 2022 still plenty research in utilizing ultrasound in enhancing the fd efficiency are worth discovering 5 3 commercialization strategies fd method has not been applied in commercial desalination plants neither effectively nor sufficiently due to physical process complexity operational constrains condition dependence and the involved separation this all translate to an additional cost and fierce competition with well established and tunable desalination technologies reduction of capital cost comes with technical maturity and thus more research and development in this field is required this comes with time and more funding and sponsor spending including local authorities and world banks and other international organization and agencies that promotes green energy lower emission and sustainability one major leeway of cost reduction is in using hybrid and integrated technology baayyad et al 2015 proposed the hybrid system by combining freezing and membrane distillation processes their feasibility showed that such system can save around 25 of the cost and the produced water quality can be improved by 71 compared with the conventional ro desalination ahmad et al 2018 investigated the potential for using suspension crystallization and ro desalination for the seawater desalination experimentally they achieved 41 water recovery and with salt rejection ratio over 99 makes it comparable to the most desalination technologies apart from improving the ice quality fd can also treat the waste brine from desalination plants due to its insensitivity to highly concentrated brine which is unfavorable for the environment minimal liquid discharge mld 95 water recovery and even zero liquid discharge zld 100 water recovery processes are promising engineering disposal approach for waste brine in which the desalination plants only discharge small to nil amount of liquid into the environment this leads to a significant reduction of waste brine volume furthermore mld zld technique eliminates liquid waste maximizes water usage efficiency and mitigates potential water quality williams et al 2015 proposed a falling film crystallization for the treatment of waste brine from al khadimah ro plant and the results showed that freeze crystallization can help to significantly reduce the annual waste brine rate from ro plant from 191 84 t year to 23 39 t year randall et al 2011 has also conducted a case study on disposing reverse osmosis waste brine using the eutectic fd and they achieved near zero waste at 99 9 overall water recovery in eutectic fd salt crystals can be separated from solution via gravitational settling while ice crystals can be removed via flotation genceli 2008 moreover pure salts can be recovered from the brine because of different eutectic temperatures of the single salts lewis et al 2008 the zld freezing desalination will become more attractive with the tightening environmental regulations and increasing public environmental awareness a third pathway in cost reduction and deployment of fd technology is the reduction energy consumption this can include several aids from renewable energy thermoacoustic lng energy and ultrasound as discussed in the previous section table 6 summarizes the energy consumption of several fd systems evaluated in literature from these results it is obvious that hybridization with conventional desalination technology or utilization of sustainable energy source is crucial for commercialization fig 17 compares those fd hybridized attempts with conventional commercial desalination technologies e g msf ro al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 one can clearly note the great potential of such enhanced fd systems in terms of energy consumption and thus freshwater production cost it is also clear that multistage freezing has a great impact on increasing the energy consumption even when renewable energy is involved it should be also emphasized that further investigation of the mechanism of salt entrapment both numerically and analytically using high fidelity cfd modeling field coupling model and molecular dynamics simulations can help to understand the salt diffusion and ice growing process this can help to control the salinity in the ice to reduce the cost of posttreatment of produced ice in addition better understanding of the freezing process can help to promote the crystallization at low subcooling which will also help to reduce the energy cost 6 conclusions the finding suggests that direct fd and indirect fd have been developed well and become the mainstream of freezing desalination methods vacuum freezing and eutectic freezing develop slowly because they are still facing large obstacles in their application for direct fd gas hydrate combined with lng regasification has been popular topic to reduce their desalination cost simulation development in indirect fd continue to improve the understanding of freezing process and the mechanism of ice growth and salt entrapment these are key problems for indirect fd which can be further investigated both experimentally and numerically the current successful application of lng cold energy in freezing desalination has opened another opportunity to this technology the combination of fd with conventional desalination such as membrane desalination are another promising direction for fd commercialization freezing desalination technologies are attractive to be one alternative commercial desalination to provide enough water for daily life and industrial applications this paper reviews the latest research progress on freezing desalination and finds that direct fd and indirect fd have been developed well and are the mainstream of freezing desalination methods vacuum freezing and eutectic freezing develop slowly because of the challenges in these technologies are still not solved in order to promote the commercial application of freezing desalination the following suggestions are given according to the literature review 1 the understanding of the parameters that affect the performance of freezing has been relatively comprehensive thus the focus of research should be put on the mechanism of ice growth and salt entrapment during freezing by both numerical and experimental study 2 there have been some successful application of lng cold energy in freezing desalination lng cold energy is a very attractive energy source for both direct fd and indirect fd and more research attention should be paid to the application of lng energy to promote the commercialization of fd 3 combining fd with other conventional desalination methods is a promising option for fd commercialization 4 computational fluid dynamics cfd and molecular dynamics models targeting freeze desalination is limited in literature although these tools can be powerful in understanding the crystal growth and salt entrapment and thus brings us one step towards commercialization declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment the funding support received by the khalifa university under award no rc2 2018 009 is highly acknowledged 
15185,desalination is the solution for water security in regions with insufficient resources this comes at high energy cost and hence improving desalination technologies translate into huge saving freeze desalination fd is emerging as an attractive low energy and less corrosion alternative to provide the needed fresh water the maturity of the heat driven cooling technology and solar cooling have given freeze desalination an additional momentum this paper summarizes the latest research progress done on fd that continues to push this technology towards deployment it gives an overview of the fd configurations and highlighting its pros and cons presents the recent experimental work that investigate the physics of the technology and reviews the latest high fidelity numerical modeling of brine freezing and salt diffusion away from crystal lattice which taps on the advanced development in computational power and multiphysics integration this enables one to identify the challenges facing fd technology and stating the prospect and foreseeable research the finding suggests that direct and indirect fd have been evolved well while the indirect is becoming the mainstream method for risk avoidance while vacuum freezing and eutectic freezing are still facing large obstacles in their application for direct fd gas hydrate combined with liquefied natural gas lng regasification has been popular topics to reduce their desalination cost simulation and modeling development in indirect fd continue to improve the knowledge of the mechanism of ice growth and salt entrapment which are key problems that need further experimental and numerical investigations nonetheless the current successful application of lng cold energy in freeze desalination the hybridization of fd with conventional desalination technologies as well as ultrasound assisted freezing are promising directions for fd commercialization keywords freeze crystallization freeze desalination crystal growth lng solutes concentration ultrasound energy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction desalination technologies are essential for providing enough water for daily life and industrial applications according to ida s water security handbook desaldata 2019 desalination is utilized in more than 100 countries and over 300 million people around the world 4 world population for their daily needs as of 2017 14e6 m3 day of fresh water was produced using a desalination capacity of almost 21 k plants worldwide desaldata 2019 as shown in fig 1 the desalination technologies can be classified into two major categories he and yan 2009 i the thermal based or phase change methods such as thermal distillation and freezing melting and ii the membrane based that does not incur phase change like reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed panagopoulos et al 2019 in distillation phase change technologies thermal energy in the form of heat is applied to evaporate the saline water which is then condensed and collected as fresh water the multi effect distillation med as well as the multi stage flash distillation msf are considered the most commercially successful distillation desalination technologies darwish 2010 membrane distillation md is also considered as thermally driven desalination technology with promising salt rejection where water vapor passes through a hydrophobic porous membrane el kadi et al 2020a 2020b other single phase membrane based technologies deploy semipermeable membranes to retain salts ions and allowing only pure water to permeate through membrane pores the separation is accomplished by high mechanical pressure of 10s of bars that electrically driven nagy 2018 tado et al 2016 ro nanofiltration nf electrodialysis ed additional to electrodialysis reversal edr represent the most commercially lucrative membrane based technologies panagopoulos et al 2019 although there had been progress in the developments of thermal and membrane based desalination technologies serious challenges are still happening for example thermal based desalination technologies utilize an overwhelming amount of thermal for freshwater production shatat and riffat 2014 for example msf distillation consumes 18 kwh m3 due to the high latent heat of evaporation of water which is near 2500 kj kg shatat and riffat 2014 williams et al 2015 el kadi and janajreh 2017 moreover corrosion is imminent at high operational temperature baig et al 2011 furthermore extremely high operating pressures of membrane based desalination is required to overcome pressure losses across the small and tortoise pores of the membrane while retaining and avoid the fouling of the solutes baker 2012 owing to hydraulic pressure limitations treating highly concentrated brine 70 g l using membrane methods is challenging davenport et al 2018 another inevitable challenge is membrane fouling which is the reason behind increasing membrane maintenance cost and energy demand mandating brine pre treatment and reducing membrane lifetime jiang et al 2017 the environmental impact for rejecting high concentration brine disposal of seawater is another challenge facing this growing desalination industry williams et al 2015 arhin et al 2016 the rejected brine concentration of common technologies is near 70 g l arnal et al 2005 and that can lead to large ecological changes on the long run while its treatment currently approximately consumes one third of the total desalination cost rahman et al 2007 gilron et al 2003 freeze desalination fd technology has the potential to avoid common desalination challenges it separates fresh water and brine by partially freezing the solution during which the new formed ice crystal progressively enlarged and displacing impurities including salts in the remaining brine solution while fresh water is obtained as of ice block badawy 2016 these crystalized ice blocks are separated from the super saline brine then washed before finally melted to provide pure water the freezing process of brine is clearly described in the binary phase diagram as shown in fig 2 in general the saline water located at point a moves down to the freezing point as the solution heat is pumped out of the brine filled container upon reaching to that point freezing starts forming solid ice and another concentrated brine solution as the solution salinity increases according to the phase diagram freezing point of the concentrated solution dips to a lower value and as the cooling source continues to pump out heat the new freezing point is surpassed and freezing progresses it can be seen that the salt always exists in the solution in the form of higher concentrated brine until it reaches to the eutectic point where nacl salt i e hydrohalite nacl 2h2o crystalizes simultaneously with ice compared with thermal and membrane based technologies fd tolerates less corrosion and scaling difficulties as a result pre treatment and maintenance of high tech desalination parts is accomplished with diminished costs desaldata 2019 johnson 1976 fd also has the potential in consuming lower energy driven by the low latent heat of fusion of ice i e 333 kj kg which counts only 17 of the required latent heat of evaporation i e 2500 kj kg el kadi and janajreh 2017 khawaji et al 2008 moreover fd is unrestricted in dealing with highly concentrated brines like those generated by md and td randall and nathoo 2015 in addition heat removal from the concentrated waste seawater can reach to the eutectic point enabling simultaneous ice and solid salts crystallization diallo et al 2015 hasan et al 2017 compared to md almost 2 3 times of salt rejection was achieved with three stages of fd naidu et al 2018 until now fd method has not been applied in commercial scale and studies are limited to laboratories and small pilot plants this is due to the incurred capital cost and complex operation of ice separation and melting processes williams et al 2015 the process of salt rejection during the freeze desalination is still far from being completely understood and when is subjected to the different process parameters one big challenge is salt entrapment between the ice crystals ensuing highly saltwater pocket during the freezing process cole and shapiro 1998 entrapment of heavy saline solution in the ice during crystallization compromises the desired lower salinity attainment of the ice crystal upon melting and results in necessary posttreatment such as ice crushing and recrystallization that rendering higher operating costs wiegandt and von berg 1980 subramani and jacangelo 2015 although studies on freeze crystallization dated back several centuries the understanding of ice crystallization and growth in a slurry mushy ice salt rejection during the process is still chaotic and unsystematic for instance the key parameters affecting the freezing time cooling rate cooling source temperature solution composition and ice quality are not available despite the numerous reports of experimental studies on fd moreover the new developments in saline diffusion in both experimental and numerical studies in the literature needs to be organized for more clear understanding of the fd process hence there is a need for a better cultivation of the reported findings on fd recent developments and inference of guidelines and suggestion for the prospects the current study is aiming at improving the understanding of freeze desalination process from experimental point view and computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling that help in developing accurate predictive and design assisted simulations a brief introduction of the fd process and its common configurations is initially introduced further literature survey of experimental studies involving fd of seawater and wastewater are reported highlighting the influence of process parameters e g freezing temperature salinity water composition on ice production rate and produced ice salinity in addition the development of numerical modelling of freezing desalination such as 1st principal models and high fidelity cfd models are also presented finally the challenges facing freeze desalination for commercialization and recommendations of future prospects are discussed 2 freeze desalination principles and configurations fd is one application of freeze crystallization technology in which a phase change process takes place through the cooling of the saline water until the freezing the liquid water into solid ice then separate and melt it as fresh water generally based on the freezing conditions and process freeze crystallization configuration can be classified into four main categories rahman et al 2006 kucera 2019 lu and xu 2010 rane and padiya 2011 namely 1 direct and 2 indirect which according to the contact between the cooling refrigerant and the solution rahman et al 2006 and 3 eutectic and 4 vacuum freezing that is based on operating conditions in desalination direct fd method operates using a refrigerant that is in intimate contact with the saline solution while in the indirect fd the refrigerant and solution are separated by a thermally conducting solid surface and the heat is transferred from the solution through the conducting surface that is cooled by circulating refrigerant in both direct fd and indirect fd the cooling temperature sets below the freezing point of the solution if the operational cooling temperature of the freezing process is further lowered reaching the eutectic point eutectic freezing ef takes place stepakoff et al 1974 barduhn 1963 pangborn 1963 barduhn and manudhane 1979 in ef the salt crystal and ice form simultaneously and these crystals can be separated by gravity nevertheless vacuum freezing method operates at high vacuum pressure to vaporize a share of the water rapidly that extracts huge amount of heat from the solution refrigeration effect and enabling freezing some remaining portion in the form of fresher ice the water vapor can be also recovered as fresh water dickey 1996 2 1 direct fd liquid refrigerant under pressure is injected into the brine solution leading to expansion and vaporization in the solution at low pressure this will lead to the absorption of a large amount of heat from the solution that enhances the cooling and arriving to its freezing point to form ice crystal schematic illustration of the direct freezing system is shown in fig 3 the advantage of direct fd is that it possesses super high surface area and high heat transfer coefficient because of the direct contact between the brine solution and the refrigerant direct contact fd is considered as the most effective fd mode xie et al 2018 hirakawa and kosugi 1981 in which insoluble refrigerants as butane and freon are evaporated when brought in contact with seawater and thus their latent heat are supplied from the brine and form ice crystals within the key parameter for direct fd is the selection of refrigerants barduhn 1968 recommended that the refrigerant should have a boiling point lower than 4 ⁰c low vapor pressure less than 2 8 atm at room temperature nontoxic immiscible and chemically stable in seawater and should not easily form hydrate during expansion besides these the price of refrigerant should not be high and easily available from commercial suppliers stepakoff and modica 1973 as direct fd has high cooling efficiency the production to the power ratio of this method is also high gibson et al 1974 however the main disadvantage of direct fd method is that refrigerant can be contaminated in the produced ice which makes it unsafe for potable water wang and chung 2012 also the use of an explosive refrigerant such as butane raises a major concern wang and chung 2012 the current research in direct fd is gradually moving towards using waste cold energy released from the regasification of lng xie et al 2018 lin et al 2017 besides the research of hydrate based desalination hydesal using hydrate former to extract fresh water from brine via the formation of hydrate crystal is becoming more popular cai et al 2016 he et al 2018 seo et al 2019 mok et al 2021 lee and park 2021 particularly the lng is demonstrated in cooling the brine and suggested to be used in the hydrate former as well as in generating the needed electricity for desalination lee and park 2021 babu et al 2018 the most pronounced developments in direct fd are summarized in table 1 2 2 indirect fd in the indirect fd fig 4 the saline and refrigerant are not contacted but separated by a solid barrier and the heat of the solution is drawn through this barrier to the refrigerant kalista et al 2018 there are two main classes of indirect fd 1 the suspension freezing process el kadi and janajreh 2017 as depicted in fig 5 and 2 the progressive freezing on cold surface in suspension crystallization the precooling saline solution is pumped through a scraped surface heat exchanger operating at low sub cooling temperature to promote nucleation of small crystals 50 µm then the slurries are pumped back into the main vessel for ice growth and the ice is separated from the slurry through a filter rahman et al 2006 suspension crystallization generally cannot reach freshwater standard 0 1 salinity as the formed ice crystals is small and salt is polluting their surfaces with no uniform freezing direction granted xie et al 2018 in addition the costs and difficulties involved for desalination by suspension to achieve freshwater standards was shown to be much higher than those required for progressive freezing yuan et al 2019 chang et al 2016 this is why current research on fd is focused on progressive freezing ahmad 2012 miyawaki et al 2005 fujioka et al 2013 in which a single ice layer is firstly formed on the cooled surface that successively grow in thickness as remaining brine in intimate contact with the ice for further crystallization the usual methods of freezing on cold surface include vertical progressive method see fig 6 a falling film method see fig 6b or on the rotating drum fig 6c the main advantage of freezing desalination on a cold plate is the higher produced ice quality as the ice is formed layer by layer in one dimensional direction which reduces impurities entrapment in between ice crystals rendering less complicated separation of ice and saline water the current studies in indirect fd are summarized in table 2 2 3 eutectic fd eutectic fd or eutectic freeze crystallization efc produces the fresh water and salt simultaneously by cooling the concentrated brine down to the eutectic freezing point refer to fig 2 the efc process was first proposed by barduhn 1963 and demonstrated by pangborn 1963 in this process as the brine is frozen into ice it commences to float and the remaining brine concentration increases gradually until reaching the eutectic point where the crystallized salts start to precipitate each at their unique eutectic temperature randall et al 2011 thereby the different density values of salts and ice will also facilitate the separation process hasan et al 2017 efd is different from the typical fd as the former requires lower temperature and ice salt separator although eutectic freezing required lower temperature the cost of eutectic fd can be lower due to highly effective separation process dickey 1996 which can be further economically favorable when two stage eutectic fd is involved schroeder 1980 eutectic fd can be one of promising solutions to treat highly concentrated waste brine from the reverse osmosis stepakoff et al 1974 recent development of efd is rather limited in literature in an early study by vaessen et al 2004 an indirect eutectic freezing was utilized on a ternary water solution including kno3 hno3 which are typically associated with sea salts authors have studied the heat transfer phenomenon inside two scraped crystallizers at different coolant flow conditions and scrapers rotational speeds results recommended turbulent flow condition for optimum heat transfer rates in another study by leyland et al 2019 ro brine na2so4 h2o was treated utilizing efc using various heat transfer rates and scraping speeds faster distribution of supersaturation state was achieved at higher rotational speeds and thus more efficient ice scraping process the authors have also highlighted the reduced occurrence of ice scaling issue when treating multi component brines compared to binary brines according to authors this is owed to the increase in the dissolved ionic concentration of aqueous electrolytes hartog et al 2019 used eutectic freezing to treat geothermal waste brine in the netherlands it was found that freezing can significantly reduce the amount of waste stream and produce usable water at significant yields of hydro halite with economic value efc process can be more useful with the rising environmental concerns on the ejected brine earlier lewis et al 2010 have investigated the potential of treating hypersaline wastewater brines using efc process as seen in fig 7 higher recovery rates of fresh water and salt is obtainable when the freezing temperature is approaching the eutectic point nevertheless up to seven washing stages were required to obtain pure ice crystals i e 20 ppm mazli et al 2020 have reported an enhancement approach to the efficiency of efc when compared to progressive freezing and suggested optimal operation parameters for its conditions the results showed an enhanced separation efficiency of efc over progressive however the latter have resulted in a better water recovery of 88 3 versus 66 for eutectic freezing the group of hasan et al 2017a 2017b have performed experimental and numerical investigations on na2so4 salt recovery from wastewater using eutectic fd process the researchers have explored the occurrence of ice scaling phenomenon in the absence of scrapers where it was inversely proportional to the driving force i e temperature gradient it was also found that the use of agitators becomes more crucial at higher driving force in addition the authors have investigated the distribution if ice crystal size at different salt concentrations and freezing temperature operating at eutectic condition larger na2so4 salt crystal sizes with narrow crystal size distribution csd was reported regardless of freezing rate as seen in fig 8 in a similar work by chivavava et al 2014 na2so4 crystal size was directly proportional to the supercooling condition and residence time when freezing in a continuous crystallizer at the eutectic temperature 2 4 vacuum fd vacuum fd contains vacuum freezing system to extract the water vapor from seawater and vapor compression systems to collect the vapor a portion of water evaporates under high vacuumed pressure by pump and the evaporating water removes the latent heat of water to start freezing of the seawater serving as the refrigerant in direct fd kalista et al 2018 the vapor and formed ice are collected to harvest the fresh water the challenges that hinder the application of vacuum fd are the associated high cost of vapor transportation operating at the sub triple point pressure this is due to the absent of reliable water freezing control the large energy consumption in compressing and collecting the water vapor kalista et al 2018 chivavava et al 2014 these unsolved challenges are the main drawback for the development of vacuum freezing on a recent published work cao and wang 2019 wang and cao 2020 have performed simultaneous seawater freezing and vaporization where pure water in form of crystallized ice and water vapor were formed under vacuum and triplet point conditions vacuum freezing was aided with enhanced nucleating agents to achieve zero thermal energy consumption similar investigation was reported back in 1984 by el nashar 1984 in which a solar assisted vacuum evaporative freezing ejector at pressure of 3 mmhg was utilized for seawater desalination summarizing it can be found that the fd is observing renascence and developments with the indirect and direct freezing are receiving much attention the eutectic freezing and vacuum freezing are continue developing at slower rates because of their inherited and unresolved challenges nevertheless vacuum assisted indirect fd was recently promoted as a promising alternative compared to normal operating pressures with high salt rejection hernández yáñez et al 2021 comparing the indirect freezing and direct freezing indirect freezing is more suitable for producing drinking water the numbers of research of indirect freezing desalination make it also possible to discuss and infer the key parameters affecting the process performance and metrics this will be discussed in next section 3 experimental development of freeze desalination as observed in the previous section most experimental efforts of fd for different water compositions have utilized indirect freeze crystallization configuration in general the success and effectiveness of fd process is tied to the operating conditions of the crystallization stage initial concentration refrigerant temperature fluid temperature subcooling degree and solution flow rate as well as the presence of seeding are examples of key operating conditions regardless of the targeted application several experimental parameters have been utilized through literature to evaluate the performance of any freeze crystallization method depending on its operating conditions and solution composition this includes the most common parameters manifested in i effective partition constant k and ii salt removal efficiency r but also others including iii crystal size iv concentration of salt in the produced ice v fresh water yield and vi ice crystal front growth rate amran et al 2016 salt removal efficiency r and effective partition constant k are frequently utilized to evaluate a desalination process r is known as the ratio of the difference between initial salinity and ice salinity to that of the initial salinity and is written in eq 1 as 1 r 1 c i c e c 0 100 where c i c e and c 0 are the ice salinity and initial salinity respectively k is known as the ratio of ice salinity c i c e to remain concentrated solution salinity c l and is written in eq 2 as 2 k c i c e c l many experimental works have been conducted to reduce the effective partition constant and enhance salt removal efficiency in this part experimental works for improving salt removal efficiency including seeking optimal operation parameters multi level successive freezing post treatment of ice and enhancement of the salt diffusion as well as mitigation salt entrapment will be reviewed fujioka et al 2013 experimentally demonstrated ice front control progressive freezing and showed that desalination efficiency can be increased by either lowering the speed of the forming ice front and the initial concentration or by increasing the circumferential velocity of the stirrer these findings are consistent with other literature which show that higher initial salinity in the brine results in a higher salinity in the formed ice htira et al 2018 el kadi and janajreh 2018 and slower cooling rate favors the formation of lower salinity crystalized ice eghtesad et al 2020 htira et al 2018 el kadi and janajreh 2018 on the other hand a substantially low freezing temperature results in increasing the cooling rate and consequently jeopardizing the purity of the produced ice mtombeni et al 2013 this is to indicate that although higher heat pumping results in increasing ice production this may come at the cost of lower ice quality eghtesad et al 2020 moreover the presence of other minerals e g fluoride was found to decrease the overall removal efficiency by 10 25 yang et al 2017 because of the imperfection of salt removal by freezing fresh water cannot be obtained from saline water by single step freezing successive freezing is one option to produce fresh water by multiple steps freezing melting cycles jayakody et al 2020 applied lng as cooling source to freeze melt the nacl solution 15 g l for desalination and after three successive cycles to obtain potable water level 1 g l the authors demonstrated achieving freshwater level by freezing nacl solution 35g l in freeze dryer within five steps badawy 2016 demonstrated freezing melting of seawater 41 g l from red sea in saudi arabia using eight steps and obtain potable water with 0 6 g l salinity however multiple freezing melting cycles increases the complexity and the associated cost of the process thereby increasing the cost of the obtained potable water on the other hand williams et al 2013 have reported an overall salt rejection of 16 4 when four successive freezing stages was performed during ro brine concentration a two stage fd process for seawater was performed utilizing both falling film and block freezing techniques to achieve 98 5 salt removal efficiency zambrano et al 2018 although multi stage freezing has illustrated promising salt rejection and water recovery it was found in a previous study by the authors of this work that higher cost is resulting when compared to conventional thermal based desalination technologies zhang et al 2021 the alternative option to obtain fresh water from freezing is the post treatment of the fresh water post treatment methods are commonly used for increasing the ice quality including washing sweating with gravity induced brine drainage centrifugation soaking and watering etc beier et al 2007 yang et al 2017 sweating was used as a posttreatment method to enhance the final water quality reaching to 0 5 g kg salt concentration as investigated by rich et al 2010 2012 likewise mandri et al 2011 found that sweating can help to drain out the trapped brine pockets nonetheless sweating oversaw losing almost 18 of the crystallized ice weight during suspension fd process as reported by mountadar et al 2019 from seawater desalination experiments washing ice with fresh water has been observed to increase salt removal efficiency by roughly 42 han et al 2017 however washing ice to achieve potable water consumes large amount of fresh water lu et al 2019 have illustrated that if a water recovery ratio of 25 is achieved the amount of salt adhesion at ice surfaces will require heavy washing process making the fd process infeasible in different attempt luo et al 2010 crushed the layered ice to open the trapped saltwater pockets followed by centrifugation to drain out the salt water and improve ice quality similarly yang et al 2018 washed the crushed ice with raw seawater before centrifugation which was proved to further improve the ice quality as an easy and economical posttreatment method in addition keeping the ice pressed for some time can significantly reduce the ice salinity which avoids water usage unlike sweating and washing method erlbeck et al 2018 the posttreatment methods are summarized in table 3 from the above literature it can be noticed that several freezing parameters and ice posttreatment were investigated in attempt to improve the ice quality it was demonstrated that impurity of obtained ice is mainly from the brine adhered to ice crystal surfaces and the brine pockets formed by the trapped brine between ice crystals in the ice blocks chen et al 2020 at higher freezing rate the rejected salt by ice crystal cannot fully diffuse from the ice surface to solution so that part of the salt is trapped between ice crystals on the contrary slow freezing rate allow the displacement and diffusion of the salt away from the ice surface into the lower salinity brine in addition for lower initial salinity brine the entrapment of the salt is less pronounced because of the low initial salinity which results in the better ice quality when compared with the high initial salinity salt diffusion and the formation of salt pockets is the root cause for the ice salinity that has not been well documented only scattered and limited work have been published on the salt diffusion during freezing castillo téllez et al 2020 reported the obtained salinity gradient from collecting and melting the initial brine at 34 5 g l nacl h2o they used different freezing temperatures 8 15 and 30 c and different crystallizer geometries they concluded that higher freezing temperature and longer crystallizer result in better ice quality due to the slow freezing rate that enables the salt ions to move towards the saline solution prior reaching solidification it was also found that the salinity increased dramatically in the last formed ice layers however detailed analysis of the salinity gradient and salt immigration were not provided or discussed in their work in the authors recent directional freezing experimental work zhang and janajreh 2021 the salt gradients of ice from the directional freezing experiments of brine under different freezing temperatures are obtained and it was found that higher freezing temperature lower freezing rate does not always produce lower salinity ice also optimal freezing temperature was found for freezing 35 g l nacl solution is around 15 c to yield the lowest salinity gradient in the first 50 ice compared to 40 25 and 10 c as shown in fig 9 this result may indicate that the salt diffusion during freezing is controlled by multiple factors and the balance of these factors may lead to optimal low salinity in the formed ice chen et al 2020 confirmed that the salt entrapment is the main source of higher salinity in the ice and they reported optimal subcooling temperature for obtaining lowest ice salinity they suggested to improve ice quality by avoiding the agglomeration of ice crystals during freezing however practical method to avoid the mentioned agglomeration was not discussed a big step forward was done by yuan et al 2020 who reported the experimental observation of ice growth and salt entrapment in the freezing experiment of 3 nacl brine solution phase field concentration field and temperature field are coupled in one numerical model in their work to simulate the freezing process in their work they stated that heterogeneous growth of dendrites during the freezing prevent the salt water that present between the dendrites from moving out and lead to the trap of high salt concentration in the melted ice their sensitivity analysis showed that subcooling degree significantly affected the salinity of the bottom formed ice the solid phase ratio as well as the height of the planar crystal this pioneering work however failed to provide recommendation for controlling the formation of salt entrapment leaving it open ended research the ongoing research aim to further improve the ice quality from the root level and this field is attracting more research interests 4 modelling development of freeze desalination despite the valuable experimental improvements done on fd technology challenges associated with understanding the phenomenon of ice growth and salt impurities are still posing a crucial drawback high fidelity cfd modeling has the precedence in providing detailed and accurate knowledge of the ice formation process at any location within the crystallizer modeling ice crystallization for desalination of brine is a multiphysics problem involving conjugated heat and mass transfer in both direct and indirect configurations heat transfers from the brine solution into the refrigerant and thus salt diffusion is promoted by the established temperature gradient heat transfers by two mechanisms i convective heat transfer to the brine solution and ii conductive heat transfer through ice crystal nonetheless indirect freezing involves another conduction mechanism through the cold wall between the brine solution and refrigerant on the other hand direct freezing involves simultaneous evaporation of refrigerant during ice crystallization modeling of such multiphysics system has been facilitated due to the availability of a board range of functional commercial cfd software nonetheless ansys fluent has caught the interest of decent number of researchers over the past decades hasan et al 2017 jayakody et al 2020 el kadi et al 2021 taghizadeh et al 2014 the governing system of equations of a typical indirect fd system of seawater can be expressed as seen in table 4 these are statement of the three conservative laws i e mass momentum energy and their derivatives such as conservation of species state equations and additional functional relationship of phase diagram observation and inference ice crystallization is governed by the solidification melting approach ansys fluent activates an enthalpy porosity technique referred as solidification melting model in which a single domain is considered rather than multiphase flow in this formulation a liquid solid mushy zone is considered in the domain to act as a porous region having a porosity defined as the liquid fraction in the range of 0 and 1 zimmermann et al 2015 the function of liquid fraction can be found from eq 3 in table 4 where t t l i q u i d u s and t s o l i d u s are the local temperature and the temperatures which bounds mushy zone between the liquid and the solid phases the mushy zone exists amongst a higher liquidus temperature t l i q u i d u s and a lower solidus temperature t s o l i d u s for a multicomponent mixture voller and prakash 1987 the two boundary temperature can be calculated by eqs 4 and 5 in these two equations t m e l t is the melting temperature of pure water k 0 is the ratio of solute mass fraction in the solid to that in the liquid at the interface k 0 y s s o l y s l i q and it is proportionally related with the initial salinity m s is the slope of the liquidus line with respect to the local solute mass fraction y s during the solidification process of the brine solution salt redistribution and segregation from solid to liquid phase is described by scheil model which assumes zero salt diffusion in the solidified zone utilizing a nonlinear relationship between the liquid fraction and interface temperature zimmermann et al 2015 therefore the modified continuity equation is shown in eq 6 in table 4 in this equation ρ is density y s l i q is the salt mass fraction in the liquid region v is the liquid velocity d s m l i q is the solute mass diffusion coefficient in the liquid region momentum equation is solved throughout the domain and consequential velocity field is distributed among the phases the basic momentum equation is modified by adding an appropriate sink term to account for pressure drop due to the phase change from water to ice voller and swaminathan 1991 the final momentum equation is shown in eq 7 where p is the static pressure μ is the molecular viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration a m u s h is the mushy zone constant and ε is a very small added number to avoid division by zero energy equation in this model is shown in eq 8 in this equation h is the overall enthalpy k is the thermal conductivity and h s j s is an addition of species transport for solidification melting problems hs is the enthalpy of salt specie and js is the diffusion mass flux of salt several numerical works have investigated the ice growth rate with the controlling conditions temperature profile qin et al 2004 and heat transfer coefficient heat transfer coefficient qin et al 2009 unsteady heat transfer qin et al 2003 and ice growth kinetics for a continuous freezing process chivavava et al 2014 genceli et al 2009 for instant the separation of binary mixture freezing for saltwater desalination using indirect fd was modeled in 2 d cfd by abid and safi 2015 who ignored the effect of ice growth kinetics jayakody et al 2018 have developed 3d cfd model to simulate a single unit of ice formation process in saline solution 1 5 4 5 salinity and validated their findings using experimental results obtained by an instrumented ice maker machine good modeling and experimental agreement were obtained showing a maximum deviation of 0 93 for the temperature change 15 for the ice salinity and 13 1 for brine salinity the volume of ice was always overestimated by the cfd model with error percentage ranging between 3 5 and 18 the modeling reveals that low cooling temperature results in a faster freezing rate and marked lowest average salinity of 0 5 at 245 k freezing temperature and ice thickness of 3 3 mm the second stage freezing of the obtained 0 5 saline was conducted as well and produced a salinity level below the stipulated potable range of 0 1 another 2 d cfd model was developed by the authors el kadi and janajreh 2018 to perform parametric studies of indirect fd in a rectangular tray in that work several parameters studied including the initial brine salinity the freezing source temperature and the initial brine temperature the results revealed that brines having lower salinities tends to produce high quality ice and lower freezing temperature leads to higher freezing rate at the cost of a lower salt removal efficiency see fig 10 moreover decreasing the subcooled temperature from 20⁰c to 0⁰c showed to significantly raising the growth rates but at the expense of reducing the removal efficiency by almost 10 in a more recent study the influence of radial and vertical indirect directional freezing was assessed in terms of effective partition coefficient and removal efficiency for seawater desalination el kadi et al 2021 a 3 d axisymmetric cylindrical crystallizer was modeled using cfd good agreement with experimental data for brine salinity of 1 7 and 3 5 is shown as in fig 11 yet with overestimation of ice salinity particularly at lower crystallinity levels this increase might be associated with low value of salt diffusion coefficient d s m l i q simulation results also showed the removal efficiency of seawater reached 44 06 and 28 3 for radial and bottom vertical freezing respectively in addition a significant increase in the removal efficiency reaching to 55 67 for a single stage freezing can be achieved when stirring is involved as seen in fig 12 the existence of a stirrer eliminates salt accumulation at crystal growth interface by creating a continuous homogenous solution during the diffusion of salts from the crystallized ice toward the concentrated brine the freezing parameters optimization is also conducted by eghtesad et al 2020 in a 2d axisymmetric hollow cylinder they implemented artificial neural network ann and multi objective optimization using genetic algorithm ga for reaching the highest ice mass at the lowest salinity two optimized parameter regions were obtained in this study to obtain the best performance for ice mass and its salinity although the parameters effects on the freezing performance have been widely studied the salt diffusion and entrapment in the crystalized ice has not been understood well recently yuan et al 2020 applied phase field method to simulate the growth of the ice crystal during fd process of binary system of water nacl in that work single nucleus crystallization multi nucleus competition crystallization and the directional competitive crystallization of the binary solutions was simulated based on numerical model coupling phase salinity and temperature fields the morphology of the ice crystal and the salt trapping mechanism inside the formed ice were expanded salt entrapment in the ice results from the heterogenous growth of multi ice dendrites between adjacent dendrites salt accumulated at the solid liquid interface hindering crystallization and brine channels formed followed by the formation of salt cells when the channels were blocked by the join of dendrites the recent and rapid development of molecular dynamics simulations have also contributed to the study of the freezing at a molecular level tsironi et al 2020 investigated the freezing process of nacl h2o solutions utilizing a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and x ray diffraction at different salt water concentrations brine rejection attributed to hexagonal ice ih formation was witnessed and nacl 2h2o hydrates was found coexist with ice ih the observation suggests that the ion inclusions due to the existence of nacl 2h2o hydrates was another source of the salt in the ice except for salt entrapment and salt adhesion on ice surface these molecular dynamics simulations estimated that the lowest salinity can be obtained in ice is 0 5 by mass due to ion inclusions table 5 summarizes the development of modelling for fd 5 current strategies and path forward 5 1 ice quality enhancement 5 1 1 nucleation and supercooling in crystallization freezing process consists of two steps namely nucleation and crystallization nucleation is the critical step which initiates the crystallization of liquid furthermore considering the composition of the liquid nucleation can be either of the two types homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation mellado and augusto 1998 the homogeneous nucleation is mostly favorable in pure systems where random but slight fluctuations of density occurs and accordingly nucleation takes place spontaneous without any preferential sites mellado and augusto 1998 heterogeneous nucleation randomly happens on preferential sites including phase boundaries wall of a container and at impurity particles and is enhanced by seeding the solution with nucleating agent the nucleation process can be explained by free energy theory as shown in the below equation mellado and augusto 1998 as well as in fig 13 kingery et al 1976 9 δ g l s 4 3 π r 3 δ g v 4 π r 2 γ where δ g l s is the net free energy of formation r is the radius of the crystal δ g v is the difference between the solid and aqueous phase free energies and γ is the interfacial tension between the ice and unfrozen phase the first term on the right side of the equation has negative sign and reflects the contribution of volume energy whereas the second term corresponds to the surface energy as the temperature of the solution decrease to below melting point water molecules are forced to be more ordered and form a stable lattice structure tleimat 1980 the free energy of this structure is described by eq 9 and increases with the structure radius firstly to reach the maximum value then decreases with structure radius the cluster radius size at maximum free energy is called critical radius r during nucleation if the structure radius exceeds r the free energy will decrease as the radius increases thus a non re dissolved structure is formed and it is called nuclei or nucleus after that the nuclei will automatically grow to form the crystal mellado and a 1998 this critical radius r is determined by the following equation tleimat 1980 10 r 2 γ t f l f δ t where the interfacial tension γ is estimated value of 22 e r g c m 2 t f is the solution s freezing temperature given in kelvin l f is volumic latent heat of fusion while the δt is the supercooling degree representing the temperature difference between freezing melting point and the actual freezing temperature this equation shows that the critical radius of a crystal varies with subcooling temperature therefore the nucleation is related to the operating conditions such as the cooling source surface temperature and solution freezing melting point in freeze desalination the existence of supercooling before the brine freezing increases the freezing desalination cost because supercooling reduces the crystallization temperature and delays the freezing supercooling occurs mainly when water is pure or lacks enough nucleus koop et al 2000 from the literature supercooling during brine freeze desalination has not been well investigated and the microphysical mechanisms of ice nucleation as well as the subsequent freezing kinetics of brine are still not clear this lack of understanding makes it difficult to control the freezing process in author s work zhang and janajreh 2021 supercooling was reported in the freezing experiment of water and sodium chloride solution 200 ml in glass jar it was found out that brine has much larger supercooling temperature than pure water fig 14 shows evolution of supercooling temperature with time during the freezing process of water droplet at 15 ⁰c chen et al 2020 reported the supercooling of 200 ml sodium chloride solution frozen in autoclave and they claimed that supercooling time of 35 g l solution can be controlled into 60 min when the supercooling degree is larger than 2 4 k these limited works considering comprehensive effects of the container surface bulk liquid volume and impurity are far from enough to understand the supercooling microphysical mechanisms droplet freezing is a promising way to understand the freezing process avoiding the effects of container surface and bulk volume barma et al 2021 tried to freeze partially individual sodium chloride solution droplets suspended in cold immiscible liquids to study the supercooling under different cooling rate droplet size and salt concentration and they developed a model to predict freezing temperature of saline droplets more research in the micro droplets freezing should be conducted to reveal the microphysical understanding of complex and stochastic freezing process as well as the desalination process of brine droplets 5 1 2 multistage freezing multistage separation has always been an efficient approach for large scale applications for fd technology to operate as a standalone a multistage is thereby necessary to achieve potable water standards according to world health organization who drinkable water must achieve a maximum salinity of 500 mg l i e 0 05 wt organization 1963 moreover multistage plants consumes lower energy and operating cost could be 50 70 lower than that of a single stage rahman et al 2007 the concept of multistage freezing for seawater desalination was first patented in 1989 by griffiths 1989 where ice purity reached up to 99 99 after utilizing four series of crystallization stages thereafter very limited work have investigated this approach for freeze desalination eghtesad et al 2020 zambrano et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 badawy 2022 salakhi et al 2022 for instant eghtesad et al 2020 showed that who standards can be achieved after three stages of indirect fd if the negative heat flux is not below 750 w m2 increase of ice production was also noticed in latter stages of the system compared to the first stage owed to the reduced salinity on successive steps another work by badawy 2022 utilizing successive freezing separation melting stages of synthetized seawater samples 4 1 nacl at temperature of 20 c was performed salinity of the produced ice see fig 15 showed an exponential decay with 8 successive freezing melting stage until reaching to a removal efficiency of 98 5 nonetheless a serious mass loss of the initial seawater feed of around 65 was present by the end of the multistage process similar approach was followed by salakhi et al 2022 with three stages of falling film freeze desalination to meet who standards of drinking water nonetheless it has been reported that higher re number of the refrigerant is favorable to water recovery but not to its salinity in a recent work by the authors four stages of freezing with 5 ice recovery at each stage was implemented to achieve potable level zhang et al 2021 from the previous attempts one can note that multistage freezing is very efficient in achieving ultrapure water nonetheless the amount of water recovery requires major attention research towards increasing the amount of ice produced in each stage with conserving the same high quality product is demanding after succeeding these two factors freeze desalination will be a powerful competitive to conventional techniques in desalination industry 5 2 energy reduction strategies thermal energy is dissipated and introduced in several steps during fd as described in fig 16 the process is initiated by sensible cooling of seawater until reaching the freezing point t f at which latent heat of fusion i e 334 kj kg is released from the system and crystallization of ice takes place eventually ice block is produced and sensible cooling is resumed until reaching to the final temperature of ice block t i at this point sensible heat is introduced to the ice block to produce water in its liquidus state t w the associated heat released input rate to the system can be estimated using eqs 11 14 11 q s 1 m c p l t l c p f t f 12 q l m δ h 13 q s 2 m c p f t f c p i t i 14 q s 3 m c p i t i c p w t w the total energy of the system is thereby expressed as 15 q t o t q s 1 q l q s 2 q s 3 where q is the heat rate kj s during sensible cooling s1 s2 and heating s3 processes as well as during latent heat release l m is the mass flow rate at each stage kg s whereas c p and t are the specific heat capacity at the initial seawater feed l freezing point f final ice block state i and melted water w δ h is the latent heat of fusion of seawater kj kg the values of the above parameters are salinity and temperature dependent eventually the electrical energy e consumed by a fd system can be estimated using the following expression 16 c o p q t o t e where cop is the coefficient of performance of refrigeration to obtain the specific energy consumption sec i e kwh m3 one should fractionate over the volume m3 although the fd process consumes less energy than thermal desalination theoretically this target has not been realized in industry yet one of the main challenges is that subcooling environment in the fd by refrigeration cycle consumes high grade energy in the form of electricity yan 2015 or refrigeration cycle with a low performance coefficient in addition the multistage freezing rather than single step freezing also increase the energy consumption and the low scale energy regeneration is painstaking and unprofitable therefore if alternative sources of lower cost energy could be utilized in freezing fd will become more feasible solar cooling technologies ajib and alahmer 2018 waste heat driven thermoacoustic refrigerator gardner and howard 2009 and lng cold energy wang and chung 2012 can be the option of energy for fd and these are detailed further in the next section 5 2 1 solar cooling a rapid research growth is seen in solar thermal cooling technology since the start of this century and is continuing to emerge the worldwide installations of solar cooling increase from 1200 mw in 2014 jakob 2016 to almost 2000 mw in 2018 iea 2019 the mediterranean countries are still the main market where italy arose as the most impressive one in 2018 driven by the high investment subsidies the middle east and australia s solar cooling markets keep growing recently raturi 2019 this rate of growth results from the technological and economic developments of solar cooling industry such as the improvement of solar collectors invention of adsorption chillers and growing market for solar thermal lazzarin and noro 2018 it may be expected that solar cooling system can be used to cool the brine to a temperature below freezing point for fd this low cost renewable energy can be used to replace the current high grade electricity that currently is used in fd pilot plants 5 2 2 waste heat driven thermoacoustic refrigerator tar tar is an emerging type of refrigerator that is capable of generating wide range of cooling capacities from 293 k down to 20 28 k mckelvey et al 1995 radebaugh et al 1990 hu et al 2007 using the thermoacoustic work tar is capable in pumping heat from low temperature region to the atmosphere to cool down the saline tar presents several outstanding advantages as wang et al 2020 i environmentally friendly by using noble gases e g helium nitrogen co2 as their working gases ii flexible driver methods these devices can be powered by electric linear compressors or be integrated to heat driven thermoacoustic heat engines iii high reliability as well as less maintenance as tar usually has no moving parts wang et al 2018 proposed one heat driven travelling wave thermoacoustic refrigerator twtar with three engine and three refrigerator cores in these experiments 4 5 kw cooling power was generated at 283 k xu et al 2020 have established a theoretical analysis of a proposed looped thermoacoustically driven refrigerator using low grade heat and 2 7 kw of cooling power was achieved at 270 k the waste heat from the industry can be reused by thermoacoustic wave refrigerator to provide cryogenic energy for fd in order to reduce the electricity consumption in fd and thereby reduce the desalination cost until now there is few research from literature to study the combination of tar and fd to reduce the fd cost which deserves more attention 5 2 3 lng cold energy and hydesal nowadays lng represents 1 3 of the natural gas trade movement internationally lin et al 2010 at lng terminals lng is re gasified and delivered to consumer terminals in the form of gas miyazaki et al 2000 during the regasification waste cold energy is released to the surrounding such as seawater or air owing to the low temperature of lng 110 k qiang et al 2005 high energy density and considering the fast increasing global lng market lng cryogenic energy is a high quality energy source cold energy from lng regasification has already been applied in some research of seawater desalination cao et al 2015 designed one flake ice maker utilizing lng cold energy and it was found that 2 kg ice was generated with 1 kg lng re gasification chang et al 2016 apply lng cold energy in seawater fd in singapore where huge lng storage market exists to achieve water with 0 3 g l salinity a hybrid desalination process comprising fd and membrane distillation processes by utilizing both waste cold energy lng and waste heat is developed by wang and chung 2012 and the system produced potable water with 71 5 water recovery using of the cold energy of lng provide triple benefits for fd in saving the electricity consumption by electrical refrigeration equipment and reducing the energy and emission of the entire process the combination of lng re gasification and fd should be vigorously developed to accelerate fd commercialization process 5 2 4 ultrasound assisted freeze desalination the application of fd is detriment by the reduced ice production at higher salinity brines meanwhile the utilization of ultrasound waves in controlling the phase transition of supercooled water to ice is proved to enhanced mass transfer between phases inada et al 2001 as discussed in section 5 1 regulating the supercooling degree of brine results in faster freezing and higher desalination efficiency in this regard ultrasonic controlled freezing reported a reduced supercooling degree during the freezing of water droplet gao et al 2019 and supercritical carbon dioxide riera et al 2004 the main idea is that ultrasonic vibration will cause the formation of cavitation within the supercooled fluid which as a result induces ice nucleation the occurrence of cavitation due to a certain ultrasound intensity is directly proportional to the maximum acoustic pressure p a m a x being greater than the critical pressure inada et al 2001 based on the dynamic instability of a single bubble cavitation appears if 17 r g 4 σ l g 3 p a m a x p v p a t m where r g is the gas bubble nucleus radius σ l g is the surface energy at liquid gas interface while p v and p a t m is the vapor and atmospheric pressure respectively nevertheless one should note that ultrasound loading time to be controlled and limited during the freezing process else continuous loading may cause deterring in the freezing performance gao et al 2022 cong et al 2021 have assessed droplet freezing with three different ultrasonic loading routes no ultrasound time controlled ultrasound and continuous ultrasound the frequency of the ultrasound was fixed at 40 000 hz and 1000 w m2 both experimental and modelling results showed that the freezing time is the lowest for the time controlled ultrasound rather than the continuous in the case of continuous loading the ultrasound is maintained even after reaching the critical point which as a result causes heat loss through cavitation instead ultrasound loading is terminated once the critical point is reached i e controlled loading route in a very recent attempt by gao et al 2022 an ultrasound assisted spray suspension freezing followed by centrifugal treatment was utilized to perform seawater desalination at first low frequency high energy lh ultrasound was used to experimentally test the freezing time of a saline droplet it was found that the freezing time has reported a 15 reduction when ultrasound intensity of 1000 w m2 was used furthermore a mathematical model was developed to simulate the suspension of the cooled saline droplets controlled by ultrasound waves with frequency ranging from 20 000 hz to 40 000 hz i e high frequency low energy hl ultrasound it was found that ultrasound can strongly affects the heat and mass transfer during the phase change process this is due to the activated cavitation effect of ultrasound eventually homogenous nucleation of ice crystals occurs the freezing rate was significantly improved at higher ultrasound loading moreover a final salinity of below 0 2 from a single stage freezing was achieved ultrasound assisted fd has a great potential to compete with conventional desalination methods with an energy consumption of 1 7 kwh m3 and water production rate of 1 8 m3 h compared to 0 3 0 4 kwh m3 and 0 97 m3 h for ro 5 7 7 8 kw m3 and 1 04 m3 h for med yet with higher production costs gao et al 2022 still plenty research in utilizing ultrasound in enhancing the fd efficiency are worth discovering 5 3 commercialization strategies fd method has not been applied in commercial desalination plants neither effectively nor sufficiently due to physical process complexity operational constrains condition dependence and the involved separation this all translate to an additional cost and fierce competition with well established and tunable desalination technologies reduction of capital cost comes with technical maturity and thus more research and development in this field is required this comes with time and more funding and sponsor spending including local authorities and world banks and other international organization and agencies that promotes green energy lower emission and sustainability one major leeway of cost reduction is in using hybrid and integrated technology baayyad et al 2015 proposed the hybrid system by combining freezing and membrane distillation processes their feasibility showed that such system can save around 25 of the cost and the produced water quality can be improved by 71 compared with the conventional ro desalination ahmad et al 2018 investigated the potential for using suspension crystallization and ro desalination for the seawater desalination experimentally they achieved 41 water recovery and with salt rejection ratio over 99 makes it comparable to the most desalination technologies apart from improving the ice quality fd can also treat the waste brine from desalination plants due to its insensitivity to highly concentrated brine which is unfavorable for the environment minimal liquid discharge mld 95 water recovery and even zero liquid discharge zld 100 water recovery processes are promising engineering disposal approach for waste brine in which the desalination plants only discharge small to nil amount of liquid into the environment this leads to a significant reduction of waste brine volume furthermore mld zld technique eliminates liquid waste maximizes water usage efficiency and mitigates potential water quality williams et al 2015 proposed a falling film crystallization for the treatment of waste brine from al khadimah ro plant and the results showed that freeze crystallization can help to significantly reduce the annual waste brine rate from ro plant from 191 84 t year to 23 39 t year randall et al 2011 has also conducted a case study on disposing reverse osmosis waste brine using the eutectic fd and they achieved near zero waste at 99 9 overall water recovery in eutectic fd salt crystals can be separated from solution via gravitational settling while ice crystals can be removed via flotation genceli 2008 moreover pure salts can be recovered from the brine because of different eutectic temperatures of the single salts lewis et al 2008 the zld freezing desalination will become more attractive with the tightening environmental regulations and increasing public environmental awareness a third pathway in cost reduction and deployment of fd technology is the reduction energy consumption this can include several aids from renewable energy thermoacoustic lng energy and ultrasound as discussed in the previous section table 6 summarizes the energy consumption of several fd systems evaluated in literature from these results it is obvious that hybridization with conventional desalination technology or utilization of sustainable energy source is crucial for commercialization fig 17 compares those fd hybridized attempts with conventional commercial desalination technologies e g msf ro al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 one can clearly note the great potential of such enhanced fd systems in terms of energy consumption and thus freshwater production cost it is also clear that multistage freezing has a great impact on increasing the energy consumption even when renewable energy is involved it should be also emphasized that further investigation of the mechanism of salt entrapment both numerically and analytically using high fidelity cfd modeling field coupling model and molecular dynamics simulations can help to understand the salt diffusion and ice growing process this can help to control the salinity in the ice to reduce the cost of posttreatment of produced ice in addition better understanding of the freezing process can help to promote the crystallization at low subcooling which will also help to reduce the energy cost 6 conclusions the finding suggests that direct fd and indirect fd have been developed well and become the mainstream of freezing desalination methods vacuum freezing and eutectic freezing develop slowly because they are still facing large obstacles in their application for direct fd gas hydrate combined with lng regasification has been popular topic to reduce their desalination cost simulation development in indirect fd continue to improve the understanding of freezing process and the mechanism of ice growth and salt entrapment these are key problems for indirect fd which can be further investigated both experimentally and numerically the current successful application of lng cold energy in freezing desalination has opened another opportunity to this technology the combination of fd with conventional desalination such as membrane desalination are another promising direction for fd commercialization freezing desalination technologies are attractive to be one alternative commercial desalination to provide enough water for daily life and industrial applications this paper reviews the latest research progress on freezing desalination and finds that direct fd and indirect fd have been developed well and are the mainstream of freezing desalination methods vacuum freezing and eutectic freezing develop slowly because of the challenges in these technologies are still not solved in order to promote the commercial application of freezing desalination the following suggestions are given according to the literature review 1 the understanding of the parameters that affect the performance of freezing has been relatively comprehensive thus the focus of research should be put on the mechanism of ice growth and salt entrapment during freezing by both numerical and experimental study 2 there have been some successful application of lng cold energy in freezing desalination lng cold energy is a very attractive energy source for both direct fd and indirect fd and more research attention should be paid to the application of lng energy to promote the commercialization of fd 3 combining fd with other conventional desalination methods is a promising option for fd commercialization 4 computational fluid dynamics cfd and molecular dynamics models targeting freeze desalination is limited in literature although these tools can be powerful in understanding the crystal growth and salt entrapment and thus brings us one step towards commercialization declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment the funding support received by the khalifa university under award no rc2 2018 009 is highly acknowledged 
15186,among the plethora of chemicals released into the environment much attention is paid to endocrine disrupting compounds edcs natural estrogens such as estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 are excreted by humans as well as animals and can enter the environment as a result of discharging domestic sewage and animal waste these compounds can cause deleterious effects such as feminization infertility and hermaphroditism in organisms that inhabit water bodies this study provides an overview of the level of estrogen exposures in surface waters groundwater and river sediments in european countries the conducted review shows that estrogen concentrations were within the range of 0 1 ng l 10 ng l in the majority of the tested environmental samples however the authors of the study point out that there are still many unexplored areas and a limited amount of data that mainly concerns eastern european countries the study also analysed the factors that influence the increased emissions of estrogens to the environment which may be helpful for identifying particularly polluted areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords estrogens surface water groundwater sediments natural environment europe data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction we are currently observing a growing interest in the state of the environment methods of its protection and the impact of the contaminants present in it on the health of living organisms our knowledge regarding already existing and emerging types of pollutants is constantly expanding but not at a sufficient pace sex hormones are one group of pollutants that have attracted the attention of scientists since nearly two decades the available literature data shows that the hormones belonging to the estrogen group are important in terms of their impact on the environment baulieu and kelly 1990 ghaneian et al 2017 luo et al 2014 tran et al 2018 vymazal et al 2015 wojnarowski et al 2021 due to the serious environmental risk caused by the presence of estrogens commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 established three steroidal estrogens estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol on a watch list of substances for union wide monitoring in the field of water policy pursuant to directive 2008 105 ec of the european parliament and of the council commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 2018 in addition commission implementing decision eu 2022 679 established 17β estradiol on a first watch list of substances and compounds of concern for water intended for human consumption as provided for in directive eu 2020 2184 of the european parliament and of the council commission implementing decision eu 2022 679 2022 although in recent years the issue of estrogens has been addressed in eu legislative documents a critical aspect is still the question of why it takes so long that measures to be taken against the environmental threats posed by estrogenic compounds estrogens are biologically active hormones that are based on cholesterol and released by the adrenal cortex testes ovaries and the placenta of humans and animals estrogenic compounds have also been found in plants adeel et al 2017 steroidal estrogens can be classified as natural or synthetic hormones if they are present in excess in the living body they can act as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs the basis of the chemical structure of estrogens is the cyclopentane phenanthrene ring the extra carbon forms the estran c18 structure natural estrogens include estrone e1 estradiol e2 estriol e3 and estetrol e4 which differ in the amount and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups additionally synthetic ethinylestradiol ee2 can be distinguished ee2 is an estrogen medication which is used widely as contraception and also in various types of hormone therapies basic data regarding the chemical structure of estrogens is presented in fig 1 estrogens stimulate the growth and development of organs associated with the reproductive system responsible for the development of secondary and tertiary female sexual characteristics ceccarelli et al 2022 the process of estrogen biosynthesis is based on the aromatization of androgens by the cyp 19 gene the enzymatic reaction produces estrone or 17β estradiol depending on whether testosterone or androstenedione is subjected to the action of aromatase murray et al 2016 17β estradiol can be reversibly oxidized to estrone using 17β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17β hsd kalemba droźdź and kapiszewska 2011 a diagram of estrogen biosynthesis is shown in fig 2 estrogens can be synthesized in various tissues incl through the graaf coat corpus luteum adrenal cortex peripheral tissues placenta and fat cells murray et al 2016 estrogens undergo hydroxylation in the liver the change of the oh groups into o leads to the conversion of e2 to e1 which transforms into e3 as a result of further changes after esterification glucuronic and sulfate derivatives are formed which are then excreted in urine or bile estrogens excreted with bile are partially reabsorbed in the intestine while the rest are removed from the body along with the feces kozłowska tylingo and namieśnik 2009 together with the feces estrogens enter the natural environment the problem associated with the exposures of estrogens in the natural environment is a global issue fig 3 shows estrogens were detected in the environment worldwide adeel et al 2017 however it should be noted that fig 3 does not reflect the exact real environmental situation currently there is still a lack of scientific data for many areas in the world including african and south american countries in addition the data used in the compilation perhaps only focused on one compound or analytical methods were not sufficient to detect other estrogens however it shows the next scientific gap such as a need for analytical methods for the detection of low levels of estrogens in environment the subject of the work is the analysis of sources and heights of concentrations of e1 e2 and e3 in the aquatic environment of europe the following article focuses on natural estrogens because they are excreted by both humans and animals 2 estrogens in the natural environment 2 1 sources of estrogens in the natural environment estrogens can be released into the environment via various routes animal feces are a natural source of estrogen however the highest load of pollutants with hormonal compounds ends up in the environment as a result of human activity along with sanitary and agricultural sewage huang et al 2019 johnson et al 2013 liu et al 2012 in 2015 the amount of steroid hormones excreted by humans and livestock was equal to 20 440 tons worldwide with livestock responsible for 74 4 of the emissions zhang et al 2021 if only estrogens were taken into account their amount in 2015 was nearly 14 240 tons of which approx 98 was in animal feces an important reason for this difference is that human waste more commonly undergoes some sort of treatment before being released into the environment compared to livestock waste which often only undergoes storage before such environmental release another reason are the differences in the size of human and animal populations the amount of feces excreted for example one hog generates the equivalent amount of waste of 4 humans and also the size of estrogen concentrations in their feces that is why a woman of childbearing age excretes approx 4 38 mg of estrogen per year in case of a sow the value is increased to approx 43 mg and for a cow the estrogen annual excretion is at 110 mg schoenborn et al 2015 thus in united states us rural states such as iowa where human populations are relatively small compared to other states the intense swine production iowa is the number one swine producer in the us effectively means that the untreated swine manure being applied to farmland is equivalent to huge human populations such like bangkok london and new york city eller 2019 of course the content of estrogen in the feces should not be viewed as the amount that is emitted directly into the environment in european countries there is an obligation to treat municipal and industrial wastewater over the past twenty years there has been a significant increase in the discharge of household wastewater into wastewater treatment plants via sewage networks oecd 2022 the lowest level of wastewater treatment is in italy 62 5 in 2015 ireland 62 5 in 2017 slovenia 62 7 in 2019 and slovakia 68 7 in 2019 oecd 2022 the countries with a high level of wastewater treatment include austria 95 95 in 2019 germany 97 13 in 2015 luxembourg 99 3 in 2019 the netherlands 99 5 in 2019 and england 100 in 2014 oecd 2022 typical wastewater treatment can involve in primary secondary and tertiary treatment studies showed that both sorption and biodegradation are the main treatment mechanism for steroid estrogens in wwtps mohagheghian et al 2014 pessoa et al 2014 silva et al 2012 primary treatment involves the sorption of steroid estrogens onto primary sludge whereas secondary treatment comprises sorption of steroid estrogens onto micro flocs and subsequent biodegradation by microbes ting and praveena 2017 the efficiency of these processes depends to a large extent on such parameters as hrt sediment age organic charge and redox potential grdulska and kowalik 2020 the pathways of estrogens degradation have not been fully studied pratush et al 2020 the biological methods of wastewater treatment effectively dealing with estrogen the activated sludge technology as well as bnr reactors have given very good results grdulska and kowalik 2020 suspended growth activated sludge treatment systems have a better removal efficiency of up to 100 compared to attached growth trickling filter treatment systems up to 75 ting and praveena 2017 the tertiary treatment further improves the secondary effluent quality by involving nitrification chlorination or uv disinfection the removal efficiency of advance treatment systems could exceed 90 ting and praveena 2017 despite this fact many wastewater treatment plants are characterized by low efficiency of removing these pollutants nazari and suja 2016 table 1 summarizes the data regarding estrogen removal in exemplary wastewater treatment plants in european countries it should be emphasized that the data on the efficiency of estrogen removal in european wastewater treatment plants is relatively scarce often limited to one or two hormonal compounds in order to determine the actual contribution of wastewater treatment plants to the emission of estrogens to the environment it is necessary to monitor the concentrations of these compounds on the outflows from wastewater treatment plants as can be seen in table 1 the removal rate of individual compounds can range from as little as 20 to even close to 100 these data show that many european treatment plants the older in particular may need to be upgraded in the usa it has been shown that the modernization of the municipal wastewater treatment plants which resulted in e g a reduced amount of estrogen released to the environment led to a sharp decrease in the number of intersex cases of male rainbow darter from 70 to 100 before modernization to less than 10 in the years after the modernization hicks et al 2017 this example shows that such initiatives have a real impact on the amount of estrogen released to the natural environment agricultural wastewater is also a source of hormones in the environment alvarez et al 2013 in european countries slurry is commonly used as a natural fertilizer the application of slurry may result in the release of estrogens into the drainage waters gall et al 2015 kjær et al 2007 agriculture has also been shown to contribute to the distribution of estrogen to surface waters dutta et al 2010 gall et al 2015 rechsteiner et al 2020 estrone is the most common livestock derived estrogen contaminant in the environment but the potential impact of e1 as an environmental estrogen is underestimated ankley et al 2017 the rate of estrogen leakage to groundwater and surface waters is influenced by many factors including agricultural practices soil type livestock type catchment characteristics rainfall intensity and the distance between fields and surface waters rechsteiner et al 2020 conducted a typically agricultural field study in the catchment area of lake baldegg switzerland the measured concentrations of e1 e2 and e3 in river ron the main tributary to lake baldegg fluctuated at the level of 0 02 0 15 ng l the study showed that the use of the so called good agricultural practices such as limiting slurry application during medium to heavy rainfall restricting direct livestock access to surface waters and applying slurry at least 3 m from surface waters are important measures to prevent natural estrogen emissions to surface waters rechsteiner et al 2020 2 2 the influence of estrogens on the natural environment as was described in the introduction section estrogens play a key role in the proper development and functioning of organisms therefore their deficiency or overproduction pose a serious threat to health and can cause many disorders and diseases in studies carried out by jørgensen et al it was found that there was also a noticeable decline in human fertility compared to historical data from the 1940s out of 4867 men surveyed only one in four had optimal sperm quality jørgensen et al 2012 the reason for the decline in male fertility may be their exposure to various types of endocrine disrupting compounds including estrogens another effect on humans from such environmental estrogen exposures is a decreasing age at which girls reach puberty increased estrogen levels in humans also increase the risk of developing prostate lung endometrial and breast cancer henderson and feigelson 2000 currently more and more people struggle with the problem of obesity and overweight estrogens play a major role in modulating the human energy balance studies have shown that disturbing estrogen levels may directly contribute to overweight or obesity martínez de morentin et al 2014 saito et al 2015 natural steroid hormones including estrogens are the strongest group of endocrine disrupting compounds huang et al 2019 jobling et al 2006 total estrogenicity in the river of 10 ng l e2 equivalents can be associated with high intersex incidence and severity whereas concentrations 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents were associated with minimal intersex expression arlos et al 2018 in the european union the environmental quality standards are 0 4 ng l for e2β and 3 6 ng l for e1 commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 2018 the life of many aquatic and terrestrial animal species is closely associated with the aquatic environment fish are the group of animals clearly linked to the aquatic environment and at the same time the have the most research that has been conducted in terms of the effects of estrogens the level of vitellogenin vtg in the blood is a commonly used biomarker in vertebrates exposed to estrogen increased concentrations of vtg in fish tissues and serum and disturbances in vtg synthesis have been found in many studies which indicates the high sensitivity of fish to the presence of estrogens in the environment filby et al 2010 hill and janz 2003 jobling et al 2003 jones et al 2000 schäfers et al 2007 song et al 2020 vajda et al 2008 one of the commonly reported negative effects of estrogens on fish is the feminization of many male species which may lead to changes in primary and secondary sexual characteristics and thus a reduction in the number of sperm cells produced or morphological changes dang and kienzler 2019 filby et al 2010 jackson and klerks 2020 karki et al 2021 martinez bengochea et al 2020 sumpter 1995 there have also been many cases where the presence of estrogens in the environment caused the dominance of female individuals hill and janz 2003 jackson and klerks 2020 karki et al 2021 teta et al 2018 vajda et al 2008 or the intensification of intersex hicks et al 2017 jobling et al 2006 among many fish populations estrogens disrupt the production and egg quality of female freshwater and marine fish brian et al 2007 gutjahr gobell et al 2006 hill and janz 2003 schäfers et al 2007 thorpe et al 2009 long term exposure to estrone may also result in a higher percentage of skeletal abnormalities wu et al 2021 there are also studies indicating the occurrence of disturbances in the periodic migration of pacific salmon due to the presence of estrogens in the water bangsgaard et al 2006 madsen et al 2004 munakata 2012a munakata et al 2012b amphibians are another group of animals the life and reproduction of which are closely related to the aquatic environment therefore the potential exposure to estrogen contamination may be very dangerous for them and in particular it may disrupt the process of sex differentiation wojnarowski et al 2021 in recent years it can be observed that frog populations are increasingly dominated by female individuals which may be due to the presence of estrogens in their habitats lambert et al 2015 it is also worth noting that in the european union there is an obligation to fertilize fields in the period march october this creates a risk that most of the estrogens will enter the habitats of frogs during the breeding season the observed effects of estrogens on amphibians may concern behavioural sensory and physiological changes ghali et al 2016 the aquatic environment is integral also to many bird species elevated estrogen levels cause various types of endocrine neuroendocrine and behavioural changes in birds ottinger et al 2008 2005 it was found that estradiol weakens the immune system of birds ottinger et al 2008 increases the risk of aggressive behavior and influences important social behavior of birds heimovics et al 2015 scientists highlight the fact that estrogens have the ability to accumulate not only in the tissues of an adult but also in eggs which can negatively affect the development of embryos adkins regan et al 1995 increased level of estrogens in the embryo may cause e g a permanent morphological change reduced fertility of female offspring adkins regan et al 1995 ottinger et al 2005 and impairment of male sexual behavior ottinger et al 2005 many representatives of invertebrates also live in water but there are conflicting opinions of scientists regarding the effect of estrogens on the functioning of this group of animals the negative effect of estrogens on invertebrates was demonstrated by marciala et al 2003 who found that estradiol significantly slows down the development of juvenile copepods marcial et al 2003 ciocan et al 2010 showed that estradiol concentrations in the range of 3 5 130 ng l affect the expression level of vitellogenin mrna vtg and estrogen receptor 2 er2 at various stages of the reproductive cycle of mussels especially in the early phase of gametogenesis ciocan et al 2010 the above mentioned studies suggest that it is likely that estrogens present in the environment may adversely affect the reproductive physiology of molluscs fodor et al 2020 noted however that the physiology and biochemistry of molluscs are different from that of humans and therefore research that relied on hormones and proteins associated with the production and signaling of these hormones may be erroneous as they are based on the incorrect assumption that estrogens have the same function in humans and invertebrates fodor et al 2020 3 exposures of estrogens in the aquatic environment in europe zhang et al 2021 conducted an analysis which shows that in 2015 europe was responsible for 8 21 of the world s steroid hormone emissions to the environment emissions of steroids were highest in areas with high human and animal densities the highest emissions occurred in central europe from great britain to poland and the dominant countries were great britain 131 8 tons in 2015 germany 180 5 tons in 2015 as well as italy 100 6 tons in 2015 year zhang et al 2021 in 2019 the livestock population in europe was 143 million pigs 77 million cattle 62 million sheep and 12 million goats eurostat 2019a the size of the livestock population in individual european countries is shown in fig 4 eurostat 2019a the countries with the highest number of livestock were spain france germany great britain and italy in terms of population density the highest population densities were found in germany great britain the netherlands and belgium eurostat 2019b in the case of estrogen emissions attention should primarily be paid to local indicators of population density and livestock the livestock density by nuts 2 regions in 2016 is shown in fig 5 eurostat 2016 total livestock density livestock units

and livestock densities above 1 5 lsu ha detailed information are summarized in table si1 over the past 20 years a number of studies have been carried out to check the actual concentrations of estrogens in the aquatic environment in europe most studies were carried out in the countries of western europe incl great britain germany portugal spain or france much less data can be found regarding the countries of eastern europe exemplary data regarding the concentrations of natural estrogens in surface waters groundwater and sediments in the countries of eastern and western europe

15186,among the plethora of chemicals released into the environment much attention is paid to endocrine disrupting compounds edcs natural estrogens such as estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 are excreted by humans as well as animals and can enter the environment as a result of discharging domestic sewage and animal waste these compounds can cause deleterious effects such as feminization infertility and hermaphroditism in organisms that inhabit water bodies this study provides an overview of the level of estrogen exposures in surface waters groundwater and river sediments in european countries the conducted review shows that estrogen concentrations were within the range of 0 1 ng l 10 ng l in the majority of the tested environmental samples however the authors of the study point out that there are still many unexplored areas and a limited amount of data that mainly concerns eastern european countries the study also analysed the factors that influence the increased emissions of estrogens to the environment which may be helpful for identifying particularly polluted areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords estrogens surface water groundwater sediments natural environment europe data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction we are currently observing a growing interest in the state of the environment methods of its protection and the impact of the contaminants present in it on the health of living organisms our knowledge regarding already existing and emerging types of pollutants is constantly expanding but not at a sufficient pace sex hormones are one group of pollutants that have attracted the attention of scientists since nearly two decades the available literature data shows that the hormones belonging to the estrogen group are important in terms of their impact on the environment baulieu and kelly 1990 ghaneian et al 2017 luo et al 2014 tran et al 2018 vymazal et al 2015 wojnarowski et al 2021 due to the serious environmental risk caused by the presence of estrogens commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 established three steroidal estrogens estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol on a watch list of substances for union wide monitoring in the field of water policy pursuant to directive 2008 105 ec of the european parliament and of the council commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 2018 in addition commission implementing decision eu 2022 679 established 17β estradiol on a first watch list of substances and compounds of concern for water intended for human consumption as provided for in directive eu 2020 2184 of the european parliament and of the council commission implementing decision eu 2022 679 2022 although in recent years the issue of estrogens has been addressed in eu legislative documents a critical aspect is still the question of why it takes so long that measures to be taken against the environmental threats posed by estrogenic compounds estrogens are biologically active hormones that are based on cholesterol and released by the adrenal cortex testes ovaries and the placenta of humans and animals estrogenic compounds have also been found in plants adeel et al 2017 steroidal estrogens can be classified as natural or synthetic hormones if they are present in excess in the living body they can act as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs the basis of the chemical structure of estrogens is the cyclopentane phenanthrene ring the extra carbon forms the estran c18 structure natural estrogens include estrone e1 estradiol e2 estriol e3 and estetrol e4 which differ in the amount and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups additionally synthetic ethinylestradiol ee2 can be distinguished ee2 is an estrogen medication which is used widely as contraception and also in various types of hormone therapies basic data regarding the chemical structure of estrogens is presented in fig 1 estrogens stimulate the growth and development of organs associated with the reproductive system responsible for the development of secondary and tertiary female sexual characteristics ceccarelli et al 2022 the process of estrogen biosynthesis is based on the aromatization of androgens by the cyp 19 gene the enzymatic reaction produces estrone or 17β estradiol depending on whether testosterone or androstenedione is subjected to the action of aromatase murray et al 2016 17β estradiol can be reversibly oxidized to estrone using 17β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17β hsd kalemba droźdź and kapiszewska 2011 a diagram of estrogen biosynthesis is shown in fig 2 estrogens can be synthesized in various tissues incl through the graaf coat corpus luteum adrenal cortex peripheral tissues placenta and fat cells murray et al 2016 estrogens undergo hydroxylation in the liver the change of the oh groups into o leads to the conversion of e2 to e1 which transforms into e3 as a result of further changes after esterification glucuronic and sulfate derivatives are formed which are then excreted in urine or bile estrogens excreted with bile are partially reabsorbed in the intestine while the rest are removed from the body along with the feces kozłowska tylingo and namieśnik 2009 together with the feces estrogens enter the natural environment the problem associated with the exposures of estrogens in the natural environment is a global issue fig 3 shows estrogens were detected in the environment worldwide adeel et al 2017 however it should be noted that fig 3 does not reflect the exact real environmental situation currently there is still a lack of scientific data for many areas in the world including african and south american countries in addition the data used in the compilation perhaps only focused on one compound or analytical methods were not sufficient to detect other estrogens however it shows the next scientific gap such as a need for analytical methods for the detection of low levels of estrogens in environment the subject of the work is the analysis of sources and heights of concentrations of e1 e2 and e3 in the aquatic environment of europe the following article focuses on natural estrogens because they are excreted by both humans and animals 2 estrogens in the natural environment 2 1 sources of estrogens in the natural environment estrogens can be released into the environment via various routes animal feces are a natural source of estrogen however the highest load of pollutants with hormonal compounds ends up in the environment as a result of human activity along with sanitary and agricultural sewage huang et al 2019 johnson et al 2013 liu et al 2012 in 2015 the amount of steroid hormones excreted by humans and livestock was equal to 20 440 tons worldwide with livestock responsible for 74 4 of the emissions zhang et al 2021 if only estrogens were taken into account their amount in 2015 was nearly 14 240 tons of which approx 98 was in animal feces an important reason for this difference is that human waste more commonly undergoes some sort of treatment before being released into the environment compared to livestock waste which often only undergoes storage before such environmental release another reason are the differences in the size of human and animal populations the amount of feces excreted for example one hog generates the equivalent amount of waste of 4 humans and also the size of estrogen concentrations in their feces that is why a woman of childbearing age excretes approx 4 38 mg of estrogen per year in case of a sow the value is increased to approx 43 mg and for a cow the estrogen annual excretion is at 110 mg schoenborn et al 2015 thus in united states us rural states such as iowa where human populations are relatively small compared to other states the intense swine production iowa is the number one swine producer in the us effectively means that the untreated swine manure being applied to farmland is equivalent to huge human populations such like bangkok london and new york city eller 2019 of course the content of estrogen in the feces should not be viewed as the amount that is emitted directly into the environment in european countries there is an obligation to treat municipal and industrial wastewater over the past twenty years there has been a significant increase in the discharge of household wastewater into wastewater treatment plants via sewage networks oecd 2022 the lowest level of wastewater treatment is in italy 62 5 in 2015 ireland 62 5 in 2017 slovenia 62 7 in 2019 and slovakia 68 7 in 2019 oecd 2022 the countries with a high level of wastewater treatment include austria 95 95 in 2019 germany 97 13 in 2015 luxembourg 99 3 in 2019 the netherlands 99 5 in 2019 and england 100 in 2014 oecd 2022 typical wastewater treatment can involve in primary secondary and tertiary treatment studies showed that both sorption and biodegradation are the main treatment mechanism for steroid estrogens in wwtps mohagheghian et al 2014 pessoa et al 2014 silva et al 2012 primary treatment involves the sorption of steroid estrogens onto primary sludge whereas secondary treatment comprises sorption of steroid estrogens onto micro flocs and subsequent biodegradation by microbes ting and praveena 2017 the efficiency of these processes depends to a large extent on such parameters as hrt sediment age organic charge and redox potential grdulska and kowalik 2020 the pathways of estrogens degradation have not been fully studied pratush et al 2020 the biological methods of wastewater treatment effectively dealing with estrogen the activated sludge technology as well as bnr reactors have given very good results grdulska and kowalik 2020 suspended growth activated sludge treatment systems have a better removal efficiency of up to 100 compared to attached growth trickling filter treatment systems up to 75 ting and praveena 2017 the tertiary treatment further improves the secondary effluent quality by involving nitrification chlorination or uv disinfection the removal efficiency of advance treatment systems could exceed 90 ting and praveena 2017 despite this fact many wastewater treatment plants are characterized by low efficiency of removing these pollutants nazari and suja 2016 table 1 summarizes the data regarding estrogen removal in exemplary wastewater treatment plants in european countries it should be emphasized that the data on the efficiency of estrogen removal in european wastewater treatment plants is relatively scarce often limited to one or two hormonal compounds in order to determine the actual contribution of wastewater treatment plants to the emission of estrogens to the environment it is necessary to monitor the concentrations of these compounds on the outflows from wastewater treatment plants as can be seen in table 1 the removal rate of individual compounds can range from as little as 20 to even close to 100 these data show that many european treatment plants the older in particular may need to be upgraded in the usa it has been shown that the modernization of the municipal wastewater treatment plants which resulted in e g a reduced amount of estrogen released to the environment led to a sharp decrease in the number of intersex cases of male rainbow darter from 70 to 100 before modernization to less than 10 in the years after the modernization hicks et al 2017 this example shows that such initiatives have a real impact on the amount of estrogen released to the natural environment agricultural wastewater is also a source of hormones in the environment alvarez et al 2013 in european countries slurry is commonly used as a natural fertilizer the application of slurry may result in the release of estrogens into the drainage waters gall et al 2015 kjær et al 2007 agriculture has also been shown to contribute to the distribution of estrogen to surface waters dutta et al 2010 gall et al 2015 rechsteiner et al 2020 estrone is the most common livestock derived estrogen contaminant in the environment but the potential impact of e1 as an environmental estrogen is underestimated ankley et al 2017 the rate of estrogen leakage to groundwater and surface waters is influenced by many factors including agricultural practices soil type livestock type catchment characteristics rainfall intensity and the distance between fields and surface waters rechsteiner et al 2020 conducted a typically agricultural field study in the catchment area of lake baldegg switzerland the measured concentrations of e1 e2 and e3 in river ron the main tributary to lake baldegg fluctuated at the level of 0 02 0 15 ng l the study showed that the use of the so called good agricultural practices such as limiting slurry application during medium to heavy rainfall restricting direct livestock access to surface waters and applying slurry at least 3 m from surface waters are important measures to prevent natural estrogen emissions to surface waters rechsteiner et al 2020 2 2 the influence of estrogens on the natural environment as was described in the introduction section estrogens play a key role in the proper development and functioning of organisms therefore their deficiency or overproduction pose a serious threat to health and can cause many disorders and diseases in studies carried out by jørgensen et al it was found that there was also a noticeable decline in human fertility compared to historical data from the 1940s out of 4867 men surveyed only one in four had optimal sperm quality jørgensen et al 2012 the reason for the decline in male fertility may be their exposure to various types of endocrine disrupting compounds including estrogens another effect on humans from such environmental estrogen exposures is a decreasing age at which girls reach puberty increased estrogen levels in humans also increase the risk of developing prostate lung endometrial and breast cancer henderson and feigelson 2000 currently more and more people struggle with the problem of obesity and overweight estrogens play a major role in modulating the human energy balance studies have shown that disturbing estrogen levels may directly contribute to overweight or obesity martínez de morentin et al 2014 saito et al 2015 natural steroid hormones including estrogens are the strongest group of endocrine disrupting compounds huang et al 2019 jobling et al 2006 total estrogenicity in the river of 10 ng l e2 equivalents can be associated with high intersex incidence and severity whereas concentrations 0 1 ng l e2 equivalents were associated with minimal intersex expression arlos et al 2018 in the european union the environmental quality standards are 0 4 ng l for e2β and 3 6 ng l for e1 commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 2018 the life of many aquatic and terrestrial animal species is closely associated with the aquatic environment fish are the group of animals clearly linked to the aquatic environment and at the same time the have the most research that has been conducted in terms of the effects of estrogens the level of vitellogenin vtg in the blood is a commonly used biomarker in vertebrates exposed to estrogen increased concentrations of vtg in fish tissues and serum and disturbances in vtg synthesis have been found in many studies which indicates the high sensitivity of fish to the presence of estrogens in the environment filby et al 2010 hill and janz 2003 jobling et al 2003 jones et al 2000 schäfers et al 2007 song et al 2020 vajda et al 2008 one of the commonly reported negative effects of estrogens on fish is the feminization of many male species which may lead to changes in primary and secondary sexual characteristics and thus a reduction in the number of sperm cells produced or morphological changes dang and kienzler 2019 filby et al 2010 jackson and klerks 2020 karki et al 2021 martinez bengochea et al 2020 sumpter 1995 there have also been many cases where the presence of estrogens in the environment caused the dominance of female individuals hill and janz 2003 jackson and klerks 2020 karki et al 2021 teta et al 2018 vajda et al 2008 or the intensification of intersex hicks et al 2017 jobling et al 2006 among many fish populations estrogens disrupt the production and egg quality of female freshwater and marine fish brian et al 2007 gutjahr gobell et al 2006 hill and janz 2003 schäfers et al 2007 thorpe et al 2009 long term exposure to estrone may also result in a higher percentage of skeletal abnormalities wu et al 2021 there are also studies indicating the occurrence of disturbances in the periodic migration of pacific salmon due to the presence of estrogens in the water bangsgaard et al 2006 madsen et al 2004 munakata 2012a munakata et al 2012b amphibians are another group of animals the life and reproduction of which are closely related to the aquatic environment therefore the potential exposure to estrogen contamination may be very dangerous for them and in particular it may disrupt the process of sex differentiation wojnarowski et al 2021 in recent years it can be observed that frog populations are increasingly dominated by female individuals which may be due to the presence of estrogens in their habitats lambert et al 2015 it is also worth noting that in the european union there is an obligation to fertilize fields in the period march october this creates a risk that most of the estrogens will enter the habitats of frogs during the breeding season the observed effects of estrogens on amphibians may concern behavioural sensory and physiological changes ghali et al 2016 the aquatic environment is integral also to many bird species elevated estrogen levels cause various types of endocrine neuroendocrine and behavioural changes in birds ottinger et al 2008 2005 it was found that estradiol weakens the immune system of birds ottinger et al 2008 increases the risk of aggressive behavior and influences important social behavior of birds heimovics et al 2015 scientists highlight the fact that estrogens have the ability to accumulate not only in the tissues of an adult but also in eggs which can negatively affect the development of embryos adkins regan et al 1995 increased level of estrogens in the embryo may cause e g a permanent morphological change reduced fertility of female offspring adkins regan et al 1995 ottinger et al 2005 and impairment of male sexual behavior ottinger et al 2005 many representatives of invertebrates also live in water but there are conflicting opinions of scientists regarding the effect of estrogens on the functioning of this group of animals the negative effect of estrogens on invertebrates was demonstrated by marciala et al 2003 who found that estradiol significantly slows down the development of juvenile copepods marcial et al 2003 ciocan et al 2010 showed that estradiol concentrations in the range of 3 5 130 ng l affect the expression level of vitellogenin mrna vtg and estrogen receptor 2 er2 at various stages of the reproductive cycle of mussels especially in the early phase of gametogenesis ciocan et al 2010 the above mentioned studies suggest that it is likely that estrogens present in the environment may adversely affect the reproductive physiology of molluscs fodor et al 2020 noted however that the physiology and biochemistry of molluscs are different from that of humans and therefore research that relied on hormones and proteins associated with the production and signaling of these hormones may be erroneous as they are based on the incorrect assumption that estrogens have the same function in humans and invertebrates fodor et al 2020 3 exposures of estrogens in the aquatic environment in europe zhang et al 2021 conducted an analysis which shows that in 2015 europe was responsible for 8 21 of the world s steroid hormone emissions to the environment emissions of steroids were highest in areas with high human and animal densities the highest emissions occurred in central europe from great britain to poland and the dominant countries were great britain 131 8 tons in 2015 germany 180 5 tons in 2015 as well as italy 100 6 tons in 2015 year zhang et al 2021 in 2019 the livestock population in europe was 143 million pigs 77 million cattle 62 million sheep and 12 million goats eurostat 2019a the size of the livestock population in individual european countries is shown in fig 4 eurostat 2019a the countries with the highest number of livestock were spain france germany great britain and italy in terms of population density the highest population densities were found in germany great britain the netherlands and belgium eurostat 2019b in the case of estrogen emissions attention should primarily be paid to local indicators of population density and livestock the livestock density by nuts 2 regions in 2016 is shown in fig 5 eurostat 2016 total livestock density livestock units

15187,fenton process has become a research hotspot due to the nonselective and efficient degradation of dissolved organic matter dom by oh however there are still many challenges and bottlenecks for conventional fenton cf this study provides the first comprehensive insight into the mechanisms of dom degradation by the fenton process including the various subcategories of humic substances emerging trace contaminants including persistent organic pollutants endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products and the interference of humus and low molecular weight organic acids on the removal of trace contaminants in addition a statistical comparison of the economics of cf and three types of fenton like technologies photo fenton electro fenton and ultrasonic fenton is conducted based on existing studies which can be used as a reference for engineering applications moreover a brief overview of the categories and characteristics of heterogeneous fenton which have been extensively studied in recent years and a comparison of their catalysts are presented in the end the paper advances a possible future research direction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter fenton oh humic substances trace contaminants fenton like technology data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water pollution is one of the leading environmental pollution issues worldwide wastewater is abundant in refractory organic matter such as landfill leachate livestock wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater and has been recognized as an environmental problem due to its high organic content various emerging trace organic contaminants and secondary derived contaminants hao et al 2021 mao et al 2022 in the context of global energy saving and low carbon sustainable development handling it efficiently and with low energy chemical consumption has become a key part of achieving the carbon neutrality goal of the entire wastewater treatment field wang et al 2016 at present fenton is a more effective process for degrading refractory organic matter in wastewater he et al 2021 however conventional fenton cf still presents many challenges such as high chemical consumption and high amount of iron sludge production wu et al 2021 accordingly fenton like technology and heterogeneous fenton have emerged recently jain et al 2018 however previous reviews of fenton technologies have infrequently and rarely analyzed the mechanism of oh attack on dissolved organic matter dom thus only by clarifying the above mechanisms we can determine whether the fenton reaction works on the degradation of the targeted dom and understand the specific mechanism behind the long established theory of nonselective degradation of most organics instead of just stopping at dom bulky indicators e g chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc furthermore in terms of engineering applications nonselective technologies for removing contaminants can be substituted with selective technologies that involve accurate chemical dosing and minimal creation of derived contaminants thus enhancing cost effectiveness and optimizing carbon reduction in addition previous reviews rarely conducted comparative economic analyses that could be used as a reference for engineering applications between fenton processes meanwhile new innovative fenton technologies are less thoroughly explained hence the overall logic of the review is developed first the degradation mechanism of dom by fenton is elucidated to explore the degradation potential of fenton from a mechanism perspective second a comparative analysis of the contaminant removal efficiency and economics of cf and three fenton like technologies the most widely studied fenton technologies is undertaken to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different fenton technologies from an engineering perspective finally the characteristics and potential research directions of modified cf are reviewed from the perspective of future development 2 materials and methods a scoping review of the literature on fenton degradation of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater from january 2000 to october 2022 excluding references to classical theoretical perspectives was conducted the literature search for peer reviewed scientific publications was conducted using authoritative academic search engines and databases such as google scholar web of science sciencedirect and acs

dom of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater consists of humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa in addition to emerging trace contaminants such as pops edcs and ppcps in humus dominated organic wastewater such as leachate the primary objective is to remove hs to meet cod or toc standard criteria of the effluent whereas the primary objective in many industrial and pharmaceutical organic wastewater is to remove toxicity from specific trace contaminants as oh is the most important oxidizing agent in the fenton reaction the mechanism of dom degradation by oh in the fenton reaction must be clarified this study investigates the degradation mechanism for both hs and trace contaminants as well as the effect of humus and low molecular weight organic acids on the removal of trace contaminants 3 1 removal mechanism of humic substances to decrease cod or toc in humus dominated organic wastewater the mechanism of hs degradation in the fenton system must be clarified the most common methodology to investigate the changes of hs during different treatment processes is fluorescent analysis e g three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence regional integration or synchronous fluorescence the fluorophores of hs are unusually detected by spectrum peaks at specified fluorescence areas excitation wavelength emission wavelength or by parallel factor analysis parafac hou et al 2020 lu et al 2009 several studies have demonstrated that when oh attacks hs the fluorescence peak of hs in landfill leachate in the fenton process undergoes a blue shift and humification index values decrease which may indicate a decreased degree of hs condensation in straight chains conjugated double bonds and formational changes and degradation of aromatic long chain organics chen et al 2018 hou et al 2020 lu et al 2009 wang et al 2020 based on the mechanism inferred from the preceding investigations the modification of the fluorescence characteristics of hs by oh attack may involve three stages in the initial stage oh may only attack the electron withdrawing and electron donating groups on the benzene ring of hs the benzene ring and the rigid planar structure may not have been destroyed the intensity of the characteristic peaks of hs increases slightly and the fluorescence center is blue shifted by less than 5 nm along the excitation axis lai et al 2013 in the second stage the center of the distinctive fluorescence peak is blue shifted by more than 30 nm along the excitation axis and more than 70 nm along the emission axis whereas its fluorescence intensity increases by nearly 100 a u lai et al 2013 the intense blue shift may be indicative of the disruption of the rigid planar structure of benzene by oh whereas the increase in fluorescence intensity may indicate the formation of short chain compounds containing unsaturated or conjugated bonds lai et al 2013 li et al 2013 in the third stage the fluorescence center of the characteristic peak shifts more than 30 nm along the excitation axis and more than 40 nm along the emission axis whereas its fluorescence intensity increases by nearly 500 a u lai et al 2013 the strong blue shift may indicate the complete disruption of the remaining benzene structure by oh whereas the increase in fluorescence intensity may indicate the removal of the electron withdrawing group from the carbonyl bonds c o and the generation of short chain compounds with unsaturated or conjugated bonds lai et al 2013 li et al 2013 in addition other studies demonstrate that synchronous and asynchronous maps generated from two dimensional correlation spectroscopy coupled with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy based on eem parafac and noda s rule allow for an approximation of the sequences in which oh oxidizes different fluorescent regions of hs aftab et al 2018 jung et al 2017 oh may mainly attack ha fluorescence followed by protein like substances and fa fluorescence i e ha protein like substances fa aftab et al 2018 jung et al 2017 however the aforementioned analysis methods cannot demonstrate the changes at the molecular level and therefore the majority of the mechanisms are presumed to have happened qiu et al 2021 the humic like or fulvic like substances may be a combination of carbohydrates proteins and lipids resulting in uncertainty for the operationally specified procedures described above drosos et al 2018 recently dom exploration has been facilitated by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms with resolutions of 600 000 qiu et al 2021 analysis of different subcategorized dom based on the van kenvelen diagram shows that the fenton process removed 97 lipids 92 proteins 90 lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram like organics 90 tannins 90 unsaturated hydrocarbons 70 aromatic organics and 30 amino sugars from landfill leachate he et al 2021 from these examples we proposed inference on the hs removal pathways by the fenton process from the following three perspectives fig 1 type of organics molecular weight and functional group regarding organics type the studies of buxton et al 1988 and varanasi et al 2018 show that oh was found to readily react with cram like organics h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 by c c double bonds through addition at roughly 1010 m 1 s 1 reaction rates buxton et al 1988 varanasi et al 2018 in addition oh reacts with lipid like organics h c 1 5 2 5 o c 0 0 3 by extracting h from the c h bonds at roughly 108 109 m 1 s 1 reaction rates buxton et al 1988 regarding molecular weight the studies of varanasi et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 demonstrated that certain compounds containing 30 50 carbon atoms disappeared after fenton oxidation indicating that the fenton process can effectively degrade long chain compounds varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2020 medium molecular weight compounds with 15 30 carbon atoms dbe 10 and o c 0 0 25 are generated implying that oh could first attack the c c double bonds and split the medium chain compounds buxton et al 1988 wang et al 2020 simultaneously low molecular weight compounds with 0 15 carbon atoms dbe 10 and o c 0 625 1 are generated suggesting that carboxylic acids and aldehydes may be generated weller and herrmann 2015 regarding the functional group the studies conducted by chan et al 2012 and weller and herrmann 2015 have shown that cho compounds are more easily degraded than chon chos and chons compounds because the reaction rate of oh with n or s compounds are slower than those with only cho compounds chan et al 2012 weller and herrmann 2015 the average o c ratio of cho compounds increased after the fenton reaction indicating more effective oxidation moreover n functional groups such as nhx and nox may contribute electrons to improve the extraction of h by oh thereby increasing the o c ratio of compounds chan et al 2012 3 2 removal mechanism of trace contaminants emerging trace contaminants found in industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater have gained considerable attention owing to their toxicity and the probability to accumulate other contaminants including pops edcs and ppcps and to pollute natural water bodies esplugas et al 2007 wojnarovits and takacs 2014 the mechanisms of oh degradation of trace contaminants have to be unraveled to maximize the removal of toxicity caused by emerging trace contaminants in the fenton system accordingly based on the understanding of the reaction rate the following sections elucidate the reaction pathway of oh attack on trace contaminants in the current study we analyzed the reaction rate constants for oh and typical trace contaminants pops edcs and ppcps based on several studies conducted by various researchers abdessalem et al 2008 acero et al 2000 al housari et al 2011 armbrust 2000 beltran et al 2000 1993 bose et al 1998 broseus et al 2009 chen et al 2009 dodd et al 2006 elovitz et al 2008 frontistis et al 2011 gallard and de laat 2001 haag and yao 1992 huber et al 2003 li et al 2013 mabury and crosby 1996 oturan et al 2010 packer et al 2003 razavi et al 2009 seibert et al 2019 song et al 2008 2009 steter et al 2018 wojnarovits and takacs 2014 wu et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 and xu et al 2014 accordingly the reaction rate constants are illustrated in fig 2 where pops and ppcps are based on second order reaction and edcs on pseudo first order reaction both experimental results based on the relative rate method and theoretical results based on density functional theory and transition state theory or models such as m05 2x functional show that the reactions of oh with various pops and ppcps follow second order kinetics whereas the reactions of oh with various edcs follow pseudo first order kinetics steter et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 from these rate constants it might be implied that oh reacts more quickly with urea and triazine compounds than carbamates thiocarbamates chlorophenoxy and organochlorine compounds and oh reacts more readily with estrone estradiol and phthalates than parabens and phenolic compounds moreover oh degradation of diclofenac fluoxetine naproxen and gemfibrozil has advantages over other ppcps in addition wert et al 2009 found that the second order reaction rate constants for ozone o3 and pops ppcps such as carbamazepine diclofenac naproxen sulfamethoxazole triclosan atrazine iopromide diazepam ibuprofen and fenuron are greater than 105 mol 1 dm3 s 1 wert et al 2009 nevertheless according to our statistics all second order reaction rate constants for oh and pops ppcps are greater than 109 mol 1 dm3 s 1 therefore fenton oxidation may be more effective at degrading pops ppcps than ozone oxidation based on the understanding of the reaction rate between oh and trace contaminants we became more interested in defining the potential reaction pathways the literature reveals that oh attacks the molecular structure of trace contaminants in three ways i h abstraction fig 3 a ii electrophilic addition hydroxylation fig 3b and iii single electron transfer from high valence ions atoms or free radicals fig 3c the three different ways are analyzed in detail in the following subsections 3 2 1 h abstraction an et al 2014 and wojnarovits and takacs 2014 found that h on nh ch and oh is more readily abstracted when oh attacks the molecular structure of trace contaminants an et al 2014 wojnarovits and takacs 2014 the dissociation energy of h oh is much greater than the dissociation energies of the first three c h bonds in saturated hydrocarbons as well as the energy of α h in olefin compounds with only one double bond wojnarovits and takacs 2014 even with considerable driving energy there is still significant selectivity primary h is more difficult to extract than secondary and tertiary h wojnarovits and takacs 2014 h abstraction at different positions has distinct impacts on the degradation products when oh attacks neutral bisphenol a bpa a typical and widely studied edcs fig 3 a the abstraction of h26 forms an unstable methyl radical which is an unfavorable high energy reaction an et al 2014 galano and alvarez idaboy 2009 in contrast the abstraction of h22 from the phenolic hydroxyl group results in the formation of a resonance stable phenolate radical which lowers reaction barriers and increases exothermic reactions jamil et al 2017 3 2 2 electrophilic addition hydroxylation schuler and albarran 2002 discovered that when oh electrophilicity attacks trace contaminants via electrophilic addition it interacts more readily with c c and c n than with c o due to the absence of electrons on the carbon atom of c o schuler and albarran 2002 oh reacts with c c at a rate close to the diffusion mode making benzenoid hydrocarbon easy to react with in addition oh performs electrophilic addition to c c of benzene hydrocarbons with relative ease correspondingly the electrophilic addition of oh to benzene and aromatic molecules with electron donor substituents demonstrates reaction rate constants of more than 109 mol 1 dm3 s 1 schuler and albarran 2002 furthermore strong electron donating substituents such as oh and nh2 in benzene compounds are slightly higher than benzene strong electron withdrawing substituents such as cn co2h and no2 in benzene compounds are lower than benzene wojnarovits and takacs 2013 the addition position occurs in the ortho meta and para positions of the benzene ring with the ortho position occurring infrequently wojnarovits and takacs 2013 typically when oh attacks neutral bpa with electrophilic addition fig 3b it is more favorable at c position 3 reaction enthalpies δh 11 kcal mol 1 than at c position 2 c position 5 and c position 6 δh 8 5 and 9 kcal mol 1 in addition to c position 3 the two lower energy electrophilic addition reaction positions are ortho and para positions c position 2 and c position 6 of the phenolic hydroxyl group implying that the group conjugation effect is significant for stabilizing oh intermediates in addition the aromatic groups further react via hydrogen extraction to restore aromaticity subsequently undergoing oh addition to generate polyhydroxy compounds naik et al 2005 serra perez et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 3 2 3 single electron transfer few studies have identified direct single electron transfer pathways which are all involved in intermediate complexes feoh2 mostly because of the realignment of h2o around the charged center which is unfavorable to the reaction entropy factor wojnarovits and takacs 2014 accordingly the findings of sharma et al 2015 and zhao et al 2018 demonstrated that when a single electron from oh is transferred to neutral bpa fig 3c bpa radical cation and hydroxide are initially generated followed by the formation of two formally charged species in an endothermic reaction sharma et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the bpa radical cation is further oxidized by the electrophilic addition of oh producing highly reactive hydroxylated bpa compounds degradation products the bpa is eventually mineralized to co2 and h2o or converted to nondegradable compounds small molecule organic acids zhao et al 2018 3 3 interference of trace contaminants degradation by other coexisting organics several studies have demonstrated that refractory hs and low molecular weight organic acids e g malonic and malic in organic wastewater have a high propensity to chelate with polyvalent cations thereby influencing the fate of organics davies et al 1997 georgi et al 2007 lin et al 2017 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 ha contains a high density of carboxyl functional groups which form fe complexes and may affect the fenton reaction rate georgi et al 2007 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 additionally ha contains other groups e g alcohol and amide that render them unstable in complex organic wastewater and cause them to participate in several chemical reactions davies et al 1997 georgi et al 2007 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 fa is a small molecular type of ha and its solubility is independent of ph conditions davies et al 1997 miller et al 2013 and voelker and sulzberger 1996 found that fe ii fa complexes increased the reaction rate of fenton at ph 5 and increased h2o2 decomposition compared to the absence of fa but not below ph 5 miller et al 2013 voelker and sulzberger 1996 oh formation occurred only during the reaction of fe ii fa complexes with h2o2 voelker and sulzberger 1996 fa has three roles in the fenton reaction carboxylate ligand free radical scaler and fe3 reductant miller et al 2013 the inhibition of h2o2 by fa increases significantly as ph and fa concentration decrease lin et al 2017 found that at ph 7 a low concentration of fa promoted oh production and 2 4 4 trichlorobiphenyl pcb28 decomposition lin et al 2017 low molecular weight organic acids can function as chelators for fenton at ph 7 and affects the efficiency of the fenton reaction several studies have shown that low molecular weight organic acids maintain iron in a soluble state at near neutral ph inhibit its decomposition and increase the generation of oh ma et al 2006 romero et al 2009 xue et al 2009b oxalic acids are adsorbed onto the surface of fe complexes by a ligand exchange mechanism the complexes weaken the fe3 o bonds on the lattice surface the total dissolution rate is proportional to fe3 o bond dissociation rate ma et al 2006 ho2 o2 can reduce fe iii oxalic acids to fe ii oxalic acids subsequently fe ii oxalic acids reacts with h2o2 to generate additional oh romero et al 2009 therefore the reduction rate of fe3 to fe2 is significantly faster oxalic acids increase the oxidation of pentachlorophenol pcp by approximately six times xue et al 2009b moreover the effect on the fenton process is substantially stronger for low molecular weight organic acids with double carboxyl groups than for those with multiple carboxyl groups lin et al 2017 xue et al 2009b 4 comparative economic analysis between cf and three fenton like technologies after elucidating the potential of the fenton process to degrade dom it is worth comparing the properties of cf with the most extensively studied fenton like technologies cf is susceptible to the issues of low iron circulation high iron sludge production and high chemical consumption lin et al 2022 ribeiro and nunes 2021 thus fenton like technologies such as pf ef and uf are developed we reviewed a comparative analysis of the reaction mechanisms of cf and three fenton like technologies as shown in the supplementary material however fenton like technologies have been developed infrequently as their derivation jain et al 2018 therefore it is plausible that the number of cf publications and their growth rate have remained significantly higher than those of fenton like technologies over the past decade fig s1 to examine them in greater detail a comparative analysis was conducted in terms of contaminants removal effectiveness chemicals consumption and operational costs here we will analyze these three factors in detail comparing the degrading efficiency of contaminants is a prerequisite for the economic analysis of cf and three fenton like technologies in this study the removal effectiveness of dom bulky indicators cod and toc and trace contaminants pops edcs and ppcps by cf and three fenton like technologies reported in the literature was statistically analyzed as shown in fig 4 the removal efficiency of cf on cod was comparable to that of three fenton like technologies and the average removal efficiency on toc was slightly lower than that of three fenton like technologies however the treatment effect stability of cf was significantly superior to that of three fenton like technologies the efficiency of cf in removing trace contaminants was marginally higher than that of three fenton like technologies pf can accelerate the fe cycle via photosensitive complexes to promote the formation of oh ef and uf are capable of producing h2o2 in situ to reduce chemical dosage pliego et al 2015 ramachandran and kumarasamy 2013 however the equipment of fenton like technology is significantly more sophisticated than cf which increases operational costs the collection and usage of the light sources of pf is a difficult barrier to overcome ramos et al 2021 starling et al 2017 low energy conversion and high energy consumption are a challenge for uf adityosulindro et al 2017 ramos et al 2021 remya and lin 2011 wang et al 2016 ef has more stringent standards for ph control than cf once ph 2 h2o2 captures a proton and converts it to h3o2 as h3o2 is electrophilic the reaction rate between h2o2 and fe2 is drastically reduced casado 2019 moreover ef generates a great deal of heat energy due to the applied current and the temperature increase is difficult to control which simultaneously accelerates the positive and side reactions and causes h2o2 to be readily dissolved into h2o and o2 he and zhou 2017 all of these factors increase the chemical consumption of ef commonly used cathode materials are graphite glassy carbon rods and activated carbon fibers and their current efficiency rate is generally low he and zhou 2017 emerging carbon polytetrafluoroethylene gas diffusion electrodes and three dimensional porous electrodes have tremendous potential for hydrogen evolution and minimal h2o2 decomposition but are of high cost kaur et al 2018 ramos et al 2021 in this study the chemical consumption fig 5 a and operational costs fig 5b of cf and the three fenton like technologies reported in the literature were statistically analyzed revealing that cf required a slightly larger dosage of feso4 and h2o2 than the three fenton like technologies however the operational costs of three fenton like technologies were much greater than cf due to additional equipment and material input high energy consumption light and electricity and low energy conversion rate which hinder their large scale engineering application 5 status and outlook of modified conventional fenton as the improvement of the abovementioned fenton like technologies to the fenton process particularly for engineering applications appears to be limited the focus of research is gradually shifting from the introduction of alternative energies to the search for efficient and inexpensive iron catalysts as alternatives to feso4 heterogeneous fenton critically heterogeneous fenton differs from fenton like technologies pf ef and uf in which heterogeneous fenton does not include a third medium energy source in addition to the oxidant and catalyst thus it appears to be a more viable upgrade to fenton process cai et al 2021 kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 additionally we simply anticipate a framework of fenton optimization that may be more applicable in the following subsections we will analyze these two aspects in detail 5 1 characteristic analysis of heterogeneous fenton the cost of the fenton process in engineering applications is mostly attributable to two factors chemical dosing and iron sludge production after fenton oxidation the fe3 catalyst must be precipitated using naoh this precipitation process needs the consumption of naoh the cost of which is nearly similar to the cost of h2o2 however the treatment of iron sludge will lead to additional costs that are even more than the cost of h2o2 itself cai et al 2021 heterogeneous fenton uses insoluble iron containing solids or a fenton catalyst supported on a solid matrix as an alternative to dissolve feso4 eliminating the requirement to precipitate fe ions and producing no iron sludge heterogeneous catalysts include three categories fig 6 iron based catalysts iron ore based catalysts and iron loaded catalysts kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 luo et al 2021 zero valent iron zvi and nanometer zero valent iron nanozvi are the most popular iron based catalysts with nanozvi being more active due to their larger surface area and zvi being more reusable zvi can operate as a fe ii source by corroding in acidic conditions and transferring two electrons kifle et al 2022 the leached fe ii can activate h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species nanozvi necessitates a more acidic environment ph 3 and anaerobic conditions for the removal of contaminants fe iii can spontaneously precipitate in the zvi h2o2 system leonel et al 2021 the oxide generated can facilitate the decomposition of fe ii by zvi and also catalyze the formation of oh kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 the zvi h2o2 system can degrade 79 of the biocide 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol cmp whereas the nanozvi h2o2 system can degrade 86 5 of amoxicillin xu and wang 2011 zha et al 2014 magnetite fe3o4 is frequently employed as an effective iron ore based catalyst scaria et al 2021 fe ii and fe iii in fe3o4 occupy the octahedral site and the two valences are indistinguishable due to fast electron hopping which can accelerate the fe ii fe iii cycle scaria et al 2021 at the octahedral site aqueous ferrous oxide fe ii h2o can perform ligand substitution in h2o2 to produce fe ii h2o2 complexes under acidic conditions which can accelerate single electron transfer to produce oh scaria et al 2021 xue et al 2009a due to its enhanced adsorption properties the fe3o4 h2o2 system can degrade 90 of pcp under neutral conditions xue et al 2009a in addition when the fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles h2o2 system degraded 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp the h2o2 utilization rate was as high as 73 xu and wang 2012 iron loaded catalysts are iron based catalysts attached to carbon materials e g multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts activated carbon and graphene and silicate materials e g soapstone and quartz to increase the specific surface area and hydrophobic surface of the reaction which are more chemically stable and less expensive chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 moreover these substances can stimulate the breakdown of h2o2 carrier materials can concentrate dom at the center of the catalytic activity of iron based catalysts through adsorption chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 scaria et al 2021 in the fe3o4 mwcnt h2o2 system the oxidative degradation of 17α methyltestosterone mt is significantly higher than in systems containing fe3o4 due to the hydrophobicity of mt hu et al 2011 the key factors in the oxidative degradation of dom by iron loaded catalysts are the adsorption behavior determined by the zero charge point of the dom the surface properties of the catalysts and the electron transfer capacity determined by the oxygen vacancy rather than solution based mechanisms which also allows the optimal ph range to be widened hu et al 2011 in the nanozvi polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp k30 h2o2 system for tetracycline degradation the nanozvi surface has a constant positive charge at ph 7 2 allowing it to retain catalytic activity in weakly acidic to neutral conditions due to surface adsorption chen et al 2011 iron based and iron ore based catalysts have a high density sink rapidly in liquids and are difficult to fluidize rendering them unsuitable for fenton fluidized bed in engineering applications kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 luo et al 2021 xu and wang 2011 zha et al 2014 the carrier of iron loaded catalysts has an adsorption effect on dom and it is unclear from the current study whether this effect is due to catalytic activity or the adsorption of dom on the catalyst surface chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 scaria et al 2021 in engineering applications the carrier tends to adsorb dom whereas the catalyst has negligible effect resulting in little treatment effect after the adsorbent is saturated chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 scaria et al 2021 overcoming the aforementioned obstacles is the key to heterogeneous fenton for optimizing cf and is also worthy of future research 5 2 possible research direction for fenton intelligent control ai has been widely implemented in wastewater treatment particularly in modeling algorithms and online monitoring ye et al 2020 early applications of ai in wastewater treatment focused mostly on heavy metal removal and dye adsorption soleymani and moradi 2018 yu et al 2014 2013 in recent years the focus has gradually shifted toward wastewater treatment process modeling algorithms advanced online monitoring controls and soft sensors for difficult to measure parameters ye et al 2020 the reaction mechanism of the fenton process was initially revealed through previous research however the chain reaction is complex and variable and the system comprising h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh cod bod5 nh4 n no3 n ph do orp and other components and indicators is still a black box model if the correspondence between the components is investigated by modeling algorithms and suitable intelligent control systems soft sensors are integrated by modeling algorithms and online or offline monitoring data it has the potential to achieve accurate and dynamically variable chemical dosing for engineering applications to optimize the fenton process 6 conclusions fenton process has better prospects for applicability because oh can efficiently degrade dom analytical techniques such as hrms or fluorescence analysis revealed that the mechanisms of attack by oh on hs and trace contaminants as well as their respective subcategories in the fenton process are distinct the priority of hs degradation by oh must still be determined using single and multicomponent sequencing experiments however incorporating energy sources such as pf ef and uf to optimize the fenton process appears to be plagued by high costs and instability resulting from a low energy conversion rate to further improve the fenton process several iron catalysts are derived as feso4 substitutes nevertheless many unexplored aspects such as the fluidizability of iron based and iron ore based catalysts and the definition of iron loaded catalysts for dom adsorption and degradation need additional investigation additionally it may be worthwhile to investigate whether ai related technologies can be incorporated into the fenton process for the exact control of chemical dosage aimed at the targeted dom molecules based on the above analysis the fenton process can be reexamined from the perspectives of mechanisms and different optimization approaches which may help drive its selective degradation of refractory organic contaminants and improve various optimization methods to achieve precise chemical dosing and improve effluent quality in an energy efficient and low carbon

15187,fenton process has become a research hotspot due to the nonselective and efficient degradation of dissolved organic matter dom by oh however there are still many challenges and bottlenecks for conventional fenton cf this study provides the first comprehensive insight into the mechanisms of dom degradation by the fenton process including the various subcategories of humic substances emerging trace contaminants including persistent organic pollutants endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products and the interference of humus and low molecular weight organic acids on the removal of trace contaminants in addition a statistical comparison of the economics of cf and three types of fenton like technologies photo fenton electro fenton and ultrasonic fenton is conducted based on existing studies which can be used as a reference for engineering applications moreover a brief overview of the categories and characteristics of heterogeneous fenton which have been extensively studied in recent years and a comparison of their catalysts are presented in the end the paper advances a possible future research direction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter fenton oh humic substances trace contaminants fenton like technology data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water pollution is one of the leading environmental pollution issues worldwide wastewater is abundant in refractory organic matter such as landfill leachate livestock wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater and has been recognized as an environmental problem due to its high organic content various emerging trace organic contaminants and secondary derived contaminants hao et al 2021 mao et al 2022 in the context of global energy saving and low carbon sustainable development handling it efficiently and with low energy chemical consumption has become a key part of achieving the carbon neutrality goal of the entire wastewater treatment field wang et al 2016 at present fenton is a more effective process for degrading refractory organic matter in wastewater he et al 2021 however conventional fenton cf still presents many challenges such as high chemical consumption and high amount of iron sludge production wu et al 2021 accordingly fenton like technology and heterogeneous fenton have emerged recently jain et al 2018 however previous reviews of fenton technologies have infrequently and rarely analyzed the mechanism of oh attack on dissolved organic matter dom thus only by clarifying the above mechanisms we can determine whether the fenton reaction works on the degradation of the targeted dom and understand the specific mechanism behind the long established theory of nonselective degradation of most organics instead of just stopping at dom bulky indicators e g chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc furthermore in terms of engineering applications nonselective technologies for removing contaminants can be substituted with selective technologies that involve accurate chemical dosing and minimal creation of derived contaminants thus enhancing cost effectiveness and optimizing carbon reduction in addition previous reviews rarely conducted comparative economic analyses that could be used as a reference for engineering applications between fenton processes meanwhile new innovative fenton technologies are less thoroughly explained hence the overall logic of the review is developed first the degradation mechanism of dom by fenton is elucidated to explore the degradation potential of fenton from a mechanism perspective second a comparative analysis of the contaminant removal efficiency and economics of cf and three fenton like technologies the most widely studied fenton technologies is undertaken to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different fenton technologies from an engineering perspective finally the characteristics and potential research directions of modified cf are reviewed from the perspective of future development 2 materials and methods a scoping review of the literature on fenton degradation of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater from january 2000 to october 2022 excluding references to classical theoretical perspectives was conducted the literature search for peer reviewed scientific publications was conducted using authoritative academic search engines and databases such as google scholar web of science sciencedirect and acs publications the search terms include at least one of the following topics refractory organic matters landfill leachate livestock wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater industrial wastewater fenton fenton like photo fenton pf electro fenton ef ultrasonic fenton uf dom oh humic substances hs trace contaminants persistent organic pollutants pops endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps fluorescent analysis high resolution mass spectrometry free radical kinetic analysis heterogeneous fenton and artificial intelligence ai finally based on the principles of authority relevance and timeliness we extracted 152 literatures as references for this study of which 76 3 were published after 2010 3 mechanism of dom degradation by the fenton process dom of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater consists of humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa in addition to emerging trace contaminants such as pops edcs and ppcps in humus dominated organic wastewater such as leachate the primary objective is to remove hs to meet cod or toc standard criteria of the effluent whereas the primary objective in many industrial and pharmaceutical organic wastewater is to remove toxicity from specific trace contaminants as oh is the most important oxidizing agent in the fenton reaction the mechanism of dom degradation by oh in the fenton reaction must be clarified this study investigates the degradation mechanism for both hs and trace contaminants as well as the effect of humus and low molecular weight organic acids on the removal of trace contaminants 3 1 removal mechanism of humic substances to decrease cod or toc in humus dominated organic wastewater the mechanism of hs degradation in the fenton system must be clarified the most common methodology to investigate the changes of hs during different treatment processes is fluorescent analysis e g three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence regional integration or synchronous fluorescence the fluorophores of hs are unusually detected by spectrum peaks at specified fluorescence areas excitation wavelength emission wavelength or by parallel factor analysis parafac hou et al 2020 lu et al 2009 several studies have demonstrated that when oh attacks hs the fluorescence peak of hs in landfill leachate in the fenton process undergoes a blue shift and humification index values decrease which may indicate a decreased degree of hs condensation in straight chains conjugated double bonds and formational changes and degradation of aromatic long chain organics chen et al 2018 hou et al 2020 lu et al 2009 wang et al 2020 based on the mechanism inferred from the preceding investigations the modification of the fluorescence characteristics of hs by oh attack may involve three stages in the initial stage oh may only attack the electron withdrawing and electron donating groups on the benzene ring of hs the benzene ring and the rigid planar structure may not have been destroyed the intensity of the characteristic peaks of hs increases slightly and the fluorescence center is blue shifted by less than 5 nm along the excitation axis lai et al 2013 in the second stage the center of the distinctive fluorescence peak is blue shifted by more than 30 nm along the excitation axis and more than 70 nm along the emission axis whereas its fluorescence intensity increases by nearly 100 a u lai et al 2013 the intense blue shift may be indicative of the disruption of the rigid planar structure of benzene by oh whereas the increase in fluorescence intensity may indicate the formation of short chain compounds containing unsaturated or conjugated bonds lai et al 2013 li et al 2013 in the third stage the fluorescence center of the characteristic peak shifts more than 30 nm along the excitation axis and more than 40 nm along the emission axis whereas its fluorescence intensity increases by nearly 500 a u lai et al 2013 the strong blue shift may indicate the complete disruption of the remaining benzene structure by oh whereas the increase in fluorescence intensity may indicate the removal of the electron withdrawing group from the carbonyl bonds c o and the generation of short chain compounds with unsaturated or conjugated bonds lai et al 2013 li et al 2013 in addition other studies demonstrate that synchronous and asynchronous maps generated from two dimensional correlation spectroscopy coupled with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy based on eem parafac and noda s rule allow for an approximation of the sequences in which oh oxidizes different fluorescent regions of hs aftab et al 2018 jung et al 2017 oh may mainly attack ha fluorescence followed by protein like substances and fa fluorescence i e ha protein like substances fa aftab et al 2018 jung et al 2017 however the aforementioned analysis methods cannot demonstrate the changes at the molecular level and therefore the majority of the mechanisms are presumed to have happened qiu et al 2021 the humic like or fulvic like substances may be a combination of carbohydrates proteins and lipids resulting in uncertainty for the operationally specified procedures described above drosos et al 2018 recently dom exploration has been facilitated by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms with resolutions of 600 000 qiu et al 2021 analysis of different subcategorized dom based on the van kenvelen diagram shows that the fenton process removed 97 lipids 92 proteins 90 lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram like organics 90 tannins 90 unsaturated hydrocarbons 70 aromatic organics and 30 amino sugars from landfill leachate he et al 2021 from these examples we proposed inference on the hs removal pathways by the fenton process from the following three perspectives fig 1 type of organics molecular weight and functional group regarding organics type the studies of buxton et al 1988 and varanasi et al 2018 show that oh was found to readily react with cram like organics h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 by c c double bonds through addition at roughly 1010 m 1 s 1 reaction rates buxton et al 1988 varanasi et al 2018 in addition oh reacts with lipid like organics h c 1 5 2 5 o c 0 0 3 by extracting h from the c h bonds at roughly 108 109 m 1 s 1 reaction rates buxton et al 1988 regarding molecular weight the studies of varanasi et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 demonstrated that certain compounds containing 30 50 carbon atoms disappeared after fenton oxidation indicating that the fenton process can effectively degrade long chain compounds varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2020 medium molecular weight compounds with 15 30 carbon atoms dbe 10 and o c 0 0 25 are generated implying that oh could first attack the c c double bonds and split the medium chain compounds buxton et al 1988 wang et al 2020 simultaneously low molecular weight compounds with 0 15 carbon atoms dbe 10 and o c 0 625 1 are generated suggesting that carboxylic acids and aldehydes may be generated weller and herrmann 2015 regarding the functional group the studies conducted by chan et al 2012 and weller and herrmann 2015 have shown that cho compounds are more easily degraded than chon chos and chons compounds because the reaction rate of oh with n or s compounds are slower than those with only cho compounds chan et al 2012 weller and herrmann 2015 the average o c ratio of cho compounds increased after the fenton reaction indicating more effective oxidation moreover n functional groups such as nhx and nox may contribute electrons to improve the extraction of h by oh thereby increasing the o c ratio of compounds chan et al 2012 3 2 removal mechanism of trace contaminants emerging trace contaminants found in industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater have gained considerable attention owing to their toxicity and the probability to accumulate other contaminants including pops edcs and ppcps and to pollute natural water bodies esplugas et al 2007 wojnarovits and takacs 2014 the mechanisms of oh degradation of trace contaminants have to be unraveled to maximize the removal of toxicity caused by emerging trace contaminants in the fenton system accordingly based on the understanding of the reaction rate the following sections elucidate the reaction pathway of oh attack on trace contaminants in the current study we analyzed the reaction rate constants for oh and typical trace contaminants pops edcs and ppcps based on several studies conducted by various researchers abdessalem et al 2008 acero et al 2000 al housari et al 2011 armbrust 2000 beltran et al 2000 1993 bose et al 1998 broseus et al 2009 chen et al 2009 dodd et al 2006 elovitz et al 2008 frontistis et al 2011 gallard and de laat 2001 haag and yao 1992 huber et al 2003 li et al 2013 mabury and crosby 1996 oturan et al 2010 packer et al 2003 razavi et al 2009 seibert et al 2019 song et al 2008 2009 steter et al 2018 wojnarovits and takacs 2014 wu et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 and xu et al 2014 accordingly the reaction rate constants are illustrated in fig 2 where pops and ppcps are based on second order reaction and edcs on pseudo first order reaction both experimental results based on the relative rate method and theoretical results based on density functional theory and transition state theory or models such as m05 2x functional show that the reactions of oh with various pops and ppcps follow second order kinetics whereas the reactions of oh with various edcs follow pseudo first order kinetics steter et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 from these rate constants it might be implied that oh reacts more quickly with urea and triazine compounds than carbamates thiocarbamates chlorophenoxy and organochlorine compounds and oh reacts more readily with estrone estradiol and phthalates than parabens and phenolic compounds moreover oh degradation of diclofenac fluoxetine naproxen and gemfibrozil has advantages over other ppcps in addition wert et al 2009 found that the second order reaction rate constants for ozone o3 and pops ppcps such as carbamazepine diclofenac naproxen sulfamethoxazole triclosan atrazine iopromide diazepam ibuprofen and fenuron are greater than 105 mol 1 dm3 s 1 wert et al 2009 nevertheless according to our statistics all second order reaction rate constants for oh and pops ppcps are greater than 109 mol 1 dm3 s 1 therefore fenton oxidation may be more effective at degrading pops ppcps than ozone oxidation based on the understanding of the reaction rate between oh and trace contaminants we became more interested in defining the potential reaction pathways the literature reveals that oh attacks the molecular structure of trace contaminants in three ways i h abstraction fig 3 a ii electrophilic addition hydroxylation fig 3b and iii single electron transfer from high valence ions atoms or free radicals fig 3c the three different ways are analyzed in detail in the following subsections 3 2 1 h abstraction an et al 2014 and wojnarovits and takacs 2014 found that h on nh ch and oh is more readily abstracted when oh attacks the molecular structure of trace contaminants an et al 2014 wojnarovits and takacs 2014 the dissociation energy of h oh is much greater than the dissociation energies of the first three c h bonds in saturated hydrocarbons as well as the energy of α h in olefin compounds with only one double bond wojnarovits and takacs 2014 even with considerable driving energy there is still significant selectivity primary h is more difficult to extract than secondary and tertiary h wojnarovits and takacs 2014 h abstraction at different positions has distinct impacts on the degradation products when oh attacks neutral bisphenol a bpa a typical and widely studied edcs fig 3 a the abstraction of h26 forms an unstable methyl radical which is an unfavorable high energy reaction an et al 2014 galano and alvarez idaboy 2009 in contrast the abstraction of h22 from the phenolic hydroxyl group results in the formation of a resonance stable phenolate radical which lowers reaction barriers and increases exothermic reactions jamil et al 2017 3 2 2 electrophilic addition hydroxylation schuler and albarran 2002 discovered that when oh electrophilicity attacks trace contaminants via electrophilic addition it interacts more readily with c c and c n than with c o due to the absence of electrons on the carbon atom of c o schuler and albarran 2002 oh reacts with c c at a rate close to the diffusion mode making benzenoid hydrocarbon easy to react with in addition oh performs electrophilic addition to c c of benzene hydrocarbons with relative ease correspondingly the electrophilic addition of oh to benzene and aromatic molecules with electron donor substituents demonstrates reaction rate constants of more than 109 mol 1 dm3 s 1 schuler and albarran 2002 furthermore strong electron donating substituents such as oh and nh2 in benzene compounds are slightly higher than benzene strong electron withdrawing substituents such as cn co2h and no2 in benzene compounds are lower than benzene wojnarovits and takacs 2013 the addition position occurs in the ortho meta and para positions of the benzene ring with the ortho position occurring infrequently wojnarovits and takacs 2013 typically when oh attacks neutral bpa with electrophilic addition fig 3b it is more favorable at c position 3 reaction enthalpies δh 11 kcal mol 1 than at c position 2 c position 5 and c position 6 δh 8 5 and 9 kcal mol 1 in addition to c position 3 the two lower energy electrophilic addition reaction positions are ortho and para positions c position 2 and c position 6 of the phenolic hydroxyl group implying that the group conjugation effect is significant for stabilizing oh intermediates in addition the aromatic groups further react via hydrogen extraction to restore aromaticity subsequently undergoing oh addition to generate polyhydroxy compounds naik et al 2005 serra perez et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 3 2 3 single electron transfer few studies have identified direct single electron transfer pathways which are all involved in intermediate complexes feoh2 mostly because of the realignment of h2o around the charged center which is unfavorable to the reaction entropy factor wojnarovits and takacs 2014 accordingly the findings of sharma et al 2015 and zhao et al 2018 demonstrated that when a single electron from oh is transferred to neutral bpa fig 3c bpa radical cation and hydroxide are initially generated followed by the formation of two formally charged species in an endothermic reaction sharma et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the bpa radical cation is further oxidized by the electrophilic addition of oh producing highly reactive hydroxylated bpa compounds degradation products the bpa is eventually mineralized to co2 and h2o or converted to nondegradable compounds small molecule organic acids zhao et al 2018 3 3 interference of trace contaminants degradation by other coexisting organics several studies have demonstrated that refractory hs and low molecular weight organic acids e g malonic and malic in organic wastewater have a high propensity to chelate with polyvalent cations thereby influencing the fate of organics davies et al 1997 georgi et al 2007 lin et al 2017 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 ha contains a high density of carboxyl functional groups which form fe complexes and may affect the fenton reaction rate georgi et al 2007 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 additionally ha contains other groups e g alcohol and amide that render them unstable in complex organic wastewater and cause them to participate in several chemical reactions davies et al 1997 georgi et al 2007 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 fa is a small molecular type of ha and its solubility is independent of ph conditions davies et al 1997 miller et al 2013 and voelker and sulzberger 1996 found that fe ii fa complexes increased the reaction rate of fenton at ph 5 and increased h2o2 decomposition compared to the absence of fa but not below ph 5 miller et al 2013 voelker and sulzberger 1996 oh formation occurred only during the reaction of fe ii fa complexes with h2o2 voelker and sulzberger 1996 fa has three roles in the fenton reaction carboxylate ligand free radical scaler and fe3 reductant miller et al 2013 the inhibition of h2o2 by fa increases significantly as ph and fa concentration decrease lin et al 2017 found that at ph 7 a low concentration of fa promoted oh production and 2 4 4 trichlorobiphenyl pcb28 decomposition lin et al 2017 low molecular weight organic acids can function as chelators for fenton at ph 7 and affects the efficiency of the fenton reaction several studies have shown that low molecular weight organic acids maintain iron in a soluble state at near neutral ph inhibit its decomposition and increase the generation of oh ma et al 2006 romero et al 2009 xue et al 2009b oxalic acids are adsorbed onto the surface of fe complexes by a ligand exchange mechanism the complexes weaken the fe3 o bonds on the lattice surface the total dissolution rate is proportional to fe3 o bond dissociation rate ma et al 2006 ho2 o2 can reduce fe iii oxalic acids to fe ii oxalic acids subsequently fe ii oxalic acids reacts with h2o2 to generate additional oh romero et al 2009 therefore the reduction rate of fe3 to fe2 is significantly faster oxalic acids increase the oxidation of pentachlorophenol pcp by approximately six times xue et al 2009b moreover the effect on the fenton process is substantially stronger for low molecular weight organic acids with double carboxyl groups than for those with multiple carboxyl groups lin et al 2017 xue et al 2009b 4 comparative economic analysis between cf and three fenton like technologies after elucidating the potential of the fenton process to degrade dom it is worth comparing the properties of cf with the most extensively studied fenton like technologies cf is susceptible to the issues of low iron circulation high iron sludge production and high chemical consumption lin et al 2022 ribeiro and nunes 2021 thus fenton like technologies such as pf ef and uf are developed we reviewed a comparative analysis of the reaction mechanisms of cf and three fenton like technologies as shown in the supplementary material however fenton like technologies have been developed infrequently as their derivation jain et al 2018 therefore it is plausible that the number of cf publications and their growth rate have remained significantly higher than those of fenton like technologies over the past decade fig s1 to examine them in greater detail a comparative analysis was conducted in terms of contaminants removal effectiveness chemicals consumption and operational costs here we will analyze these three factors in detail comparing the degrading efficiency of contaminants is a prerequisite for the economic analysis of cf and three fenton like technologies in this study the removal effectiveness of dom bulky indicators cod and toc and trace contaminants pops edcs and ppcps by cf and three fenton like technologies reported in the literature was statistically analyzed as shown in fig 4 the removal efficiency of cf on cod was comparable to that of three fenton like technologies and the average removal efficiency on toc was slightly lower than that of three fenton like technologies however the treatment effect stability of cf was significantly superior to that of three fenton like technologies the efficiency of cf in removing trace contaminants was marginally higher than that of three fenton like technologies pf can accelerate the fe cycle via photosensitive complexes to promote the formation of oh ef and uf are capable of producing h2o2 in situ to reduce chemical dosage pliego et al 2015 ramachandran and kumarasamy 2013 however the equipment of fenton like technology is significantly more sophisticated than cf which increases operational costs the collection and usage of the light sources of pf is a difficult barrier to overcome ramos et al 2021 starling et al 2017 low energy conversion and high energy consumption are a challenge for uf adityosulindro et al 2017 ramos et al 2021 remya and lin 2011 wang et al 2016 ef has more stringent standards for ph control than cf once ph 2 h2o2 captures a proton and converts it to h3o2 as h3o2 is electrophilic the reaction rate between h2o2 and fe2 is drastically reduced casado 2019 moreover ef generates a great deal of heat energy due to the applied current and the temperature increase is difficult to control which simultaneously accelerates the positive and side reactions and causes h2o2 to be readily dissolved into h2o and o2 he and zhou 2017 all of these factors increase the chemical consumption of ef commonly used cathode materials are graphite glassy carbon rods and activated carbon fibers and their current efficiency rate is generally low he and zhou 2017 emerging carbon polytetrafluoroethylene gas diffusion electrodes and three dimensional porous electrodes have tremendous potential for hydrogen evolution and minimal h2o2 decomposition but are of high cost kaur et al 2018 ramos et al 2021 in this study the chemical consumption fig 5 a and operational costs fig 5b of cf and the three fenton like technologies reported in the literature were statistically analyzed revealing that cf required a slightly larger dosage of feso4 and h2o2 than the three fenton like technologies however the operational costs of three fenton like technologies were much greater than cf due to additional equipment and material input high energy consumption light and electricity and low energy conversion rate which hinder their large scale engineering application 5 status and outlook of modified conventional fenton as the improvement of the abovementioned fenton like technologies to the fenton process particularly for engineering applications appears to be limited the focus of research is gradually shifting from the introduction of alternative energies to the search for efficient and inexpensive iron catalysts as alternatives to feso4 heterogeneous fenton critically heterogeneous fenton differs from fenton like technologies pf ef and uf in which heterogeneous fenton does not include a third medium energy source in addition to the oxidant and catalyst thus it appears to be a more viable upgrade to fenton process cai et al 2021 kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 additionally we simply anticipate a framework of fenton optimization that may be more applicable in the following subsections we will analyze these two aspects in detail 5 1 characteristic analysis of heterogeneous fenton the cost of the fenton process in engineering applications is mostly attributable to two factors chemical dosing and iron sludge production after fenton oxidation the fe3 catalyst must be precipitated using naoh this precipitation process needs the consumption of naoh the cost of which is nearly similar to the cost of h2o2 however the treatment of iron sludge will lead to additional costs that are even more than the cost of h2o2 itself cai et al 2021 heterogeneous fenton uses insoluble iron containing solids or a fenton catalyst supported on a solid matrix as an alternative to dissolve feso4 eliminating the requirement to precipitate fe ions and producing no iron sludge heterogeneous catalysts include three categories fig 6 iron based catalysts iron ore based catalysts and iron loaded catalysts kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 luo et al 2021 zero valent iron zvi and nanometer zero valent iron nanozvi are the most popular iron based catalysts with nanozvi being more active due to their larger surface area and zvi being more reusable zvi can operate as a fe ii source by corroding in acidic conditions and transferring two electrons kifle et al 2022 the leached fe ii can activate h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species nanozvi necessitates a more acidic environment ph 3 and anaerobic conditions for the removal of contaminants fe iii can spontaneously precipitate in the zvi h2o2 system leonel et al 2021 the oxide generated can facilitate the decomposition of fe ii by zvi and also catalyze the formation of oh kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 the zvi h2o2 system can degrade 79 of the biocide 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol cmp whereas the nanozvi h2o2 system can degrade 86 5 of amoxicillin xu and wang 2011 zha et al 2014 magnetite fe3o4 is frequently employed as an effective iron ore based catalyst scaria et al 2021 fe ii and fe iii in fe3o4 occupy the octahedral site and the two valences are indistinguishable due to fast electron hopping which can accelerate the fe ii fe iii cycle scaria et al 2021 at the octahedral site aqueous ferrous oxide fe ii h2o can perform ligand substitution in h2o2 to produce fe ii h2o2 complexes under acidic conditions which can accelerate single electron transfer to produce oh scaria et al 2021 xue et al 2009a due to its enhanced adsorption properties the fe3o4 h2o2 system can degrade 90 of pcp under neutral conditions xue et al 2009a in addition when the fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles h2o2 system degraded 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp the h2o2 utilization rate was as high as 73 xu and wang 2012 iron loaded catalysts are iron based catalysts attached to carbon materials e g multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts activated carbon and graphene and silicate materials e g soapstone and quartz to increase the specific surface area and hydrophobic surface of the reaction which are more chemically stable and less expensive chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 moreover these substances can stimulate the breakdown of h2o2 carrier materials can concentrate dom at the center of the catalytic activity of iron based catalysts through adsorption chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 scaria et al 2021 in the fe3o4 mwcnt h2o2 system the oxidative degradation of 17α methyltestosterone mt is significantly higher than in systems containing fe3o4 due to the hydrophobicity of mt hu et al 2011 the key factors in the oxidative degradation of dom by iron loaded catalysts are the adsorption behavior determined by the zero charge point of the dom the surface properties of the catalysts and the electron transfer capacity determined by the oxygen vacancy rather than solution based mechanisms which also allows the optimal ph range to be widened hu et al 2011 in the nanozvi polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp k30 h2o2 system for tetracycline degradation the nanozvi surface has a constant positive charge at ph 7 2 allowing it to retain catalytic activity in weakly acidic to neutral conditions due to surface adsorption chen et al 2011 iron based and iron ore based catalysts have a high density sink rapidly in liquids and are difficult to fluidize rendering them unsuitable for fenton fluidized bed in engineering applications kifle et al 2022 leonel et al 2021 luo et al 2021 xu and wang 2011 zha et al 2014 the carrier of iron loaded catalysts has an adsorption effect on dom and it is unclear from the current study whether this effect is due to catalytic activity or the adsorption of dom on the catalyst surface chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 scaria et al 2021 in engineering applications the carrier tends to adsorb dom whereas the catalyst has negligible effect resulting in little treatment effect after the adsorbent is saturated chen et al 2011 hu et al 2011 scaria et al 2021 overcoming the aforementioned obstacles is the key to heterogeneous fenton for optimizing cf and is also worthy of future research 5 2 possible research direction for fenton intelligent control ai has been widely implemented in wastewater treatment particularly in modeling algorithms and online monitoring ye et al 2020 early applications of ai in wastewater treatment focused mostly on heavy metal removal and dye adsorption soleymani and moradi 2018 yu et al 2014 2013 in recent years the focus has gradually shifted toward wastewater treatment process modeling algorithms advanced online monitoring controls and soft sensors for difficult to measure parameters ye et al 2020 the reaction mechanism of the fenton process was initially revealed through previous research however the chain reaction is complex and variable and the system comprising h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh cod bod5 nh4 n no3 n ph do orp and other components and indicators is still a black box model if the correspondence between the components is investigated by modeling algorithms and suitable intelligent control systems soft sensors are integrated by modeling algorithms and online or offline monitoring data it has the potential to achieve accurate and dynamically variable chemical dosing for engineering applications to optimize the fenton process 6 conclusions fenton process has better prospects for applicability because oh can efficiently degrade dom analytical techniques such as hrms or fluorescence analysis revealed that the mechanisms of attack by oh on hs and trace contaminants as well as their respective subcategories in the fenton process are distinct the priority of hs degradation by oh must still be determined using single and multicomponent sequencing experiments however incorporating energy sources such as pf ef and uf to optimize the fenton process appears to be plagued by high costs and instability resulting from a low energy conversion rate to further improve the fenton process several iron catalysts are derived as feso4 substitutes nevertheless many unexplored aspects such as the fluidizability of iron based and iron ore based catalysts and the definition of iron loaded catalysts for dom adsorption and degradation need additional investigation additionally it may be worthwhile to investigate whether ai related technologies can be incorporated into the fenton process for the exact control of chemical dosage aimed at the targeted dom molecules based on the above analysis the fenton process can be reexamined from the perspectives of mechanisms and different optimization approaches which may help drive its selective degradation of refractory organic contaminants and improve various optimization methods to achieve precise chemical dosing and improve effluent quality in an energy efficient and low carbon

15188,sartans are a group of pharmaceuticals widely used to regulate blood pressure their concentration levels were monitored in 80 wastewater treatment plants wwtp in the baltic sea region reached from limit of detection up to 6 µg l the concentrations were significantly different in different countries but consistent within the respective country the degradation of sartans losartan valsartan irbesartan in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs that utilize biofilms grown on mobile carriers to treat wastewater was investigated for the first time and compared with the degradation in a conventional activated sludge cas treatment plant the results showed the formation of six microbial transformation products tps of losartan four of valsartan and four of irbesartan in biological wastewater treatment four of these metabolites have not been described in the literature before chemical structures were suggested and selected tps were verified and quantified depending on availability of true standards valsartan acid was a common tp of losartan valsartan and irbesartan losartan and irbesartan also shared one tp losartan irbesartan tp335 based on the mass balance analysis losartan carboxylic acid is the main tp of losartan and valsartan acid is the main tp of valsartan during the biotransformation process for irbesartan tp447 is likely to be the main tp as its peak areas were two orders of magnitude higher than those of all the other detected tps of this compound the effects of adapting biofilms to different biological oxygen demand bod loading on the degradation of sartans as well as the formation of their tps were investigated compared to feeding a poor substrate pure effluent wastewater from a cas feeding with richer substrate 1 3 raw and 2 3 effluent wastewater promoted the metabolism of most compounds co metabolization however the addition of raw wastewater inhibited some metabolic pathways of other compounds such as from losartan irbesartan to tp335 competitive inhibition the formation of irbesartan tp447 did not change with or without raw wastewater finally the sartans and their tps were investigated in a full scale cas wastewater treatment plant wwtp the removal of losartan valsartan and irbesartan ranged from 3 0 to 72 and some of the transformation products tps from human metabolism were also removed in the wwtp however some of the sartan tps i e valsartan acid losartan carboxylic acid irbesartan tp443 and losartan tp453 were formed in the wwtp relative high amounts of especially losartan carboxylic acid which was detected with concentrations up to 2 27 µg l were found in the effluent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords angiotensin ii receptor blocker moving bed biofilm reactor

used to treat high blood pressure i e hypertension angiotensin ii receptor antagonists boix et al 2016 letzel et al 2015 serna galvis et al 2019 with the aging of societies the use of sartans has increased during the last few decades arvaniti et al 2020 carpinteiro et al 2019 in germany the annual prescriptions of sartans nearly tripled from 7 108 to 2 109 defined daily doses ddds from 2002 to 2011 diehle et al 2019 nödler et al 2013 losartan was the first sartan drug launched on the market in 1995 and it is still widely used today ladhari et al 2021 nödler et al 2013 valsartan and irbesartan are also extensively prescribed and were among the top ten best selling pharmaceuticals in france belgium portugal and greece in 2018 ladhari et al 2021 therefore losartan valsartan and irbesartan were selected as representatives of sartan compounds being studied here see structures in table 1 like most sartans losartan valsartan and irbesartan all share a basic core of a tetrazole bonded to a biphenyl while the losartan molecule contains a chlorine atom hydroxymethyl and butyl groups linked to an imidazole ring valsartan has a carboxyl and an isopropyl group linked to a pentanamide moiety and irbesartan has a butyl chain and a butyl ring connected to an imidazolone structure table 1 losartan irbesartan and valsartan were constantly detected in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent monitored in denmark in concentration ranges reaching up to 694 575 and 224 ng l respectively kisielius et al 2023 in wwtp effluent in sweden 450 ng l of irbesartan was detected bayer et al 2014 due to the extensive use and incomplete removal by wwtps sartans have also been discussed as emerging micropollutants in different aquatic environments kaushik et al 2016 nödler et al 2010 reh et al 2013 losartan has been found at a concentration of 620 ng l in a river in spain and 45 ng l in a bay in the united states fent et al 2006 gracia lor et al 2012 valsartan concentrations of 46 ng l were detected in surface water in switzerland and it reached 1300 ng l in a river in spain gracia lor et al 2012 klosterhaus et al 2013 up to 830 ng l was detected in a spanish river bayer et al 2014 huerta fontela et al 2011 however the number of studies on the occurrence and fate of sartans in aquatic environments and wastewater treatment are still limited nödler et al 2013 and mass balance studies in wastewater treatment for sartan compounds are missing in the literature in wwtps most micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals x ray contrast media industrial chemicals etc are unlikely to be completely mineralized but will form transformation products tps huntscha et al 2014 knopp et al 2016 lee and von gunten 2016 compared to their parent compounds the tps of organic micropollutants in general can be more persistent and mobile than their parent compounds and some can be even more toxic arvaniti et al 2020 helbling et al 2010 kosjek et al 2009 therefore identifying and quantifying the tps originating from organic micropollutants in biological processes is critical for assessing their overall impact on the water environments as shown by boix et al 2016 and helbling et al 2010 the only sartan metabolite for which some environmental data is available is valsartan acid it is often found in the effluents of wwtps surface waters up to 2100 ng l as well as in drinking water 72 ng l nödler et al 2016 2013 sperlich et al 2017 berkner and thierbach 2014 otherwise there is no no consolidated data on identification of metabolites mass balances or formation kinetics on metabolisation of sartans in wastewater treatment while wastewater is predominantly treated by activated sludge reactors also biofilm based processes can be used moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology uses biofilms grown on movable carriers in reactors to treat wastewater ødegaard 2006 torresi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 mbbrs have been proven a promising alternative to conventional activated sludge cas reactors to remove organic matter and nitrogen from wastewater more efficiently and it can also be used as a post treatment technology to remove micropollutants from effluent wastewater falås et al 2013 hapeshi et al 2013 tang et al 2021 falås et al 2012 compared the ability of activated sludge and mbbr to remove 70 pharmaceuticals from wastewater and found that treatment with mbbrs resulted in higher removal than in cas for almost all the pharmaceuticals however to our knowledge there is currently no data available on the removal of sartan compounds in mbbrs and generation of their metabolites in biofilms ooi et al 2018 tang et al 2017 2021 and liang et al 2019 have shown that the operation of mbbrs with various feeding modes can lead to significantly different removal of micropollutants casas et al 2015 investigated the application of a three stage mbbr unit to treat wastewater and found that the last stage reactor fed with the lowest level of nutrients had the lowest removal for most micropollutants it is generally assumed that in municipal wastewater treatment co metabolism or fortuituous degradation and not catabolism was the main reaction mechanism for most micropollutants that is the predominant energy and nutrient source for microbial growth and enzymes production in the system is the bod nitrogen and other nutrients and not the micropollutants fischer mjewsky 2014 alexander 1981 thus it is not surprising that bod loading has an effect on the degradation of the micropollutants for removing micropollutants with biofilms it has also been shown that adaptation liang et al 2021 and 2022 redox and film thickness is relevant torresi et al 2017a b however to the best knowledge of the authors there are no studies on metabolization pathways and transformation products mass balances including the metabolism of sartans in biofilm systems and reports on conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment are focusing on occurrence of selected known metabolites sabater liesa et al 2021 ladhari et al 2021 nödler et al 2013 letzel et al 2015 hillebrand et al 2013 or sono chemical reactions arvaniti et al 2020 diehle et al 2019 carpinteiro et al 2019 knaur dulova 2020 compare table 2 therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to identify metabolites of sartan blood pressure regulators in biofilm systems for the first time 2 conduct mass balance studies on sartans in biofilm systems including all possible metabolites for the first time 3 use the gained data to increase the understanding on sartans in full scale conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment with all possible metabolites for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals losartan 95 valsartan 98 and irbesartan 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich and their molecular structures and main physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 the isotopic labeled compounds losartan d4 and citalopram d6 were obtained from toronto research chemicals trc and santa cruz biotechnology respectively and used as internal standards valsartan acid 98 and losartan carboxylic acid 97 were also purchased from trc and applied as reference standards to verify the proposed tps structures formic acid from sigma aldrich and lc ms grade water and methanol supplied by merck were used to prepare hplc ms ms mobile phase premixed lc ms grade 0 1 formic acid in water and in methanol riedel de haën honeywell were purchased from thermo fisher scientific as hplc qtof mobile phase 2 2 mbbr 2 2 1 adaptation of biofilms in mbbrs the biofilms were grown on plastic carriers z 400 anoxkaldnes lund sweden in 1 liter mbbrs 150 carriers per reactor and adapted for two months under different feeding modes the mbbrs were operated under aeration conditions in the dark at 20 with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 hours four feeding modes of mbbrs were studied 1 feeding only with wwtp effluent 2 continuously feeding a mixture of 33 3 raw wastewater and 66 7 effluent 3 intermittently feeding raw wastewater for 4 days and effluent for 8 days 4 intermittently feeding raw wastewater for 2 days and effluent for 4 days overall in the last three feeding modes the ratios of raw wastewater to effluent were all kept at 1 to 2 only the feeding frequencies were different the raw wastewater and effluent used here were obtained from avedøre wwtp 400 000 population equivalent pe in copenhagen denmark transported to the lab immediately stored at 4 and pumped into the reactors by 4 channel programmed pumps reglo icc ismatec wertheim germany 2 2 2 batch incubation experiments in mbbr 2 2 2 1 kinetics experiments after a two month adaptation period the biofilm covered carriers from four different feeding modes reactors were transferred to 100 ml flasks 12 carriers per flask spiked with sartan compounds to conduct batch incubation experiments in triplicates in effluent water to study the degradation kinetics of sartans in detail a methanol stock solution containing losartan valsartan and irbesartan was spiked into the flasks and the solvent was evaporated overnight to eliminate the possible effects of methanol on microorganisms successively 80 ml effluent water was added to each flask and shaken for two hours to dissolve sartans 10 µg l for each compound finally the incubation was started by adding the pre incubated carriers to the flasks during the whole period the flasks were operated in the dark at 20 aerated with an airflow of 0 25 l min and shaken at 120 rpm water samples were taken over a period of 400 hours to analyze the degradation of sartans and the formation of tps over time 2 2 2 2 transformation product tp identification experiments opposite to the kinetic experiments the tp identification experiments were conducted with 1 carriers adapted to pure effluent 2 tap water instead of effluent water during the incubation as tap water is producing less chemical background in the hplc ms high concentrations 1 mg l losartan valsartan and irbesartan were used to ensure no minor pathway remained undetected which was feasible as blood pressure regulators are not expected to have dedicated effects on the microbial biomass the parent compounds were spiked to separate incubation flasks in addition a control experiment under the same conditions spiked with sartans to tap water but without adding carriers or other biomass to the flasks was conducted to investigate whether abiotic processes such as sorption hydrolysis and photodegradation took place and whether abiotic tps were produced the differences in the starting concentrations were below 7 thus sorption could be excluded the other processes are discussed in the results part another control experiment in which the carriers were added to tap water but no sartans were spiked was used as a background to ensure that the potential tps detected were indeed originating from the degradation of the parent compounds and not from any other constituent of the system thus the differences of chromatographic peaks between the samples from the sartan incubations and the two control experiments verified the origin of these biotransformation products 2 3 experiments in a full scale wastewater treatment plant the experiments were conducted at the wwtp of avedøre copenhagen denmark operating a 400 000 pe cas plant with nitrification denitrification and biological as well as chemical phosphate removal samples on the cas were taken as 24 h flow proportional samples on three consecutive days both in the inflow and downstream of the secondary clarifier additionally two approximately 1 m3 large pilots were installed at this treatment plant to further polish the effluent water of the wwtp from pharmaceuticals a membrane bioreactor mbr using a ceramic microfiltration membrane followed by a forward osmosis fo set up for details see li et al 2022 and li et al 2021 the mbr was fed by cas effluent while the fo was operated downstream of the mbr the effluents and influent of the pilots were sampled by grab sampling removal r in all steps was calculated following eq 1 1 r c in c out c in 100 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 identification of unknown transformation products identification of the tps resulting from sartan degradation in mbbrs was conducted on a high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an api 6600 quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer with high resolution hplc qtof absciex framingham ma usa 10 µl samples were injected into the hplc qtof using an acquity uplc beh shield rp18 column 2 1 30 mm particle size 1 7 μm waters taastrup denmark thermostated at 30 c for chromatographic separation the mobile phase was methanol and water both containing 0 1 formic acid and the detailed gradient elution is illustrated in table s3 in the supporting information the qtof mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization source esi operated in positive ionization mode with 500 c heater gas temperature and 5300 v capillary voltage information dependent acquisition ida method was employed to detect samples on the hplc qtof one ida cycle contained a tof ms scan mass scan range from 100 to 1000 da accumulation time 0 25 s and a product ion scan fragmenting the 10 highest peaks with intensity higher than 100 cps mass scan range from 25 to 1000 da accumulation time of 0 04 s per ion and collision energy 30 ev with a spread of 15 ev after each product ion scan the further triggering of fragmentation of the same parent mass was suppressed for 3 seconds the qtof instrument was operated with a resolution fwhm of 41265 at m z 829 analyst 1 7 software absciex frammingham ma usa was used for data acquisition and primary data processing sciex os software absciex frammingham ma usa was used to analyse the data including chromatographic and spectral analysis in this paper the identification of metabolites included 1 comparison of chromatographic properties and mass spectral data to authentic synthetized standards 2 interpretation of found mass signals and isotope profiles of the ms spectra were consistent with expected biochemical reactions 3 the use of criteria that the detected signals increased over incubation time meaning the peaks at the start were either a no peak in the initial sample 0 h or b the peak in later samples is significantly higher than those obtained from the sample taken at 0 h and does not occur in the control samples 4 the usage of proposed structures agreeing to the obtained product ion spectra rationality of the fragments comparison of the fragments between the parent compounds and the tentative tps comparison of the fragments with the information in databases or literatures additionally the metabolitepilottm software absciex usa was employed as a supplement to further determine tps the principle was to subtract the data from the first sample 0h of the incubationfrom those of an incubated sample providing a list containing all the potential generated peaks with accurate m z under the internal algorithm to predict and give possible molecular formulas and structures pähler and brink 2013 qian et al 2012 because metabolitepilottm only compares two specific samples without kinetic information which might provide false results it was used as a reference for manual analysis on sciex os 2 4 2 quantitative detection of known compounds quantitative detection of three parent compounds losartan valsartan and irbesartan and two transformation products that were available as authentic reference standards valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid was performed on a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms with an ultimate 3000 hplc system dionex cal usa connecting to an api 4000 triple quadrupole system absciex framingham ma usa after spiking with an internal standard solution containing losartan d4 and citalopram d6 the samples were homogenized 100 μl aliquots were injected into the synergi polar rp column 150 2 mm particle size 4 μm phenomenex cal usa thermostated at 30 c the mobile phase was methanol and water both

at 400 c with a capillary voltage of 5500 v the details regarding precursor ions product ions other hplc ms ms parameters and the corresponding detection limits of these compounds are shown in table s2 in the supporting information losartan and irbesartan were quantified using losartan d4 as an internal standard whereas eprosartan and olmesartan were quantified using citalopram d6 2 5 sampling for effluent monitoring in different countries effluent of 82 cas wwtps from 8 countries in the baltic sea region 5 from germany 34 from denmark 8 from sweden 11 from finland 6 from estonia 6 from latvia 2 from lithuania and 10 from poland was sampled in a 500 ml glass bottles as 24 h flow controlled composite samples by operators of the respective utilities in june july 2021 and shipped by express courier service the received samples were kept at 20 c for approximately two months thawed and centrifuged to remove particulate matter mixed with internal standards and measured by directly injecting 70 µl into the hplc ms ms 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring of sartans in 80 wwtps in the baltic sea region to obtain a clearer idea on the relevance of sartans in the baltic sea region we analysed these compounds in the framework of an ongoing project sartan concentrations in the effluent wastewater are shown in fig 1 the measured sartan concentrations varied considerably from country to country but were generally consistent within each country resulting in country specific patterns fig 1 our results show that in all 8 countries at least one sartan is used heavily as the different sartans have different physiological properties and pharmaceutical efficiency we will only compare the wwtp effluent concentration pattern in this article while in germany mostly irbesartan 0 2 0 8 µg l valsartan 0 2 1 4 µg l and olmesartan 0 5 1 2 µg l are relevant in denmark losartan 0 3 6 9 µg l dominates in estonia mostly olmesartan 0 5 4 3 µg l in the wastewater is in the wastewater while in finland losartan 0 2 2 3 µg l and valsartan 0 2 7 µg l are used predominantly in lithuania the emissions are dominated by valsartan 0 7 1 3 µg l and olmesartan 0 2 0 5 µg l while in latvia the emissions are almost completely due to olmesartan 0 4 2 0 µg l in poland the emissions are mostly due to valsartan 0 4 4 3 µg l while in sweden valsartan 0 2 1 3 µg l losartan 0 3 2 3 µg l and irbesartan 0 06 0 2 µg l are found in some samples the concentrations exceed 6 µg l losartan in denmark and valsartan in finland in comparison to the concentrations of other pharmaceuticals in wwtp effluents that rarely exceed 1 µg l kisielius et al 2023 the concentrations of sartans are high 3 2 identification of transformation products in model experiments at high concentrations mg l losartan valsartan and irbesartan were degraded only in the mbbr samples but not in control samples sartans in tap water with no biofilms fig s1 supporting information the identified tps were only formed in the mbbr but not in the control tps of losartan valsartan and irbesartan in mbbr were identified by hplc qtof the identification of microbial tps of these three sartans resulted in suggestions on structures of transformation products for some of these authentic standards were available while for others this was not the case the mass spectrometric characterization of the respective compounds is shown in table 2 3 2 1 losartan fig 2 illustrates an example of the unequivocal identification of a tp losartan tp437 by comparing its data to those of the authentic standard losartan carboxylic acid the extracted ion chromatogram eic tof ms spectrum and tof ms2 fragments of losartan carboxylic acid are shown in fig 2a while the same data of the proposed losartan tp437 are shown in fig 2b the retention time exact mass error 10ppm isotopic pattern indicating towards twenty two carbon one chlorine and fragment ions 178 180 207 235 m z of this detected tp all matched the information of the reference standard in addition fig 2 b1 shows the chromatographic peak of losartan tp437 increased with the degradation of the parent compound losartan from 0 to 434 hours kinetics details in fig 5 there was no signal for this tp at incubation time 0 therefore losartan tp437 was identified as losartan carboxylic acid fig 3 b shows an example of characterizing losartan tp393 without an authentic standard in comparison to the parent losartan fig 3a the chromatographic peak of the parent compound losartan decreased from 0 to 434 hours the tof ms spectrum and the tof ms2 fragments of losartan at 0 hours are provided in fig 3 a the retention time of the parent losartan was 7 8 min and the tof spectrum shows the exact mass of losartan as well as the isotopic peaks containing 13c and 37cl elements in accordance with the theoretical abundance calculation eight main tof ms2 fragments were detected and the proposed structures of each fragment ion are illustrated in fig 3 a while the elemental composition data are shown in table 2 while the parent compound was degraded peak size decreased the suspected tp losartan tp393 was formed peak increased from 0 to 434 hours and the chromatographic and spectral data of losartan tp393 at 434 hours are shown in fig 3b the retention time of losartan tp393 of 8 3 min was higher than that of losartan in the hplc separation this agrees with the suggested structure losartan minus one ch2oh group which makes this tp less hydrophilic than the parent compound losartan the isotopic pattern in the tof ms spectrum agreed with the proposed formula the tof ms2 spectrum showed six main fragments marked with the tentative structures and the calculated mass errors fig 3b three of which 171 207 235 m z were also fragments of the parent compound losartan overall the combination of chromatographic data accurate spectral data obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry and tof ms2 fragments comparable to those of the parent compound all supported the proposed structure of losartan tp393 as des methylhydroxy losartan according to the same identification methods four more tps of losartan were proposed thus a total of six tps of losartan with tentative structures were identified fig 4 a two of these losartan tp267 and losartan tp437 were confirmed by authentic standards as valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid table 2 in comparison the degradation products and pathways were modelled by envipath envipath predicted only losartan carboxylic acid four tps of valsartan and four tps of irbesartan were also identified table 2 and fig 4b and c the detailed analysis processes with chromatographic and spectral data are shown in figs s2 s15 in the supporting information table 2 summarizes the retention times precursor ions fragment ions proposed formulas and mass errors of these three sartan compounds and all their identified tps and also contains information about whether a tp s identification was confirmed by an authentic standard whether a tp was reported and supported by literature comparable spectral data with at least one identical fragment and whether a tp was identified for the first time in this paper valsartan acid has previously been reported to be a biological transformation product of losartan in water environments hillebrand et al 2013 kaur and dulova 2020 losartan carboxylic acid as the main metabolite of losartan has been frequently detected in aquatic systems dubey and ghosh 2015 van nuijs et al 2015 losartan tp335 seemed to correspond to a proposed tp of losartan previously reported in sonochemistry and photooxidation processes as there were three fragments 101 180 207 m z detected in this paper consistent with their reports but our study is the first one identifying losartan tp335 as a microbial tp of losartan in mbbr systems ladhari et al 2021 serna galvis et al 2019 moreover to the best of our knowledge losartan tp453 losartan tp403 and losartan tp393 have not been reported in the literature before as tps of losartan marked in table 2 among them losartan tp453 and losartan tp403 had chromatographic and spectral evidence to support the proposed structures but some functional groups could not be exactly be located in the molecule figs 4 and s4 s5 supporting information losartan tp453 had one hydroxyl group added to the tetrazole biphenyl structure in comparison to losartan and a carbonyl group added to the peripherical structure imidazole ring butyl chain or hydroxymethyl fig supporting information table 2 summarizes that the eic peaks of losartan tp453 appeared at two retention times of 7 954 min and 7 582 min indicating this compound has isomers however the chromatographic peak at 7 582 min provided poor tof ms data therefore only the result of losartan tp543 at 7 954 min is discussed in this paper losartan tp403 is formed by loss of chlorine from the parent compound losartan and an added carbonyl group to the imidazole butyl or hydroxymethyl group but the specific reactive site remains unknown fig s5 supporting information fig 4 a demonstrates an overview of the suggested structures and transformation processes from losartan to its different tps from losartan tp453 can result through oxidation and hydroxylation reactions after oxidation and dechlorination losartan can form losartan tp403 the formation of losartan tp393 is due to dehydroxylation and demethylation on the imidazole ring of losartan losartan tp437 losartan carboxylic acid resulted from an oxidation reaction forming a carboxyl group the processes to generate losartan tp335 and tp267 were probably sequential reactions first through ring cleavage and n dealkylation losartan produced losartan tp335 ladhari et al 2021 serna galvis et al 2019 losartan tp335 can transfer to an intermediate product dealkylated valsartan by changing nh to o on the amylamine chain a process previously demonstrated on losartan but this intermediate product might be unstable so we did not detect it here serna galvis et al 2019 however this intermediate product has been widely reported to be active and could further transfer to losartan tp267 valsartan acid by n dealkylation and oxidation reactions helbling et al 2010 ladhari et al 2021 nödler et al 2013 after identifying the tps of the three sartans their degradation and formation kinetics as well as their mass balances were investigated fig 5 a demonstrates the degradation of losartan and the formation of two of its tps losartan carboxylic acid and valsartan acid whose concentrations were quantified according to the authentic standards it can be seen that losartan degraded from 1 mg l to 253 µg l in 434 hours while the concentration of losartan carboxylic acid increased from 0 to 611 µg l and valsartan acid was formed with concentrations reaching 5 2 µg l in 41 hours and then degraded again to reaching concentrations of 1 5 µg l at 434 hours fig 5b shows the mass balance among these three compounds in the laboratory mbbr incubations normalized to the initially spiked molar concentration of losartan it can be seen that the concentration of losartan decreased with time while the molar fractions of losartan carboxylic acid and valsartan acid increased fig 5b in this experiment losartan carboxylic acid is the main tp of losartan as the loss of losartan results in the generation of losartan carboxylic acid and the sum of molar fraction of losartan and losartan carboxylic acid was always higher than 84 fig 5b the missing 15 are most probably due to not quantified metabolites during our identification study see above four more tps i e losartan tp335 losartan tp453 losartan tp403 and losartan tp393 were characterized but without authentic standards the formation of these four tps can only be demonstrated via the development of the respective peak areas and the result is shown in fig 6 a it is worth noting that the initial peak area of losartan tp335 was not 0 but around 10000 for the first 165 hours and then increasing to 41500 in 434 hours therefore this tp might be an impurity in the production process of losartan and the peak of losartan tp335 was also found in the test of directly spiking sartans into deionized di water which confirmed this hypothesis fig s16 supporting information however it was also formed in the biofilm incubation as indicated by increase of peak size by a factor of 4 during the incubation losartan tp453 losartan tp403 and losartan tp393 developed from zero signal to 10 000 15 000 and 20 000 peak area in 434 h losartan carboxylic acid is the main metabolite in the biofilm systems in our study this compound is also the main human metabolite of losartan and is widely detected in human plasma urine and sewage systems assress et al 2019 gracia lor et al 2014 hernández et al 2015 karra et al 2012 3 2 2 valsartan four tps of valsartan were identified the structure of valsartan tp267 was confirmed by an authentic standard to be valsartan acid fig s6 supporting information the plausible structures of valsartan tp336 valsartan tp452 and valsartan tp424 were proposed based on their spectral data fragment ions and chromatographic information figs s8 10 supporting information among them one tp i e valsartan tp452 originated from the parent by adding a hydroxyl group to the structure of tetrazole biphenyl but the exact isomer is still unknown the eic of valsartan tp452 showed three peaks at retention times of 7 675 min 8 160 min and 8 311 min possible isomers marked in table 2 but only the peak at 8 160 min provided sufficient spectral and fragmentation data to interpret the structure and was shown in this paper a similar hydroxylation reaction on valsartan to produce hydroxylated tp has been seen in previous studies arvaniti et al 2020 diehle et al 2019 serna galvis et al 2019 the reaction of valsartan to valsartan tp336 n dealkylation and then to valsartan tp267 hydrolysis and oxidation is suggested in fig 4b and has also been previously reported helbling et al 2010 ladhari et al 2021 letzel et al 2015 valsartan tp424 was identified as a suspected tp of valsartan and was reported the first time in this paper valsartan tp424 was formed by oxidizing the isopropyl and cleaving the tetrazole ring on valsartan fig 4 b the process of tetrazole group opening on sartans and other compounds has been demonstrated in previous studies gurkan et al 2012 serna galvis et al 2019 valsartan degraded from 1 mg l to 441 µg l in 603 hours while valsartan acid valsartan tp267 was formed and concentration developed from 0 to 271 µg l fig 5c valsartan acid was detected to be the main tp of valsartan since the mass balance result indicated that the sum of the molar fractions of these two compounds was above 80 during the whole process fig 5d in the literature is described that valsartan acid is not a human metabolite of sartan compounds but it is the main microbial transformation product of valsartan and wwtps are the major source of valsartan acid in the water environment helbling et al 2010 letzel et al 2015 nödler et al 2013 semi quantitative data for the other valsartan transformation products is shown in fig 6 in comparison envipath revealed only one tp resulting from the break of the amide function hydrolysis with successive release of the pentanoic acid pentanoic acid would have escaped the identification but the other predicted hydrolysis product was not found in our experiment 3 2 3 irbesartan four tps of irbesartan were identified the structure of irbesartan tp267 was confirmed by a reference standard to be valsartan acid fig s11 supporting information without standards the structures of the remaining three tps irbesartan tp335 irbesartan tp443 irbesartan tp447 were proposed fig 4c and figs s13 s15 si by oxidation irbesartan tp443 added a carbonyl group to the imidazolone or butyl structure of irbesartan the exact position of which was unknown fig 4c oxidation and carbonylation of irbesartan have been observed in both biotransformation and free chlorine reactions boix et al 2016 carpinteiro et al 2019 ladhari et al 2021 letzel et al 2015 irbesartan tp447 was obtained after hydrolysis and opening of the imidazolone ring on irbesartan fig 4c and this compound has also been reported to be formed in photodegradation and free chlorine processes carpinteiro et al 2019 ladhari et al 2021 several studies have shown that irbesartan could transfer to irbesartan 267 valsartan acid in wastewater but the transformation processes were not clarified letzel et al 2015 nödler et al 2013 in our study irbesartan tp335 was identified for the first time as a suspected tp of irbesartan and irbesartan tp335 is identical to losartan tp335 identical chromatographic spectral and fragment data figs s3 s15 si therefore we assumed that the process to generate valsartan acid from irbesartan was similar to the process on losartan section 3 1 1 e g through a sequential reaction from irbesartan to irbesartan tp335 then to valsartan acid including dealkylation oxidation hydrolysis etc irbesartan concentrations decreased from 1 to 0 048 mg l while the concentration of valsartan acid increased from 0 to 0 013 mg l in 357 hours fig 5e however the mass balance shows the degraded fraction of irbesartan can not be explained by the formation of valsartan acid or any other quantifiable metabolite fig 5f it means valsartan acid was not the main microbial tp of irbesartan in this experiment however the formation of the suggested metabolites for which no authentic standards were available was detected by following the development of the respective peak areas over time as shown in fig 6c in parallel to the degradation of the parent compound irbesartan irbesartan tp443 peak area from 0 to 20 000 tp335 peak area from 0 to 10 000 and tp447 peakarea from 1 000 000 to 2 500 000 formed development of peak areas in brackets fig 6 the peak area of irbesartan tp447 was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of other tps thus irbesartan tp447 was probably the main tp of irbesartan irbesartan tp447 has already been reported as a tp in different reactions including microbial process photodegradation and free chlorine reaction as a major tp of irbesartan carpinteiro et al 2019 ladhari et al 2021 letzel et al 2015 fig 6c also demonstrates the initial peak area of irbesartan tp447 was not zero and previous studies have showed this compound to be an impurity of irbesartan carpinteiro et al 2019 fig s16 supporting information thus irbesartan tp447 was probably an impurity of irbesartan while it also was formed from this parent by hydrolysis and dehydration fig 4c it is worth noting that losartan and irbesartan shared a common tp losartan irbesartan tp335 but this compound was only present in losartan but not in irbesartan samples at 0 hours indicating that it might only be an impurity of losartan while it is truly formed by microbial degradation from irbesartan fig 6 for irbesartan envipath did not produce results in an overnight run the effects of substrate loading on sartan metabolisation in mbbrs is shown in text si 1 3 3 removal in a conventional sludge wastewater treatment plant in the conventional activated sludge treatment plant cas of wwtp avedøre copenhagen denmark the three sartans losartan valsartan and irbesartan and their eleven identified tps were investigated in raw wastewater and secondary effluent water three sartans and five of their tps valsartan acid losartan carboxylic acid losartan irbesartan tp335 losartan tp453 and irbesartan tp447 were detected in both the raw wastewater and the effluent fig 7 table 3 indicating towards that these compounds are also products of human metabolism the concentrations of losartan valsartan irbesartan valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid were considerable i e 0 1 4 3 µg l in raw wastewater and 0 19 2 27 µg l in effluent wastewater table 3 for those tps for which no authentical standards were available only peak areas in raw wastewater and effluent water are shown in table 3 nonetheless the relative removal of the compounds can be calculated by substituting the concentrations by the respective peak areas in eq 1 fig 7 the removal of losartan valsartan and irbesartan in the cas were 52 72 and 3 respectively two tps originating from human metabolism were also removed in the cas wwtp tp447 of irbesartan with 64 and of tp335 of losartan irbesartan with 23 fig 7 on the other hand formation of four tps was registered in the cas tp267 valsartan acid 144 tp437 losartan carboxylic acid 55 tp453 101 from losartan fig s18 demonstrates the mass balance of sartans and their tps between the influent and effluent of the wwtp the molar concentration of each compound was normalized to the sum of the molar concentrations of all these compounds detected in the raw wastewater to obtain the molar ratio the molar fractions of losartan valsartan irbesartan valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid in the raw wastewater were 62 5 8 4 3 1 6 and 25 of the total inflow and 30 1 7 4 2 5 1 and 39 respectively in the effluent it is worth noting that opposite to the balancing experiment in the full scale plant the balancing in the lab systems was complete even though the three parent compounds losartan valsartan irbesartan were all removed in the wwtp to some extent valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid were formed especially losartan carboxylic acid was detected up to 2 8 µg l in the effluent water which was also previously detected in an effluent wastewater in spain at 1 56 µg l and 0 116 µg l in a surface water gracia lor et al 2014 the result indicates the necessity to include the sartans tps into the monitoring program in the aquatic environment in order to have a more comprehensive insight into their environmental impact however several other tps losartan tp 403 393 valsartan tp 336 452 424 and irbesartan tp 443 that were identified in the lab with incubations of high concentrations with biofilms were not detected in the cas wwtp whether this is due to sludge microbial communities having less metabolic pathways eventually only in this wwtp or whether this was due to the about 20 times lower starting concentrations and thus the metabolite concentrations were below limit of detection in the full scale wwtp is not 100 known at this point to test whether advanced approaches can remove the sartans better than the cas their fate in an mbr and fo polishing step was tested figs s17 si the mbr was able to remove small amounts of losartan valsartan and irbesartan 6 7 12 9 and 21 3 respectively while generating valsartan acid losartan carboxylic acid and tp453 additionally the mbr was also able to remove small fractions of tps 335 443 and 447 forward osmosis was able to remove all remaining residues of both sartan parents and sartan transformation products fig s17 4 conclusions concentrations of sartans in cas wwtp effluents can reach close to 6 µg l the patterns in different studied european countries were different but the mean total sartan concentrations in all countries were close to or exceeded 1 µg l biological systems like cas mbbrs and mbr are able to remove and metabolize sartan compounds to some extent however considerable concentrations remain in the effluent waters valsartan can be removed efficiently by predominantly but not exclusively forming valsartan acid losartan is removed by 52 in the cas while about half of which is transformed into losartan carboxylic acid which is thus reaching relatively high concentrations 2 8 µg l in the small laboratory mbbrs the same predominant metabolite is formed besides a lot of other metabolites that are formed at lower rates irbesartan is removed by 3 in the cas with several metabolites being identified the main metabolite being tp 443 while in the mbbr 90 removal is achieved in 70 h a small fraction is transformed into valsartan acid as well as three other metabolites the main metabolite also being irbesartan tp 447 whether or not these metabolites are of toxicological relevance is beyond the knowledge of the authors and needs further studies however as the determined sartan and sartan tp concentrations are relatively high they should be considered in future assessments credit author statement rui li planned and conducted the experiment did the data treatment and provided the first draft of the manuscript chuanzhou liang and

15188,sartans are a group of pharmaceuticals widely used to regulate blood pressure their concentration levels were monitored in 80 wastewater treatment plants wwtp in the baltic sea region reached from limit of detection up to 6 µg l the concentrations were significantly different in different countries but consistent within the respective country the degradation of sartans losartan valsartan irbesartan in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs that utilize biofilms grown on mobile carriers to treat wastewater was investigated for the first time and compared with the degradation in a conventional activated sludge cas treatment plant the results showed the formation of six microbial transformation products tps of losartan four of valsartan and four of irbesartan in biological wastewater treatment four of these metabolites have not been described in the literature before chemical structures were suggested and selected tps were verified and quantified depending on availability of true standards valsartan acid was a common tp of losartan valsartan and irbesartan losartan and irbesartan also shared one tp losartan irbesartan tp335 based on the mass balance analysis losartan carboxylic acid is the main tp of losartan and valsartan acid is the main tp of valsartan during the biotransformation process for irbesartan tp447 is likely to be the main tp as its peak areas were two orders of magnitude higher than those of all the other detected tps of this compound the effects of adapting biofilms to different biological oxygen demand bod loading on the degradation of sartans as well as the formation of their tps were investigated compared to feeding a poor substrate pure effluent wastewater from a cas feeding with richer substrate 1 3 raw and 2 3 effluent wastewater promoted the metabolism of most compounds co metabolization however the addition of raw wastewater inhibited some metabolic pathways of other compounds such as from losartan irbesartan to tp335 competitive inhibition the formation of irbesartan tp447 did not change with or without raw wastewater finally the sartans and their tps were investigated in a full scale cas wastewater treatment plant wwtp the removal of losartan valsartan and irbesartan ranged from 3 0 to 72 and some of the transformation products tps from human metabolism were also removed in the wwtp however some of the sartan tps i e valsartan acid losartan carboxylic acid irbesartan tp443 and losartan tp453 were formed in the wwtp relative high amounts of especially losartan carboxylic acid which was detected with concentrations up to 2 27 µg l were found in the effluent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords angiotensin ii receptor blocker moving bed biofilm reactor

used to treat high blood pressure i e hypertension angiotensin ii receptor antagonists boix et al 2016 letzel et al 2015 serna galvis et al 2019 with the aging of societies the use of sartans has increased during the last few decades arvaniti et al 2020 carpinteiro et al 2019 in germany the annual prescriptions of sartans nearly tripled from 7 108 to 2 109 defined daily doses ddds from 2002 to 2011 diehle et al 2019 nödler et al 2013 losartan was the first sartan drug launched on the market in 1995 and it is still widely used today ladhari et al 2021 nödler et al 2013 valsartan and irbesartan are also extensively prescribed and were among the top ten best selling pharmaceuticals in france belgium portugal and greece in 2018 ladhari et al 2021 therefore losartan valsartan and irbesartan were selected as representatives of sartan compounds being studied here see structures in table 1 like most sartans losartan valsartan and irbesartan all share a basic core of a tetrazole bonded to a biphenyl while the losartan molecule contains a chlorine atom hydroxymethyl and butyl groups linked to an imidazole ring valsartan has a carboxyl and an isopropyl group linked to a pentanamide moiety and irbesartan has a butyl chain and a butyl ring connected to an imidazolone structure table 1 losartan irbesartan and valsartan were constantly detected in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent monitored in denmark in concentration ranges reaching up to 694 575 and 224 ng l respectively kisielius et al 2023 in wwtp effluent in sweden 450 ng l of irbesartan was detected bayer et al 2014 due to the extensive use and incomplete removal by wwtps sartans have also been discussed as emerging micropollutants in different aquatic environments kaushik et al 2016 nödler et al 2010 reh et al 2013 losartan has been found at a concentration of 620 ng l in a river in spain and 45 ng l in a bay in the united states fent et al 2006 gracia lor et al 2012 valsartan concentrations of 46 ng l were detected in surface water in switzerland and it reached 1300 ng l in a river in spain gracia lor et al 2012 klosterhaus et al 2013 up to 830 ng l was detected in a spanish river bayer et al 2014 huerta fontela et al 2011 however the number of studies on the occurrence and fate of sartans in aquatic environments and wastewater treatment are still limited nödler et al 2013 and mass balance studies in wastewater treatment for sartan compounds are missing in the literature in wwtps most micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals x ray contrast media industrial chemicals etc are unlikely to be completely mineralized but will form transformation products tps huntscha et al 2014 knopp et al 2016 lee and von gunten 2016 compared to their parent compounds the tps of organic micropollutants in general can be more persistent and mobile than their parent compounds and some can be even more toxic arvaniti et al 2020 helbling et al 2010 kosjek et al 2009 therefore identifying and quantifying the tps originating from organic micropollutants in biological processes is critical for assessing their overall impact on the water environments as shown by boix et al 2016 and helbling et al 2010 the only sartan metabolite for which some environmental data is available is valsartan acid it is often found in the effluents of wwtps surface waters up to 2100 ng l as well as in drinking water 72 ng l nödler et al 2016 2013 sperlich et al 2017 berkner and thierbach 2014 otherwise there is no no consolidated data on identification of metabolites mass balances or formation kinetics on metabolisation of sartans in wastewater treatment while wastewater is predominantly treated by activated sludge reactors also biofilm based processes can be used moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr technology uses biofilms grown on movable carriers in reactors to treat wastewater ødegaard 2006 torresi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 mbbrs have been proven a promising alternative to conventional activated sludge cas reactors to remove organic matter and nitrogen from wastewater more efficiently and it can also be used as a post treatment technology to remove micropollutants from effluent wastewater falås et al 2013 hapeshi et al 2013 tang et al 2021 falås et al 2012 compared the ability of activated sludge and mbbr to remove 70 pharmaceuticals from wastewater and found that treatment with mbbrs resulted in higher removal than in cas for almost all the pharmaceuticals however to our knowledge there is currently no data available on the removal of sartan compounds in mbbrs and generation of their metabolites in biofilms ooi et al 2018 tang et al 2017 2021 and liang et al 2019 have shown that the operation of mbbrs with various feeding modes can lead to significantly different removal of micropollutants casas et al 2015 investigated the application of a three stage mbbr unit to treat wastewater and found that the last stage reactor fed with the lowest level of nutrients had the lowest removal for most micropollutants it is generally assumed that in municipal wastewater treatment co metabolism or fortuituous degradation and not catabolism was the main reaction mechanism for most micropollutants that is the predominant energy and nutrient source for microbial growth and enzymes production in the system is the bod nitrogen and other nutrients and not the micropollutants fischer mjewsky 2014 alexander 1981 thus it is not surprising that bod loading has an effect on the degradation of the micropollutants for removing micropollutants with biofilms it has also been shown that adaptation liang et al 2021 and 2022 redox and film thickness is relevant torresi et al 2017a b however to the best knowledge of the authors there are no studies on metabolization pathways and transformation products mass balances including the metabolism of sartans in biofilm systems and reports on conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment are focusing on occurrence of selected known metabolites sabater liesa et al 2021 ladhari et al 2021 nödler et al 2013 letzel et al 2015 hillebrand et al 2013 or sono chemical reactions arvaniti et al 2020 diehle et al 2019 carpinteiro et al 2019 knaur dulova 2020 compare table 2 therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to identify metabolites of sartan blood pressure regulators in biofilm systems for the first time 2 conduct mass balance studies on sartans in biofilm systems including all possible metabolites for the first time 3 use the gained data to increase the understanding on sartans in full scale conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment with all possible metabolites for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals losartan 95 valsartan 98 and irbesartan 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich and their molecular structures and main physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 the isotopic labeled compounds losartan d4 and citalopram d6 were obtained from toronto research chemicals trc and santa cruz biotechnology respectively and used as internal standards valsartan acid 98 and losartan carboxylic acid 97 were also purchased from trc and applied as reference standards to verify the proposed tps structures formic acid from sigma aldrich and lc ms grade water and methanol supplied by merck were used to prepare hplc ms ms mobile phase premixed lc ms grade 0 1 formic acid in water and in methanol riedel de haën honeywell were purchased from thermo fisher scientific as hplc qtof mobile phase 2 2 mbbr 2 2 1 adaptation of biofilms in mbbrs the biofilms were grown on plastic carriers z 400 anoxkaldnes lund sweden in 1 liter mbbrs 150 carriers per reactor and adapted for two months under different feeding modes the mbbrs were operated under aeration conditions in the dark at 20 with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 hours four feeding modes of mbbrs were studied 1 feeding only with wwtp effluent 2 continuously feeding a mixture of 33 3 raw wastewater and 66 7 effluent 3 intermittently feeding raw wastewater for 4 days and effluent for 8 days 4 intermittently feeding raw wastewater for 2 days and effluent for 4 days overall in the last three feeding modes the ratios of raw wastewater to effluent were all kept at 1 to 2 only the feeding frequencies were different the raw wastewater and effluent used here were obtained from avedøre wwtp 400 000 population equivalent pe in copenhagen denmark transported to the lab immediately stored at 4 and pumped into the reactors by 4 channel programmed pumps reglo icc ismatec wertheim germany 2 2 2 batch incubation experiments in mbbr 2 2 2 1 kinetics experiments after a two month adaptation period the biofilm covered carriers from four different feeding modes reactors were transferred to 100 ml flasks 12 carriers per flask spiked with sartan compounds to conduct batch incubation experiments in triplicates in effluent water to study the degradation kinetics of sartans in detail a methanol stock solution containing losartan valsartan and irbesartan was spiked into the flasks and the solvent was evaporated overnight to eliminate the possible effects of methanol on microorganisms successively 80 ml effluent water was added to each flask and shaken for two hours to dissolve sartans 10 µg l for each compound finally the incubation was started by adding the pre incubated carriers to the flasks during the whole period the flasks were operated in the dark at 20 aerated with an airflow of 0 25 l min and shaken at 120 rpm water samples were taken over a period of 400 hours to analyze the degradation of sartans and the formation of tps over time 2 2 2 2 transformation product tp identification experiments opposite to the kinetic experiments the tp identification experiments were conducted with 1 carriers adapted to pure effluent 2 tap water instead of effluent water during the incubation as tap water is producing less chemical background in the hplc ms high concentrations 1 mg l losartan valsartan and irbesartan were used to ensure no minor pathway remained undetected which was feasible as blood pressure regulators are not expected to have dedicated effects on the microbial biomass the parent compounds were spiked to separate incubation flasks in addition a control experiment under the same conditions spiked with sartans to tap water but without adding carriers or other biomass to the flasks was conducted to investigate whether abiotic processes such as sorption hydrolysis and photodegradation took place and whether abiotic tps were produced the differences in the starting concentrations were below 7 thus sorption could be excluded the other processes are discussed in the results part another control experiment in which the carriers were added to tap water but no sartans were spiked was used as a background to ensure that the potential tps detected were indeed originating from the degradation of the parent compounds and not from any other constituent of the system thus the differences of chromatographic peaks between the samples from the sartan incubations and the two control experiments verified the origin of these biotransformation products 2 3 experiments in a full scale wastewater treatment plant the experiments were conducted at the wwtp of avedøre copenhagen denmark operating a 400 000 pe cas plant with nitrification denitrification and biological as well as chemical phosphate removal samples on the cas were taken as 24 h flow proportional samples on three consecutive days both in the inflow and downstream of the secondary clarifier additionally two approximately 1 m3 large pilots were installed at this treatment plant to further polish the effluent water of the wwtp from pharmaceuticals a membrane bioreactor mbr using a ceramic microfiltration membrane followed by a forward osmosis fo set up for details see li et al 2022 and li et al 2021 the mbr was fed by cas effluent while the fo was operated downstream of the mbr the effluents and influent of the pilots were sampled by grab sampling removal r in all steps was calculated following eq 1 1 r c in c out c in 100 2 4 analytical

absciex frammingham ma usa was used to analyse the data including chromatographic and spectral analysis in this paper the identification of metabolites included 1 comparison of chromatographic properties and mass spectral data to authentic synthetized standards 2 interpretation of found mass signals and isotope profiles of the ms spectra were consistent with expected biochemical reactions 3 the use of criteria that the detected signals increased over incubation time meaning the peaks at the start were either a no peak in the initial sample 0 h or b the peak in later samples is significantly higher than those obtained from the sample taken at 0 h and does not occur in the control samples 4 the usage of proposed structures agreeing to the obtained product ion spectra rationality of the fragments comparison of the fragments between the parent compounds and the tentative tps comparison of the fragments with the information in databases or literatures additionally the metabolitepilottm software absciex usa was employed as a supplement to further determine tps the principle was to subtract the data from the first sample 0h of the incubationfrom those of an incubated sample providing a list containing all the potential generated peaks with accurate m z under the internal algorithm to predict and give possible molecular formulas and structures pähler and brink 2013 qian et al 2012 because metabolitepilottm only compares two specific samples without kinetic information which might provide false results it was used as a reference for manual analysis on sciex os 2 4 2 quantitative detection of known compounds quantitative detection of three parent compounds losartan valsartan and irbesartan and two transformation products that were available as

s2 in the supporting information losartan and irbesartan were quantified using losartan d4 as an internal standard whereas eprosartan and olmesartan were quantified using citalopram d6 2 5 sampling for effluent monitoring in different countries effluent of 82 cas wwtps from 8 countries in the baltic sea region 5 from germany 34 from denmark 8 from sweden 11 from finland 6 from estonia 6 from latvia 2 from lithuania and 10 from poland was sampled in a 500 ml glass bottles as 24 h flow controlled composite samples by operators of the respective utilities in june july 2021 and shipped by express courier service the received samples were kept at 20 c for approximately two months thawed and centrifuged to remove particulate matter mixed with internal standards and measured by directly injecting 70 µl into the hplc ms ms 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring of sartans in 80 wwtps in the baltic sea region to obtain a clearer idea on the relevance of sartans in the baltic sea region we analysed these compounds in the framework of an ongoing project sartan concentrations in the effluent wastewater are shown in fig 1 the measured sartan concentrations varied considerably from country to country but were generally consistent within each country resulting in country specific patterns fig 1 our results show that in all 8 countries at least one sartan is used heavily as the different sartans have different physiological properties and pharmaceutical efficiency we will only compare the wwtp effluent concentration pattern in this article while in germany mostly irbesartan 0 2 0 8 µg l valsartan 0 2 1 4 µg l and olmesartan 0 5 1 2 µg l are relevant in denmark losartan 0 3 6 9 µg l dominates in estonia mostly olmesartan 0 5 4 3 µg l in the wastewater is in the wastewater while in finland losartan 0 2 2 3 µg l and valsartan 0 2 7 µg l are used predominantly in lithuania the emissions are dominated by valsartan 0 7 1 3 µg l and olmesartan 0 2 0 5 µg l while in latvia the emissions are almost completely due to olmesartan 0 4 2 0 µg l in poland the emissions are mostly due to valsartan 0 4 4 3 µg l while in sweden valsartan 0 2 1 3 µg l losartan 0 3 2 3 µg l and irbesartan 0 06 0 2 µg l are found in some samples the concentrations exceed 6 µg l losartan in denmark and valsartan in finland in comparison to the concentrations of other pharmaceuticals in wwtp effluents that rarely exceed 1 µg l kisielius et al 2023 the concentrations of sartans are high 3 2 identification of transformation products in model experiments at high concentrations mg l losartan valsartan and irbesartan were degraded only in the mbbr samples but not in control samples sartans in tap water with no biofilms fig s1 supporting information the identified tps were only formed in the mbbr but not in the control tps of losartan valsartan and irbesartan in mbbr were identified by hplc qtof the identification of microbial tps of these three sartans resulted in suggestions on structures of transformation products for some of these authentic standards were available while for others this was not the case the mass spectrometric characterization of the respective compounds is shown in table 2 3 2 1 losartan fig 2 illustrates an example of the unequivocal identification of a tp losartan tp437 by comparing its data to those of the authentic standard losartan carboxylic acid the extracted ion chromatogram eic tof ms spectrum and tof ms2 fragments of losartan carboxylic acid are shown in fig 2a while the same data of the proposed losartan tp437 are shown in fig 2b the retention time exact mass error 10ppm isotopic pattern indicating towards twenty two carbon one chlorine and fragment ions 178 180 207 235 m z of this detected tp all matched the information of the reference standard in addition fig 2 b1 shows the chromatographic peak of losartan tp437 increased with the degradation of the parent compound losartan from 0 to 434 hours kinetics details in fig 5 there was no signal for this tp at incubation time 0 therefore losartan tp437 was identified as losartan carboxylic acid fig 3 b shows an example of characterizing losartan tp393 without an authentic standard in comparison to the parent losartan fig 3a the chromatographic peak of the parent compound losartan decreased from 0 to 434 hours the tof ms spectrum and the tof ms2 fragments of losartan at 0 hours are provided in fig 3 a the retention time of the parent losartan was 7 8 min and the tof spectrum shows the exact mass of losartan as well as the isotopic peaks containing 13c and 37cl elements in accordance with the theoretical abundance calculation eight main tof ms2 fragments were detected and the proposed structures of each fragment ion are illustrated in fig 3 a while the elemental composition data are shown in table 2 while the parent compound was degraded peak size decreased the suspected tp losartan tp393 was formed peak increased from 0 to 434 hours and the chromatographic and spectral data of losartan tp393 at 434 hours are shown in fig 3b the retention time of losartan tp393 of 8 3 min was higher than that of losartan in the hplc separation this agrees with the suggested structure losartan minus one ch2oh group which makes this tp less hydrophilic than the parent compound losartan the isotopic pattern in the tof ms spectrum agreed with the proposed formula the tof ms2 spectrum showed six main fragments marked with the tentative structures and the calculated mass errors fig 3b three of which 171 207 235 m z were also fragments of the parent compound losartan overall the combination of chromatographic data accurate spectral data obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry and tof ms2 fragments comparable to those of the parent compound all supported the proposed structure of losartan tp393 as des methylhydroxy losartan according to the same identification methods four more tps of losartan were proposed thus a total of six tps of losartan with tentative structures were identified fig 4 a two of these losartan tp267 and losartan tp437 were confirmed by authentic standards as valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid table 2 in comparison the degradation products and pathways were modelled by envipath envipath predicted only losartan carboxylic acid four tps of valsartan and four tps of irbesartan were also identified table 2 and fig 4b and c the detailed analysis processes with chromatographic and spectral data are shown in figs s2 s15 in the supporting information table 2 summarizes the retention times precursor ions fragment ions proposed formulas and mass errors of these three sartan compounds and all their identified tps and also contains information about whether a tp s identification was confirmed by an authentic standard whether a tp was reported and supported by literature comparable spectral data with at least one identical fragment and whether a tp was identified for the first time in this paper valsartan acid has previously been reported to be a biological transformation product of losartan in water environments hillebrand et al 2013 kaur and dulova 2020 losartan carboxylic acid as the main metabolite of losartan has been frequently detected in aquatic systems dubey and ghosh 2015 van nuijs et al 2015 losartan tp335 seemed to correspond to a proposed tp of losartan previously reported in sonochemistry and photooxidation processes as there were three fragments 101 180 207 m z detected in this paper consistent with their reports but our study is the first one identifying losartan tp335 as a microbial tp of losartan in mbbr systems ladhari et al 2021 serna galvis et al 2019 moreover to the best of our knowledge losartan tp453 losartan tp403 and losartan tp393 have not been reported in the literature before as tps of losartan marked in table 2 among them losartan tp453 and losartan tp403 had chromatographic and spectral evidence to support the proposed structures but some functional groups could not be exactly be located in the molecule figs 4 and s4 s5 supporting information losartan tp453 had one hydroxyl group added to the tetrazole biphenyl structure in comparison to losartan and a carbonyl group added to the peripherical structure imidazole ring butyl chain or hydroxymethyl fig supporting information table 2 summarizes that the eic peaks of losartan tp453 appeared at two retention times of 7 954 min and 7 582 min indicating this compound has isomers however the chromatographic peak at 7 582 min provided poor tof ms data therefore only the result of losartan tp543 at 7 954 min is discussed in this paper losartan tp403 is formed by loss of chlorine from the parent compound losartan and an added carbonyl group to the imidazole butyl or hydroxymethyl group but the specific reactive site remains unknown fig s5 supporting information fig 4 a demonstrates an overview of the suggested structures and transformation processes from losartan to its different tps from losartan tp453 can result through oxidation and hydroxylation reactions after oxidation and dechlorination losartan can form losartan tp403 the formation of losartan tp393 is due to dehydroxylation and demethylation on the imidazole ring of losartan losartan tp437 losartan carboxylic acid resulted from an oxidation reaction forming a carboxyl group the processes to generate losartan tp335 and tp267 were probably sequential reactions first through ring cleavage and n dealkylation losartan produced losartan tp335 ladhari et al 2021 serna galvis et al 2019 losartan tp335 can transfer to an intermediate product dealkylated valsartan by changing nh to o on the amylamine chain a process previously demonstrated on losartan but this intermediate product might be unstable so we did not detect it here serna galvis et al 2019 however this intermediate product has been widely reported to be active and could further transfer to losartan tp267 valsartan acid by n dealkylation and oxidation reactions helbling et al 2010 ladhari et al 2021 nödler et al 2013 after identifying the tps of the three sartans their degradation and formation kinetics as well as their mass balances were investigated fig 5 a demonstrates the degradation of losartan and the formation of two of its tps losartan carboxylic acid and valsartan acid whose concentrations were quantified according to the authentic standards it can be seen that losartan degraded from 1 mg l to 253 µg l in 434 hours while the concentration of losartan carboxylic acid increased from 0 to 611 µg l and valsartan acid was formed with concentrations reaching 5 2 µg l in 41 hours and then degraded again to reaching concentrations of 1 5 µg l at 434 hours fig 5b shows the mass balance among these three compounds in the laboratory mbbr incubations normalized to the initially spiked molar concentration of losartan it can be seen that the concentration of losartan decreased with time while the molar fractions of losartan carboxylic acid and valsartan acid increased fig 5b in this experiment losartan carboxylic acid is the main tp of losartan as the loss of losartan results in the generation of losartan carboxylic acid and the sum of molar fraction of losartan and losartan carboxylic acid was always higher than 84 fig 5b the missing 15 are most probably due to not quantified metabolites during our identification study see above four more tps i e losartan tp335 losartan tp453 losartan tp403 and losartan tp393 were characterized but without authentic standards the formation of these four tps can only be demonstrated via the development of the respective peak areas and the result is shown in fig 6 a it is worth noting that the initial peak area of losartan tp335 was not 0 but around 10000 for the first 165 hours and then increasing to 41500 in 434 hours therefore this tp might be an impurity in the production process of losartan and the peak of losartan tp335 was also found in the test of directly spiking sartans into deionized di water which confirmed this hypothesis fig s16 supporting information however it was also formed in the biofilm incubation as indicated by increase of peak size by a factor of 4 during the incubation losartan tp453 losartan tp403 and losartan tp393 developed from zero signal to 10 000 15 000 and 20 000 peak area in 434 h losartan carboxylic acid is the main metabolite in the biofilm systems in our study this compound is also the main human metabolite of losartan and is widely detected in human plasma

confirmed by an authentic standard to be valsartan acid fig s6 supporting information the plausible structures of valsartan tp336 valsartan tp452 and valsartan tp424 were proposed based on their spectral data fragment ions and chromatographic information figs s8 10 supporting information among them one tp i e valsartan tp452 originated from the parent by adding a hydroxyl group to the structure of tetrazole biphenyl but the exact isomer is still unknown the eic of valsartan tp452 showed three peaks at retention times of 7 675 min 8 160 min and 8 311 min possible isomers marked in table 2 but only the peak at 8 160 min provided sufficient spectral and fragmentation data to interpret the structure and was shown in this paper a similar hydroxylation reaction on valsartan to produce hydroxylated tp has been seen in previous studies arvaniti et al 2020 diehle et al 2019 serna galvis et al 2019 the reaction of valsartan to valsartan tp336 n dealkylation and then to valsartan tp267 hydrolysis and oxidation is suggested in fig 4b and has also been previously reported helbling et al 2010 ladhari et al 2021 letzel et al 2015 valsartan tp424 was identified as a suspected tp of valsartan and was reported the first time in this paper valsartan tp424 was formed by oxidizing the isopropyl and cleaving the tetrazole ring on valsartan fig 4 b the process of tetrazole group opening on sartans and other compounds has been demonstrated in previous studies gurkan et al 2012 serna galvis et al 2019 valsartan degraded from 1 mg l to 441 µg l in 603 hours while valsartan acid valsartan tp267 was formed and concentration developed from 0 to 271 µg l fig 5c valsartan acid was detected to be the main tp of valsartan since the mass balance result indicated that the sum of the molar fractions of these two compounds was above 80 during the whole process fig 5d in the literature is described that valsartan acid is not a human metabolite of sartan compounds but it is the main microbial transformation product of valsartan and wwtps are the major source of valsartan acid in the water environment helbling et al 2010 letzel et al 2015 nödler et al 2013 semi quantitative data for the other valsartan transformation products is shown in fig 6 in comparison envipath revealed only one tp resulting from the break of the amide function hydrolysis with successive release of the pentanoic acid pentanoic acid would have escaped the identification but the other predicted hydrolysis product was not found in our experiment 3 2 3 irbesartan four tps of irbesartan were identified the structure of irbesartan tp267 was confirmed by a reference standard to be valsartan acid fig s11 supporting information without standards the structures of the remaining three tps irbesartan tp335 irbesartan tp443 irbesartan tp447 were proposed fig 4c and figs s13 s15 si by oxidation irbesartan tp443 added a carbonyl group to the imidazolone or butyl structure of irbesartan the exact position of which was unknown fig 4c oxidation and carbonylation of irbesartan have been observed in both biotransformation and free chlorine reactions boix et al 2016 carpinteiro et al 2019 ladhari et al 2021 letzel et al 2015 irbesartan tp447 was obtained after hydrolysis and opening of the imidazolone ring on irbesartan fig 4c and this compound has also been reported to be formed in photodegradation and free chlorine processes carpinteiro et al 2019 ladhari et al 2021 several studies have shown that irbesartan could transfer to irbesartan 267 valsartan acid in wastewater but the transformation processes were not clarified letzel et al 2015 nödler et al 2013 in our study irbesartan tp335 was identified for the first time as a suspected tp of irbesartan and irbesartan tp335 is identical to losartan tp335 identical chromatographic spectral and fragment data figs s3 s15 si therefore we assumed that the process to generate valsartan acid from irbesartan was similar to the process on losartan section 3 1 1 e g through a sequential reaction from irbesartan to irbesartan tp335 then to valsartan acid including dealkylation oxidation hydrolysis etc irbesartan concentrations decreased from 1 to 0 048 mg l while the concentration of valsartan acid increased from 0 to 0 013 mg l in 357 hours fig 5e however the mass balance shows the degraded fraction of irbesartan can not be explained by the formation of valsartan acid or any other quantifiable metabolite fig 5f it means valsartan acid was not the main microbial tp of irbesartan in this experiment however the formation of the suggested metabolites for which no authentic standards were available was detected by following the development of the respective peak areas over time as shown in fig 6c in parallel to the degradation of the parent compound irbesartan irbesartan tp443 peak area from 0 to 20 000 tp335 peak area from 0 to 10 000 and tp447 peakarea from 1 000 000 to 2 500 000 formed development of peak areas in brackets fig 6 the peak area of irbesartan tp447 was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of other tps thus irbesartan tp447 was probably the main tp of irbesartan irbesartan tp447 has already been reported as a tp in different reactions including microbial process photodegradation and free chlorine reaction as a major tp of irbesartan carpinteiro et al 2019 ladhari et al 2021 letzel et al 2015 fig 6c also demonstrates the initial peak area of irbesartan tp447 was not zero and previous studies have showed this compound to be an impurity of irbesartan carpinteiro et al 2019 fig s16 supporting information thus irbesartan tp447 was probably an impurity of irbesartan while it also was formed from this parent by hydrolysis and dehydration fig 4c it is worth noting that losartan and irbesartan shared a common tp losartan irbesartan tp335 but this compound was only present in losartan but not in irbesartan samples at 0 hours indicating that it might only be an impurity of losartan while it is truly formed by microbial degradation from irbesartan fig 6 for irbesartan envipath did not produce results in an overnight run the effects of substrate loading on sartan metabolisation in mbbrs is shown in text si 1 3 3 removal in a conventional sludge wastewater treatment plant in the conventional activated sludge treatment plant cas of wwtp avedøre copenhagen denmark the three sartans losartan valsartan and irbesartan and their eleven identified tps were investigated in raw wastewater and secondary effluent water three sartans and five of their tps valsartan acid losartan carboxylic acid losartan irbesartan tp335 losartan tp453 and irbesartan tp447 were detected in both the raw wastewater and the effluent fig 7 table 3 indicating towards that these compounds are also products of human metabolism the concentrations of losartan valsartan irbesartan valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid were considerable i e 0 1 4 3 µg l in raw wastewater and 0 19 2 27 µg l in effluent wastewater table 3 for those tps for which no authentical standards were available only peak areas in raw wastewater and effluent water are shown in table 3 nonetheless the relative removal of the compounds can be calculated by substituting the concentrations by the respective peak areas in eq 1 fig 7 the removal of losartan valsartan and irbesartan in the cas were 52 72 and 3 respectively two tps originating from human metabolism were also removed in the cas wwtp tp447 of irbesartan with 64 and of tp335 of losartan irbesartan with 23 fig 7 on the other hand formation of four tps was registered in the cas tp267 valsartan acid 144 tp437 losartan carboxylic acid 55 tp453 101 from losartan fig s18 demonstrates the mass balance of sartans and their tps between the influent and effluent of the wwtp the molar concentration of each compound was normalized to the sum of the molar concentrations of all these compounds detected in the raw wastewater to obtain the molar ratio the molar fractions of losartan valsartan irbesartan valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid in the raw wastewater were 62 5 8 4 3 1 6 and 25 of the total inflow and 30 1 7 4 2 5 1 and 39 respectively in the effluent it is worth noting that opposite to the balancing experiment in the full scale plant the balancing in the lab systems was complete even though the three parent compounds losartan valsartan irbesartan were all removed in the wwtp to some extent valsartan acid and losartan carboxylic acid were formed especially losartan carboxylic acid was detected up to 2 8 µg l in the effluent water which was also previously detected in an effluent wastewater in spain at 1 56 µg l and 0 116 µg l in a surface water gracia lor et al 2014 the result indicates the necessity to include the sartans tps into the monitoring program in the aquatic environment in order to have a more comprehensive insight into their environmental impact however several other tps losartan tp 403 393 valsartan tp 336 452 424 and irbesartan tp 443 that were identified in the lab with incubations of high concentrations with biofilms were not detected in the cas wwtp whether this is due to sludge microbial communities having less metabolic pathways eventually only in this wwtp or whether this was due to the about 20 times lower starting concentrations and thus the metabolite concentrations were below limit of detection in the full scale wwtp is not 100 known at this point to test whether advanced approaches can remove the sartans better than the cas their fate in an mbr and fo polishing step was tested figs s17 si the mbr was able to remove small amounts of losartan valsartan and irbesartan 6 7 12 9 and 21 3 respectively while generating valsartan acid losartan carboxylic acid and tp453 additionally the mbr was also able to remove small fractions of tps 335 443 and 447 forward osmosis was able to remove all remaining residues of both sartan parents and sartan transformation products fig s17 4 conclusions concentrations of sartans in cas wwtp effluents can reach close to 6 µg l the patterns in different studied european countries were different but the mean total sartan concentrations in all countries were close to or exceeded 1 µg l biological systems like cas mbbrs and mbr are able to remove and metabolize sartan compounds to some extent however considerable concentrations remain in the effluent waters valsartan can be removed efficiently by predominantly but not exclusively forming valsartan acid losartan is removed by 52 in the cas while about half of which is transformed into losartan carboxylic acid which is thus reaching relatively high concentrations 2 8 µg l in the small laboratory mbbrs the same predominant metabolite is formed besides a lot of other metabolites that are formed at lower rates irbesartan is removed by 3 in the cas with several metabolites being identified the main metabolite being tp 443 while in the mbbr 90 removal is achieved in 70 h a small fraction is transformed into valsartan acid as well as three other metabolites the main metabolite also being irbesartan tp 447 whether or not these metabolites are of toxicological relevance is beyond the knowledge of the authors and needs further studies however as the determined sartan and sartan tp concentrations are relatively high they should be considered in future assessments credit author statement rui li planned and conducted the experiment did the data treatment and provided the first draft of the manuscript chuanzhou liang and

15189,in this study non invasive low field magnetic resonance imaging mri technology was used to monitor fouling induced changes in fiber by fiber hydrodynamics inside a multi fiber hollow fiber membrane module containing 401 fibers using structural and velocity images the fouling evolution of these membrane modules were shown to exhibit distinct trends in fiber by fiber volumetric flow with increasing fouling causing a decrease in the number of flow active fibers this study shows that the fouling rate is not evenly distributed over the parallel fibers which results in a broadening of the fiber to fiber flowrate distribution during cleaning this distribution is initially broadened further as relatively clean fibers are cleaned more rapidly compared to clogged fibers by tracking the volumetric flow rate of individual fibers inside the modules during the fouling cleaning cycle it was possible to observe a fouling memory like effect with residual fouling occurring preferentially at the outer edge of the fiber bundle during repeated fouling cleaning cycle these results demonstrate the ability of mri velocity imaging to quantitatively monitor these effects which are important when testing the effectiveness of cleaning protocols due to the long term effect that residual fouling and memory like effect may have on the operation of membrane modules graphical abstract image

ultrafiltration uf hollow fiber hf membranes are widely used in membrane separation processes as pre treatment for reverse osmosis ro processes to reduce ro membrane fouling and increase service life anis et al 2019 li et al 2017 voutchkov 2010 however fouling of hollow fiber membranes whereby local hydrodynamics change has great influence on the overall system operation stability li et al 2017 increases in flow resistance result in decreased efficiency increased costs due to higher energy consumption and can severely reduce membrane lifespan thus membrane fouling and associated hydrodynamic changes are a major challenge to the operation of large scale hollow fiber membrane systems sun et al 2014 wang et al 2008 to this end better understanding of the relationship between membrane fouling

to allow for detailed monitoring of individual fibers in a multi fiber module yan et al 2021 at a lower cost with the use of permanent magnets allowing a high degree of accessibility in the current research we expand upon our previous research yan et al 2021 using a bench top mri techniques to monitor the fouling and cleaning of a multi fiber membrane module to systematically examine the effect of module fouling and cleaning by tracking the impact of fouling and cleaning on a fiber by fiber basis the benchtop mri approach used in the current research has the ablility to monitor hundreds of hollow fibers flowing inside a membrane module and detect fouling and subsequent cleaning of fibers yan et al 2021 in the current work this previous research is extended to include the systematic monitoring of alginate fouling and subsequent sodium hydroxide naoh solution cleaning to quantify the extent of residual fouling this allows for the observation of any spatial residual fouling effects which may be reminiscent of memory like effects this study aims to spatially quantify and assess the cleaning effectiveness of hollow fiber membrane modules at both a fiber by fiber length scale and shed new light on the evolution of fouling structures spanning the length scales of the whole fiber bundle e g radial dependence of cleaning effectiveness and preferential fouling cleaning of outer vs inner radii fibers this can elucidate the relationships between fouling induced changes in hydrodynamics both at a local and fiber bundle length scales which can influence the long term operability of a multi fiber hollow fiber bundle 2 materials and methodology 2 1 equipment the polysulfone ps ultrafiltration uf hollow fiber membrane module used in this study is a laboratory scale microza sp series ultrafiltration module sip 1023 developed by asahi kasei corporation it has a nominal capacity of 44 l h 1 at 1 bar average transmembrane pressure at 25 c with a membrane area of 0 2m2 thickness of 0 2 mm and molecular weight cut off mwco of 6 kda inside its 36 mm inner diameter id housing it has a nominal 400 closely packed straight hollow fibers as specified with an id of 0 8 mm arranged non symmetrically with a fiber length of 205 mm both the membrane housing and fibers are made of polysulfone material while the collection manifold is made of epoxy resin schematic diagram of flowloop is shown in fig 1 a for the current experimental protocol the permeate channel is shut after the extra capillary space is filled with permeate inspection of nmr 2d image revealed there were 401 fibers in the module this was confirmed by manually counting the number of fibers on both sides of the module after removing the end caps fig 1 c an oxford maran drx nmr rock core analysis rca as shown in fig 1 b employing a 0 3 t permanent magnet with a 1h resonance frequency of 12 9 mhz was used to conduct the mri measurements it features a 53 mm diameter sample access chamber which is open both ways and a 3d magnetic field gradients maximum x y z gradients are respectively 0 27 0 27 and 0 33 t m for spatial encoding thus enabling the performance of 2d imaging and velocity mapping in a 2d transverse plane to the vertical y axis 2 2 experimental procedures deionized water was used as the flowing medium a commercial sodium alginate powder fmc manugel gmb mw 170 240 kda was used to prepare the alginate solution at a concentration of 2000 mg l 1 alginate is used as a model foulant in this work it is a common fouling substitute to replicate organic charfi et al 2017 mi and elimelech 2010 and biological fouling katsoufidou et al 2007 ye et al 2005 cacl2 labserv and nacl analytical reagent were added at a concentration of 700 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 respectively to form alginate calcium bonding with na as the bonding initiator the resultant 0 2 wt calcium alginate gel was used as the foulant in all experiments performed the foulant stock solution was diluted to 20 ppm in the feed solution for the membrane element sodium hydroxide pellets analytical reagent were dissolved in deionized water to prepare the 1 mm naoh ph 11 membrane cleaning solution the naoh alkaline solution is used for cleaning as it has hydrolysis and solubilisation effects on organic foulant such as alginate jafari et al 2020 and is compatible with the membrane module used in the current study in these experiments the membrane module was placed vertically inside the rca s sample access chamber as indicated in fig 1 b when obtaining 2d structural images the shell side of the membrane module was first filled with di water from the permeate channel and then sealed dry compressed air was then employed to remove residual water inside the fibers to improve image contrast a schematic of the experimental flow measurement setup is shown in fig 1 di water was fed through the shell side of the membrane modules in the vertical upward direction using a masterflex peristaltic pump cole parmer a masterflex pulse dampener cole parmer was installed after the peristaltic pump before the fluid enters the lower end of the uf module thus ensuring steady flow the retentate was directed to drain and not recycled to ensure consistent feed water quality makeup di water required to maintain reservoir level was fed directly from the di water tap to the fluid reservoir the volumetric flow rate qf was set at 100 ml min 1 pressures were measured upstream point a and downstream point b of the membrane module as indicated in fig 1 a using cerabar t pmp131 endress and hauser the data was recorded every 5 s using an ecograph t multi channel recorder rsg30 endress and hauser the permeate outlet was sealed after the extra capillary space was filled with di water and remained sealed during velocity imaging measurements so that there is no permeate production during imaging this allows for better flow control for monitoring of small dp changes 0 1 kpa due to fouling during the long time duration measurements measurements of the impact of fiber lumen fouling and subsequent cleaning were then performed the nmr experiments were performed in two experimental groups group i and group ii which are summarized in table 1 during each experimental run a b c d e the membrane module was left un distrubed inside the mri system for monitoring in a temperature controlled laboratory at 22 c all mri velocity images were conducted with feed water volumetric flow qfeed of 100 ml min 1 group i experiments a1 a5 were conducted with no alginate foulant added and thus function as a control for the other measurements experiments b1 b5 and c1 c5 had 20 ppm alginate foulant doses added at b2 b4 and c2 c4 respectively with each foulant dosing followed by 30 min flow of feed water at qfeed 100 ml min 1 cleaning using 1 l of 1 mm naoh solution ph 11 was conducted after each fouling b3 b5 and c3 c5 the only difference between b and c is that the flow rate is 100 ml min 1 and 200 ml min 1 respectively during the cleaning stage see table 1 for reference so the main difference in results should be due to different shear during the cleaning for group ii two repeated measurements using the same fouling and cleaning were performed d1 d7 and e1 e7 an initial no fouling velocity image was acquired d1 and e1 followed by two stages of fouling d2 d3 and e2 e3 using the same total amount of foulant as in b and c then same cleaning protocol as for b3 was performed for d4 and e4 this was followed by three different durations of naoh ph 11 soaking for 20 min d5 and e5 for 1 h d6 and e6 and for 10 h d7 and e7 alginate foulant was injected into the system between the fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump see fig 1 a at a rate of 1 ml min 1 while mixing with 100 ml min 1 feed water this mixture passes through the peristaltic pump and the pulse dampener volume before flowing into the uf membrane module the naoh ph 11 cleaning solution was flushed through the flow loop at 100 ml min 1 when soaking is included the membrane module remains soaked in the cleaning solution at the end of the cleaning solution feeding cycle for a specified period of time i e 1 l naoh ph 11 solution is added to the flow loop then the pump is stopped and fluid inside flow loop is allowed to sit for the required number of hours after which di water is continuously fed at 100 ml min 1 the total flow loop volume is 0 5 l before the beginning of each series of mri velocity images the membrane module was flushed with dry compressed air membrane module inlet pressure p 1 5 bar and di water at high flow rate i e 700 ml min 1 this was done at an elevated membrane module inlet pressure p 1 bar until the active fibers participation rate during flowing reaches 98 392 fibers or higher the designation of flow active fibers is due to there being a lower detection threshold using the technique such that it is not possible to distinguish if a fiber is not flowing or simply slow flowing qi 0 1 ml min 1 2 3 imaging protocol the mri image plane is in the perpendicular to flow direction 40 mm from the fibers entrance manifold 2d structural and velocity mri images were acquired with a field of view fov of 75 mm 75 mm with 512 512 pixels in the transverse plane in plane resolution of 146 µm and slice thickness of 30 mm the procedure detailed below aims to find a favourable trade off between image acquisition time and resolution the flow encode gradient δ 2 ms δ 16 ms strength was varied to avoid signal phase fold over total acquisition times of 2d structural and velocity images were 41 and 82 min respectively and used reduced k space sampling negligible structural or velocity information losses were encountered when comparing full k space to 1 3 k space sampling a conventional phase contrast velocity imaging pulse sequence incorporated with gradient moment nulling based on even echo re phasing was used yan et al 2021 only the first order flow is corrected by the flow compensation which null the first moment during spatial encoding thus minimising flow motion artefacts laukemper ostendorf et al 1998 a slice is excited by employing a 90 radiofrequency rf soft pulse accompanied with a slice selection gradient along the longitudinal direction of the fiber followed by a half width gradient in the negative direction in this series of measurement only positive flow encoding gradient gf and positive reference flow encoding gradient gf r were measured during consecutive mri velocity measurements gf gf r other primary parameters employed during mr velocity mapping are summarised in table 2 2 4 fixed detection frame method to determine the location of fibers before the start of measurements a cross sectional 512 by 512 pixel 2d mr image was acquired with an in plane resolution of 0 146 0 146 mm pixel see fig 2 a the nmr signal grey originated from the di water on the shell side of the module with the air filled inner fibers membrane module housing and external air not contributing signal based on fiber centre identification a defined fiber inner surface cyan colour with an id of 0 8 mm are superimposed on the original 2d mr image for reference a photograph of the entrance of membrane module is shown fig 2b an algorithm yan et al 2021 allows the identification of all fiber locations from the structural mr image and can be used to monitor changes in fiber location during the course of experiments it can then be used to quantify and store information for each fiber in an image to allow the tracking of changes of individual fiber volumetric flowrate over time across velocity images for example fig 2c shows velocity image pixels for a single fiber enclosed within a red colour frame which were then used to analyse the volumetric flow rates of the fiber where i indicates the ith fiber where i 1 to 401 for reference cyan and black circle are also shown as indications of the approximate inner surface and outer surface of the fiber 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental group 1 cleaning without soaking we evaluated the effect of cleaning by 5 and 10 min of naoh ph 11 dosing on fibers fouled by an alginate solution see table 1 fig 3 a shows the obtained velocity images fig 3 b shows the corresponding fiber flowrate histograms and fig 4 shows the number of flow active fibers and the pressure drop for the unfouled reference a and the fouled and cleaned modules b and c the five consecutive images were obtained over 10 h and show the progressive change in flow distribution when the flowrate in clogged fibers decreases the flowrate in the non fouled fibers increases because the total flowrate remains constant thus the fouling of membrane fibers results in an increased number of non flowing fibers and a shift of the main peak distribution to higher flow velocity values fig 3 b shows the emergence of two flowrate peaks during experiments b labelled α and β in fig 3 b indicating a clustering of volumetric flow velocities in a subset of fibers associated with fouled fibers α and non fouled fibers β the number of flow active fibers is plotted in fig 4 in fig 3 b a small but notable change is observed in the distribution for the unfouled reference a as due to an increased number of effectively non flowing fibers the main peak distribution shifts to higher individual flowrate values the observation of a non zero fouling rate in the reference experiment may be attributed to minor residual alginate in the equipment from previous experiments this fouling effect is however small compared with experiments b and c when the membrane is exposed to alginate dosing and subsequent cleaning b and c in fig 3 a significant change in the velocity images and corresponding fiber velocity distributions fig 3 is observed it is also seen that there is a progressive effect of fouling between the first and second alginate doses resulting in broader fiber flowrate distributions and a decreasing number of flow active fibers examination of the effect of cleaning e g b2 vs b3 reveals that after dosing of the naoh solution the flow distribution has broadened fig 3 b and the number of active fibers has decreased fig 4 at first glance this suggests that cleaning was counter productive however it should be noted that the result is indicative of the fouling distribution rather than the total amount of fouling while the total amount of fouling decreased the fouling appears to be preferentially removed from relatively clean fibers consequently the cleaning procedure lead to a broadening of the flow distribution it is noteworthy that experiment c shows a more severe fouling effect than experiment b while the effect of increasing the flow rate of naoh can explain this observation with the increased shear causing fouling material upstream of module in flow loop to accumulate downstream towards the fiber entrance region of the module however this may also be due to the stochastic nature of fouling and foulant addition nevertheless a similar pattern is observed in experiment c where after the alginate fouling dose and the cleaning the distribution broadens significantly the fiber velocity distribution of this more severely fouled hollow fiber module has the appearance of backbone flow distributions seen in spiral wound and other fouled porous media systems von der schulenburg et al 2008 where a sub set of fibers contains a high proportion of the total volumetric flow while a large number of fibers are non flowing this behaviour is indicative of the sensitivity of multi fiber parallel flow systems to changes in flow resistance of fibers where flow redistributes to the lowest resistance non fouled fibers 3 2 experimental group ii cleaning with soaking experimental group ii see table 1 follows a series of measurements where the module is fouled in two sequential steps with equal doses of alginate this is followed by four stages of cleaning with progressively longer duration of soaking i e wait time during which system is stagnant after introduction of naoh solution the results of the velocity measurements for experiment d and e are shown in fig 5 a the corresponding distributions of volumetric flow distributions are shown in fig 5 b and the number of active fibers and the pressure drop are shown in fig 6 the first cleaning was similar to the cleaning procedure used for experimental group i fig 5b e g d3 vs d4 shows that this cleaning procedure results in a negligible change in the distribution however after the subsequent cleaning which consist of sequentially longer durations of soaking the module in naoh solution the initial fiber velocity distribution is eventually restored it is interesting to note that during the consecutive soaking steps there is first an emergence of a bimodal distribution while after the last naoh soak d 7 e 7 the distribution shape returns to a distribution shape similar to the initial conditions of the module d 1 e 1 the emergence of the bimodal distribution can be explained by the consideration that individual fibers with a relative high degree of fouling are cleaned at a slower rate compared to relatively open fibers for experiment d and e there is a significant increase in pavg fig 6 indicating a significant fouling event has occurred which is consistent with the significant decrease of flow active fibers pavg returns to its pre fouled value after the cleaning of the module which corresponds with a recovery in the number of flow active fibers after the first cleaning it can be seen that the pressure drop was partially restored while the flow distribution broadened and the number of active fibers decreased this observation suggests that relatively open fibers are preferentially cleaned whilst experiments d and e demonstrate differences at each stage of the fouling and cleaning progression they show a general reproducibility with observed differences likely due to the stochastic nature of fouling and the subsequent cleaning of the module we consider that compared to less fouled fibers fibers with a relatively higher degree of fouling clog more easily and are more difficult to clean thus small initial differences may be amplified during the experiment given these change the membrane module show good similarity in distribution after the final cleaning d 7 and e 7 figs 7 and 8 show the relative change compared to the initial unfouled value in volumetric flow rate of individual fibers i e qi qi 1 where subscript i refers to the ith fiber in each image and 1 refers to the first images in each experiment the respective change in volumetric flow rate distribution on a fiber by fiber basis are shown for experiments d and e respectively for reference a baseline measurement is shown in all figures which shows the relative change in flowrate of two subsequent non fouling states obtained from experiment a1 and a2 table 1 what is observed after the initial broadening due to the initial two fouling stages is a gradual recovery of the distribution after cleaning with the final distribution for each experiment being similar to the distribution observed for the clean module system and similar to baseline from experiment a this indicates that the cleaning has been successful in recovering the fibers towards their initial pre fouling state whilst a small sub set of fibers retain evidence of fouling it should be noted that while the evolution of the distributions of fig 7 and fig 8 are quite similar there are subtle differences at different stages of the fouling and cleaning progression which is likely due to stochastic differences during both fouling and cleaning which may be generally expected in these types of multi step fouling and cleaning measurements 3 3 spatial distribution of clogged fibers in addition to monitoring the effectiveness of cleaning by monitoring the fiber by fiber evolution of flowrate distribution fig 7 and fig 8 it is of significant interest to determine the spatial location of any residual fouling in fibers this allows for the assessment of whether there are module design or cleaning protocol issues which may be more systematically addressed the fibers are categorized based on their individual relative flowrate reduction as fouled 30 flowrate reduction and non fouled the fouled fibers are indicated by solid yellow circles in fig 9 after extensive cleaning fig 9 c and f it appears that irreversible fouling tends to occur near the perimeter of the fiber bundle to investigate whether these patterns are likely to occur when fibers foul randomly a monte carlo simulation was used to generate 4000 random patterns with the same number of clogged fibers the average relative fouled fiber radial position that occurred in the experiments are compared to the range that was found by generating random patterns these results are shown in fig 10 the figure confirms that the observed pattern where irreversibly fouled fibers are near the perimeter is statistically significant there is also an indication that the initial fouling 1st fouling is statistically closer to the centre of the fiber module this may allude to initial fouling occurring closer to the centre of the module while residual fouling remains more at the periphery of the hollow fiber bundle as is observed in the velocity images see figs 5 7 and 8 for reference higher flow is observed towards the centre of the hollow fiber bundle after the fouling steps and after the unsuccessful flash cleaning of the module d e 2 4 after the soak cleaning steps d e 5 7 there is progression towards flow re emergence in fibers towards the centre of the fiber bundle which appears to occur generally in a centre to periphery progression this observation is supported by the average radial position of fouled fibers see fig 10 where the cleaning steps show that the fouled fibers are increasingly at a more peripheral radial location as this behaviour indicates centre to periphery progression in cleaning of the fibers it is likely that the higher flow rates measured towards the module s centre e g fig 5 d3 and e3 result in better penetration of the naoh cleaning solution into the more centrally located fibers during the soak cleaning procedure this may explain the appearance of residually fouled fibers towards the periphery of the membrane module which are subsequently difficult to clean due to the same fluid transport mechanisms which governed the successful cleaning of the more centrally located fibers further research is necessary to investigate how representative the observed fouling structure progression during cleaning is and how fouling and cleaning deviates from stochastic assumptions underlying fouling flora 1993 with each fiber treated independently of the structure of the fiber bundle and the membrane module these observations add important complementary information to studies performed on membrane modules in industry lin et al 2020 which observe progressive change in foulant composition along membrane stages and for targeted fouling control strategies which may be either position or foulant dependent in this respect the current research results complement previous non invasive observations of wetting patterns wypysek et al 2021 single ceramic hollow fiber alginate fouling arndt et al 2017 and seven channel hollow fibers filtration characteristics schuhmann et al 2019 simkins et al 2020 4 conclusions mri velocity imaging measurements of multi fiber hollow fiber membrane modules containing 401 fibers were performed after calcium alginate fouling and subsequent sodium hydroxide cleaning with and without soaking this led to the following conclusions mri data clearly showed the impact of alginate fouling on both fiber flow de activation i e fouled and re activation i e cleaned as consequence of foulant addition and subsequent cleaning protocol the fact that the distribution of volumetric flow in each fiber can be used to monitor the evolution of the module flow is novel allowing for detailed analysis of the extent of cleaning and residual fouling at each stage of the cleaning process this allows for the systematic study of the effectiveness of cleaning protocols using non invasive monitoring allowing for the potential of extended duration cleaning fouling studies of the same module resulting in important information about residual fouling and its impact on the long term usage of membrane modules which is of significant interest for chemical cleaning optimisation during the fouling stage of the experiments we observed that the fiber to fiber flowrate distribution broadens this shows that the fouling rate is not evenly distributed over the parallel fibers rather some fibers tend to clog and show a reduced flowrate while others remain open and show an increased flowrate monitoring of the fiber flowrate distribution during the cleaning steps revealed that initially there is an emergence of a further broadening bimodal distribution while after 10 h soaking eventually the original flow distribution was virtually restored this shows that relatively open fibers are cleaned more rapidly compared to clogged fibers thus dividing the fibers in a clean and a fouled cluster due to the slow cleaning rate of the clogged fibers a considerable effort is needed to completely restore a fouled module after the module was virtually restored the remaining fouled fibers are mainly located near the periphery of the fiber bundle indicating a preferential radial position for residual fouling after cleaning this observation suggests that hollow fiber membrane module design aspects such as fiber packing density or bundle size may play a role in the occurrence of irreversible fouling this study has demonstrated that velocity mri can be used to monitor the progression of fouling and cleaning within a hollow fiber module containing hundreds of individual fibers via the quantitative analysis of the volumetric flow within each fiber future research will focus on applying this fiber scale analysis to other types of fouling including biological and combined fouling such as occurs in practice between biological inorganic organic and particulate materials e g microplastics further developments of improve

15189,in this study non invasive low field magnetic resonance imaging mri technology was used to monitor fouling induced changes in fiber by fiber hydrodynamics inside a multi fiber hollow fiber membrane module containing 401 fibers using structural and velocity images the fouling evolution of these membrane modules were shown to exhibit distinct trends in fiber by fiber volumetric flow with increasing fouling causing a decrease in the number of flow active fibers this study shows that the fouling rate is not evenly distributed over the parallel fibers which results in a broadening of the fiber to fiber flowrate distribution during cleaning this distribution is initially broadened further as relatively clean fibers are cleaned more rapidly compared to clogged fibers by tracking the volumetric flow rate of individual fibers inside the modules during the fouling cleaning cycle it was possible to observe a fouling memory like effect with residual fouling occurring preferentially at the outer edge of the fiber bundle during repeated fouling cleaning cycle these results demonstrate the ability of mri velocity imaging to quantitatively monitor these effects which are important when testing the effectiveness of cleaning protocols due to the long term effect that residual fouling and memory like effect may have on the operation of membrane modules graphical abstract image

ultrafiltration uf hollow fiber hf membranes are widely used in membrane separation processes as pre treatment for reverse osmosis ro processes to reduce ro membrane fouling and increase service life

research we expand upon our previous research yan et al 2021 using a bench top mri techniques to monitor the fouling and cleaning of a multi fiber membrane module to systematically examine the effect of module fouling and cleaning by tracking the impact of fouling and cleaning on a fiber by fiber basis the benchtop mri approach used in the current research has the ablility to monitor hundreds of hollow fibers flowing inside a membrane module and detect fouling and subsequent cleaning of fibers yan et al 2021 in the current work this previous research is extended to include the systematic monitoring of alginate fouling and subsequent sodium hydroxide naoh solution cleaning to quantify the extent of residual fouling this allows for the observation of any spatial residual fouling effects which may be reminiscent of memory like effects this study aims to spatially quantify and assess the cleaning effectiveness of hollow fiber membrane modules at both a fiber by fiber length scale and shed new light on the evolution of fouling structures spanning the length scales of the whole fiber bundle e g radial dependence of cleaning effectiveness and preferential fouling cleaning of outer vs inner radii fibers this can elucidate the relationships between fouling induced changes in hydrodynamics both at a local and fiber bundle length scales which can influence the long term operability of a multi fiber hollow fiber bundle 2 materials and methodology 2 1 equipment the polysulfone ps ultrafiltration uf hollow fiber membrane module used in this study is a laboratory scale microza sp series ultrafiltration module sip 1023 developed by asahi kasei corporation it has a nominal capacity of 44 l h 1 at 1 bar average transmembrane pressure at 25 c with a membrane area of 0 2m2 thickness of 0 2 mm and molecular weight cut off mwco of 6 kda inside its 36 mm inner diameter id housing it has a nominal 400 closely packed straight hollow fibers as specified with an id of 0 8 mm arranged non symmetrically with a fiber length of 205 mm both the membrane housing and fibers are made of polysulfone material while the collection manifold is made of epoxy resin schematic diagram of flowloop is shown in fig 1 a for the current experimental protocol the permeate channel is shut after the extra capillary space is filled with permeate inspection of nmr 2d image revealed there were 401 fibers in the module this was confirmed by manually counting the number of fibers on both sides of the module after removing the end caps fig 1 c an oxford maran drx nmr rock core analysis rca as shown in fig 1 b employing a 0 3 t permanent magnet with a 1h resonance frequency of 12 9 mhz was used to conduct the mri measurements it features a 53 mm diameter sample access chamber which is open both ways and a 3d magnetic field gradients maximum x y z gradients are respectively 0 27 0 27 and 0 33 t m for spatial encoding thus enabling the performance of 2d imaging and velocity mapping in a 2d transverse plane to the vertical y axis 2 2 experimental procedures deionized water was used as the flowing medium a commercial sodium alginate powder fmc manugel gmb mw 170 240 kda was used to prepare the alginate solution at a concentration of 2000 mg l 1 alginate is used as a model foulant in this work it is a common fouling substitute to replicate organic charfi et al 2017 mi and elimelech 2010 and biological fouling katsoufidou et al 2007 ye et al 2005 cacl2 labserv and nacl analytical reagent were added at a concentration of 700 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 respectively to form alginate calcium bonding with na as the bonding initiator the resultant 0 2 wt calcium alginate gel was used as the foulant in all experiments performed the foulant stock solution was diluted to 20 ppm in the feed solution for the membrane element sodium hydroxide pellets analytical reagent were dissolved in deionized water to prepare the 1 mm naoh ph 11 membrane cleaning solution the naoh alkaline solution is used for cleaning as it has hydrolysis and solubilisation effects on organic foulant such as alginate jafari et al 2020 and is compatible with the membrane module used in the current study in these experiments the membrane module was placed vertically inside the rca s sample access chamber as indicated in fig 1 b when obtaining 2d structural images the shell side of the membrane module was first filled with di water from the permeate channel and then sealed dry compressed air was then employed to remove residual water inside the fibers to improve image contrast a schematic of the experimental flow measurement setup is shown in fig 1 di water was fed through the shell side of the membrane modules in the vertical upward direction using a masterflex peristaltic pump cole parmer a masterflex pulse dampener cole parmer was installed after the peristaltic pump before the fluid enters the lower end of the uf module thus ensuring steady flow the retentate was directed to drain and not recycled to ensure consistent feed water quality makeup di water required to maintain reservoir level was fed directly from the di water tap to the fluid reservoir the volumetric flow rate qf was set at 100 ml min 1 pressures were measured upstream point a and downstream point b of the membrane module as indicated in fig 1 a using cerabar t pmp131 endress and hauser the data was recorded every 5 s using an ecograph t multi channel recorder rsg30 endress and hauser the permeate outlet was sealed after the extra capillary space was filled with di water and remained sealed during velocity imaging measurements so that there is no permeate production during imaging this allows for better flow control for monitoring of small dp changes 0 1 kpa due to fouling during the long time duration measurements measurements of the impact of fiber lumen fouling and subsequent cleaning were then performed the nmr experiments were performed in two experimental groups group i and group ii which are summarized in table 1 during each experimental run a b c d e the membrane module was left un distrubed inside the mri system for monitoring in a temperature controlled laboratory at 22 c all mri velocity images were conducted with feed water volumetric flow qfeed of 100 ml min 1 group i experiments a1 a5 were conducted with no alginate foulant added and thus function as a control for the other measurements experiments b1 b5 and c1 c5 had 20 ppm alginate foulant doses added at b2 b4 and c2 c4 respectively with each foulant dosing followed by 30 min flow of feed water at qfeed 100 ml min 1 cleaning using 1 l of 1 mm naoh solution ph 11 was conducted after each fouling b3 b5 and c3 c5 the only difference between b and c is that the flow rate is 100 ml min 1 and 200 ml min 1 respectively during the cleaning stage see table 1 for reference so the main difference in results should be due to different shear during the cleaning for group ii two repeated measurements using the same fouling and cleaning were performed d1 d7 and e1 e7 an initial no fouling velocity image was acquired d1 and e1 followed by two stages of fouling d2 d3 and e2 e3 using the same total amount of foulant as in b and c then same cleaning protocol as for b3 was performed for d4 and e4 this was followed by three different durations of naoh ph 11 soaking for 20 min d5 and e5 for 1 h d6 and e6 and for 10 h d7 and e7 alginate foulant was injected into the system between the fluid reservoir and peristaltic pump see fig 1 a at a rate of 1 ml min 1 while mixing with 100 ml min 1 feed water this mixture passes through the peristaltic pump and the pulse dampener volume before flowing into the uf membrane module the naoh ph 11 cleaning solution was flushed through the flow loop at 100 ml min 1 when soaking is included the membrane module remains soaked in the cleaning solution at the end of the cleaning solution feeding cycle for a specified period of time i e 1 l naoh ph 11 solution is added to the flow loop then the pump is stopped and fluid inside flow loop is allowed to sit for the required number of hours after which di water is continuously fed at 100 ml min 1 the total flow loop volume is 0 5 l before the beginning of each series of mri velocity images the membrane module was flushed with dry compressed air membrane module inlet pressure p 1 5 bar and di water at high flow rate i e 700 ml min 1 this was done at an elevated membrane module inlet pressure p 1 bar until the active fibers participation rate during flowing reaches 98 392 fibers or higher the designation of flow active fibers is due to there being a lower detection threshold using the technique such that it is not possible to distinguish if a fiber is not flowing or simply slow flowing qi 0 1 ml min 1 2 3 imaging protocol the mri image plane is in the perpendicular to flow direction 40 mm from the fibers entrance manifold 2d structural and velocity mri images were acquired with a field of view fov of 75 mm 75 mm with 512 512 pixels in the transverse plane in plane resolution of 146 µm and slice thickness of 30 mm the procedure detailed below aims to find a favourable trade off between image acquisition time and resolution the flow encode gradient δ 2 ms δ 16 ms strength was varied to avoid signal phase fold over total acquisition times of 2d structural and velocity images were 41 and 82 min respectively and used reduced k space sampling negligible structural or velocity information losses were encountered when comparing full k space to 1 3 k space sampling a conventional phase contrast velocity imaging pulse sequence incorporated with gradient moment nulling based on even echo re phasing was used yan et al 2021 only the first order flow is corrected by the flow compensation which null the first moment during spatial encoding thus minimising flow motion artefacts laukemper ostendorf et al 1998 a slice is excited by employing a 90 radiofrequency rf soft pulse accompanied with a slice selection gradient along the longitudinal direction of the fiber followed by a half width gradient in the negative direction in this series of measurement only positive flow encoding gradient gf and positive reference flow encoding gradient gf r were measured during consecutive mri velocity measurements gf gf r other primary parameters employed during mr velocity mapping are summarised in table 2 2 4 fixed detection frame method to determine the location of fibers before the start of measurements a cross sectional 512 by 512 pixel 2d mr image was acquired with an in plane resolution of 0 146 0 146 mm pixel see fig 2 a the nmr signal grey originated from the di water on the shell side of the module with the air filled inner fibers membrane module housing and external air not contributing signal based on fiber centre identification a defined fiber inner surface cyan colour with an id of 0 8 mm are superimposed on the original 2d mr image for reference a photograph of the entrance of membrane module is shown fig 2b an algorithm yan et al 2021 allows the identification of all fiber locations from the structural mr image and can be used to monitor changes in fiber location during the course of experiments it can then be used to quantify and store information for each fiber in an image to allow the tracking of changes of individual fiber volumetric flowrate over time across velocity images for example fig 2c shows velocity image pixels for a single fiber enclosed within a red colour frame which were then used to analyse the volumetric flow rates of the fiber where i indicates the ith fiber where i 1 to 401 for reference cyan and black circle are also shown as indications of the approximate inner surface and outer surface of the fiber 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental group 1 cleaning without soaking we evaluated the effect of cleaning by 5 and 10 min of naoh ph 11 dosing on fibers fouled by an alginate solution see table 1 fig 3 a shows the obtained velocity images fig 3 b shows the corresponding fiber flowrate histograms and fig 4 shows the number of flow active fibers and the pressure drop for the unfouled reference a and the fouled and cleaned modules b and c the five consecutive images were obtained over 10 h and show the progressive change in flow distribution when the flowrate in clogged fibers decreases the flowrate in the non fouled fibers increases because the total flowrate remains constant thus the fouling of membrane fibers results in an increased number of non flowing fibers and a shift of the main peak distribution to higher flow velocity values fig 3 b shows the emergence of two flowrate peaks during experiments b labelled α and β in fig 3 b indicating a clustering of volumetric flow velocities in a subset of fibers associated with fouled fibers α and non fouled fibers β the number of flow active fibers is plotted in fig 4 in fig 3 b a small but notable change is observed in the distribution for the unfouled reference a as due to an increased number of effectively non flowing fibers the main peak distribution shifts to higher individual flowrate values the observation of a non zero fouling rate in the reference experiment may be attributed to minor residual alginate in the equipment from previous experiments this fouling effect is however small compared with experiments b and c when the membrane is exposed to alginate dosing and subsequent cleaning b and c in fig 3 a significant change in the velocity images and corresponding fiber velocity distributions fig 3 is observed it is also seen that there is a progressive effect of fouling between the first and second alginate doses resulting in broader fiber flowrate distributions and a decreasing number of flow active fibers examination of the effect of cleaning e g b2 vs b3 reveals that after dosing of the naoh solution the flow distribution has broadened fig 3 b and the number of active fibers has decreased fig 4 at first glance this suggests that cleaning was counter productive however it should be noted that the result is indicative of the fouling distribution rather than the total amount of fouling while the total amount of fouling decreased the fouling appears to be preferentially removed from relatively clean fibers consequently the cleaning procedure lead to a broadening of the flow distribution it is noteworthy that experiment c shows a more severe fouling effect than experiment b while the effect of increasing the flow rate of naoh can explain this observation with the increased shear causing fouling material upstream of module in flow loop to accumulate downstream towards the fiber entrance region of the module however this may also be due to the stochastic nature of fouling and foulant addition nevertheless a similar pattern is observed in experiment c where after the alginate fouling dose and the cleaning the distribution broadens significantly the fiber velocity distribution of this more severely fouled hollow fiber module has the appearance of backbone flow distributions seen in spiral wound and other fouled porous media systems von der schulenburg et al 2008 where a sub set of fibers contains a high proportion of the total volumetric flow while a large number of fibers are non flowing this behaviour is indicative of the sensitivity of multi fiber parallel flow systems to changes in flow resistance of fibers where flow redistributes to the lowest resistance non fouled fibers 3 2 experimental group ii cleaning with soaking experimental group ii see table 1 follows a series of measurements where the module is fouled in two sequential steps with equal doses of alginate this is followed by four stages of cleaning with progressively longer duration of soaking i e wait time during which system is stagnant after introduction of naoh solution the results of the velocity measurements for experiment d and e are shown in fig 5 a the corresponding distributions of volumetric flow distributions are shown in fig 5 b and the number of active fibers and the pressure drop are shown in fig 6 the first cleaning was similar to the cleaning procedure used for experimental group i fig 5b e g d3 vs d4 shows that this cleaning procedure results in a negligible change in the distribution however after the subsequent cleaning which consist of sequentially longer durations of soaking the module in naoh solution the initial fiber velocity distribution is eventually restored it is interesting to note that during the consecutive soaking steps there is first an emergence of a bimodal distribution while after the last naoh soak d 7 e 7 the distribution shape returns to a distribution shape similar to the initial conditions of the module d 1 e 1 the emergence of the bimodal distribution can be explained by the consideration that individual fibers with a relative high degree of fouling are cleaned at a slower rate compared to relatively open fibers for experiment d and e there is a significant increase in pavg fig 6 indicating a significant fouling event has occurred which is consistent with the significant decrease of flow active fibers pavg returns to its pre fouled value after the cleaning of the module which corresponds with a recovery in the number of flow active fibers after the first cleaning it can be seen that the pressure drop was partially restored while the flow distribution broadened and the number of active fibers decreased this observation suggests that relatively open fibers are preferentially cleaned whilst experiments d and e demonstrate differences at each stage of the fouling and cleaning progression they show a general reproducibility with observed differences likely due to the stochastic nature of fouling and the subsequent cleaning of the module we consider that compared to less fouled fibers fibers with a relatively higher degree of fouling clog more easily and are more difficult to clean thus small initial differences may be amplified during the experiment given these change the membrane module show good similarity in distribution after the final cleaning d 7 and e 7 figs 7 and 8 show the relative change compared to the initial unfouled value in volumetric flow rate of individual fibers i e qi qi 1 where subscript i refers to the ith fiber in each image and 1 refers to the first images in each experiment the respective change in volumetric flow rate distribution on a fiber by fiber basis are shown for experiments d and e respectively for reference a baseline measurement is shown in all figures which shows the relative change in flowrate of two subsequent non fouling states obtained from experiment a1 and a2 table 1 what is observed after the initial broadening due to the initial two fouling stages is a gradual recovery of the distribution after cleaning with the final distribution for each experiment being similar to the distribution observed for the clean module system and similar to baseline from experiment a this indicates that the cleaning has been successful in recovering the fibers towards their initial pre fouling state whilst a small sub set of fibers retain evidence of fouling it should be noted that while the evolution of the distributions of fig 7 and fig 8 are quite similar there are subtle differences at different stages of the fouling and cleaning progression which is likely due to stochastic differences during both fouling and cleaning which may be generally expected in these types of multi step fouling and cleaning measurements 3 3 spatial distribution of clogged fibers in addition to monitoring the effectiveness of cleaning by monitoring the fiber by fiber evolution of flowrate distribution fig 7 and fig 8 it is of significant interest to determine the spatial location of any residual fouling in fibers this allows for the assessment of whether there are module design or cleaning protocol issues which may be more systematically addressed the fibers are categorized based on their individual relative flowrate reduction as fouled 30 flowrate reduction and non fouled the fouled fibers are indicated by solid yellow circles in fig 9 after extensive cleaning fig 9 c and f it appears that irreversible fouling tends to occur near the perimeter of the fiber bundle to investigate whether these patterns are likely to occur when fibers foul randomly a monte carlo simulation was used to generate 4000 random patterns with the same number of clogged fibers the average relative fouled fiber radial position that occurred in the experiments are compared to the range that was found by generating random patterns these results are shown in fig 10 the figure confirms that the observed pattern where irreversibly fouled fibers are near the perimeter is statistically significant there is also an indication that the initial fouling 1st fouling is statistically closer to the centre of the fiber module this may allude to initial fouling occurring closer to the centre of the module while residual fouling remains more at the periphery of the hollow fiber bundle as is observed in the velocity images see figs 5 7 and 8 for reference higher flow is observed towards the centre of the hollow fiber bundle after the fouling steps and after the unsuccessful flash cleaning of the module d e 2 4 after the soak cleaning steps d e 5 7 there is progression towards flow re emergence in fibers towards the centre of the fiber bundle which appears to occur generally in a centre to periphery progression this observation is supported by the average radial position of fouled fibers see fig 10 where the cleaning steps show that the fouled fibers are increasingly at a more peripheral radial location as this behaviour indicates centre to periphery progression in cleaning of the fibers it is likely that the higher flow rates measured towards the module s centre e g fig 5 d3 and e3 result in better penetration of the naoh cleaning solution into the more centrally located fibers during the soak cleaning procedure this may explain the appearance of residually fouled fibers towards the periphery of the membrane module which are subsequently difficult to clean due to the same fluid transport mechanisms which governed the successful cleaning of the more centrally located fibers further research is necessary to investigate how representative the observed fouling structure progression during cleaning is and how fouling and cleaning deviates from stochastic assumptions underlying fouling flora 1993 with each fiber treated independently of the structure of the fiber bundle and the membrane module these observations add important complementary information to studies performed on membrane modules in industry lin et al 2020 which observe progressive change in foulant composition along membrane stages and for targeted fouling control strategies which may be either position or foulant dependent in this respect the current research results complement previous non invasive observations of wetting patterns wypysek et al 2021 single ceramic hollow fiber alginate fouling arndt et al 2017 and seven channel hollow fibers filtration characteristics schuhmann et al 2019 simkins et al 2020 4 conclusions mri velocity imaging measurements of multi fiber hollow fiber membrane modules containing 401 fibers were performed after calcium alginate fouling and subsequent sodium hydroxide cleaning with and without soaking this led to the following conclusions mri data clearly showed the impact of alginate fouling on both fiber flow de activation i e fouled and re activation i e cleaned as consequence of foulant addition and subsequent cleaning protocol the fact that the distribution of volumetric flow in each fiber can be used to monitor the evolution of the module flow is novel allowing for detailed analysis of the extent of cleaning and residual fouling at each stage of the cleaning process this allows for the systematic study of the effectiveness of cleaning protocols using non invasive monitoring allowing for the potential of extended duration cleaning fouling studies of the same module resulting in important information about residual fouling and its impact on the long term usage of membrane modules which is of significant interest for chemical cleaning optimisation during the fouling stage of the experiments we observed that the fiber to fiber flowrate distribution broadens this shows that the fouling rate is not evenly distributed over the parallel fibers rather some fibers tend to clog and show a reduced flowrate while others remain open and show an increased flowrate monitoring of the fiber flowrate distribution during the cleaning steps revealed that initially there is an emergence of a further broadening bimodal distribution while after 10 h soaking eventually the original flow distribution was virtually restored this shows that relatively open fibers are cleaned more rapidly compared to clogged fibers thus dividing the fibers in a clean and a fouled cluster due to the slow cleaning rate of the clogged fibers a considerable effort is needed to completely restore a fouled module after the module was virtually restored the remaining fouled fibers are mainly located near the periphery of the fiber bundle indicating a preferential radial position for residual fouling after cleaning this observation suggests that hollow fiber membrane module design aspects such as fiber packing density or bundle size may play a role in the occurrence of irreversible fouling this study has demonstrated that velocity mri can be used to monitor the progression of fouling and cleaning within a hollow fiber module containing hundreds of individual fibers via the quantitative analysis of the volumetric flow within each fiber future research will focus on applying this fiber scale analysis to other types of fouling including biological and combined fouling such as occurs in practice between biological inorganic organic and particulate materials e g microplastics further developments of improve
