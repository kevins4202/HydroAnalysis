8755,we present a method using the material in the form of cross linked β cyclodextrin cd showing high efficiency in the simultaneous removal of hazardous pollutants from sewage such as diclofenac dic ibuprofen ibu ketoprofen keto naproxen napr salicylic acid sali and tramadol tram the material is stable and particularly easy to regenerate the sorbent probably remembers the shape of the contaminants which increases its sorption capacity after the second use the kinetics of the keto adsorption process from one two and three component solutions are well described by the pseudo second order model the maximum polymer capacity was 162 60 mg g 1 the interactions of keto with cd were investigated indicating that the main sorption mechanism is based on supramolecular interaction and uptake by a polymer network the material is not sensitive to low ph and high salinity so it can be used for the treatment of dic ibu and keto post production wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals shape memory polymers adsorption sewage 1 introduction pharmaceutical industry wastewaters are high variability of composition due to the wide spectrum of manufactured drugs 1 2 moreover the wastewater streams generated during production are characterized by relatively high concentrations of pharmacologically active substances api 3 often they have a very low or high ph usually before entering the activated sludge chambers their composition is averaged by mixing in a homogenizer and ph correction in a neutralizer 4 at this stage many pharmaceuticals precipitate out and become less bioavailable 5 this phenomenon can be counteracted by subjecting the post production streams to preliminary treatment the most commonly used are advanced oxidation processes aop 6 10 membrane 11 14 and adsorption methods 15 17 in the first case mineralization is very rarely achieved typically the drug is converted into other derivatives that may be less environmentally friendly than the native substance 18 19 the use of appropriate membranes seems to be a better resolution disregarding the high cost the contaminants are obtained in a form that is easier to dispose of due to the significantly reduced volume 20 21 adsorption produces give a similar effect with much less investment in the pharmaceutical industry activated carbon ac is most often used both in the product purification stage and in the removal of impurities from waste streams 22 33 the most important advantages of ac include a large specific surface area and the ability to bind both organic and inorganic compounds the disadvantages include separation and regeneration problems especially when using ac in powder form and final disposal 34 waste ac usually undergoes combustion 35 this process is difficult to carry out due to the lack of volatile components and therefore a supply of steam and oxygen is required thus creating the conditions for gasification 36 the described procedure is far from green technology and requires the implementation of new ones a solution that is currently very popular is organic adsorbents derived from renewable raw materials 37 39 this group includes both dried and shredded plant waste 40 41 as well as cellulose 42 44 chitosan 45 48 and cyclodextrins cd 49 51 the latter is quite soluble and requires appropriate modification the selection of appropriate cross linking agents enables the synthesis of an adsorbent tailored to the size of a single or a group of pollutants 52 54 the basis of sorption is supramolecular interactions produced by van der waals forces hydrogen bonds and molecular fit of guest pollutant molecule to host cd 53 55 cds are cyclic compounds composed of 6 7 or 8 glucose units linked by α 1 4 acetal bonds 56 57 the torus is hydrophobic on the inside and hydrophilic on the outside 58 the hydrophobic parts of the organic compounds are contained inside the torus or if the structure of the polymer allows it also in the resulting network usually the materials are durable regeneration is simple 59 61 and the spent polymer can potentially be broken down during composting for example 62 63 this paper presents the possibility of removing ketoprofen directly from post production wastewater streams subsequent experiments show that the composition of wastewater has a significant impact on the efficiency of drug removal this research can help manage streams going to the homogenizer in industrial wastewater treatment plants the presented material may also find application in the treatment of municipal wastewater from non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid and painkillers 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and techniques hexamethylene diisocyanate 1 6 hmdi 99 β cyclodextrin β cd 97 pyridine

nmr spectra were recorded in d2o on a bruker advance iii hd 400 mhz spectrometer at 25 c the concentrations of api were determined by ultraviolet spectra detected by high pressure liquid

initial concentration and concentration at time t of api in the sample 2 4 adsorption procedure the experiments were performed at room temperature on a digital vortex mixer ohaus vxhddg at 700 rpm after shaking the adsorbent was separated from the solution by filtration whatman grade 540 filter paper and the concentration of the filtrate c e was determined the influence of the adsorbent quantity was initially investigated for this purpose β cd hmdi in an amount of 1 100 mg was added to 5 ml of keto solution in plastic falcon tubes 7 ml then the influence of electrolytes and humic acids as well as ph 2 to 10 corrected with naoh or hcl was investigated using a previously selected dose of the adsorbent each time three sets of experiments were carried out at the keto 20 mg l 1 the contact time of 60 min 2 5 kinetic equilibrium studies and thermodynamic analysis kinetic and equilibrium experiments were performed under optimal experimental conditions in the first one the keto 20 mg l 1 solution was used and in the second keto 1 100 mg l 1 the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics data were analyzed using the models presented in tables s4 and s6 the tables also show the relevant mathematical relations of these models the parameters to be valued and the dependable references the reliability of the results was considered based on the analysis of variance anova test 2 6 real wastewater treatment 2 6 1 api s post production effluents many methods for synthesizing ketoprofen can be found in the literature 75 80 however not all of them are suitable for industrial purposes which explains the continued use of the syntheses described in patents from the past century 75 81 82 fig 1 shows two examples of the reactions carried out under industrial conditions their common feature is usually an alkaline hydrolysis step carried out in an organic solvent environment which is then distilled the resulting drug is in the form of a salt from which it is released the resulting solution of the drug in the solvent is washed repeatedly with water and solutions of different ph the combination of these streams produces saline and usually acidic wastewater a similar situation is observed during the production of diclofenac 83 the exception is the ibuprofen system which is considered to be waste free 84 the information in the literature has become a determinant of the composition of model post production leachates ep which were prepared by dissolving dic ibu and keto 0 4 mmol l 1 in a hydrochloric acid solution of sodium chloride ph 2 763 mg l 1 2 6 2 wastewaters model wastewater was obtained by dissolving individual apis 0 4 mmol l 1 in treated municipal wastewater mw the description of mw is shown in table s1 the resulting mixtures can successfully mimic the feedstock for the next treatment step based on adsorption 2 6 3 multicomponent wastewaters mix ternary blends were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the respective dic ibu and keto solutions in mw seven component effluents were obtained analogously by mixing all the solutions of the drugs under study the aforementioned model effluents 50 ml were poured into falcon type plastic tubes containing 50 mg each of β cd hmdi the vials were sealed tightly and the mixtures were shaken in a digital vortex mixer at 700 rpm for 1 h at 25 c the supernatant was then collected and filtered the concentration at adsorption equilibrium of each was measured by hplc 2 7 regeneration 100 mg of β cd hmdi was added to 50 ml of keto solution initial 20 mg l 1 the mixture was shaken in a digital vortex mixer at 700 rpm 25 c 1 h after 1 h the solution was decanted from the surface of the precipitate and in its place 20 ml of methanol was added soaking for 15 min the procedure was repeated in distilled water the adsorption desorption experiment was performed five times 3 result and discussion the synthesized material is characterized by a high degree of cross linking the basic sorbent unit consists of three β cd molecules in a single β cd a total of 21 primary hydroxyl groups are available 16 of which are substituted significantly only 14 are embedded in urethane bonds and two in allophanate bonds the resulting material is amphiphilic having both rigid and flexible elements fig s13 so it can easily adapt to the structure of the adsorbed drug the bet surface area of β cd hmdi is 7 31 m2 g 1 the average pore size is 16 8 nm and the total pore volume is 3 08 ml g 1 the average particle size of β cd hmdi varieties is from 270 to 600 μm valued by sem fig s2 the particles have a divergent porous structure the material is thermally stable at temperatures below 250 c after which decomposition follows the final weight loss is observed at 333 c 61 82 the zeta potential ξ of β cd hmdi in the ph range from 2 to 11 is 0 for ph 2 53 and above this value it is constantly negative the material does not permanently retain water and does not tend to swell more information on the sugar adsorbent can be found in the publication 68 3 1 adsorption experiments the adsorption studies were carried out conventionally examining the influence of individual parameters on the course of the process the obtained results are discussed in subsequent subsections 3 1 1 effect of adsorbent mass it can be considered that overall an increase in the mass of the sorbent 0 2 20 g l 1 is accompanied by an increase in the degree of removal of api from the solution which is certainly typical nevertheless in the case of keto it reaches minimums and maximums which indicate probably the formation of new equilibria fig 2 a a significant excess of api in the solution compared to the initial amount of β cd hmdi causes a rapid equilibrium state where the q e limits of 65 42 mg g 1 fig 2b therefore to be able to investigate the kinetics of the sorption process no minimum amount of material but 10 mg was used in the next stage the ph of the api solutions 20 mg l 1 was not corrected 3 1 2 effect of contact time the adsorption processes are required to run efficiently in a relatively short time to reduce the cost of the unit operation the time in which the maximum removal of the desired component from solution was achieved depends on the kinetics of the process which is predominantly influenced by the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and adsorbate in the keto question the required state was achieved in between 5 min and 24 h depending on the material used 85 87 two compartments can be distinguished in the analyzed system the first one lasting 30 min is dynamic then it slows down significantly the result is a 40 62 removal of keto in 60 min fig 2c 3 1 3 effect of api initial concentration the initial concentration is the driving force needed to overcome the resistance to mass transfer between the aqueous and solid phases at the first moment of contact β cd hmdi has the largest number of centers capable of interacting with the components of the liquid phase which usually results in a high adsorption efficiency observed at the lowest concentration of 1 mg l 1 a higher concentration may create an additional barrier to overcome in the form of already accumulated keto particles or api transfer from solution to solid hence the involvement of deeper structures is partial and consequently the ineffectiveness of api removal is observed the concentration of 20 mg l 1 was selected for further research fig 2e 3 1 4 effect of ph keto contains a ph sensitive carboxyl group in a solution with ph 3 the degree of api removal is the highest and amounts to almost 61 fig 2f then it gradually decreases with increasing ph assuming the lowest value for ph 6 rme 17 55 after which when exceeded there is an almost two fold increase to ph 9 the electrokinetic potential of the various dispersed phases depends largely on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the case of the tested material the electrokinetic potential is zero at ph 2 53 this value corresponds to the highest degree of keto removal fig s3 this is an area close to the complete disappearance of anticoagulant electrostatic repulsion considering that the final ph of the effluent from keto production is acidic and the drug content is at the level of several dozen mg the resulting material can potentially be used to remove the drug from this stream before it is sent to the on site sewage treatment plant 81 however to restore normal adsorption conditions the ph of the keto solutions was not adjusted in further tests and was 4 21 3 1 5 effect of salts humic and fulvic acids the salts present in the wastewater can significantly affect the sorption of drugs in the case of keto both sodium and calcium chloride increase the removal efficiency of the drug by several percent even high salinity mustn t adversely affect the sorption process which means that β cd hmdi can potentially be used during the treatment of neutralized post production wastewater the presence of humic and fulvic acids is typical for surface waters and may be of great importance when removing keto from the natural environment these compounds have little effect on the value of the rme parameter in the range of low concentrations the effect increases with increasing concentration resulting in a reduction in the degree of keto removal by 5 fig 2g 3 1 6 regeneration the presented material contains elements of different elasticity enabling a better adjustment of the material structure to the shape of the adsorbate the initial structure of β cd hmdi was formed by a pyridine matrix which was removed in the purification step during the first sorption the material is reorganized and arranged according to the structure of the guest molecule the new system is not fully formed but does not fail under mild methanol desorption conditions during the next two cycles adsorption desorption the new polymer system is remembered and the process becomes more efficient fig 2h the low boiling point of alcohol and the lack of azeotropes with water make the regeneration stage relatively cheap and waste free the regeneration process must be very effective and simple in industrial conditions it is enough to place the sorbent in the mixer with post production effluents after an appropriate time it is enough to drain the treated sewage and replace it with methanol after only 15 min the solvent phase can also be drained and sent to the distillation tower and the material itself can be washed with water the operation does not need to be repeated aqueous washings can also be used repeatedly after removing residual methanol scheme s1 3 1 7 removal of pollutants from a complex model mixture the presence of additional drugs such as dic and ibu increases the removal efficiency of the individually tested api from model solutions this effect is strongest with dic which is removed from the solution with an efficiency of 24 7 in the absence of other drugs in the case of a mixture containing all tested pharmaceuticals the effectiveness increases up to 86 6 the observed synergism of these drug adsorption is an unquestionable advantage of β cd hmdi and has the potential to be used in the treatment of combined post production wastewater from the simultaneous manufacture of these medicines fig 3 a and b and scheme s1 3 1 8 adsorption of pharmaceuticals present in biologically treated sewage of municipal type and post productions streams the composition of the wastewater depends on the source of its formation two cases of mixtures containing api were included in the research the first one with the ph 2 and sodium chloride 763 mg l 1 is the simulation of the keto adsorption process from post production effluents 81 the second is the removal of drugs from municipal wastewater first the effect of the matrices on the removal efficiency of single apis was determined followed by mixtures containing three or seven drugs concentration 0 3 mmol l 1 each components of municipal wastewater have a positive effect on the removal of api from wastewater containing single pharmaceuticals fig 3a the degree of keto removal is similar to that in the presence of salt and humic acids the phenomenon of low para adsorption is difficult to explain especially as it complexes with β cd fig s10 like other studies figs s6 s7 s8 s9 s11 s12 88 89 perhaps interactions under environmental conditions are unstable or the matrix contains more attractive substances the three component mixtures dic ibu and keto are noteworthy as they indicate the synergism of the mentioned compounds also under environmental conditions which effectively eliminates the influence of the matrices the result is a high removal rate for each drug slightly higher than that of distilled water solutions fig 3b the efficiency of removing these apis from synthetic production wastewater is impressively high for single production streams as well as their mixtures fig 3b cyclodextrin materials do not have functional groups sensitive to low ph and the hydrophobic interior is not attractive to salt hence the lack of sensitivity to the high salinity of the formed supramolecular complexes this could be expected based on the previously conducted studies on the effect of ph and sodium chloride on the sorption efficiency of the drug fig 2f and g β cd hmdi is a material whose action is based primarily on the formation of supramolecular complexes characterized by various durability it is no wonder that for more complex systems we can see completely different results such as for mixtures formed by dissolving dic ibu keto napr para sali and tram in water or wastewater respectively the apis used for comparison also belong to the group of hazardous pollutants commonly found in the natural environment which justifies the choice 90 93 the presence of seven pharmaceuticals in the mixture significantly reduced the influence of the matrix on adsorption compared to the one component systems the strongest interactions with the β cd hmdi surface are observed in the case of sali and tram which are removed with an efficiency of 72 7 and 52 1 respectively unfortunately the degree of removal of the remaining ones decreased in a relatively high concentration range fig 3c 3 1 9 adsorption isotherms the isotherm shown in fig 3d corresponds to type i the course of the isotherm reflects the basic assumptions of langmuir s theory that the adsorbent surface has many active sites and only one adsorbate molecule can adsorb to one active site the amount of adsorption initially increases in proportion to the concentration of the adsorbate then the increase gradually decreases and the adsorption becomes constant all active places are occupied and a monolayer is formed a larger amount of the adsorbate particles cannot be adsorbed on the adsorbent surface using the nonlinear and linear form of the langmuir equation the maximum adsorption capacity q m a x was determined amounting to 129 70 mg l 1 and 131 23 mg l 1 respectively this value is higher than that resulting from the β cd content in the polymer structure 54 68 which indicates the existence of non supramolecular interactions an important addition to the langmuir isotherm is the dimensionless separation factor r l the calculated value shows the privileged course of the process 0 r l 1 table s4 the freundlich model was also used to eliminate or confirm multilayer adsorption involving inhomogeneous surfaces with non uniform heat distribution of adsorption the parameter n which is decisive for the quality of the adsorption process was estimated based on its linear form when its value is in the range of 1 10 the process is preferable in that case however the determined statistical coefficients indicate a worse fit of the experimental points to the model table s5 the sips model is a sense of balance to those described and works well for localized adsorption without adsorbate adsorbate interaction 94 95 as c e approaches a low value the sips isotherm transforms into freundlich and at high c e into langmuir the sips isotherm equation is also characterized by the dimensionless heterogeneity coefficient n which can be used to describe the heterogeneity of the system if the value of n is from 0 to 1 in the case under consideration n 0 71 nonlinear and n 1 43 linear the linear model may show a relationship between adsorbent and adsorbed molecules the β cd hmdi keto system is perfectly suited to the sips model as evidenced by the error analysis and the value of the linear regression coefficient table s5 based on the nonlinear and linear form of the sips isotherm the value of q m a x 161 13 mg l 1 and q m a x 162 60 mg l 1 was determined which is higher than that resulting from the langmuir equation this obtained q m a x value was compared with the maximum sorption capacity of other sorbent materials for keto reported in the literature and presented in table 1 of these only nitrogen doped reduced graphene has a higher q m a x than β cd hmdi it should be noted that in the case of β cd hmdi the adsorption process is more efficient considering the short adsorption time and five times the lower specific surface area in addition β cd hmdi maintains a constant sorption capacity in subsequent cycles and the regeneration itself is fast and simple 3 1 10 thermodynamic analysis the obtained negative value of δh means that the process is exothermic and proceeds with energy release negative δg values point to unprompted and thermodynamically favorable processes as well as an affinity of the adsorbate for the adsorbent 101 positive values of δs specify a high preference for the adsorbate molecules on the adsorbent surface 102 table s5 3 2 kinetic models seven classical models of adsorption kinetics were used to fit the data pseudo first order pseudo second order elovic modified freundlich weber morris intramolecular diffusion bangham pore diffusion and liquid layer diffusion table s5 considering the fit to the model based on the statistical analysis it can be concluded that the pseudo first order model best describes the adsorption of keto r 2 0 998 table s7 nevertheless the value of q e estimated based on this model deviates significantly from the experimental value fig 2d which is close to q e calculated from the pseudo second order model table s6 three more models were used to determine the limiting stage of the process the results obtained after fitting the experimental data to these models indicate that the diffusion of the boundary layer film and inside the surface of solid particles pores substances dissolved in the solution are equally important a long time to reach the adsorption equilibrium approx 1 h may indicate that internal diffusion dominates the overall adsorption kinetics to confirm unequivocal information about the reaction rate limitation the assumptions of weber and morris based on an internal diffusion model 103 104 were used this model describes the equation shown in table s6 t h e k i d is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and c is the layer thickness the higher the value of c the greater the influence of the boundary layer on the adsorption process if the rate limiting factor is diffusion inside the particles then the dependence of the square root function q t on the time t 1 2 is a straight line passing through the origin of the coordinate system i e c 0 in the case under consideration c 1 05 which markers that the rate limiting factor is the boundary layer film controlled by the diffusion process table s7 additional applied elovic and modified freundlich models during fitting experimental data were linear over the entire range and the slopes describing the modified freundlich kinetic model significantly below the value of unity confirm the chemisorption of keto at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 table s7 the presence of additional apis results in a better fit to the pseudo second order kinetic model of each of the drugs under consideration table s8 two component mixtures are characterized by a significantly higher rate of removal of organic compounds and better use of the specific surface area of the material fig s5 in the case of three component mixtures the highest degree of drug removal is observed as well as adsorption rates fig s5 and table s8 dic pseudo second order reaction constant k 2 d i c increases almost 581 fold k 2 i b u 7 7 fold and k 2 k e t o 72 fold respectively conceivably this phenomenon is accompanied by changes in the structure of the material which make it possible to significantly accelerate the adsorption of the most spatial molecules i e dic 3 3 mechanism of adsorption to put it simply all tested pharmaceuticals form supramolecular complexes with β cd both in the solid phase and in aqueous solutions 88 105 108 so they should also be retained in the β cd hmdi structure six out of seven do the exception is paracetamol which forms a 3 2 stoichiometry complex with cd in aqueous solutions fig s10 the formation of a multi component complex requires the appropriate mutual arrangement of the molecules that make up the compound cross linking significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the β cd rings and requires a different arrangement consequently the interactions are so weak that para is equally quickly adsorbed and desorbed in the sorption process the stoichiometry of the resulting complex is not the only significant component sali in aqueous solutions also forms 3 2 complexes with β cd fig s11 and interestingly shows the highest affinity for the material in both aqueous solutions and sewage the explanation should be sought in the arrangement of the functional groups most likely the aromatic rings of the acid are located in the β cd tori while its functional groups located in the ortho position to each other are involved in the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds with other elements of the sorbent structure the remaining apis show greater lipophilicity due to the presence of aliphatic or aromatic substituents thereby increasing the number of possible structures fig s6 s12 and s13 for example the phenolic substituent keto is complexed through the interior of the cd the second ring interacts with the aliphatic chain of the lattice and the carboxyl group is involved in hydrogen bonding with the urethane or allophanate moiety fig s13 4 conclusions the paper presents a material that contrary to the commonly used activated carbons in the form of a powder is easily separated and regenerated it is durable and can work in environmental conditions the sorption capacity remains unchanged after the next five regeneration cycles despite the small specific surface area of the material a high degree of keto removal from model post production effluents is achieved during the simultaneous removal of diclofenac ibuprofen and ketoprofen even in concentrations much higher than those found in the natural environment which allows it to be used in industrial conditions the outflow of streams from municipal wastewater treatment plants containing the above mentioned drugs can be successfully purified achieving efficiencies in removing diclofenac ibuprofen and ketoprofen of 95 82 and 78 respectively even higher efficiency of the pre treatment can be obtained in industrial conditions by combining the streams of the above mentioned apis 100 dic 99 ibu and 97 keto the presence of additional other nsaids and analgesics in the wastewater modifies the adsorption profile and the preferred adsorbent compounds are mainly salicylic acid tramadol and diclofenac for which the removal efficiencies are 72 52 and 44 respectively credit authorship contribution statement anna skwierawska conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis validation writing original draft

8755,we present a method using the material in the form of cross linked β cyclodextrin cd showing high efficiency in the simultaneous removal of hazardous pollutants from sewage such as diclofenac dic ibuprofen ibu ketoprofen keto naproxen napr salicylic acid sali and tramadol tram the material is stable and particularly easy to regenerate the sorbent probably remembers the shape of the contaminants which increases its sorption capacity after the second use the kinetics of the keto adsorption process from one two and three component solutions are well described by the pseudo second order model the maximum polymer capacity was 162 60 mg g 1 the interactions of keto with cd were investigated indicating that the main sorption mechanism is based on supramolecular interaction and uptake by a polymer network the material is not sensitive to low ph and high salinity so it can be used for the treatment of dic ibu and keto post production wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals shape memory polymers adsorption sewage 1 introduction pharmaceutical industry wastewaters are high variability of composition due to the wide spectrum of manufactured drugs 1 2 moreover the wastewater streams generated during production are characterized by relatively high concentrations of pharmacologically active substances api 3 often they have a very low or high ph usually before entering the activated sludge chambers their composition is averaged by mixing in a homogenizer and ph correction in a neutralizer 4 at this stage many pharmaceuticals precipitate out and become less bioavailable 5 this phenomenon can be counteracted by subjecting the post production streams to preliminary treatment the most commonly used are advanced oxidation processes aop 6 10 membrane 11 14 and adsorption methods 15 17 in the first case mineralization is very rarely achieved typically the drug is converted into other derivatives that may be less environmentally friendly than the native substance 18 19 the use of appropriate membranes seems to be a better resolution disregarding the high cost the contaminants are obtained in a form that is easier to dispose of due to the significantly reduced volume 20 21 adsorption produces give a similar effect with much less investment in the pharmaceutical industry activated carbon ac is most often used both in the product purification stage and in the removal of impurities from waste streams 22 33 the most important advantages of ac include a large specific surface area and the ability to bind both organic and inorganic compounds the disadvantages include separation and regeneration problems especially when using ac in powder form and final disposal 34 waste ac usually undergoes combustion 35 this process is difficult to carry out due to the lack of volatile components and therefore a supply of steam and oxygen is required thus creating the conditions for gasification 36 the described procedure is far from green technology and requires the implementation of new ones a solution that is currently very popular is organic adsorbents derived from renewable raw materials 37 39 this group includes both dried and shredded plant waste 40 41 as well as cellulose 42 44 chitosan 45 48 and cyclodextrins cd 49 51 the latter is quite soluble and requires appropriate modification the selection of appropriate cross linking agents enables the synthesis of an adsorbent tailored to the size of a single or a group of pollutants 52 54 the basis of sorption is supramolecular interactions produced by van der waals forces hydrogen bonds and molecular fit of guest pollutant molecule to host cd 53 55 cds are cyclic compounds composed of 6 7 or 8 glucose units linked by α 1 4 acetal bonds 56 57 the torus is hydrophobic on the inside and hydrophilic on the outside 58 the hydrophobic parts of the organic compounds are contained inside the torus or if the structure of the polymer allows it also in the resulting network usually the materials are durable regeneration is simple 59 61 and the spent polymer can potentially be broken down during composting for example 62 63 this paper presents the possibility of removing ketoprofen directly from post production wastewater streams subsequent experiments show that the composition of wastewater has a significant impact on the efficiency of drug

initial concentration and concentration at time t of api in the sample 2 4 adsorption procedure the experiments were performed at room temperature on a digital vortex mixer ohaus vxhddg at 700 rpm after shaking the adsorbent was separated from the solution by filtration whatman grade 540 filter paper and the concentration of the filtrate c e was determined the influence of the adsorbent quantity was initially investigated for this purpose β cd hmdi in an amount of 1 100 mg was added to 5 ml of keto solution in plastic falcon tubes 7 ml then the influence of electrolytes and humic acids as well as ph 2 to 10 corrected with naoh or hcl was investigated using a previously selected dose of the adsorbent each time three sets of experiments were carried out at the keto 20 mg l 1 the contact time of 60 min 2 5 kinetic equilibrium studies and thermodynamic analysis kinetic and equilibrium experiments were performed under optimal experimental conditions in the first one the keto 20 mg l 1 solution was used and in the second keto 1 100 mg l 1 the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics data were analyzed using the models presented in tables s4 and s6 the tables also show the relevant mathematical relations of these models the parameters to be valued and the dependable references the reliability of the results was considered based on the analysis of variance anova test 2 6 real wastewater treatment 2 6 1 api s post production effluents many methods for synthesizing ketoprofen can be found in the literature 75 80 however not all of them are suitable for industrial purposes which explains the continued use of the syntheses described in patents from the past century 75 81 82 fig 1 shows two examples of the reactions carried out under industrial conditions their common feature is usually an alkaline hydrolysis step carried out in an organic solvent environment which is then distilled the resulting drug is in the form of a salt from which it is released the resulting solution of the drug in the solvent is washed repeatedly with water and solutions of different ph the combination of these streams produces saline and usually acidic wastewater a similar situation is observed during the production of diclofenac 83 the exception is the ibuprofen system which is considered to be waste free 84 the information in the literature has become a determinant of the composition of model post production leachates ep which were prepared by dissolving dic ibu and keto 0 4 mmol l 1 in a hydrochloric acid solution of sodium chloride ph 2 763 mg l 1 2 6 2 wastewaters model wastewater was obtained by dissolving individual apis 0 4 mmol l 1 in treated municipal wastewater mw the description of mw is shown in table s1 the resulting mixtures can successfully mimic the feedstock for the next treatment step based on adsorption 2 6 3 multicomponent wastewaters mix ternary blends were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the respective dic ibu and keto solutions in mw seven component effluents were obtained analogously by mixing all the solutions of the drugs under study the aforementioned model effluents 50 ml were poured into falcon type plastic tubes containing 50 mg each of β cd hmdi the vials were sealed tightly and the mixtures were shaken in a digital vortex mixer at 700 rpm for 1 h at 25 c the supernatant was then collected and filtered the concentration at adsorption equilibrium of each was measured by hplc 2 7 regeneration 100 mg of β cd hmdi was added to 50 ml of keto solution initial 20 mg l 1 the mixture was shaken in a digital vortex mixer at 700 rpm 25 c 1 h after 1 h the solution was decanted from the surface of the precipitate and in its place 20 ml of methanol was added soaking for 15 min the procedure was repeated in distilled water the adsorption desorption experiment was performed five times 3 result and discussion the synthesized material is characterized by a high degree of cross linking the basic sorbent unit consists of three β cd molecules in a single β cd a total of 21 primary hydroxyl groups are available 16 of which are substituted significantly only 14 are embedded in urethane bonds and two in allophanate bonds the resulting material is amphiphilic having both rigid and flexible elements fig s13 so it can easily adapt to the structure of the adsorbed drug the bet surface area of β cd hmdi is 7 31 m2 g 1 the average pore size is 16 8 nm and the total pore volume is 3 08 ml g 1 the average particle size of β cd hmdi varieties is from 270 to 600 μm valued by sem fig s2 the particles have a divergent porous structure the material is thermally stable at temperatures below 250 c after which decomposition follows the final weight loss is observed at 333 c 61 82 the zeta potential ξ of β cd hmdi in the ph range from 2 to 11 is 0 for ph 2 53 and above this value it is constantly negative the material does not permanently retain water and does not tend to swell more information on the sugar adsorbent can be found in the publication 68 3 1 adsorption experiments the adsorption studies were carried out conventionally examining the influence of individual parameters on the course of the process the obtained results are discussed in subsequent subsections 3 1 1 effect of adsorbent mass it can be considered that overall an increase in the mass of the sorbent 0 2 20 g l 1 is accompanied by an increase in the degree of removal of api from the solution which is certainly typical nevertheless in the case of keto it reaches minimums and maximums which indicate probably the formation of new equilibria fig 2 a a significant excess of api in the solution compared to the initial amount of β cd hmdi causes a rapid equilibrium state where the q e limits of 65 42 mg g 1 fig 2b therefore to be able to investigate the kinetics of the sorption process no minimum amount of material but 10 mg was used in the next stage the ph of the api solutions 20 mg l 1 was not corrected 3 1 2 effect of contact time the adsorption processes are required to run efficiently in a relatively short time to reduce the cost of the unit operation the time in which the maximum removal of the desired component from solution was achieved depends on the kinetics of the process which is predominantly influenced by the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and adsorbate in the keto question the required state was achieved in between 5 min and 24 h depending on the material used 85 87 two compartments can be distinguished in the analyzed system the first one lasting 30 min is dynamic then it slows down significantly the result is a 40 62 removal of keto in 60 min fig 2c 3 1 3 effect of api initial concentration the initial concentration is the driving force needed to overcome the resistance to mass transfer between the aqueous and solid phases at the first moment of contact β cd hmdi has the largest number of centers capable of interacting with the components of the liquid phase which usually results in a high adsorption efficiency observed at the lowest concentration of 1 mg l 1 a higher concentration may create an additional barrier to overcome in the form of already accumulated keto particles or api transfer from solution to solid hence the involvement of deeper structures is partial and consequently the ineffectiveness of api removal is observed the concentration of 20 mg l 1 was selected for further research fig 2e 3 1 4 effect of ph keto contains a ph sensitive carboxyl group in a solution with ph 3 the degree of api removal is the highest and amounts to almost 61 fig 2f then it gradually decreases with increasing ph assuming the lowest value for ph 6 rme 17 55 after which when exceeded there is an almost two fold increase to ph 9 the electrokinetic potential of the various dispersed phases depends largely on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the case of the tested material the electrokinetic potential is zero at ph 2 53 this value corresponds to the highest degree of keto removal fig s3 this is an area close to the complete disappearance of anticoagulant electrostatic repulsion considering that the final ph of the effluent from keto production is acidic and the drug content is at the level of several dozen mg the resulting material can potentially be used to remove the drug from this stream before it is sent to the on site sewage treatment plant 81 however to restore normal adsorption conditions the ph of the keto solutions was not adjusted in further tests and was 4 21 3 1 5 effect of salts humic and fulvic acids the salts present in the wastewater can significantly affect the sorption of drugs in the case of keto both sodium and calcium chloride increase the removal efficiency of the drug by several percent even high salinity mustn t adversely affect the sorption process which means that β cd hmdi can potentially be used during the treatment of neutralized post production wastewater the presence of humic and fulvic acids is typical for surface waters and may be of great importance when removing keto from the natural environment these compounds have little effect on the value of the rme parameter in the range of low concentrations the effect increases with increasing concentration resulting in a reduction in the degree of keto removal by 5 fig 2g 3 1 6 regeneration the presented material contains elements of different elasticity enabling a better adjustment of the material structure to the shape of the adsorbate the initial structure of β cd hmdi was formed by a pyridine matrix which was removed in the purification step during the first sorption the material is reorganized and arranged according to the structure of the guest molecule the new system is not fully formed but does not fail under mild methanol desorption conditions during the next two cycles adsorption desorption the new polymer system is remembered and the process becomes more efficient fig 2h the low boiling point of alcohol and the lack of azeotropes with water make the regeneration stage relatively cheap and waste free the regeneration process must be very effective and simple in industrial conditions it is enough to place the sorbent in the mixer with post production effluents after an appropriate time it is enough to drain the treated sewage and replace it with methanol after only 15 min the solvent phase can also be drained and sent to the distillation tower and the material itself can be washed with water the operation does not need to be repeated aqueous washings can also be used repeatedly after removing residual methanol scheme s1 3 1 7 removal of pollutants from a complex model mixture the presence of additional drugs such as dic and ibu increases the removal efficiency of the individually tested api from model solutions this effect is strongest with dic which is removed from the solution with an efficiency of 24 7 in the absence of other drugs in the case of a mixture containing all tested pharmaceuticals the effectiveness increases up to 86 6 the observed synergism of these drug adsorption is an unquestionable advantage of β cd hmdi and has the potential to be used in the treatment of combined post production wastewater from the simultaneous manufacture of these medicines fig 3 a and b and scheme s1 3 1 8 adsorption of pharmaceuticals present in biologically treated sewage of municipal type and post productions streams the composition of the wastewater depends on the source of its formation two cases of mixtures containing api were included in the research the first one with the ph 2 and sodium chloride 763 mg l 1 is the simulation of the keto adsorption process from post production effluents 81 the second is the removal of drugs from municipal wastewater first the effect of the matrices on the removal efficiency of single apis was determined followed by mixtures containing three or seven drugs concentration 0 3 mmol l 1 each components of municipal wastewater have a positive effect on the removal of api from wastewater containing single pharmaceuticals fig 3a the degree of keto removal is similar to that in the presence of salt and humic acids the phenomenon of low para adsorption is difficult to explain especially as it complexes with β cd fig s10 like other studies figs s6 s7 s8 s9 s11 s12 88 89 perhaps interactions under environmental conditions are unstable or the matrix contains more attractive substances the three component mixtures dic ibu and keto are noteworthy as they indicate the synergism of the mentioned compounds also under environmental conditions which effectively eliminates the influence of the matrices the result is a high removal rate for each drug slightly higher than that of distilled water solutions fig 3b the efficiency of removing these apis from synthetic production wastewater is impressively high for single production streams as well as their mixtures fig 3b cyclodextrin materials do not have functional groups sensitive to low ph and the hydrophobic interior is not attractive to salt hence the lack of sensitivity to the high salinity of the formed supramolecular complexes this could be expected based on the previously conducted studies on the effect of ph and sodium chloride on the sorption efficiency of the drug fig 2f and g β cd hmdi is a material whose action is based primarily on the formation of supramolecular complexes characterized by various durability it is no wonder that for more complex systems we can see completely different results such as for mixtures formed by dissolving dic ibu keto napr para sali and tram in water or wastewater respectively the apis used for comparison also belong to the group of hazardous pollutants commonly found in the natural environment which justifies the choice 90 93 the presence of seven pharmaceuticals in the mixture significantly reduced the influence of the matrix on adsorption compared to the one component systems the strongest interactions with the β cd hmdi surface are observed in the case of sali and tram which are removed with an efficiency of 72 7 and 52 1 respectively unfortunately the degree of removal of the remaining ones decreased in a relatively high concentration range fig 3c 3 1 9 adsorption isotherms the isotherm shown in fig 3d corresponds to type i the course of the isotherm reflects the basic assumptions of langmuir s theory that the adsorbent surface has many active sites and only one adsorbate molecule can adsorb to one active site the amount of adsorption initially increases in proportion to the concentration of the adsorbate then the increase gradually decreases and the adsorption becomes constant all active places are occupied and a monolayer is formed a larger amount of the adsorbate particles cannot be adsorbed on the adsorbent surface using the nonlinear and linear form of the langmuir equation the maximum adsorption capacity q m a x was determined amounting to 129 70 mg l 1 and 131 23 mg l 1 respectively this value is higher than that resulting from the β cd content in the polymer structure 54 68 which indicates the existence of non supramolecular interactions an important addition to the langmuir isotherm is the dimensionless separation factor r l the calculated value shows the privileged course of the process 0 r l 1 table s4 the freundlich model was also used to eliminate or confirm multilayer adsorption involving inhomogeneous surfaces with non uniform heat distribution of adsorption the parameter n which is decisive for the quality of the adsorption process was estimated based on its linear form when its value is in the range of 1 10 the process is preferable in that case however the determined statistical coefficients indicate a worse fit of the experimental points to the model table s5 the sips model is a sense of balance to those described and works well for localized adsorption without adsorbate adsorbate interaction 94 95 as c e approaches a low value the sips isotherm transforms into freundlich and at high c e into langmuir the sips isotherm equation is also characterized by the dimensionless heterogeneity coefficient n which can be used to describe the heterogeneity of the system if the value of n is from 0 to 1 in the case under consideration n 0 71 nonlinear and n 1 43 linear the linear model may show a relationship between adsorbent and adsorbed molecules the β cd hmdi keto system is perfectly suited to the sips model as evidenced by the error analysis and the value of the linear regression coefficient table s5 based on the nonlinear and linear form of the sips isotherm the value of q m a x 161 13 mg l 1 and q m a x 162 60 mg l 1 was determined which is higher than that resulting from the langmuir equation this obtained q m a x value was compared with the maximum sorption capacity of other sorbent materials for keto reported in the literature and presented in table 1 of these only nitrogen doped reduced graphene has a higher q m a x than β cd hmdi it should be noted that in the case of β cd hmdi the adsorption process is more efficient considering the short adsorption time and five times the lower specific surface area in addition β cd hmdi maintains a constant sorption capacity in subsequent cycles and the regeneration itself is fast and simple 3 1 10 thermodynamic analysis the obtained negative value of δh means that the process is exothermic and proceeds with energy release negative δg values point to unprompted and thermodynamically favorable processes as well as an affinity of the adsorbate for the adsorbent 101 positive values of δs specify a high preference for the adsorbate molecules on the adsorbent surface 102 table s5 3 2 kinetic models seven classical models of adsorption kinetics were used to fit the data pseudo first order pseudo second order elovic modified freundlich weber morris intramolecular diffusion bangham pore diffusion and liquid layer diffusion table s5 considering the fit to the model based on the statistical analysis it can be concluded that the pseudo first order model best describes the adsorption of keto r 2 0 998 table s7 nevertheless the value of q e estimated based on this model deviates significantly from the experimental value fig 2d which is close to q e calculated from the pseudo second order model table s6 three more models were used to determine the limiting stage of the process the results obtained after fitting the experimental data to these models indicate that the diffusion of the boundary layer film and inside the surface of solid particles pores substances dissolved in the solution are equally important a long time to reach the adsorption equilibrium approx 1 h may indicate that internal diffusion dominates the overall adsorption kinetics to confirm unequivocal information about the reaction rate limitation the assumptions of weber and morris based on an internal diffusion model 103 104 were used this model describes the equation shown in table s6 t h e k i d is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and c is the layer thickness the higher the value of c the greater the influence of the boundary layer on the adsorption process if the rate limiting factor is diffusion inside the particles then the dependence of the square root function q t on the time t 1 2 is a straight line passing through the origin of the coordinate system i e c 0 in the case under consideration c 1 05 which markers that the rate limiting factor is the boundary layer film controlled by the diffusion process table s7 additional applied elovic and modified freundlich models during fitting experimental data were linear over the entire range and the slopes describing the modified freundlich kinetic model significantly below the value of unity confirm the chemisorption of keto at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 table s7 the presence of additional apis results in a better fit to the pseudo second order kinetic model of each of the drugs under consideration table s8 two component mixtures are characterized by a significantly higher rate of removal of organic compounds and better use of the specific surface area of the material fig s5 in the case of three component mixtures the highest degree of drug removal is observed as well as adsorption rates fig s5 and table s8 dic pseudo second order reaction constant k 2 d i c increases almost 581 fold k 2 i b u 7 7 fold and k 2 k e t o 72 fold respectively conceivably this phenomenon is accompanied by changes in the structure of the material which make it possible to significantly accelerate the adsorption of the most spatial molecules i e dic 3 3 mechanism of adsorption to put it simply all tested pharmaceuticals form supramolecular complexes with β cd both in the solid phase and in aqueous solutions 88 105 108 so they should also be retained in the β cd hmdi structure six out of seven do the exception is paracetamol which forms a 3 2 stoichiometry complex with cd in aqueous solutions fig s10 the formation of a multi component complex requires the appropriate mutual arrangement of the molecules that make up the compound cross linking significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the β cd rings and requires a different arrangement consequently the interactions are so weak that para is equally quickly adsorbed and desorbed in the sorption process the stoichiometry of the resulting complex is not the only significant component sali in aqueous solutions also forms 3 2 complexes with β cd fig s11 and interestingly shows the highest affinity for the material in both aqueous solutions and sewage the explanation should be sought in the arrangement of the functional groups most likely the aromatic rings of the acid are located in the β cd tori while its functional groups located in the ortho position to each other are involved in the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds with other elements of the sorbent structure the remaining apis show greater lipophilicity due to the presence of aliphatic or aromatic substituents thereby increasing the number of possible structures fig s6 s12 and s13 for example the phenolic substituent keto is complexed through the interior of the cd the second ring interacts with the aliphatic chain of the lattice and the carboxyl group is involved in hydrogen bonding with the urethane or allophanate moiety fig s13 4 conclusions the paper presents a material that contrary to the commonly used activated carbons in the form of a powder is easily separated and regenerated it is durable and can work in environmental conditions the sorption capacity remains unchanged after the next five regeneration cycles despite the small specific surface area of the material a high degree of keto removal from model post production effluents is achieved during the simultaneous removal of diclofenac ibuprofen and ketoprofen even in concentrations much higher than those found in the natural environment which allows it to be used in industrial conditions the outflow of streams from municipal wastewater treatment plants containing the above mentioned drugs can be successfully purified achieving efficiencies in removing diclofenac ibuprofen and ketoprofen of 95 82 and 78 respectively even higher efficiency of the pre treatment can be obtained in industrial conditions by combining the streams of the above mentioned apis 100 dic 99 ibu and 97 keto the presence of additional other nsaids and analgesics in the wastewater modifies the adsorption profile and the preferred adsorbent compounds are mainly salicylic acid tramadol and diclofenac for which the removal efficiencies are 72 52 and 44 respectively credit authorship contribution statement anna skwierawska conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis validation writing original draft

8756,water sterilisation requires the inactivation of waterborne pathogens like e coli to such low levels that its use will not cause illness here we examine a potential methodology for disinfecting water through the combined effect of hot expanding gases and shock waves from underwater explosions water pathogens located within the proximity of the explosive charge will be exposed to two different sterilisation conditions firstly the high pressure shock wave moving within the fluid and secondly the expanding hot n2 o2 and co2 bubbles that are products of the explosion to simulate the first case we used a flyer plate technique to understand the lower threshold for inactivation we did this with a novel capsule design in a single stage light gas gun and observed 0 813 logs of e coli inactivation after subjecting an entire bacterial broth to a minimum pressure of 3 53 gpa thereby indicating a lower threshold for shock pressure induced inactivation for the second case we show that hot gas bubbles from different explosive gaseous products at 150 c in a bubble column established the minimum gas temperature thresholds required to successfully inactivate e coli this work shows that any benefit of using explosives to sterilise water will principally come from the release of hot gaseous bubbles rather than the effect of the shock this new approach could be used in conflict areas or remote locations with no access to standard sterilisation technologies or power keywords shockwaves shock pressure hot gases plate impact technique escherichia coli inactivation 1 introduction explosives have been extensively used to destroy structures and break rock however the use of explosive materials is not limited to military mining and quarrying applications for example explosives have been successfully used for more than 100 years to extinguish fires in oil fields 1 furthermore artificial rain can be produced by dispersing silver iodide particles in the upper atmosphere at which point water droplets cluster around the particles to produce rain this process is known as cloud seeding and involves the use of anti aircraft rounds filled with silver iodide 1 the use of explosives for fishing also known as blast fishing has been employed for more than a century and is still in use in many countries around the world 2 there are however many other applications of explosives yet to be explored here we present a unique alternative use of explosives for the purpose of water sterilisation when an explosive detonates a shock wavefront is produced first this is followed by the release of large amounts of heat and gas temperatures can reach 3 000 5 000 c gases can expand 12 000 to 15 000 times and shockwaves can generate pressures of 5 45 gpa 3 therefore we propose a new way of sterilising e coli by underwater explosions this is driven by two principal phenomena shockwave formation and propagation and hot bubbles from gaseous products this work will explore what are the minimum requirements of these two phenomena and which is the principal mechanism that can be used to sterilise e coli with explosives 1 1 water sterilisation with shock waves the application of shockwaves and their ability to cause inactivation in microorganisms such as bacteria is of interest to several industries including water purification technology food safety and medicine induced shockwaves can be used as a potential methodology to purify water specifically in the desalination process which can remove up to 99 99 salt shockwaves can also be used to remove other water containing unhealthy minerals such as boron lead arsenic and copper and microbial pathogens 4 in the food industry shockwaves have been applied to tenderise meat 5 and offer an alternative to pasteurization techniques to preserve taste and protect heat sensitive products such as mothers milk 6 7 additionally shockwaves have been investigated as a method of destroying biofilms within patients to reduce the chances of infection post surgery 8 when a pressure wave travels through a medium faster than the medium s local speed of sound a discontinuity in pressure density and temperature is formed in the form of a shock wave there are multiple ways to deliver shocks within fluids and to the microorganisms that reside within them including explosions exploding wires electrical and plasma discharges and high speed impact experiments cavitation produces explosive microbubbles within the fluid that have localized areas of high pressure and temperature and upon collapse cause sharp jets of water to form which induce cell lysis through shearing the cell walls and consequently increasing cell inactivation this phenomenon has been employed with the introduction of additional microbubbles to enhance the death of a marine vibrio sp when applied with shockwaves in the context of preventing cross contamination of water from international shipping liners 9 although these methods produce additional natural phenomena to induce cell inactivation the same studies found that the shockwave itself and the resultant peak pressures are the main factors for achieving the inactivation to elucidate the role of the shock waves on microbial organisms we have conducted flyer plate impact experiments at impact velocities of 200 m s and 348 m s subjecting bacterial solutions of e coli to shock loading the bacterial solutions were contained in a novel capsule design 1 2 water sterilisation with hot bubbles from explosive gaseous products thermal inactivation of pathogens is one of the most widely used ways of disinfection the world health organisation who guidelines for drinking water quality compare thermal inactivation rates for different types of bacteria in hot liquids such studies show that at a water temperature of 60 c e coli needs 300 s to reach a 1 5 log unit reduction in viability 10 thermal inactivation of pathogens was effectively used by panchal et al 11 13 to pasteurise milk in a concentric tube type heat exchanger using the heat from a solar system the hot bubble column hbc technique has successfully desalinated seawater 14 and thermally inactivated viruses bacteria 15 protozoa and blue green algae found in piggery effluent using hot combustion gases and hot air 16 this previous use of hbc to inactivate pathogens in contaminated industrial water has established the foundations of this new study that will explore the sterilisation effect of heat and gaseous products from an underwater explosion a laboratory scale hbc 17 was identified to be fit for purpose for its capability of emulating the production of hot gas bubbles from the detonation of explosives such as co2 n2 o2 and their mixture in a controlled aquatic environment at 3 different temperatures 103 150 and 195 c the hbc utilizes its heat transfer efficiency to inactivate waterborne pathogens for water reuse without the need for boiling 18 it does so by transferring heat from the hot bubbles of 1 3 mm of diameter to the pathogen surfaces through collisions while keeping the water at a low temperature 19 the heat transfer rate between liquid and gas is 100 times more efficient in a gas liquid bubble column than in a single phase flow according to decker 20 the use of explosives in the water industry has been previously suggested by chen and yang 21 they pretreated sludge with shock waves generated with 25g of hexogen rdx in a pilot scale spherical explosion vessel e coli has been successfully inactivated using underwater shock waves 22 23 or hot gases in hbc 15 16 19 24 the research team here discusses these two effects for the first time that aims to understand the sterilisation capacity due to the detonation of an explosive underwater this is done by using two experimental techniques utilising the principles of hot bubbles generated in an hbc and shock waves generated by a single stage light gas gun impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental solution a solution with a 0 17 m concentration of nacl nacl 99 purity purchased from sigma aldrich in 300 ml milli q water was prepared and sterilised to avoid contamination by autoclaving in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi from 121 to 124 c for 15 min 2 2 preparation of growth culture medium the plate count method is commonly used for the detection of e coli in both wastewater and marine water the degree of contamination in water is assessed based on the ability of bacteria to propagate forming colonies in a layer of agar 25 an agar medium is commonly used for good visibility and high consistency of counts for each bacterial growth experiment an atcc broth 271 escherichia 26 was used as the base for the e coli culture this broth was made up of two component mediums a and b which are not commercially available medium a consists of 13 g of tryptone 1 g of yeast extract 6 g of nacl and 1 l of milli q water this medium was aseptically distributed into two vessels containing 1 41 agar and no agar respectively the agar used in the experiments was molecular biology grade from sigma aldrich the medium was heated to boiling to dissolve the agar and sterilised by autoclaving for 15 min in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi and 121 124 c medium b contains 1 g of glucose 0 01 g of thiamine and 50 ml of milli q water it was sterilised using a 0 22 μm filter to avoid any contamination after medium a cooled down to 50 c medium b was added in a proportion of 1 1 10 ml of this resulting 1 34 agar medium were poured into each petri dish 100 15 mm and dried above a bunsen burner to maintain local environmental sterility until the agar was not too dry nor too moist 2 3 bacterial strain and growth conditions escherichia coli migula castellani and chalmers atcc 15597 a biosafety level 1 organism was selected as a representative model for bacterial contamination in water 27 the overnight e coli culture was grown in 25 ml of the nutrient broth medium a without agar and medium b and incubated at 37 c for 24 h in a labtech digital incubator model lib 030 m with gentle shaking at 110 rpm using a psu 10i orbital shaker the total concentration of the overnight e coli culture was calculated by preparing 10 fold dilutions 0 50 ml of e coli from the stock solution were added to a tube containing 4 5 ml of 0 17 m nacl 10 1 tube the same operation was conducted for the rest of the 10 fold dilutions in the range of 10 2 to 10 10 this process was done around a bunsen burner to avoid any contamination 2 4 hot bubble column hbc setup for heat and gas sterilisation experiments to assess the inactivation effect of e coli collisions with hot gas bubbles from an explosion 27 l min of 4 different gases were pumped through an electrical heater the base of the bubble column was fitted with a 40 100 μm pore size glass sinter type 2 of 13 5 cm diameter 28 see fig 1 once the solutions with known concentrations of e coli were prepared different rounds of experiments with different gases mixture of gaseous products of explosives and the individual gases from the mixture o2 n2 and co2 and temperatures 103 150 and 195 c were conducted in the hbc the temperature of each gas was measured before the introduction of the solution in the column with a thermocouple above the sinter in the centre of the dry column the hot gases passed through the sinter in the form of bubbles into the 300 ml 0 17 m nacl solution 2 5 flyer plate impact testing to evaluate the effect of a shock on the water contaminated with bacteria a 70 mm calibre single stage light gas gun was used to accelerate a flyer plate to the capsule containing the bacterial solution this is a standard experimental approach used to generate a shock wave in materials 29 the target and the flyer plate were aligned to ensure that the plate impacted the target such that all points on the face of the projectile contacted the test specimen simultaneously the collision between the flyer plate and the target initially achieved a state of uniaxial strain along the impact axis and non zero orthogonal stresses thus leading to a shock wave 29 see fig 2 for a simple schematic of the set up the flyer plate impacted the target at a velocity v 0 and this was measured by a velocimeter that was placed at the end of the gun barrel to record the shock conditions in the steel capsule a photon doppler velocimetry pdv probe was used the pdv probe was positioned to record the free surface velocity u f s v seen in the capsule on the inside of the cover plate and was inserted through a hole drilled through the capsule see fig 2 from this measurement the in material particle velocity u p which is an important measure of shock behaviour can be obtained through eq 1 1 u p 1 2 u f s v the in material stress in the steel σ x can then be calculated according to the well known conservation of momentum calculation 29 2 σ x ρ 0 c 0 s u p u p where u p is the particle velocitiy calculated from eq 1 c 0 is the bulk sound speed and s is the slope in the u s versus u p hugoniot for the stainless steel used in these experiments ρ 0 7 96 g cc c 0 4 464 mm μs and s 1 544 this measure was used to validate the numerical modelling see later 2 6 capsule design for shock wave sterilisation experiments in this work a modified capsule design 30 was used to contain the bacterial broth to be subjected to the shock wave the capsule s dimensions can be seen in fig 3 the internal shape and size of the recess included a singular spike of 6 mm in height and a base diameter of 6 mm the sides of the recess were set at an angle of 63 this was to enable the capsule cover to bend into the recess upon impact and to ensure that overpressure was still applied to the bacterial fluid throughout the course of the shock event thus preventing the onset of cavitation the angled walls of the recess also aided in the shock reflections off the sides of the recess so that the shock would ring up to sufficient pressure the spike was implemented to change the shock propagation through the fluid from an initially one dimensional shock to a multi directional shock throughout the fluid that may well be expected in a water hole subjected to an explosion for example this also increased the shock duration and pressure within the solution with e coli due to ringing the capsule used a 5 mm thick cap and was applied to the body using m6 bolts the metal used to construct the capsule was stainless steel 316 a high strength ductile austenitic stainless steel the choice of this steel was based on the need for particularly high strength and ductility further stainless steels and particularly stainless steel 316 have been investigated throughout the literature and do not appear to exhibit bactericidal effects 31 in this work two impact experiments were conducted the first experiment was conducted at a nominal velocity of 200 m s and the second at 348 m s the capsules were loaded with a 10 2 dilution from the original 10 fold dilution taken from the e coli broth the capsules were overflooded with the dilution and a positive meniscus formed to ensure that no air was within the recess before impact samples were then taken from the original pre shocked dilution to compare e coli concentration numbers between the pre shocked and post shocked samples using the plate count method 2 7 numerical modeling hydrocode simulations were carried out to calculate the pressure in the central cavity and to confirm the shock compression of the fluid layer which was modeled as water all computations were carried out using 2d axial symmetry using an explicit non linear transient dynamic numerical code ansys autodyn the cell size was chosen to be 0 25 mm this code works off the basis of conservation of mass and momentum 32 33 to reduce the amount of cell deformation and subsequent cell erosion that would otherwise be experienced by a purely lagrange mesh during the fluid structure interaction fsi an ale mesh was applied to the area around the recess of the capsule the equation of state for all of the materials used was of mie grüneisen form derived from a linear shock particle hugoniot thus 34 3 u s c 0 s u p where u s and u p are the shock and particle velocities respectively c 0 is the bulk sound speed and s is the slope in the u s versus u p diagram a johnson cook strength model was applied to the 316 steel and described the von mises equivalent flow stress accordingly 29 4 y a b ε p n 1 c ln ε p 1 t h m where a is the yield strength at

softening exponent t and t m are the temperature and melting temperature of the material respectively property values were gleaned from the autodyn material libraries and 30 2 8 data analysis the evaluation of viable e coli in the samples was performed using the plate count agar pca method 27 35 36 plate counts indicate the number of e coli colonies that grow on the surface of a solid translucid agar media in a petry dish the mean and standard deviation of each triplicated sample was obtained using a bacteria survival factor log10 cfu cfu0 where cfu0 is the initial number of colony forming units cfu per sample and cfu is the number of e coli colonies per sample after a set exposure time to hot bubbles or shock waves 37 the decimal reduction times d value were used to measure the temperature impact on e coli this can also be defined as the time needed to inactivate 90 i e 1 log of e coli heat resistance the z value is the temperature change of explosive gaseous products required to change the d value by a factor of 10 d values and z values were calculated using a linear exponential decay model or thermal death model 38 5 log c f u t l o g c f u 0 t d 6 log c f u t c

impact of a change in temperature on e coli inactivation thus 7 z t 1 t 2 l o g d 1 l o g d 2 where t1 is the first temperature of the interval t2 second is the second temperature of the interval and d1 and d2 are the d values at t1 and t2 3 results and discussion the detonation of explosives under the water will generate a pressure front shock wave first and heat and expanding gases later it is thought that the combined effect of these two explosive products will be able to sterilise the surrounding water containing e coli water pathogens located within the proximity of the explosive charge will be exposed to two different sterilisation conditions first the pressure wave moving within the fluid and second the expanding hot gas bubbles from the explosive products at further distances beyond the reach of the hot expanding gas bubbles only the shock front will produce any sterilisation effect therefore e coli sterilisation will decrease with the distance from the explosive charge this work has established the minimum shock wave pressures and separately the hot gas bubble temperature required to effectively sterilise e coli using underwater explosions sterilisation of industrial waters is a challenging process especially in remote locations or in conflict areas where access to power or basic disinfection technologies is not always possible in these situations the use of eco friendly explosives could become a viable alternative 3 1 e coli sterilisation with shock waves one third of the total energy of an underwater detonation is released in the shock wave if pathogens like e coli are subjected to this pressure front they will experience inactivation experiments focusing on the effects of solely shockwaves have established the size dependency of microorganism inactivation when subjected to shock conditions in general the larger the microorganism the less peak shock pressures they can survive additionally a general trend has been noted whereby increasing shock pressures gives a survival rate relation of s r 1 49 10 3 p 1 37 where shock pressure p is measured in gpa and s r is the survival rate 39 although it is a very general trend it does give some scope to predict expected survival rates of different microorganisms when subjected to shock pressures experiments that reach these types of shock pressures are typically carried out using high speed gas guns similar to the system used in this work 3 1 1 comparison of computational and experimental results table 1 shows the results of the theoretical measured and numerical model of the pressures being delivered to the bacterial solution from the steel cover plate the theoretical calculations are based on a well known impedance matching technique see refs 30 35 the small discrepancies found in each can be explained by the differences in the materials used to model the impact event and the actual material samples and their characteristics used for the experiments unfortunately only one pdv result was obtained with the second impact experiment at 348 m s recorded off the inside of the cover plate see fig 2 nevertheless this provided confidence in the numerical model see table 1 fig 4 shows shock propagations through the fluid sample from the simulation model these indicate substantial shockwave interactions occurring throughout the fluid the corner shocks are a result of the shock in the steel navigating the corner as well as early reflections from the sloped walls of the capsule recess pressure calculations from the model are shown in fig 4 the pressures experienced throughout the fluid vary substantially for both impact velocities with maximum pressures of 3 70 gpa for the first experiment and 8 46 gpa for the second experiment although it should be noted that these high pressures were short lived and only present within a small part of the recess gauge 8 it is evident that within the deeper part of the recess that shock pressures were able to be brought to substantially higher shock pressures than what has previously been achieved for this type of capsule previously 30 however arguably a better metric to consider is the minimum shock pressure that would have been seen by all gauges and hence positions in the bacterial broth these are indicated by the horizontal arrows in fig 4 and are 1 29 gpa for the 200 m s impact and 3 53 gpa for the 348 m s impact 3 1 2 bacterial inactivation the results of bacterial inactivation from the first and second impact experiments of the capsule can be seen in table 2 fig 5 shows the pre and post firing samples plated onto petri dishes it is visible that there is a lower amount of bacterial growth in the post shocked sample for the same dilution strength inactivation was measured by comparing the amount of colony forming units cfu per milliliter between the pre and post firing samples at two different impact velocities the first impact velocity experiment 200 m s generated a maximum shock pressure of 3 70 gpa with the bacterial broth experiencing a minimum shock pressure of 1 29 gpa that didn t produce any e coli inactivation in the fluid this is higher than the shock pressures expected in water from a 10 kg explosive charge at a range of 1 m for example 29 40 there was a slightly higher bacteria count assumed to be due to the leftover nutrients left within the initial dilution a reason the 2nd experiment took the next dilution to prevent this further this result is consistent with hazell et al who designed a capsule that subjected e coli to initial shock pressures of 0 87 gpa and recorded no inactivation 30 the second impact velocity experiment 348 m s generated a maximum shock pressure of 8 46 gpa with the bacterial broth experiencing a minimum shock pressure of 3 53 gpa achieving 0 813 logs of e coli inactivation additional development of capsules for shock recovery experiments of liquids have enabled shock pressures of up to 4 gpa in a single shock 41 research using this type of capsule has subjected e coli to shock pressures of between 0 5 and 1 88 gpa 42 43 these studies have shown as low as 0 01 survival of the e coli with their loading regime and registered a substantial drop in survivability across the 1 2 1 5 gpa of shock pressure these studies however have only subjected the bacterial fluid to uniaxial shock waves and may have subjected the samples to cavitation effects which are known to exacerbate cell morbidity 31 post experiment analysis on the capsule cover shows that the design was not able to achieve a significant amount of compression on the fluid sample through the metal bending into the recess as evidenced by the lack of metal deformation compared to the capsule used in previous research 42 this raises some concerns over the modifications ability to properly compress the fluid and ensure that cavitation was being suppressed nevertheless the pressure traces from the computational modelling work implied that cavitation was suppressed differences in the amount of inactivation seen for this experiment compared to previous experiments are still unknown the results in refs 42 43 showed a substantial drop in survivability for one type of e coli and survival rates of as low as 0 01 survivability when shocked to pressures of below 2 gpa possible reasons for the differences include cavitation effects as discussed above and the natural variances between the different strains of e coli this may play a part in their individual resistance to shockwaves 3 2 e coli sterilisation with gaseous products from explosives when suggesting to use explosives for water sterilisation the first thing that has to be considered apart from safety is to choose an explosive material that will not contaminate the water to be sterilised for this purpose the best positioned candidates are ammonium nitrate an fuel mixtures such as an confectioner s sugar an cellulose tissue paper and an activated carbon at different stoichiometric compositions 44 ammonium nitrate is widely used as a fertiliser and is the key ingredient in the manufacture of many commercial explosives since it increases the oxygen balance in explosive mixtures is cheap is not toxic and its detonation generates a large volume of gases such as n2 and o2 1 3 eq 8 8 nh4no3 s 2n2 g 4h2o g o2 g when mixed with 4 8 fuel the detonation will also generate co2 and o2 with a low of fuel eq 9 9 nh4no3 s fuel ao2 g bn2 g ch2o g dco2 g when the oxygen balance of the explosive mixture is close to the ideal case of zero these are the gaseous products for the suggested explosive mixtures eq 10 and 11 activated carbon 10 2 nh4no3 s c s 2 n2 g 4h2o g co2 g cellulose 11 12 nh4no3 s c6h10o5 s 12 n2 g 29h2o g 6 co2 g sugar 12 24 nh4no3 s c12h22o11 s 24 n2 g 59h2o g 12 co2 g decimal reduction times d values at three temperatures 102 150 and 195 c have been reached in the bubble column to study e coli sterilisation effect of each individual hot gas explosive product and their mixture from equations 8 11 table 3 the correlation between d values and the corresponding temperature was represented in fig 6 a d value is the time in minutes needed to inactivate 90 i e 1 log of e coli to measure e coli heat resistance z values have been calculated the z value gives the temperature required to change the d value by a factor of 10 and reflects the gas temperature impact on e coli the smaller the z value the greater the sensitivity to heat fig 6 shows the minimum contact time between hot gas bubbles and e coli at different temperatures and for different explosive gaseous products needed to achieve 1 log e coli inactivation in 0 17 m nacl solution above and to the right of the line and dots e coli will be sterilised by 1 log gaseous products from explosives at 102 c presented a low e coli inactivation rate of 65 36 min d value for an intermediate temperature of 150 c e coli inactivation rates improved to 9 31 min d value at higher temperatures 195 c e coli inactivation was only 3 87 min d value see table 3 and fig 6 e coli inactivation improved by increasing the temperature of gaseous products from explosives from 103 c to 195 c thermal inactivation effects are more effective when the gas temperature increases this section has identified three main mechanisms that explain the different e coli inactivation rates for each of the three main gases co 2 n2 and o2 eq 9 found in gaseous products from non toxic explosive mixtures of ammonium nitrate and fuel confectioner s sugar cellulose tissue paper and activated carbon 3 2 1 thermal inactivation mechanism hot gas bubbles are released when an explosive detonates underwater and a thin layer of heated water is transiently formed around the surface of these hot bubbles e coli is rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 60 c 45 so hot gas bubbles will effectively thermally inactivate e coli when the temperature of the bubbles and the transient water film is greater than 60 c the collision between hot gas bubbles and coliforms is the fundamental mechanism 17 that explains the thermal inactivation of e coli in contaminated waters when an explosive detonates in water releasing hot gaseous products which are composed of co2 n2 and o2 3 2 2 co2 inactivation mechanism with pure co2 at 150 c the collision between the hot co2 bubbles and e coli appears to be not the only mechanism contributing to higher inactivation rates with a d value of 4 11 min for co2 bubbles see fig 6 this d value obtained for e coli using hot co2 as inlet gas was found to be much more effective than when using n2 with just 7 51 min or gaseous products the stoichiometric mixture co2 n2 and o2 with 9 31 min a different mechanism has been suggested to explain the antibacterial effect of dissolved co2 in ref 46 which describes the inactivation mechanism of bacteria when exposed to pressurised co2 dissolved co2 decreased the ph of the solution this acidification of the solution increases the penetration of co2 through the cell membranes the co2 inside the cell will then induce an intracellular ph decrease that will exceed the cell s buffering capacity resulting in cell inactivation 46 47 3 2 3 oxidation combustion mechanism hot oxygen bubbles at 150 c in the bubble column produced high e coli inactivation rates with a d value of 1 53 min pure hot oxygen could oxidise e coli by direct contact or through reactive oxygen species produced by the detonation of mixtures of ammonium nitrate and low fuel ratio it is known that the oxidative properties of h2o2 can inactivate e coli 48 proteins lipids and nucleic acids can also be oxidised by active oxygen species from an incomplete reduction of o2 during respiration 49 the e coli used in this study has a straight cylindrical rod shape of 1 1 1 5 μm diameter and 2 0 6 0 μm length compared with the size of the bubbles of 1 3 mm these cells could easily get through the thin heated water layer around the oxygen bubbles and directly contact the hot oxygen gas within the bubbles 4 conclusions this work has established the minimum pressure and temperature threshold to sterilise e coli in solutions when using shock waves and hot gaseous products from the detonation of explosives our findings suggest that a minimum pressure front of 3 53 gpa caused by the impact of a capsule at 348 m s is the minimum pressure required to induce 0 813 logs of e coli inactivation the study did not find any inactivation at 1 29 gpa minimum pressure given that such shock pressures are not achievable with current explosives in water apart from very close proximity to the charge means that the shock wave alone will not be a contributing factor to microbial inactivation cavitation may be a contributing factor to cell morbidity however the collision between e coli and the hot gas bubbles from the explosive detonation will effectively inactivate bacteria until the temperature of the hot bubbles decreases to below 150 c due to the high shock pressure required for cell inactivation this work shows that any benefit for using explosives to steralise water using explosives will principally come from the release of hot gaseous bubbles rather than the effect of the shock nevertheless this new approach could be used in conflict areas or remote locations with no access to standard sterilisation technologies this work is part of an ongoing effort to explore novel ways of steralising water further work will investigate whether combining the two effects of the hot bubble gases with a shock wave has a positive synergistic effect on cell morbidity further work will also explore whether pathogenic groups such as protozoa b subtislis atcc 6633 spores and virus ms2 atcc 15597 b1 can be

8756,water sterilisation requires the inactivation of waterborne pathogens like e coli to such low levels that its use will not cause illness here we examine a potential methodology for disinfecting water through the combined effect of hot expanding gases and shock waves from underwater explosions water pathogens located within the proximity of the explosive charge will be exposed to two different sterilisation conditions firstly the high pressure shock wave moving within the fluid and secondly the expanding hot n2 o2 and co2 bubbles that are products of the explosion to simulate the first case we used a flyer plate technique to understand the lower threshold for inactivation we did this with a novel capsule design in a single stage light gas gun and observed 0 813 logs of e coli inactivation after subjecting an entire bacterial broth to a minimum pressure of 3 53 gpa thereby indicating a lower threshold for shock pressure induced inactivation for the second case we show that hot gas bubbles from different explosive gaseous products at 150 c in a bubble column established the minimum gas temperature thresholds required to successfully inactivate e coli this work shows that any benefit of using explosives to sterilise water will principally come from the release of hot gaseous bubbles rather than the effect of the shock this new approach could be used in conflict areas or remote locations with no access to standard sterilisation technologies or power keywords shockwaves shock pressure hot gases plate impact technique escherichia coli inactivation 1 introduction explosives have been extensively used to destroy structures and break rock however the use of explosive materials is not limited to military mining and quarrying applications for example explosives have been successfully used for more than 100 years to extinguish fires in oil fields 1 furthermore artificial rain can be produced by dispersing silver iodide particles in the upper atmosphere at which point water droplets cluster around the particles to produce rain this process is known as cloud seeding and involves the use of anti aircraft rounds filled with silver iodide 1 the use of explosives for fishing also known as blast fishing has been employed for more than a century and is still in use in many countries around the world 2 there are however many other applications of explosives yet to be explored here we present a unique alternative use of explosives for the purpose of water sterilisation when an explosive detonates a shock wavefront is produced first this is followed by the release of large amounts of heat and gas temperatures can reach 3 000 5 000 c gases can expand 12 000 to 15 000 times and shockwaves can generate pressures of 5 45 gpa 3 therefore we propose a new way of sterilising e coli by underwater explosions this is driven by two principal phenomena shockwave formation and propagation and hot bubbles from gaseous products this work will explore what are the minimum requirements of these two phenomena and which is the principal mechanism that can be used to sterilise e coli with explosives 1 1 water sterilisation with shock waves the application of shockwaves and their ability to cause inactivation in microorganisms such as bacteria is of interest to several industries including water purification technology food safety and medicine induced shockwaves can be used as a potential methodology to purify water specifically in the desalination process which can remove up to 99 99 salt shockwaves can also be used to remove other water containing unhealthy minerals such as boron lead arsenic and copper and microbial pathogens 4 in the food industry shockwaves have been applied to tenderise meat 5 and offer an alternative to pasteurization techniques to preserve taste and protect heat sensitive products such as mothers milk 6 7 additionally shockwaves have been investigated as a method of destroying biofilms within patients to reduce the chances of infection post surgery 8 when a pressure wave travels through a medium faster than the medium s local speed of sound a discontinuity in pressure density and temperature is formed in the form of a shock wave there are multiple ways to deliver shocks within fluids and to the microorganisms that reside within them including explosions exploding wires electrical and plasma discharges and high speed impact experiments cavitation produces explosive microbubbles within the fluid that have localized areas of high pressure and temperature and upon collapse cause sharp jets of water to form which induce cell lysis through shearing the cell walls and consequently increasing cell inactivation this phenomenon has been employed with the introduction of additional microbubbles to enhance the death of a marine vibrio sp when applied with shockwaves in the context of preventing cross contamination of water from international shipping liners 9 although these methods produce additional natural phenomena to induce cell inactivation the same studies found that the shockwave itself and the resultant peak pressures are the main factors for achieving the inactivation to elucidate the role of the shock waves on microbial organisms we have conducted flyer plate impact experiments at impact velocities of 200 m s and 348 m s subjecting bacterial solutions of e coli to shock loading the bacterial solutions were contained in a novel capsule design 1 2 water sterilisation with hot bubbles from explosive gaseous products thermal inactivation of pathogens is one of the most widely used ways of disinfection the world health organisation who guidelines for drinking water quality compare thermal inactivation rates for different types of bacteria in hot liquids such studies show that at a water temperature of 60 c e coli needs 300 s to reach a 1 5 log unit reduction in viability 10 thermal inactivation of pathogens was effectively used by panchal et al 11 13 to pasteurise milk in a concentric tube type heat exchanger using the heat from a solar system the hot bubble column hbc technique has successfully desalinated seawater 14 and thermally inactivated viruses bacteria 15 protozoa and blue green algae found in piggery effluent using hot combustion gases and hot air 16 this previous use of hbc to inactivate pathogens in contaminated industrial water has established the foundations of this new study that will explore the sterilisation effect of heat and gaseous products from an underwater explosion a laboratory scale hbc 17 was identified to be fit for purpose for its capability of emulating the production of hot gas bubbles from the detonation of explosives such as co2 n2 o2 and their mixture in a controlled aquatic environment at 3 different temperatures 103 150 and 195 c the hbc utilizes its heat transfer efficiency to inactivate waterborne pathogens for water reuse without the need for boiling 18 it does so by transferring heat from the hot bubbles of 1 3 mm of diameter to the pathogen surfaces through collisions while keeping the water at a low temperature 19 the heat transfer rate between liquid and gas is 100 times more efficient in a gas liquid bubble column than in a single phase flow according to decker 20 the use of explosives in the water industry has been previously suggested by chen and yang 21 they pretreated sludge with shock waves generated with 25g of hexogen rdx in a pilot scale spherical explosion vessel e coli has been successfully inactivated using underwater shock waves 22 23 or hot gases in hbc 15 16 19 24 the research team here discusses these two effects for the first time that aims to understand the sterilisation capacity due to the detonation of an explosive underwater this is done by using two experimental techniques utilising the principles of hot bubbles generated in an hbc and shock waves generated by a single stage light gas gun impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental solution a solution with a 0 17 m concentration of nacl nacl 99 purity purchased from sigma aldrich in 300 ml milli q water was prepared and sterilised to avoid contamination by autoclaving in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi from 121 to 124 c for 15 min 2 2 preparation of growth culture medium the plate count method is commonly used for the detection of e coli in both wastewater and marine water the degree of contamination in water is assessed based on the ability of bacteria to propagate forming colonies in a layer of agar 25 an agar medium is commonly used for good visibility and high consistency of counts for each bacterial growth experiment an atcc broth 271 escherichia 26 was used as the base for the e coli culture this broth was made up of two component mediums a and b which are not commercially available medium a consists of 13 g of tryptone 1 g of yeast extract 6 g of nacl and 1 l of milli q water this medium was aseptically distributed into two vessels containing 1 41 agar and no agar respectively the agar used in the experiments was molecular biology grade from sigma aldrich the medium was heated to boiling to dissolve the agar and sterilised by autoclaving for 15 min in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi and 121 124 c medium b contains 1 g of glucose 0 01 g of thiamine and 50 ml of milli q water it was sterilised using a 0 22 μm filter to avoid any contamination after medium a cooled down to 50 c medium b was added in a proportion of 1 1 10 ml of this resulting 1 34 agar medium were poured into each petri dish 100 15 mm and dried above a bunsen burner to maintain local environmental sterility until the agar was not too dry nor too moist 2 3 bacterial strain and growth conditions escherichia coli migula castellani and chalmers atcc 15597 a biosafety level 1 organism was selected as a representative model for bacterial contamination in water 27 the overnight e coli culture was grown in 25 ml of the nutrient broth medium a without agar and medium b and incubated at 37 c for 24 h in a labtech digital incubator model lib 030 m with gentle shaking at 110 rpm using a psu 10i orbital shaker the total concentration of the overnight e coli culture was calculated by preparing 10 fold dilutions 0 50 ml of e coli from the stock solution were added to a tube containing 4 5 ml of 0 17 m nacl 10 1 tube the same operation was conducted for the rest of the 10 fold dilutions in the range of 10 2 to 10 10 this process was done around a bunsen burner to avoid any contamination 2 4 hot bubble column hbc setup for heat and gas sterilisation experiments to assess the inactivation effect of e coli collisions with hot gas bubbles from an explosion 27 l min of 4 different gases were pumped through an electrical heater the base of the bubble column was fitted with a 40 100 μm pore size glass sinter type 2 of 13 5 cm diameter 28 see fig 1 once the solutions with known concentrations of e coli were prepared different rounds of experiments with different gases mixture of gaseous products of explosives and the individual gases from the mixture o2 n2 and co2 and temperatures 103 150 and 195 c were conducted in the hbc the temperature of each gas was measured before the introduction of the solution in the column with a thermocouple above the sinter in the centre of the dry column the hot gases passed through the sinter in the form of bubbles into the 300 ml 0 17 m nacl solution 2 5 flyer plate impact testing to evaluate the effect of a shock on the water contaminated with bacteria a 70 mm calibre single stage light gas gun was used to accelerate a flyer plate to the capsule containing the bacterial solution this is a standard experimental approach used to generate a shock wave in materials 29 the target and the flyer plate were aligned to ensure that the plate impacted the target such that all points on the face of the projectile contacted the test specimen simultaneously the collision between the flyer plate and the target initially achieved a state of uniaxial strain along the impact axis and non zero orthogonal stresses thus leading to a shock wave 29 see fig 2 for a simple schematic of the set up the flyer plate impacted the target at a velocity v 0 and this was measured by a velocimeter that was placed at the end of the gun barrel to record the shock conditions in the steel capsule a photon doppler velocimetry pdv probe was used the pdv probe was positioned to record the free surface velocity u f s v seen in the capsule on the inside of the cover plate and was inserted through a hole drilled through the capsule see fig 2 from this measurement the in material particle velocity u p which is an important measure of shock behaviour can be obtained through eq 1 1 u p 1 2 u f s v the in material stress in the steel σ x can then be calculated according to the well known conservation of momentum calculation 29 2 σ x ρ 0 c 0 s u p u p where u p is the particle velocitiy calculated from eq 1 c 0 is the bulk sound speed and s is the slope in the u s versus u p hugoniot for the stainless steel used in these experiments ρ 0 7 96 g cc c 0 4 464 mm μs and s 1 544 this measure was used to validate the numerical modelling see later 2 6 capsule design for shock wave sterilisation experiments in this work a modified capsule design 30 was used to contain the bacterial broth to be subjected to the shock wave the capsule s dimensions can be seen in fig 3 the internal shape and size of the recess included a singular spike of 6 mm in height and a base diameter of 6 mm the sides of the recess were set at an angle of 63 this was to enable the capsule cover to bend into the recess upon impact and to ensure that overpressure was still applied to the bacterial fluid throughout the course of the shock event thus preventing the onset of cavitation the angled walls of the recess also aided in the shock reflections off the sides of the recess so that the shock would ring up to sufficient pressure the spike was implemented to change the shock propagation through the fluid from an initially one dimensional shock to a multi directional shock throughout the fluid that may well be expected in a water hole subjected to an explosion for example this also increased the shock duration and pressure within the solution with e coli due to ringing the capsule used a 5 mm thick cap and was applied to the body using m6 bolts the metal used to construct the capsule was stainless steel 316 a high strength ductile austenitic stainless steel the choice of this steel was based on the need for particularly high strength and ductility further stainless steels and particularly stainless steel 316 have been investigated throughout the literature and do not appear to exhibit bactericidal effects 31 in this work two impact experiments were conducted the first experiment was conducted at a nominal velocity of 200 m s and the second at 348 m s the capsules were loaded with a 10 2 dilution from the original 10 fold dilution taken from the e coli broth the capsules were overflooded with the dilution and a positive meniscus formed to ensure that no air was within the recess before impact samples were then taken from the original pre shocked dilution to compare e coli concentration numbers between the pre shocked and post shocked samples using the plate count method 2 7 numerical modeling hydrocode simulations were carried out to calculate the pressure in the central cavity and to confirm the shock compression of the fluid layer which was modeled as water all computations were carried out using 2d axial symmetry using an explicit non linear transient dynamic numerical code ansys autodyn the cell size was chosen to be 0 25 mm this code works off the basis of conservation of mass and momentum 32 33 to reduce the amount of cell deformation and subsequent cell erosion that would otherwise be experienced by a purely lagrange mesh during the fluid structure interaction fsi an ale mesh was applied to the area around the recess of the capsule the equation of state for all of the materials used was of mie grüneisen form derived from a linear shock particle hugoniot thus 34 3 u s c 0 s u p where u s and u p are the shock and particle velocities respectively c 0 is the bulk sound speed and s is the slope in the u s versus u p diagram a johnson cook strength model was applied to the 316 steel and described the von mises equivalent flow stress accordingly 29 4 y a b ε p n 1 c ln ε p 1 t h m where a is the yield strength at

softening exponent t and t m are the temperature and melting temperature of the material respectively property values were gleaned from the autodyn material libraries and 30 2 8 data analysis the evaluation of viable e coli in the samples was performed using the plate count agar pca method 27 35 36 plate counts indicate the number of e coli colonies that grow on the surface of a solid translucid agar media in a petry dish the mean and standard deviation of each triplicated sample was obtained using a bacteria survival factor log10 cfu cfu0 where cfu0 is the initial number of colony forming units cfu per sample and cfu is the number of e coli colonies per sample after a set exposure time to hot bubbles or shock waves 37 the decimal reduction times d value were used to measure the temperature impact on e coli this can also be defined as the time needed to inactivate 90 i e 1 log of e coli heat resistance the z value is the temperature change of explosive gaseous products required to change the d value by a factor of 10 d values and z values were calculated using a linear exponential decay model or thermal death model 38 5 log c f u t l o g c f u 0 t d 6 log c f u t c

impact of a change in temperature on e coli inactivation thus 7 z t 1 t 2 l o g d 1 l o g d 2 where t1 is the first temperature of the interval t2 second is the second temperature of the interval and d1 and d2 are the d values at t1 and t2 3 results and discussion the detonation of explosives under the water will generate a pressure front shock wave first and heat and expanding gases later it is thought that the combined effect of these two explosive products will be able to sterilise the surrounding water containing e coli water pathogens located within the proximity of the explosive charge will be exposed to two different sterilisation conditions first the pressure wave moving within the fluid and second the expanding hot gas bubbles from the explosive products at further distances beyond the reach of the hot expanding gas bubbles only the shock front will produce any sterilisation effect therefore e coli sterilisation will decrease with the distance from the explosive charge this work has established the minimum shock wave pressures and separately the hot gas bubble temperature required to effectively sterilise e coli using underwater explosions sterilisation of industrial waters is a challenging process especially in remote locations or in conflict areas where access to power or basic disinfection technologies is not always possible in these situations the use of eco friendly explosives could become a viable alternative 3 1 e coli sterilisation with shock waves one third of the total energy of an underwater detonation is released in the shock wave if pathogens like e coli are subjected to this pressure front they will experience inactivation experiments focusing on the effects of solely shockwaves have established the size dependency of microorganism inactivation when subjected to shock conditions in general the larger the microorganism the less peak shock pressures they can survive additionally a general trend has been noted whereby increasing shock pressures gives a survival rate relation of s r 1 49 10 3 p 1 37 where shock pressure p is measured in gpa and s r is the survival rate 39 although it is a very general trend it does give some scope to predict expected survival rates of different microorganisms when subjected to shock pressures experiments that reach these types of shock pressures are typically carried out using high speed gas guns similar to the system used in this work 3 1 1 comparison of computational and experimental results table 1 shows the results of the theoretical measured and numerical model of the pressures being delivered to the bacterial solution from the steel cover plate the theoretical calculations are based on a well known impedance matching technique see refs 30 35 the small discrepancies found in each can be explained by the differences in the materials used to model the impact event and the actual material samples and their characteristics used for the experiments unfortunately only one pdv result was obtained with the second impact experiment at 348 m s recorded off the inside of the cover plate see fig 2 nevertheless this provided confidence in the numerical model see table 1 fig 4 shows shock propagations through the fluid sample from the simulation model these indicate substantial shockwave interactions occurring throughout the fluid the corner shocks are a result of the shock in the steel navigating the corner as well as early reflections from the sloped walls of the capsule recess pressure calculations from the model are shown in fig 4 the pressures experienced throughout the fluid vary substantially for both impact velocities with maximum pressures of 3 70 gpa for the first experiment and 8 46 gpa for the second experiment although it should be noted that these high pressures were short lived and only present within a small part of the recess gauge 8 it is evident that within the deeper part of the recess that shock pressures were able to be brought to substantially higher shock pressures than what has previously been achieved for this type of capsule previously 30 however arguably a better metric to consider is the minimum shock pressure that would have been seen by all gauges and hence positions in the bacterial broth these are indicated by the horizontal arrows in fig 4 and are 1 29 gpa for the 200 m s impact and 3 53 gpa for the 348 m s impact 3 1 2 bacterial inactivation the results of bacterial inactivation from the first and second impact experiments of the capsule can be seen in table 2 fig 5 shows the pre and post firing samples plated onto petri dishes it is visible that there is a lower amount of bacterial growth in the post shocked sample for the same dilution strength inactivation was measured by comparing the amount of colony forming units cfu per milliliter between the pre and post firing samples at two different impact velocities the first impact velocity experiment 200 m s generated a maximum shock pressure of 3 70 gpa with the bacterial broth experiencing a minimum shock pressure of 1 29 gpa that didn t produce any e coli inactivation in the fluid this is higher than the shock pressures expected in water from a 10 kg explosive charge at a range of 1 m for example 29 40 there was a slightly higher bacteria count assumed to be due to the leftover nutrients left within the initial dilution a reason the 2nd experiment took the next dilution to prevent this further this result is consistent with hazell et al who designed a capsule that subjected e coli to initial shock pressures of 0 87 gpa and recorded no inactivation 30 the second impact velocity experiment 348 m s generated a maximum shock pressure of 8 46 gpa with the bacterial broth experiencing a minimum shock pressure of 3 53 gpa achieving 0 813 logs of e coli inactivation additional development of capsules for shock recovery experiments of liquids have enabled shock pressures of up to 4 gpa in a single shock 41 research using this type of capsule has subjected e coli to shock pressures of between 0 5 and 1 88 gpa 42 43 these studies have shown as low as 0 01 survival of the e coli with their loading regime and registered a substantial drop in survivability across the 1 2 1 5 gpa of shock pressure these studies however have only subjected the bacterial fluid to uniaxial shock waves and may have subjected the samples to cavitation effects which are known to exacerbate cell morbidity 31 post experiment analysis on the capsule cover shows that the design was not able to achieve a significant amount of compression on the fluid sample through the metal bending into the recess as evidenced by the lack of metal deformation compared to the capsule used in previous research 42 this raises some concerns over the modifications ability to properly compress the fluid and ensure that cavitation was being suppressed nevertheless the pressure traces from the computational modelling work implied that cavitation was suppressed differences in the amount of inactivation seen for this experiment compared to previous experiments are still unknown the results in refs 42 43 showed a substantial drop in survivability for one type of e coli and survival rates of as low as 0 01 survivability when shocked to pressures of below 2 gpa possible reasons for the differences include cavitation effects as discussed above and the natural variances between the different strains of e coli this may play a part in their individual resistance to shockwaves 3 2 e coli sterilisation with gaseous products from explosives when suggesting to use explosives for water sterilisation the first thing that has to be considered apart from safety is to choose an explosive material that will not contaminate the water to be sterilised for this purpose the best positioned candidates are ammonium nitrate an fuel mixtures such as an confectioner s sugar an cellulose tissue paper and an activated carbon at different stoichiometric compositions 44 ammonium nitrate is widely used as a fertiliser and is the key ingredient in the manufacture of many commercial explosives since it increases the oxygen balance in explosive mixtures is cheap is not toxic and its detonation generates a large volume of gases such as n2 and o2 1 3 eq 8 8 nh4no3 s 2n2 g 4h2o g o2 g when mixed with 4 8 fuel the detonation will also generate co2 and o2 with a low of fuel eq 9 9 nh4no3 s fuel ao2 g bn2 g ch2o g dco2 g when the oxygen balance of the explosive mixture is close to the ideal case of zero these are the gaseous products for the suggested explosive mixtures eq 10 and 11 activated carbon 10 2 nh4no3 s c s 2 n2 g 4h2o g co2 g cellulose 11 12 nh4no3 s c6h10o5 s 12 n2 g 29h2o g 6 co2 g sugar 12 24 nh4no3 s c12h22o11 s 24 n2 g 59h2o g 12 co2 g decimal reduction times d values at three temperatures 102 150 and 195 c have been reached in the bubble column to study e coli sterilisation effect of each individual hot gas explosive product and their mixture from equations 8 11 table 3 the correlation between d values and the corresponding temperature was represented in fig 6 a d value is the time in minutes needed to inactivate 90 i e 1 log of e coli to measure e coli heat resistance z values have been calculated the z value gives the temperature required to change the d value by a factor of 10 and reflects the gas temperature impact on e coli the smaller the z value the greater the sensitivity to heat fig 6 shows the minimum contact time between hot gas bubbles and e coli at different temperatures and for different explosive gaseous products needed to achieve 1 log e coli inactivation in 0 17 m nacl solution above and to the right of the line and dots e coli will be sterilised by 1 log gaseous products from explosives at 102 c presented a low e coli inactivation rate of 65 36 min d value for an intermediate temperature of 150 c e coli inactivation rates improved to 9 31 min d value at higher temperatures 195 c e coli inactivation was only 3 87 min d value see table 3 and fig 6 e coli inactivation improved by increasing the temperature of gaseous products from explosives from 103 c to 195 c thermal inactivation effects are more effective when the gas temperature increases this section has identified three main mechanisms that explain the different e coli inactivation rates for each of the three main gases co 2 n2 and o2 eq 9 found in gaseous products from non toxic explosive mixtures of ammonium nitrate and fuel confectioner s sugar cellulose tissue paper and activated carbon 3 2 1 thermal inactivation mechanism hot gas bubbles are released when an explosive detonates underwater and a thin layer of heated water is transiently formed around the surface of these hot bubbles e coli is rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 60 c 45 so hot gas bubbles will effectively thermally inactivate e coli when the temperature of the bubbles and the transient water film is greater than 60 c the collision between hot gas bubbles and coliforms is the fundamental mechanism 17 that explains the thermal inactivation of e coli in contaminated waters when an explosive detonates in water releasing hot gaseous products which are composed of co2 n2 and o2 3 2 2 co2 inactivation mechanism with pure co2 at 150 c the collision between the hot co2 bubbles and e coli appears to be not the only mechanism contributing to higher inactivation rates with a d value of 4 11 min for co2 bubbles see fig 6 this d value obtained for e coli using hot co2 as inlet gas was found to be much more effective than when using n2 with just 7 51 min or gaseous products the stoichiometric mixture co2 n2 and o2 with 9 31 min a different mechanism has been suggested to explain the antibacterial effect of dissolved co2 in ref 46 which describes the inactivation mechanism of bacteria when exposed to pressurised co2 dissolved co2 decreased the ph of the solution this acidification of the solution increases the penetration of co2 through the cell membranes the co2 inside the cell will then induce an intracellular ph decrease that will exceed the cell s buffering capacity resulting in cell inactivation 46 47 3 2 3 oxidation combustion mechanism hot oxygen bubbles at 150 c in the bubble column produced high e coli inactivation rates with a d value of 1 53 min pure hot oxygen could oxidise e coli by direct contact or through reactive oxygen species produced by the detonation of mixtures of ammonium nitrate and low fuel ratio it is known that the oxidative properties of h2o2 can inactivate e coli 48 proteins lipids and nucleic acids can also be oxidised by active oxygen species from an incomplete reduction of o2 during respiration 49 the e coli used in this study has a straight cylindrical rod shape of 1 1 1 5 μm diameter and 2 0 6 0 μm length compared with the size of the bubbles of 1 3 mm these cells could easily get through the thin heated water layer around the oxygen bubbles and directly contact the hot oxygen gas within the bubbles 4 conclusions this work has established the minimum pressure and temperature threshold to sterilise e coli in solutions when using shock waves and hot gaseous products from the detonation of explosives our findings suggest that a minimum pressure front of 3 53 gpa caused by the impact of a capsule at 348 m s is the minimum pressure required to induce 0 813 logs of e coli inactivation the study did not find any inactivation at 1 29 gpa minimum pressure given that such shock pressures are not achievable with current explosives in water apart from very close proximity to the charge means that the shock wave alone will not be a contributing factor to microbial inactivation cavitation may be a contributing factor to cell morbidity however the collision between e coli and the hot gas bubbles from the explosive detonation will effectively inactivate bacteria until the temperature of the hot bubbles decreases to below 150 c due to the high shock pressure required for cell inactivation this work shows that any benefit for using explosives to steralise water using explosives will principally come from the release of hot gaseous bubbles rather than the effect of the shock nevertheless this new approach could be used in conflict areas or remote locations with no access to standard sterilisation technologies this work is part of an ongoing effort to explore novel ways of steralising water further work will investigate whether combining the two effects of the hot bubble gases with a shock wave has a positive synergistic effect on cell morbidity further work will also explore whether pathogenic groups such as protozoa b subtislis atcc 6633 spores and virus ms2 atcc 15597 b1 can be

8757,in this study metallic iron nanoparticles fe nps and metallic copper nanoparticles cu nps were prepared characterized and used in the removal of methyl orange mo dye the experiments investigated first the uv vis spectra of dye molecules in three types of solvents water water ethanol and water dimethyl sulfoxide the removal of mo was then conducted under various experimental conditions to investigate the effects of solvent type nanoparticles dosage salinity of the solutions temperature and shaking time the highest extent of mo removal was achieved in water solutions under all experimental conditions fe nps showed higher efficiency than cu nps in mo removal moreover heterogeneous fenton process led to smaller mo removal when compared with the direct use of the nanoparticles for both water and water ethanol solutions from a kinetic perspective the dye removal process was much faster in water than in water ethanol mixtures and the data followed pseudo second order rate equation keywords methyl orange iron nanoparticles copper nanoparticles sorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution is increasingly causing global concern and innovative methods for water purification are being explored world wide as meeting the environmental regulations and quality standards is becoming more challenging the main sources of water contamination are of anthropogenic origin and dye related industries are among the leading contamination sources these industries consume huge amounts of water and the wastewater discharge from the related industrial facilities is considered as the most polluting of all the industrial sectors it is reported that more than 7 105 tons of synthetic dyes are being annually produced worldwide and up to 200 000 tons of these dyes are being lost to effluents every year from textile industry alone 1 dye removal technologies include membrane separation coagulation adsorption flocculation oxidation ion exchange advanced oxidation process electrochemical process photocatalysis biodegradation and others unfortunately many of the dyes can escape the conventional treatment methods of wastewaters 2 therefore intensive research has been conducted to synthesize cost effective novel materials which can efficiently remove synthetic and natural dye colorants from water bodies methyl orange mo is an anionic dye which is considered a model example of azo dyes the chemical formula of mo is c14h14n3nao3s and its structural formula is shown in fig 1 mo is water soluble and it is contained in the discharge effluents from various industries like printing leather paper textile and others 3 as an azo dye mo contains aromatic and n n groups in its structure which are highly toxic carcinogenic and teratogenic and the molecular diameter of the mo molecule is estimated to be around 6 8 nm based on its molecular weight and structure 3 many types of sorbents have been tested for the removal of mo dye from water solutions these include activated carbon biochar biosorbents clays and minerals polymers and resins composites and nanoparticles with the last type being reported to be the most effective 4 among various types of nanomaterials fe nanoparticles are reported to be among the most efficient emerging materials for mo removal from aqueous solutions 5 8 this has motivated the synthesis and application of many types of fe based nanomaterials for mo removal including bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles polymeric nanocomposites and others 9 11 cu nanoparticles are widely used in many industries like electronics ceramics polymers metallic coatings health care products in addition to their utilization in environmental remediation drug resistant pathogens and others 12 however inspite of the wide use of fe nanoparticles in the removal studies of mo no study seem to exist about mo removal by cu nps according to our literature search nevertheless some studies exist about the removal of mo by cu based nanomaterials like fe cu ag trimetallic nanoparticles 10 and cuo nanoflakes 13 recently fe cu bimetallic nps were applied by our group to elucidate its effectiveness in the removal of aqueous methylene blue under various experimental conditions in a comparative manner with fe nps 14 in addition although solvents play an important role in dye industry there is scarcity in the reports about the solvent effect on dye removal recently a study was published by our group about the comparative removal of methylene blue from aqueous solutions and from water ethanol mixtures 15 it was shown that the solvent type affects dye aggregation and as such the extent of its removal the aim of this work was to synthesize fe and cu nanoparticles by borohydride reduction method and characterize the materials and assess their potential for the removal of mo under various reaction conditions the characterization techniques include sem edx tem xps and xrd in order to reveal the structure morphology and elemental content of both nanomaterials the examined experimental parameters include solvent type time temperature nanoparticle doses salinity in addition to evaluating the materials performance as heterogeneous fenton catalysts 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 preparation of the nanoparticle materials the samples of fe nps were prepared using the borohydride reduction method this was acheived by dissolving 7 245 g 26 8 mmol of fecl3 6h2o in 25 0 ml portions of ethanol water mixture 4 1 v v the solution was then shaked under magnetic stirring for an extra period of 15 min milli q water was used throughout the process then 2 54 g 67 2 mmol of nabh4 was separately dissolved in 70 0 ml volume of pure water this solution was added quickly to the fe solution using a burette while continuously stirring during the reaction the color of the iron solution turned into black and evolution of h2 gas was observed the oxidation reduction reaction can be written as 16 fecl3 6h2o aq 3nabh4 aq 3h2o l fe0 s 3b oh 3 aq 3nacl aq 21 2h2 g the produced fe0 nps were separated from solutions by using vacuum filtration the resulting solid powder was then washed three times using absolute ethanol and was dried at 60 c for 3 h on the other hand the samples of cu nps were prepared by dissolving 4 569 g 26 8 mmol of cucl2 2h2o in 25 0 ml ethanol water mixture 4 1 v v the same steps were then followed as above the oxidation reduction reaction can be written as cucl2 2h2o aq 2nabh4 aq 4h2o cu0 s 2b oh 3 aq 2nacl aq 7h2 g the remaining steps were performed in the same way as given above 2 2 structural and elemental characterization of the nanomaterials in order to reveal the structural constituents of the samples the x ray diffraction xrd diagrams were recorded in a 2θ range of 10 80 using a diffractometer of stoe stadi p with a source of cu kα 1 5405 å operated at 40 kv 40 ma the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra were used in identifying the elemental contents and the oxidation states of the elements in the samples of fe nps and cu nps a phi 5800 multitechnique esca system was used in acquiring the spectra with monochromatized al kα 1486 6 ev radiation being used as a source at take off angle of 45 when recording detail scans the pass energies at the analyzer were 29 35 ev but it was kept at 93 90 ev for survey scans the morphology and sizes of fe nps and cu nps samples were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy tem the images were recorded with a jeol 1400 instrument operated at an accelerating voltage was 120 kv after initial preparation a copper grid was used to fix the samples on the device holder the experimental parameters were finally adjusted to obtain clear images elemental and mapping analysis of the nanoparticle materials were recorded energy dispersive x ray analysis edx the spectra were recorded using a zeiss gemini leo 1550 vp equipped with a silicon drift detector using a 10 kev electron beam with an accelerating voltage of 10 kv 2 3 calibration curves of mo the calibration curves of mo were constructed in three different solvents water w 1 1 v v water ethanol w e and 1 1 v v water dimethyl sulfoxide w dmso stock solutions of mo aldrich 140910 were prepared in the three solvents at a concentration of 1000 mg l dilute solutions were subsequently prepared by serial dilution using milli q water the uv visible spectra were recorded at mo concentrations ranging between 1 0 and 10 0 mg l in each of the three solvents in a spectral range of 200 700 nm 2 4 aggregation behavior of mo the aggregation behavior of mo was analyzed at an initial concentration of 10 0 mg l in three solvents w w e w dmso the dye absorbance spectra were used to determine the possible spectral shifts of the wavelength maxima λmax of the mo peaks in the three solvents which were observed to occur at 466 447 460 nm for mo in w w e w dmso respectively in addition the transition energy of the mo molecules in each of the three solutions was calculated 2 5 dye removal experiments different parameters were studied for the removal of mo using fe nps and cu nps the dye solutions obtained at the end of the removal experiments were diluted whenever needed prior to measuring the absorbance of mo solutions by uv vis spectrophotometry the studied experimental parameters are given below 2 5 1 effect of solvent and nanoparticle type on mo removal the removal process of mo in different solutions of w w e and w dmso was studied by using both of fe nps and cu nps at 298 k the extent of mo removal was investigated by introducing 0 025 g samples of each type of nanoparticles to 25 0 ml of 100 0 mg l mo in w w e and w dmso solutions the ph was then measured and the mixtures were shaken at a given temperature for a duration of 4 h in a thermostated shaking water bath the solid was separated from the liquid phase using gravity filtration and was then used to determine the dye concentration and the corresponding solution ph 2 5 2 effect of temperature and nanoparticle dose on the removal of mo the effect of nanoparticle dose of fe nps and cu nps on the removal of mo in different solutions of w and w e at two different temperatures 298 k and 323 k was studied by introducing 0 005 0 015 0 025 and 0 035 g of each nanoparticle type to 25 0 ml of 100 0 mg l mo in w and w e solutions then the ph was measured and the solutions were shaken once at 298 k and once at 323 k for 4 h in a thermostated shaking water bath the liquid phase of each solution was finally separated using gravity filtration 2 5 3 salinity effect on mo removal four concentrations of nacl 10 0 20 0 30 0 and 40 0 g l were prepared in mo solutions by adding the appropriate masses of nacl into 25 0 ml of 100 0 mg l mo solution containing 0 035 g of nanoparticles fe nps and cu nps the solutions were kept in a water bath at 298 k for 4 h finally the solutions were filtered and the mo concentration was determined 2 5 4 mo discoloration using a fenton like process the efficiency of fe nps and cu nps as heterogeneous fenton catalysts in mo removal was tested the experiments were performed in w and w e solutions by introducing 0 050 g nanoparticle samples to 45 0 ml of 100 mg l mo solution and 5 0 ml of freshly prepared 10 v v h2o2 a solution of 0 1 m hcl was used for ph adjustment of mo solutions before introducing the nanoparticles ph was approximately 3 37 the mixtures were then kept in a water bath at 298 k for 2 h and subsequently the liquid phase was separated from the mixture and analyzed 2 5 5 effect of time on mo removal the kinetic aspect of mo removal was studied at an initial dye concentration of 100 0 mg l in two solvents w and w e 1 1 at temperatures of 298 k and 323 k in each trial a 0 025 g sample of nanoparticle materials was introduced into 25 0 ml portion of dye solution the dye mixtures were then shaken at constant temperature for time periods ranging from 1 min to 4 h the liquid and solid components were separated using gravity filtration and the dye concentrations were measured using uv vis spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the nanoparticle materials the nanoparticle samples of fe and cu were characterized by sem edx xrd tem and xps techniques examples of tem images of fe nps and cu nps are shown in fig 2 fe nps appear in its typical chain like morphology fig 2 a which is attributed to the magnetic forces among the individual fe nanoparticles this aggregation is suggested to reduce the efficiency of the fe nps toward the removal of pollutants 17 on the other hand a tem image of cu nps is shown in fig 2 b it is reported that cu nanoparticles exhibit nearly spherical shape and have a strong tendency to aggregate and as such it can appear in nanopatches and nanocluster forms 18 the edx elemental spectra and mapping images of fe nps and cu nps are shown in fig 3 as expected the fe samples are dominated by fe and o and the cu samples are dominated by cu and o the oxygen content is not attributed totally to the samples as some of the oxygen and possibly carbon and nitrogen can arise from adventitious sources the elemental mapping images show that the o signals are intensively associated with fe and cu signals possibly due to the presence of the oxide phases at the particles surface which is in support of the core shell model structure of these metallic nanoparticles 19 the xps spectrum of fe 2p doublet obtained from fe nps is shown in fig 4 a the spectrum reveals a small shoulder at around 707 ev which designates the 2p3 2 peak of a zero valent iron core fe0 the photoelectron peaks centered around 710 ev and 724 ev suggest that the shell was largely made up of iron oxides and iron oxyhydroxide the peak deconvolution shows the existence of both ferrous and ferric ions in the fe sample the peaks at 711 ev and 724 ev originate from fe2 2p3 2 and fe2 2p1 2 respectively while the features around 713 ev and 726 ev originate from fe3 2p3 2 and fe3 2p1 2 respectively the appearance of the satellite feature indicates that iron ions are in high spin states which is characteristic of certain iron compounds like oxide compounds 20 21 the xps spectrum of a cu nps sample is shown in fig 4 b the peaks at 933 5 ev and 953 5 ev can be attributed to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 which can form envelopes for cu 0 cu i in cu2o the peaks at 936 2 and 956 2 ev corresponding to the cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 can be indicative of the presence of cu ii in cuo in the sample which is also verified by the cu 2p3 2 satellite peak in the spectrum at about 943 6 22 23 the mineral phases and purity of the prepared fe nps and cu nps were examined using x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig 5 the peak appearing at 2θ value of 44 7 in fig 5 a matches with the characteristic 110 reflection of iron in its zero valent state fe0 the low intensity of the reflections indicate that fe nps structure is mostly amorphous 24 the xrd pattern of cu nps is shown in fig 5 b the reflections at 2θ values of 43 3 50 4 74 2 and 89 9 correspond to 111 200 220 and 311 planes respectively 25 these reflections match with metallic copper with a face centered cubic fcc unit cell the intense reflections indicate that cu nps possess a highly oriented crystalline structure 18 the relatively weak reflections below 2θ of 40 indicates the existence of copper oxide in the structure of cu nps the core shell structure has important implications for the nanoparticles as the surface charge of the nanoparticle depends on the oxide and hydroxide groups in the nanoparticle shell at a ph below the point of zero charge the surface is positively charged and as such it contains sorption centers which can attract the negatively charged mo entities mo structure contains a dimethyl substituted n atom and a sodium substituted s atom and since mo is an ionizable molecule with a pka of 3 4 it is capable of forming strong electrostatic interactions with sorbent surface under proper ph values 4 however when nanoparticles like fe nps are considered sorption is not the sole interaction mechanism with the sorbent since there is a possibility in this case for the degradation of the mo molecules through the cleavage of the nn bond in the molecular structure of the dye 26 3 2 spectral features of methyl orange in different solvents the spectral features of mo were analyzed in three types of solvents with different polarities water w water ethanol w e and water dmso table 1 gives some of the physicochemical properties of water ethanol and dmso 27 it is clear that the three solvents possess distinctive polarities which may influence the behavior of the dye molecules in the solution it is reported that the solvent polarity can strongly affect the non radiative energy relaxation processes in a solute molecule 28 electronic and vibrational energies of the ground and excited states of those molecules may change in accordance with the arrangement of the solvent molecules around the dye molecules moreover the polarity of the solution medium can affect the solute solute interactions leading to different aggregation behaviors 29 in solution the solute molecules can make solute solvent and solute solute interactions this can influence their photophysical properties and could be reflected in its uv vis spectra such interactions may have effects on the spectral features of the solute entities in terms of the position intensity and shape of the absorption peak in the spectra as seen in fig 1 the chromophoric groups in mo structure include two phenyl and one azo group which forms a bridge that connects the two benzene rings to which the ch3 2n and so3na groups are attached the spectra of mo show two characteristic absorption peaks one at 464 nm and another at 271 nm these peaks arise from the nitrogen azo bonding and the benzene ring of the dye molecule respectively with the former peak giving rise to the orange color of the dye upon degradation of the dye the former peak disappears while the latter one shifts to 246 nm 30 typical spectra of mo at a concentration of 10 0 mg l in the three types of solvents are shown in fig 6 in the three types of solvents no distinctive signs for dimers or larger aggregates are seen in the spectra however the curves of mo appear to be too broad in water the curves are clearly skewed toward high wavelengths while in both of the mixed solvent media the curves are blue shifted and appear more symmetric in all cases the spectral intensities are very close for a given dye concentration the corresponding λmax values were determined and used in calculating the transition energies of methyl orange molecules in the three solvents using rydberg s equation given in the following equation 31 1 e t n a h c λ where et is the transition energy j mol na is avogadro s number λ is the wavelength m h is plank s constant j s and c is the speed of light m s the obtained values of et are given in table 2 apparently as the values of dielectric constant and surface tension of the solvent increase the values of λmax increase and the values of et decrease it is reported that higher wavelengths or lower frequency are observed for mo in aqueous solvents compared with organic solvents 32 the wavelength can be assigned to a π1 π1 transition of a solvate which involves a specific hydrogen bonding interaction between the azo nitrogen in the dye structure and the h atoms in water molecules the absorption feature of mo molecules is reported to consist of two bands which are overlapping with the low frequency component arising from that solvate molecules the same study concluded that the free energies in various solvents in which hydrogen bonding is involved are correlated with the solvent surface tension 32 3 3 solvent type effect on the extent of mo removal this effect was studied using water water ethanol and water dmso solvents for both of fe nps and cu nps the results in terms of percentage mo removal are shown in fig 7 the percentage removal was calculated using the equation 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c c 0 x 100 where c is the liquid concentration of the dye mg l and c0 is its initial liquid concentration mg l according to the results fe nps are more effective in the removal of mo when compared with cu nps in the three solvents the trend of mo removal by fe nps is water water ethanol water dmso this trend is proportional with the trend of polarity of the solvents in the case of cu nps almost no dye removal was observed in water ethanol and water dmso solvents since the examination of the aggregation behavior of mo in the three solvents indicated no dimer or higher order aggregate formation it can be concluded that the solute solute interactions play minimal effects on the observed results on the other hand the solute solvent interactions seem to control the extent of mo removal in the three different solvents like mo molecules ethanol and dmso molecules consist of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts so solute solvent interactions in water ethanol and water dmso solutions compared with water solutions could be causing smaller extents of removal moreover the molecules of ethanol and dmso in the two mixed solvents might be forming solvation spheres around the nanoparticles in which the hydrophilic part is directed towards the hydroxyl groups at the nanoparticle surface while the hydrophobic part extends into solution possibly causing a steric hindrance acting against the accessibility of the dye molecules to the nanoparticle materials on the overall the solvent effect seems to be more inhibiting for mo sorption in the case of cu nps compared to fe nps roughly speaking through a variety of ferrous and ferric hydroxide and oxyhydroxide groups the latter material possesses a distinctly more chemically dynamic external surface which can be more attractive to mo dye molecules in the three types of solvents the following sections discuss the mo removal under different conditions due to the poorer performance of the water dmso solvent the later experiments were performed on a comparative basis between pure water and water ethanol solvents 3 4 effect of nanoparticle amounts on mo removal the obtained results of the effect of nanoparticle amount on the removal of mo at 298 k in water and water ethanol solutions are shown in fig 8 it is obvious that water is markedly more effective as a solvent for dye removal than water ethanol at all nanoparticle doses and for both types of nanoparticles the dye removal in water ethanol solvent does not exceed 2 at its best when cu nps are used in water solutions the removal of mo increases with an increase in the dose of nanoparticles this might be related with the availability of surface active sites which increases with the increased dose of the adsorbent 33 it is also evident from the results that fe nps possess higher efficiency in dye removal compared to cu nps under all conditions and it is possible to attain almost a complete removal of mo from water at the highest nanoparticle dose used in these experiments freundlich temkin langmuir dubinin radushkevich and harkins jura isotherms were used to fit the experimental data the equations of these isotherms are given in the equations 34 3 langmuir model q q m k l c 1 k l c 4 freundlich model q k f c 1 n 5 temkin model q b t ln a t c dubinin radushkevich d r model 6 q q m e k ε 2 i n w h i c h ε r t ln 1 1 c 7 harkins jura q β l o g c α in all equations q stands for the dye concentration on the solid phase mg g at equilibrium and c is the equilibrium liquid concentration mg l the other terms in the equations stand for the isotherm constants q and c are related using the mass balance equation for a batch system 8 q c0 c v m here c0 stands for mo initial concentration mg l v refers to the total solution volume l and m represents the mass of the nanomaterial used in the removal process g when considering the d r isotherm in particular it was recently suggested that obtaining the correct value of polanyi potential ε requires that the unit of solute concentration be chosen as molar concentration 35 the linear equations of these isotherms the coefficients of determination r2 and the fitting equations are provided in table 3 according to the linear regression results poor correlations were obtained for langmuir dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherms on the other hand harkins jura isotherm provided the best correlation followed by freundlich isotherm the linear fits obtained using these two models are shown in fig 9 a b both isotherms allow for sorption through multilayer formation on surfaces of heterogeneous nature harkins jura model was initially derived for gas solid adsorption systems but was then extended to liquid solid systems the isotherm constant β can be related with the specific surface area of the adsorbent s through the relation 36 9 β q s 2 4 606 r t n a here q is a constant which is characteristic of the sorbate material r is the universal gas constant t is the system temperature and na is avogadro s number the value of β constant is obtainable from the slope of a plot of log c versus 1 q2 as given in table 3 the obtained values of β can be used to determine the relative surface areas of the two nanoparticle types available for mo under the studied experimental conditions the values of the isotherm parameter β for the two cases of fe nps and cu nps are determined from the isotherm fits as 5974 9 and 601 4 respectively using the square roots of the absolute values of β the value of sfe scu comes out as 77 2 24 5 3 15 1 0 it is reported that the values of β can be used also to deduce information about the molecular orientation of the adsorbate on the adsorbent with the greater value pointing to a flat orientation while a smaller value signifying near vertical orientation 36 3 5 temperature effect on mo removal the related experiments were performed at 323 k by repeating the experiments of the effect of nps dose which were performed previously at 298 k the results in terms of percentage mo removal are shown in fig 10 a b in agreement with the previous results water solutions were much better than water ethanol mixtures for the removal of mo in the case of fe nps increasing the temperature resulted in increasing the removal of mo in both solvents the increase in temperature affects the adsorbate behavior both in solution and on the solid phase the increase in temperature can enhance the mobility of the adsorbate molecules inside the solution and increases the rate of diffusion of these molecules toward the adsorbent particles as a result of the decreased viscosity of the solution this factor can possibly explain the observed endothermic behavior of mo onto fe nps in contrast when using cu nps increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in the percentage removal of mo this might be attributed to possible weakening of the sorption bonds between mo molecules and the active sites of adsorbents at high temperatures 37 the difference in the thermal behavior of mo in fe nps and cu nps systems can also be connected with the relative contribution of sorption and degradation to the mechanism of removal in each of the two cases the results obtained from the effect of temperature were used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of sorption gibbs free energy changes and enthalpy changes the values of δg0 can be calculated using the well non thermodynamic relation 10 δg0 rt lnk here r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the solution temperature k and k stands for the equilibrium constant in sorption studies the value of k can be linked to the distribution ratio rd which is usually calculated as the ratio of the sorbate concentration on the solid to its liquid concentration qe ce using this ratio a phenomenological equilibrium constant k can then be calculated by the relation 38 11 k rd m v the obtained k values can be used to calculate the enthalpy changes δη0 associated with the uptake of mo from the water and water ethanol solutions using van t hoff equation 39 12 l n k 2 k 1 δ η o r 1 t 1 1 t 2 where k1 and k2 are the equilibrium constants of the reaction at two different temperatures t1 and t2 respectively the obtained values of δg0 and δh0 for mo removal using fe nps in the two solvents at 298 k and 323 k are shown in table 4 the table contains also the values of δg0 and δh0 for mo removal using cu nps in water only since the performance of cu nps in water ethanol was very poor as can be seen from the table the k values obtained for mo removal from water solutions are distinctly larger than those in water ethanol solutions in general the negative δg⁰ values indicate that the mo adsorption reaction onto fe nps favors the products over the reactants since k values would then be greater than one on the other hand in all cases positive values δg⁰ result from limited mo sorption which leads to k values less than one 38 literature resources indicate that endothermic behavior of mo removal was reported in some cases 6 40 while exothermic behavior was reported in others 13 41 the positive values of δh⁰ obtained in this study for the removal of mo using fe nps from solutions of water and water ethanol indicate that the energy requirement of dehydration effects of the mo molecules is larger than the energy associated with the intrinsic sorption step on the adsorbent surface this situation is reversed if exothermic behavior is observed as in the case of mo removal from water solutions using cu nps the calculated values of enthalpy change are in energy ranges which correspond mostly to physical adsorption and in some cases to weak chemical adsorption 39 3 6 salinity effect industrial dye wastewater is a complex chemical matrix which includes salts this justifies studying the effect of salinity on the removal process of mo the results of the corresponding experiments using the two solvent types and nanoparticle materials are given in table 5 which shows that nacl has detrimental effects on the extent of mo decolorization in general the percentage removal of mo from water by fe nps decreased from 94 0 no salt in solution to 83 6 when the concentration of nacl was 10 g l and the extent of dye removal decreased further as the concentration of nacl increased and reached to 74 5 at nacl concentration of 30 g l the decrease in the salt effect at 40 g l concentration stimulates further investigation but it might be attributed to partial recombination of the salt ions the negative effects of salinity were also observed when cu nps were used as the percentage removal of mo from water decreased from 63 6 no salt in solution to about 58 when nacl was added on the overall small changes in mo removal from water were observed as the nacl amount was raised gradually from 10 to 40 g l in water ethanol solutions the effect of salinity is more obvious as almost no removal of mo is observed upon the addition of nacl to solutions of both of fe nps and cu nps the decrease in mo removal in salty solutions might be caused by the competition between the dye entities and salt ions to the surface sites of the nanoparticles materials amphoteric oxide layer for example the outside iron oxide layer in fe nps is positively charged at ph values below the pzc 8 1 42 which makes it accessible to the anions that have lone pairs of electrons such as chloride ions these ions might compete with mo molecules for the reactive sites on the surface of fe nps which leads to reducing the decolorization efficiency 6 3 7 heterogeneous fenton reaction the nanoparticles of fe and cu were tried fenton like catalysts for degradation of mo from water and water ethanol mixtures this refers to the metal catalyzed reduction of hydrogen peroxide to produce primarily hydroxyl radicals which can in turn degrade organic pollutants the production of the radicals using fe nps as a catalyst can be represented by ref 43 fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o2 fe0 h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh metallic iron has been widely used as a heterogeneous fenton catalyst copper has also been proposed as an effective catalyst in fenton reactions and it is reported that the cu2 h2o2 fenton like system would be expected to operate over a broader ph range in comparison to the fe3 h2o2 redox system 44 the results are given in fig 11 it is clear that the effectiveness of fe nps for dye removal exceeds that of cu nps from both types of solvents and that water is better as a solvent for mo removal than water ethanol in this case the poorer performance of mo removal in water ethanol mixtures in comparison to that in water is not linked only to the aforementioned difference in solute solvent interactions it is interesting to note also that in addition to oxidizing the dye the hydroxyl radicals produced by the fenton cycle in acidic media can oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde 45 thus reducing further its effectiveness as a solvent the same reference reports that ethanol can be also oxidized even at neutral ph values under the effect of corrosion of zero valent iron by oxygen based on the obtained results heterogeneous fenton process does not seem to offer an advantage over the direct application of fe nps in mo removal under the studied conditions 3 8 effect of time on mo removal this effect was studied in two solvents water and water ethanol using fe nps and cu nps at initial dye concentration of 100 mg l based on the results presented in fig 12 a b it is clear that the removal of mo is faster and more efficient in water medium compared with water ethanol medium and that fe nps material is more effective in mo removal than cu nps in both solvent systems hence the better efficiency of fe nps is evident from a kinetic perspective in addition to the extent of mo removal reported in the previous sections under various conditions due to the poor kinetic performance of cu nps and also the poorer kinetic performance in water ethanol solvent the following kinetic analysis was performed only for mo removal by fe nps in water medium at 298 k and 323 k the experimental data were fitted to the two most widely used kinetic models the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics the pseudo first order rate equation pfe represented by lagergren s equation was used 46 13 q q e 1 e k 1 t linear fitting of the experimental data produced poor correlation as suggested by the values of the coefficients of determination r2 which were 0 8920 at 298 k and 0 4429 at 323 k however non linear fitting provided more convenient results for the data in particular at 323 k as shown in fig 13 next two forms of second order rate equations pse were used the nonlinear ho equation is given as 47 14 q k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qe is the experimental equilibrium value and k2 is the rate constant alternatively the equation suggested by shahwan for sorption cases which approached completion is given as 48 15 q k 2 q m c 0 t 1 k 2 c 0 t where c0 is the initial dye concentration k2 is the second order rate constant q is the amount of mo sorbed on nps qm stands for the amount of solute that could be sorbed if the sorption reaction is complete c0v m the two equations differ in the interpretation of qe or qm and the method of determination of the rate constant k and its unit since qm is used instead of qe the equation suggested by shahwan is reported to show better applicability when the removal is almost complete the unit of the rate constant are g mg 1 min 1 eq 14 and l mg 1 min 1 eq 15 the two units can be interrelated through the v m factor in each trial of the kinetic experiments 0 025 g sample of nanoparticle materials was introduced into 25 0 ml portion of solution which makes the v m ratio as 1 0 l g thus both units becomes equivalent for this specific case the experimental data were analyzed using non linear fitting and the results are shown in figs 13 and 14 for pfe and pse respectively the nonlinear fits were optimized using the chi test and the obtained rate constants are given in table 6 the values of the rate constants obtained by the two pseudo second order equation pse equations are very close the rate constants show that the rate of mo removal increases at higher temperature the agreement of the data with the second order kinetics can also be verified using the partial life calculation recently it was reported that a partial life of sorption for pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics can be determined using the two equations 49 16 t n s ln 1 1 n k 1 17 t n s n 1 n q e k 2 where tn stands for the partial life time n is a partial number i e 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 875 etc k1 and k2 are the rate constants of sorption units of g mg 1 min 1 and qe is the equilibrium loading mg g 1 the half life t0 50 value of sorption was determined from the experimental data and was compared with the half life values calculated using the rate constants obtained from the two pse equations given above the experimental half life values were determined graphically as 8 1 min at 298 k and 0 94 min at 323 k the corresponding model values were obtained from equation 16 were 3 0 min and 0 86 min this shows that pfe is not proper for describing the experimental data at 298 k while it gives a good prediction at 323 k on the other hand the corresponding model values obtained from equation 17 were 8 9 min 0 80 min using the rate constant obtained from equation 14 and 10 6 min 0 90 min using the rate constant obtained from equation 15 after unit adjustment as was mentioned above the experimental and model values seem close enough to conclude that pse provides proper correlation with the experimental data moreover graphical determination of the successive values of half life indicated that these values increases as the mo loading increases mo liquid concentration decreases which is a typical behavior of second order kinetics proper correlation of mo removal with pseudo first order was reported in some studies e g 5 6 10 on the other hand correlation of mo removal sorption with second order kinetics was reported in many studies for various types of sorbents some examples are mo uptake on fe ni nanoparticles 9 fe mn zr pani nc 11 carbon nanotubes 50 nio and cuo nanoparticles 51 and ni cr ldhs 52 finally the rate constants obtained from pseudo second order kinetics were used to calculate the activation energy ea of sorption using the well known equation 18 l n k 2 k 2 e a r 1 t 2 1 t 1 where k2 is the rate constant at t2 and k2 is the rate constant at t1 the obtained values were 73 7 kj mol 1 and 76 5 kj mol 1 using the rate constants obtained from equations 14 and 15 respectively hence the increase in temperature leads to more activated molecules which are capable of crossing the activation energy barrier of sorption and as such accelerates the mo removal 4 conclusion the transition energy of mo in the three studied solvents can be correlated with the trends of dielectric constant and surface tension of these solvents the spectral features indicated that the solute solute interactions are less effective than the solute solvent interactions in determining the behavior of mo molecules in solution on the overall fe nps were more effective in dye removal than cu nps and with a proper dose of fe nps almost a complete removal of mo from water was attained in addition it was found that water solutions are clearly more suitable than the other solvents for the removal of mo the removal of mo was best described with harkins jura isotherm the kinetic data can be adequately described with pseudo second order rate equation the removal of mo from solutions of water and water ethanol using fe nps was observed to be endothermic but it was exothermic in the case of cu nps the addition of nacl salt reduced the extent of mo removal under the studied experimental conditions under the operating conditions heterogeneous fenton process did not offer any advantage over the direct use of fe nps in the removal of mo under the studied conditions credit author statement m majadleh formal analysis

8757,in this study metallic iron nanoparticles fe nps and metallic copper nanoparticles cu nps were prepared characterized and used in the removal of methyl orange mo dye the experiments investigated first the uv vis spectra of dye molecules in three types of solvents water water ethanol and water dimethyl sulfoxide the removal of mo was then conducted under various experimental conditions to investigate the effects of solvent type nanoparticles dosage salinity of the solutions temperature and shaking time the highest extent of mo removal was achieved in water solutions under all experimental conditions fe nps showed higher efficiency than cu nps in mo removal moreover heterogeneous fenton process led to smaller mo removal when compared with the direct use of the nanoparticles for both water and water ethanol solutions from a kinetic perspective the dye removal process was much faster in water than in water ethanol mixtures and the data followed pseudo second order rate equation keywords methyl orange iron nanoparticles copper nanoparticles sorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution is increasingly causing global concern and innovative methods for water purification are being explored world wide as meeting the environmental regulations and quality standards is becoming more challenging the main sources of water contamination are of anthropogenic origin and dye related industries are among the leading contamination sources these industries consume huge amounts of water and the wastewater discharge from the related industrial facilities is considered as the most polluting of all the industrial sectors it is reported that more than 7 105 tons of synthetic dyes are being annually produced worldwide and up to 200 000 tons of these dyes are being lost to effluents every year from textile industry alone 1 dye removal technologies include membrane separation coagulation adsorption flocculation oxidation ion exchange advanced oxidation process electrochemical process photocatalysis biodegradation and others unfortunately many of the dyes can escape the conventional treatment methods of wastewaters 2 therefore intensive research has been conducted to synthesize cost effective novel materials which can efficiently remove synthetic and natural dye colorants from water bodies methyl orange mo is an anionic dye which is considered a model example of azo dyes the chemical formula of mo is c14h14n3nao3s and its structural formula is shown in fig 1 mo is water soluble and it is contained in the discharge effluents from various industries like printing leather paper textile and others 3 as an azo dye mo contains aromatic and n n groups in its structure which are highly toxic carcinogenic and teratogenic and the molecular diameter of the mo molecule is estimated to be around 6 8 nm based on its molecular weight and structure 3 many types of sorbents have been tested for the removal of mo dye from water solutions these include activated carbon biochar biosorbents clays and minerals polymers and resins composites and nanoparticles with the last type being reported to be the most effective 4 among various types of nanomaterials fe nanoparticles are reported to be among the most efficient emerging materials for mo removal from aqueous solutions 5 8 this has motivated the synthesis and application of many types of fe based nanomaterials for mo removal including bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles polymeric nanocomposites and others 9 11 cu nanoparticles are widely used in many industries like electronics ceramics polymers metallic coatings health care products in addition to their utilization in environmental remediation drug resistant pathogens and others 12 however inspite of the wide use of fe nanoparticles in the removal studies of mo no study seem to exist about mo removal by cu nps according to our literature search nevertheless some studies exist about the removal of mo by cu based nanomaterials like fe cu ag trimetallic nanoparticles 10 and cuo nanoflakes 13 recently fe cu bimetallic nps were applied by our group to elucidate its effectiveness in the removal of aqueous methylene blue under various experimental conditions in a comparative manner with fe nps 14 in addition although solvents play an important role in dye industry there is scarcity in the reports about the solvent effect on dye removal recently a study was published by our group about the comparative removal of methylene blue from aqueous solutions and from water ethanol mixtures 15 it was shown that the solvent type affects dye aggregation and as such the extent of its removal the aim of this work was to synthesize fe and cu nanoparticles by borohydride reduction method and characterize the materials and assess their potential for the removal of mo under various reaction conditions the characterization techniques include sem edx tem xps and xrd in order to reveal the structure morphology and elemental content of both nanomaterials the examined experimental parameters include solvent type time temperature nanoparticle doses salinity in addition to evaluating the materials performance as heterogeneous fenton catalysts 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 preparation of the nanoparticle materials the samples of fe nps were prepared using the borohydride reduction method this was acheived by dissolving 7 245 g 26 8 mmol of fecl3 6h2o in 25 0 ml portions of ethanol water mixture 4 1 v v the solution was then shaked under magnetic stirring for an extra period of 15 min milli q water was used throughout the process then 2 54 g 67 2 mmol of nabh4 was separately dissolved in 70 0 ml volume of pure water this solution was added quickly to the fe solution using a burette while continuously stirring during the reaction the color of the iron solution turned into black and evolution of h2 gas was observed the oxidation reduction reaction can be written as 16 fecl3 6h2o aq 3nabh4 aq 3h2o l fe0 s 3b oh 3 aq 3nacl aq 21 2h2 g the produced fe0 nps were separated from solutions by using vacuum filtration the resulting solid powder was then washed three times using absolute ethanol and was dried at 60 c for 3 h on the other hand the samples of cu nps were prepared by dissolving 4 569 g 26 8 mmol of cucl2 2h2o in 25 0 ml ethanol water mixture 4 1 v v the same steps were then followed as above the oxidation reduction reaction can be written as cucl2 2h2o aq 2nabh4 aq 4h2o cu0 s 2b oh 3 aq 2nacl aq 7h2 g the remaining steps were performed in the same way as given above 2 2 structural and elemental characterization of the nanomaterials in order to reveal the structural constituents of the samples the x ray diffraction xrd diagrams were recorded in a 2θ range of 10 80 using a diffractometer of stoe stadi p with a source of cu kα 1 5405 å operated at 40 kv 40 ma the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra were used in identifying the elemental contents and the oxidation states of the elements in the samples of fe nps and cu nps a phi 5800 multitechnique esca system was used in acquiring the spectra with monochromatized al kα 1486 6 ev radiation being used as a source at take off angle of 45 when recording detail scans the pass energies at the analyzer were 29 35 ev but it was kept at 93 90 ev for survey scans the morphology and sizes of fe nps and cu nps samples were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy tem the images were recorded with a jeol 1400 instrument operated at an accelerating voltage was 120 kv after initial preparation a copper grid was used to fix the samples on the device holder the experimental parameters were finally adjusted to obtain clear images elemental and mapping analysis of the nanoparticle materials were recorded energy dispersive x ray analysis edx the spectra were recorded using a zeiss gemini leo 1550 vp equipped with a silicon drift detector using a 10 kev electron beam with an accelerating voltage of 10 kv 2 3 calibration curves of mo the calibration curves of mo were constructed in three different solvents water w 1 1 v v water ethanol w e and 1 1 v v water dimethyl sulfoxide w dmso stock solutions of mo aldrich 140910 were prepared in the three solvents at a concentration of 1000 mg l dilute solutions were subsequently prepared by serial dilution using milli q water the uv visible spectra were recorded at mo concentrations ranging between 1 0 and 10 0 mg l in each of the three solvents in a spectral range of 200 700 nm 2 4 aggregation behavior of mo the aggregation behavior of mo was analyzed at an initial concentration of 10 0 mg l in three solvents w w e w dmso the dye absorbance spectra were used to determine the possible spectral shifts of the wavelength maxima λmax of the mo peaks in the three solvents which were observed to occur at 466 447 460 nm for mo in w w e w dmso respectively in addition the transition energy of the mo molecules in each of the three solutions was calculated 2 5 dye removal experiments different parameters were studied for the removal of mo using fe nps and cu nps the dye solutions obtained at the end of the removal experiments were diluted whenever needed prior to measuring the absorbance of mo solutions by uv vis spectrophotometry the studied experimental parameters are given below 2 5 1 effect of solvent and nanoparticle type on mo removal the removal process of mo in different solutions of w w e and w dmso was studied by using both of fe nps and cu nps at 298 k the extent of mo removal was investigated by introducing 0 025 g samples of each type of nanoparticles to 25 0 ml of 100 0 mg l mo in w w e and w dmso solutions the ph was then measured and the mixtures were shaken at a given temperature for a duration of 4 h in a thermostated shaking water bath the solid was separated from the liquid phase using gravity filtration and was then used to determine the dye concentration and the corresponding solution ph 2 5 2 effect of temperature and nanoparticle dose on the removal of mo the effect of nanoparticle dose of fe nps and cu nps on the removal of mo in different solutions of w and w e at two different temperatures 298 k and 323 k was studied by introducing 0 005 0 015 0 025 and 0 035 g of each nanoparticle type to 25 0 ml of 100 0 mg l mo in w and w e solutions then the ph was measured and the solutions were shaken once at 298 k and once at 323 k for 4 h in a thermostated shaking water bath the liquid phase of each solution was finally separated using gravity filtration 2 5 3 salinity effect on mo removal four concentrations of nacl 10 0 20 0 30 0 and 40 0 g l were prepared in mo solutions by adding the appropriate masses of nacl into 25 0 ml of 100 0 mg l mo solution containing 0 035 g of nanoparticles fe nps and cu nps the solutions were kept in a water bath at 298 k for 4 h finally the solutions were filtered and the mo concentration was determined 2 5 4 mo discoloration using a fenton like process the efficiency of fe nps and cu nps as heterogeneous fenton catalysts in mo removal was tested the experiments were performed in w and w e solutions by introducing 0 050 g nanoparticle samples to 45 0 ml of 100 mg l mo solution and 5 0 ml of freshly prepared 10 v v h2o2 a solution of 0 1 m hcl was used for ph adjustment of mo solutions before introducing the nanoparticles ph was approximately 3 37 the mixtures were then kept in a water bath at 298 k for 2 h and subsequently the liquid phase was separated from the mixture and analyzed 2 5 5 effect of time on mo removal the kinetic aspect of mo removal was studied at an initial dye concentration of 100 0 mg l in two solvents w and w e 1 1 at temperatures of 298 k and 323 k in each trial a 0 025 g sample of nanoparticle materials was introduced into 25 0 ml portion of dye solution the dye mixtures were then shaken at constant temperature for time periods ranging from 1 min to 4 h the liquid and solid components were separated using gravity filtration and the dye concentrations were measured using uv vis spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the nanoparticle materials the nanoparticle samples of fe and cu were characterized by sem edx xrd tem and xps techniques examples of tem images of fe nps and cu nps are shown in fig 2 fe nps appear in its typical chain like morphology fig 2 a which is attributed to the magnetic forces among the individual fe nanoparticles this aggregation is suggested to reduce the efficiency of the fe nps toward the removal of pollutants 17 on the other hand a tem image of cu nps is shown in fig 2 b it is reported that cu nanoparticles exhibit nearly spherical shape and have a strong tendency to aggregate and as such it can appear in nanopatches and nanocluster forms 18 the edx elemental spectra and mapping images of fe nps and cu nps are shown in fig 3 as expected the fe samples are dominated by fe and o and the cu samples are dominated by cu and o the oxygen content is not attributed totally to the samples as some of the oxygen and possibly carbon and nitrogen can arise from adventitious sources the elemental mapping images show that the o signals are intensively associated with fe and cu signals possibly due to the presence of the oxide phases at the particles surface which is in support of the core shell model structure of these metallic nanoparticles 19 the xps spectrum of fe 2p doublet obtained from fe nps is shown in fig 4 a the spectrum reveals a small shoulder at around 707 ev which designates the 2p3 2 peak of a zero valent iron core fe0 the photoelectron peaks centered around 710 ev and 724 ev suggest that the shell was largely made up of iron oxides and iron oxyhydroxide the peak deconvolution shows the existence of both ferrous and ferric ions in the fe sample the peaks at 711 ev and 724 ev originate from fe2 2p3 2 and fe2 2p1 2 respectively while the features around 713 ev and 726 ev originate from fe3 2p3 2 and fe3 2p1 2 respectively the appearance of the satellite feature indicates that iron ions are in high spin states which is characteristic of certain iron compounds like oxide compounds 20 21 the xps spectrum of a cu nps sample is shown in fig 4 b the peaks at 933 5 ev and 953 5 ev can be attributed to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 which can form envelopes for cu 0 cu i in cu2o the peaks at 936 2 and 956 2 ev corresponding to the cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 can be indicative of the presence of cu ii in cuo in the sample which is also verified by the cu 2p3 2 satellite peak in the spectrum at about 943 6 22 23 the mineral phases and purity of the prepared fe nps and cu nps were examined using x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig 5 the peak appearing at 2θ value of 44 7 in fig 5 a matches with the characteristic 110 reflection of iron in its zero valent state fe0 the low intensity of the reflections indicate that fe nps structure is mostly amorphous 24 the xrd pattern of cu nps is shown in fig 5 b the reflections at 2θ values of 43 3 50 4 74 2 and 89 9 correspond to 111 200 220 and 311 planes respectively 25 these reflections match with metallic copper with a face centered cubic fcc unit cell the intense reflections indicate that cu nps possess a highly oriented crystalline structure 18 the relatively weak reflections below 2θ of 40 indicates the existence of copper oxide in the structure of cu nps the core shell structure has important implications for the nanoparticles as the surface charge of the nanoparticle depends on the oxide and hydroxide groups in the nanoparticle shell at a ph below the point of zero charge the surface is positively charged and as such it contains sorption centers which can attract the negatively charged mo entities mo structure contains a dimethyl substituted n atom and a sodium substituted s atom and since mo is an ionizable molecule with a pka of 3 4 it is capable of forming strong electrostatic interactions with sorbent surface under proper ph values 4 however when nanoparticles like fe nps are considered sorption is not the sole interaction mechanism with the sorbent since there is a possibility in this case for the degradation of the mo molecules through the cleavage of the nn bond in the molecular structure of the dye 26 3 2 spectral features of methyl orange in different solvents the spectral features of mo were analyzed in three types of solvents with different polarities water w water ethanol w e and water dmso table 1 gives some of the physicochemical properties of water ethanol and dmso 27 it is clear that the three solvents possess distinctive polarities which may influence the behavior of the dye molecules in the solution it is reported that the solvent polarity can strongly affect the non radiative energy relaxation processes in a solute molecule 28 electronic and vibrational energies of the ground and excited states of those molecules may change in accordance with the arrangement of the solvent molecules around the dye molecules moreover the polarity of the solution medium can affect the solute solute interactions leading to different aggregation behaviors 29 in solution the solute molecules can make solute solvent and solute solute interactions this can influence their photophysical properties and could be reflected in its uv vis spectra such interactions may have effects on the spectral features of the solute entities in terms of the position intensity and shape of the absorption peak in the spectra as seen in fig 1 the chromophoric groups in mo structure include two phenyl and one azo group which forms a bridge that connects the two benzene rings to which the ch3 2n and so3na groups are attached the spectra of mo show two characteristic absorption peaks one at 464 nm and another at 271 nm these peaks arise from the nitrogen azo bonding and the benzene ring of the dye molecule respectively with the former peak giving rise to the orange color of the dye upon degradation of the dye the former peak disappears while the latter one shifts to 246 nm 30 typical spectra of mo at a concentration of 10 0 mg l in the three types of solvents are shown in fig 6 in the three types of solvents no distinctive signs for dimers or larger aggregates are seen in the spectra however the curves of mo appear to be too broad in water the curves are clearly skewed toward high wavelengths while in both of the mixed solvent media the curves are blue shifted and appear more symmetric in all cases the spectral intensities are very close for a given dye concentration the corresponding λmax values were determined and used in calculating the transition energies of methyl orange molecules in the three solvents using rydberg s equation given in the following equation 31 1 e t n a h c λ where et is the transition energy j mol na is avogadro s number λ is the wavelength m h is plank s constant j s and c is the speed of light m s the obtained values of et are given in table 2 apparently as the values of dielectric constant and surface tension of the solvent increase the values of λmax increase and the values of et decrease it is reported that higher wavelengths or lower frequency are observed for mo in aqueous solvents compared with organic solvents 32 the wavelength can be assigned to a π1 π1 transition of a solvate which involves a specific hydrogen bonding interaction between the azo nitrogen in the dye structure and the h atoms in water molecules the absorption feature of mo molecules is reported to consist of two bands which are overlapping with the low frequency component arising from that solvate molecules the same study concluded that the free energies in various solvents in which hydrogen bonding is involved are correlated with the solvent surface tension 32 3 3 solvent type effect on the extent of mo removal this effect was studied using water water ethanol and water dmso solvents for both of fe nps and cu nps the results in terms of percentage mo removal are shown in fig 7 the percentage removal was calculated using the equation 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c c 0 x 100 where c is the liquid concentration of the dye mg l and c0 is its initial liquid concentration mg l according to the results fe nps are more effective in the removal of mo when compared with cu nps in the three solvents the trend of mo removal by fe nps is water water ethanol water dmso this trend is proportional with the trend of polarity of the solvents in the case of cu nps almost no dye removal was observed in water ethanol and water dmso solvents since the examination of the aggregation behavior of mo in the three solvents indicated no dimer or higher order aggregate formation it can be concluded that the solute solute interactions play minimal effects on the observed results on the other hand the solute solvent interactions seem to control the extent of mo removal in the three different solvents like mo molecules ethanol and dmso molecules consist of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts so solute solvent interactions in water ethanol and water dmso solutions compared with water solutions could be causing smaller extents of removal moreover the molecules of ethanol and dmso in the two mixed solvents might be forming solvation spheres around the nanoparticles in which the hydrophilic part is directed towards the hydroxyl groups at the nanoparticle surface while the hydrophobic part extends into solution possibly causing a steric hindrance acting against the accessibility of the dye molecules to the nanoparticle materials on the overall the solvent effect seems to be more inhibiting for mo sorption in the case of cu nps compared to fe nps roughly speaking through a variety of ferrous and ferric hydroxide and oxyhydroxide groups the latter material possesses a distinctly more chemically dynamic external surface which can be more attractive to mo dye molecules in the three types of solvents the following sections discuss the mo removal under different conditions due to the poorer performance of the water dmso solvent the later experiments were performed on a comparative basis between pure water and water ethanol solvents 3 4 effect of nanoparticle amounts on mo removal the obtained results of the effect of nanoparticle amount on the removal of mo at 298 k in water and water ethanol solutions are shown in fig 8 it is obvious that water is markedly more effective as a solvent for dye removal than water ethanol at all nanoparticle doses and for both types of nanoparticles the dye removal in water ethanol solvent does not exceed 2 at its best when cu nps are used in water solutions the removal of mo increases with an increase in the dose of nanoparticles this might be related with the availability of surface active sites which increases with the increased dose of the adsorbent 33 it is also evident from the results that fe nps possess higher efficiency in dye removal compared to cu nps under all conditions and it is possible to attain almost a complete removal of mo from water at the highest nanoparticle dose used in these experiments freundlich temkin langmuir dubinin radushkevich and harkins jura isotherms were used to fit the experimental data the equations of these isotherms are given in the equations 34 3 langmuir model q q m k l c 1 k l c 4 freundlich model q k f c 1 n 5 temkin model q b t ln a t c dubinin radushkevich d r model 6 q q m e k ε 2 i n w h i c h ε r t ln 1 1 c 7 harkins jura q β l o g c α in all equations q stands for the dye concentration on the solid phase mg g at equilibrium and c is the equilibrium liquid concentration mg l the other terms in the equations stand for the isotherm constants q and c are related using the mass balance equation for a batch system 8 q c0 c v m here c0 stands for mo initial concentration mg l v refers to the total solution volume l and m represents the mass of the nanomaterial used in the removal process g when considering the d r isotherm in particular it was recently suggested that obtaining the correct value of polanyi potential ε requires that the unit of solute concentration be chosen as molar concentration 35 the linear equations of these isotherms the coefficients of determination r2 and the fitting equations are provided in table 3 according to the linear regression results poor correlations were obtained for langmuir dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherms on the other hand harkins jura isotherm provided the best correlation followed by freundlich isotherm the linear fits obtained using these two models are shown in fig 9 a b both isotherms allow for sorption through multilayer formation on surfaces of heterogeneous nature harkins jura model was initially derived for gas solid adsorption systems but was then extended to liquid solid systems the isotherm constant β can be related with the specific surface area of the adsorbent s through the relation 36 9 β q s 2 4 606 r t n a here q is a constant which is characteristic of the sorbate material r is the universal gas constant t is the system temperature and na is avogadro s number the value of β constant is obtainable from the slope of a plot of log c versus 1 q2 as given in table 3 the obtained values of β can be used to determine the relative surface areas of the two nanoparticle types available for mo under the studied experimental conditions the values of the isotherm parameter β for the two cases of fe nps and cu nps are determined from the isotherm fits as 5974 9 and 601 4 respectively using the square roots of the absolute values of β the value of sfe scu comes out as 77 2 24 5 3 15 1 0 it is reported that the values of β can be used also to deduce information about the molecular orientation of the adsorbate on the adsorbent with the greater value pointing to a flat orientation while a smaller value signifying near vertical orientation 36 3 5 temperature effect on mo removal the related experiments were performed at 323 k by repeating the experiments of the effect of nps dose which were performed previously at 298 k the results in terms of percentage mo removal are shown in fig 10 a b in agreement with the previous results water solutions were much better than water ethanol mixtures for the removal of mo in the case of fe nps increasing the temperature resulted in increasing the removal of mo in both solvents the increase in temperature affects the adsorbate behavior both in solution and on the solid phase the increase in temperature can enhance the mobility of the adsorbate molecules inside the solution and increases the rate of diffusion of these molecules toward the adsorbent particles as a result of the decreased viscosity of the solution this factor can possibly explain the observed endothermic behavior of mo onto fe nps in contrast when using cu nps increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in the percentage removal of mo this might be attributed to possible weakening of the sorption bonds between mo molecules and the active sites of adsorbents at high temperatures 37 the difference in the thermal behavior of mo in fe nps and cu nps systems can also be connected with the relative contribution of sorption and degradation to the mechanism of removal in each of the two cases the results obtained from the effect of temperature were used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of sorption gibbs free energy changes and enthalpy changes the values of δg0 can be calculated using the well non thermodynamic relation 10 δg0 rt lnk here r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the solution temperature k and k stands for the equilibrium constant in sorption studies the value of k can be linked to the distribution ratio rd which is usually calculated as the ratio of the sorbate concentration on the solid to its liquid concentration qe ce using this ratio a phenomenological equilibrium constant k can then be calculated by the relation 38 11 k rd m v the obtained k values can be used to calculate the enthalpy changes δη0 associated with the uptake of mo from the water and water ethanol solutions using van t hoff equation 39 12 l n k 2 k 1 δ η o r 1 t 1 1 t 2 where k1 and k2 are the equilibrium constants of the reaction at two different temperatures t1 and t2 respectively the obtained values of δg0 and δh0 for mo removal using fe nps in the two solvents at 298 k and 323 k are shown in table 4 the table contains also the values of δg0 and δh0 for mo removal using cu nps in water only since the performance of cu nps in water ethanol was very poor as can be seen from the table the k values obtained for mo removal from water solutions are distinctly larger than those in water ethanol solutions in general the negative δg⁰ values indicate that the mo adsorption reaction onto fe nps favors the products over the reactants since k values would then be greater than one on the other hand in all cases positive values δg⁰ result from limited mo sorption which leads to k values less than one 38 literature resources indicate that endothermic behavior of mo removal was reported in some cases 6 40 while exothermic behavior was reported in others 13 41 the positive values of δh⁰ obtained in this study for the removal of mo using fe nps from solutions of water and water ethanol indicate that the energy requirement of dehydration effects of the mo molecules is larger than the energy associated with the intrinsic sorption step on the adsorbent surface this situation is reversed if exothermic behavior is observed as in the case of mo removal from water solutions using cu nps the calculated values of enthalpy change are in energy ranges which correspond mostly to physical adsorption and in some cases to weak chemical adsorption 39 3 6 salinity effect industrial dye wastewater is a complex chemical matrix which includes salts this justifies studying the effect of salinity on the removal process of mo the results of the corresponding experiments using the two solvent types and nanoparticle materials are given in table 5 which shows that nacl has detrimental effects on the extent of mo decolorization in general the percentage removal of mo from water by fe nps decreased from 94 0 no salt in solution to 83 6 when the concentration of nacl was 10 g l and the extent of dye removal decreased further as the concentration of nacl increased and reached to 74 5 at nacl concentration of 30 g l the decrease in the salt effect at 40 g l concentration stimulates further investigation but it might be attributed to partial recombination of the salt ions the negative effects of salinity were also observed when cu nps were used as the percentage removal of mo from water decreased from 63 6 no salt in solution to about 58 when nacl was added on the overall small changes in mo removal from water were observed as the nacl amount was raised gradually from 10 to 40 g l in water ethanol solutions the effect of salinity is more obvious as almost no removal of mo is observed upon the addition of nacl to solutions of both of fe nps and cu nps the decrease in mo removal in salty solutions might be caused by the competition between the dye entities and salt ions to the surface sites of the nanoparticles materials amphoteric oxide layer for example the outside iron oxide layer in fe nps is positively charged at ph values below the pzc 8 1 42 which makes it accessible to the anions that have lone pairs of electrons such as chloride ions these ions might compete with mo molecules for the reactive sites on the surface of fe nps which leads to reducing the decolorization efficiency 6 3 7 heterogeneous fenton reaction the nanoparticles of fe and cu were tried fenton like catalysts for degradation of mo from water and water ethanol mixtures this refers to the metal catalyzed reduction of hydrogen peroxide to produce primarily hydroxyl radicals which can in turn degrade organic pollutants the production of the radicals using fe nps as a catalyst can be represented by ref 43 fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o2 fe0 h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh metallic iron has been widely used as a heterogeneous fenton catalyst copper has also been proposed as an effective catalyst in fenton reactions and it is reported that the cu2 h2o2 fenton like system would be expected to operate over a broader ph range in comparison to the fe3 h2o2 redox system 44 the results are given in fig 11 it is clear that the effectiveness of fe nps for dye removal exceeds that of cu nps from both types of solvents and that water is better as a solvent for mo removal than water ethanol in this case the poorer performance of mo removal in water ethanol mixtures in comparison to that in water is not linked only to the aforementioned difference in solute solvent interactions it is interesting to note also that in addition to oxidizing the dye the hydroxyl radicals produced by the fenton cycle in acidic media can oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde 45 thus reducing further its effectiveness as a solvent the same reference reports that ethanol can be also oxidized even at neutral ph values under the effect of corrosion of zero valent iron by oxygen based on the obtained results heterogeneous fenton process does not seem to offer an advantage over the direct application of fe nps in mo removal under the studied conditions 3 8 effect of time on mo removal this effect was studied in two solvents water and water ethanol using fe nps and cu nps at initial dye concentration of 100 mg l based on the results presented in fig 12 a b it is clear that the removal of mo is faster and more efficient in water medium compared with water ethanol medium and that fe nps material is more effective in mo removal than cu nps in both solvent systems hence the better efficiency of fe nps is evident from a kinetic perspective in addition to the extent of mo removal reported in the previous sections under various conditions due to the poor kinetic performance of cu nps and also the poorer kinetic performance in water ethanol solvent the following kinetic analysis was performed only for mo removal by fe nps in water medium at 298 k and 323 k the experimental data were fitted to the two most widely used kinetic models the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics the pseudo first order rate equation pfe represented by lagergren s equation was used 46 13 q q e 1 e k 1 t linear fitting of the experimental data produced poor correlation as suggested by the values of the coefficients of determination r2 which were 0 8920 at 298 k and 0 4429 at 323 k however non linear fitting provided more convenient results for the data in particular at 323 k as shown in fig 13 next two forms of second order rate equations pse were used the nonlinear ho equation is given as 47 14 q k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qe is the experimental equilibrium value and k2 is the rate constant alternatively the equation suggested by shahwan for sorption cases which approached completion is given as 48 15 q k 2 q m c 0 t 1 k 2 c 0 t where c0 is the initial dye concentration k2 is the second order rate constant q is the amount of mo sorbed on nps qm stands for the amount of solute that could be sorbed if the sorption reaction is complete c0v m the two equations differ in the interpretation of qe or qm and the method of determination of the rate constant k and its unit since qm is used instead of qe the equation suggested by shahwan is reported to show better applicability when the removal is almost complete the unit of the rate constant are g mg 1 min 1 eq 14 and l mg 1 min 1 eq 15 the two units can be interrelated through the v m factor in each trial of the kinetic experiments 0 025 g sample of nanoparticle materials was introduced into 25 0 ml portion of solution which makes the v m ratio as 1 0 l g thus both units becomes equivalent for this specific case the experimental data were analyzed using non linear fitting and the results are shown in figs 13 and 14 for pfe and pse respectively the nonlinear fits were optimized using the chi test and the obtained rate constants are given in table 6 the values of the rate constants obtained by the two pseudo second order equation pse equations are very close the rate constants show that the rate of mo removal increases at higher temperature the agreement of the data with the second order kinetics can also be verified using the partial life calculation recently it was reported that a partial life of sorption for pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics can be determined using the two equations 49 16 t n s ln 1 1 n k 1 17 t n s n 1 n q e k 2 where tn stands for the partial life time n is a partial number i e 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 875 etc k1 and k2 are the rate constants of sorption units of g mg 1 min 1 and qe is the equilibrium loading mg g 1 the half life t0 50 value of sorption was determined from the experimental data and was compared with the half life values calculated using the rate constants obtained from the two pse equations given above the experimental half life values were determined graphically as 8 1 min at 298 k and 0 94 min at 323 k the corresponding model values were obtained from equation 16 were 3 0 min and 0 86 min this shows that pfe is not proper for describing the experimental data at 298 k while it gives a good prediction at 323 k on the other hand the corresponding model values obtained from equation 17 were 8 9 min 0 80 min using the rate constant obtained from equation 14 and 10 6 min 0 90 min using the rate constant obtained from equation 15 after unit adjustment as was mentioned above the experimental and model values seem close enough to conclude that pse provides proper correlation with the experimental data moreover graphical determination of the successive values of half life indicated that these values increases as the mo loading increases mo liquid concentration decreases which is a typical behavior of second order kinetics proper correlation of mo removal with pseudo first order was reported in some studies e g 5 6 10 on the other hand correlation of mo removal sorption with second order kinetics was reported in many studies for various types of sorbents some examples are mo uptake on fe ni nanoparticles 9 fe mn zr pani nc 11 carbon nanotubes 50 nio and cuo nanoparticles 51 and ni cr ldhs 52 finally the rate constants obtained from pseudo second order kinetics were used to calculate the activation energy ea of sorption using the well known equation 18 l n k 2 k 2 e a r 1 t 2 1 t 1 where k2 is the rate constant at t2 and k2 is the rate constant at t1 the obtained values were 73 7 kj mol 1 and 76 5 kj mol 1 using the rate constants obtained from equations 14 and 15 respectively hence the increase in temperature leads to more activated molecules which are capable of crossing the activation energy barrier of sorption and as such accelerates the mo removal 4 conclusion the transition energy of mo in the three studied solvents can be correlated with the trends of dielectric constant and surface tension of these solvents the spectral features indicated that the solute solute interactions are less effective than the solute solvent interactions in determining the behavior of mo molecules in solution on the overall fe nps were more effective in dye removal than cu nps and with a proper dose of fe nps almost a complete removal of mo from water was attained in addition it was found that water solutions are clearly more suitable than the other solvents for the removal of mo the removal of mo was best described with harkins jura isotherm the kinetic data can be adequately described with pseudo second order rate equation the removal of mo from solutions of water and water ethanol using fe nps was observed to be endothermic but it was exothermic in the case of cu nps the addition of nacl salt reduced the extent of mo removal under the studied experimental conditions under the operating conditions heterogeneous fenton process did not offer any advantage over the direct use of fe nps in the removal of mo under the studied conditions credit author statement m majadleh formal analysis

8758,released cesium 137 poses a serious threat to living organisms and the environment as a radioactive substance it can only be disposed by the greatest possible concentration and safe storage in our work a highly efficient sorbent cuhcf p qmax 143 6 3 2 mg g composed of pectin p and modified copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf was prepared for the removal of cesium from aqueous solutions suitable modification of cuhcf generated a homogeneous and highly packed sorbent with active substances up to 50 the as prepared sorbent exhibited a suitable bead shape round 2 4 mm diameter wet form for application in dynamic systems and allowed easy separation from the purified solution cuhcf p sorbent showed high sorption capacity in seawater q 104 6 3 5 mg g and stability over a wide range of ph 4 10 and temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c in addition cuhcf was dust free and occupied little volume when dry therefore proposed sorbent can be successfully used to trap cesium ions graphical abstract image 1 keywords cesium 137 adsorption batch studies column studies polysaccharide bio based adsorbent 1 introduction water pollution is a major problem in modern society and is mainly caused by human activity that originates from households industry agriculture mines and sometimes infiltration discharged wastewater may contain particularly hazardous substances such as organic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides inorganic compounds heavy metals nitrates organometallic compounds methylmercury tributyltin radioactive elements radon radium uranium cesium strontium and various types of biological materials microorganisms 1 6 in recent years special attention has also been paid to so called contaminants of emerging concerns cecs which include various pharmaceuticals hormones personal care products surfactants pesticides flame retardants heavy metals nanomaterials and microplastics 5 7 8 additionally the high risk factor associated with wastewater containing radioactive elements has encourage more focus on the area radioactive liquid effluent originates from the direct operation of nuclear power plants industrial plants and medical applications furthermore associated wastewaters can stem from for example the processing of spent nuclear fuel and seawater contaminated with radioactive elements as well as laundries washes for floors or other surfaces contaminated with radioactive elements 9 14 among particularly hazardous radionuclides cesium 137 is of particular interest because it has a very long half life 30 years radioactive cesium can be released into the environment for example as a result of a nuclear power plant accident recently the biggest accident was at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant npp in japan which released significant amounts of fission products that contain among others radioisotopes of cesium 15 radioactive cesium can also come from the production and testing of nuclear weapons or production and use of radioisotopes in medicine and industry 16 17 it is also a component of spent nuclear fuel cesium 137 is highly soluble and therefore poses a serious threat to the environment and humans radioactive cesium can easily be incorporated into living organism tissues and cause damage to cells and dna making it very carcinogenic 15 16 18 hence work with radioactive materials their protection and radioactive waste management are strictly regulated by international regulations and periodically controlled depending on the type of waste generated solid gaseous liquid appropriate methods are selected for its disposal or protection however since radionuclide activity can only be reduced by their decay the main purpose of treating and disposal of all types of radioactive waste is their proper segregation volume reduction solidification and storage in a specific manner that makes them safer for all living organisms 19 20 one of the techniques enabling volume reduction or solidification or rather immobilization of a substance on a solid carrier is adsorption adsorption is a low cost and highly efficient technique as it is easily implemented and easy to operate and requires only small qualities of reagents moreover it is suitable for removing contaminants from solutions over a very wide range of concentrations 1 8 21 the spectrum of adsorption applications is very broad and is basically limited to the selection of a suitable sorbent metal hexacyanoferrates mhcf are the best known adsorbents for cesium ions removal with high selectivity and good sorption capacity mhcfs are coordination polymers consisting of a transition metal cation for example fe3 cu2 ni2 zn2 and hexacyanoferrate anions they have a face centered cubic structure that contain channels with dimensions similar to those of hydrated cesium ions therefore cesium ions can be trapped in these channels by simple physical adsorption 22 23 making mhcfs effective and attractive substances for this purpose unfortunately they are obtained as fine powders which are impossible or very difficult to use in static and flow systems to address this problem new advanced materials have been developed to improve the performance of mhcfs in such materials powders are combined with other substances to obtain sorbents with better operating properties e g sodium cobalt hexacyanoferrate encapsulated alginate beads reinforced with highly dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes 24 sludge functionalized with potassium copper hexacyanoferrate 25 electrospun nanofibers embedded with potassium copper hexacyanoferrate 26 porous hydrogel containing prussian blue nanoparticles 27 prussian blue embedded alginate aerogel 28 magnetic bentonite chitosan hybrid beads 29 and from our previously study using hybrid pectin prussian blue beads 30 additionally the literature describes various advanced materials for the removal of many other organic and inorganic contaminants 6 7 21 31 35 the possibility of creating new highly efficient and highly selective sorbents is of great interest when creating a new hybrid sorbent not only should high sorption capacity be considered but also the whole cost of manufacturing and substrate availability in addition in the case of radioactive materials whose activity may be reduced only by decay of sorbents it should be easily storable and dust free therefore in our work we described a method for the preparation of highly efficient copper hexacyanoferrate embedded pectin sorbents for the removal of radioactive cesium ions the proposed sorbents contained copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf as an active sorption substance and pectin as a matrix for its immobilization pectin is a cheap substrate of natural origin and often obtained as a waste product from vegetable and fruit processing additionally it has the ability to gelate in the presence of divalent cations for example calcium ions therefore it can be used as a matrix to produce sorbents the combination of

hexacyanoferrate khcf to cucl2 was 1 2 3 hence 10 solution of khcf 100 ml was slowly poured into a 10 solution of copper chloride 84 ml and intensively stirred with a mechanical stirrer the resulting brown precipitate was stirred with the stock solution for 1 h this was followed with decanting centrifuging and washing with demineralized water finally the precipitate was dried for 24 h at 45 c and then ground using a batch mill and mortar water dispersible cuhcf was prepared by modifying its surface with khcf according to the method proposed by ishizaki et al 36 briefly the obtained cuhcf was stirred for 3 days in 5 khcf solution 4 ml of khcf 1 g of cuhcf then washed with demineralized water the prepared modified cuhcf cuhcf was used to obtain sorbents 2 4 hybrid sorbent preparation a

concentration of cuhcf and pectin in the final solution was 3 cuhcf suspension in pectin was then slowly dropped by peristaltic pump into continuously stirred cold cacl2 solution 1 m 4 c after 24 h of contact with cacl2 the obtained sorbent cuchf p was filtered washed with demineralized water to remove chloride ions and dried at 45 c 2 5 sorption experiments 2 5 1 general procedure for cesium ions sorption examination in general batch sorption experiments were performed by contacting the dry sorbent with a nonradioactive cesium ion solution dry sorbent dose 1 g l c0 130 mg l ph 6 temp 22 1 c t 48 h the concentration of the cesium ions in the initial and purified solution was measured using icp aes or icp ms apparatus the amount of adsorbed cesium was calculated as the difference between the amount of cesium in the initial solution and that in the final solution after sorption the sorption capacity q or the removal efficiency r were calculated using the formula shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q c0 c v m 2 r c0 c c0 100 where c0 the initial concentration of cesium ions in solution mg l c the final concentration of cesium ions in solution mg l v the volume of solution l m the

general sorption examination procedure the effect of ph in the range of 2 10 on cesium ion sorption was also tested according to the general sorption examination procedure in addition the effect of ph on hybrid sorbent swelling index was examined each sample of hybrid cuhcf p sorbent after sorption was carefully dried with a paper towel and immediately weighed the swelling index was calculated according to eq 3 3 s ms md where ms mass of the swollen sorbent g md mass of the dry sorbent g 2 5 2 effect of interfering cations the effect of na k ca2 and mg2 on the sorption of cesium ions was

substitute ocean water sow prepared according to astm d 1141 98 standard 37 was studied the cesium ion partition coefficient was determined according to eq 4 4 kd c0 ce ce v m 2 5 3 sorption isotherms

5 4 sorption kinetics the sorption kinetics were determined over a time interval from 1 min to 48 h at three different temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c according to the general sorption examination the sorption kinetics on pre swelled sorbent in demineralized water was also investigated an appropriate amount of sorbent was contacted with demineralized water for 24 h then filtered and dried with a paper towel the swollen sorbent was used for the kinetic studies the obtained results were used to calculate the parameters of pseudo first order kinetic models eq 7 39 40 and pseudo second order

studies continuous studies were conducted in glass columns 1 5 cm in diameter and 25 cm in length appropriate masses 1 5 g 2 g and 3 g of dry hybrid cuhcf p sorbent were contacted with demineralized water for at least 2 h for swelling before introduction to the column the sorbent slurry in water was introduced into the column to avoid the formation of air bubbles the cesium solution was fed into the column using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 30 ml h 25 ml samples were collected until c c0 ratio of 0 02 was reached in the effluent cesium concentration was examined by icp ms a bdst model

as a brown powder fig 1 a which formed agglomerates in water and pectin fig 1b the agglomerates were not desirable as they caused clogging of the peristaltic pump tubing during the preparation of sorbents and made the final materials less homogeneous surface modification of cuhcf was achieved by contacting for 3 days with khcf solution which yielded a homogeneous aqueous dispersion solution of cuhcf the modification caused an amazing change in the surface charge on cuhcf particles where after contact with water and pectin the particles electrostatically repulsed each other to form a homogeneous dispersion fig 1c furthermore sem micrographs of cuhcf powder cuhcf suspension in pectin and suspension of modified cuhcf in pectin are shown in fig 1d e and f the micrographs showed that modified cuhcf was efficiently dispersed compared to unmodified cuhcf fig 1f and d shows numerous fine bright spots of modified cuhcf and nonuniformly distributed clumped cuhcf agglomerates respectively 3 2 hybrid sorbent characteristics the resulting sorbents ranged in size from 2 to 4 mm fig 2 a and 1 2 mm after drying fig 2b the majority of sorbent beads were spherical in shape but some were slightly oblong after drying the difference in the bead s shape was almost unnoticeable the uniform distribution of cuhcf particles was confirmed by sem fig 2c the depicted micrograph showed bright cuhcf spots examples circled in red uniformly distributed in the calcium ion cross linked pectin matrix sem micrograph of only pectin sorbent beads was provided for comparison fig 2 d thermogravimetric analysis was performed under an inert ar atmosphere in a temperature range of 20 1000 c fig 3 a all samples were dried at 80 c before analysis the data revealed that the obtained sorbents cuhcf p cuhcf powder and pectin sorbents were stable up to 150 190 c and only free and interstitial water loss was observed up to this temperature in the case of cuhcf a weight loss was observed up to 125 c whereas for sorbents the weight loss associated with water loss occurred up to approx 190 c weight loss was 2 5 and 3 for cuhcf p and p only pectin sorbent respectively between 125 and 350 c for cuhcf exothermic decomposition of the cyanide groups occurred which formed intermediates and released carbon monoxide nitrogen and ammonia 42 above 200 c the pectin matrix decomposed the mass loss was about 27 for cuhcf and 55 for hybrid sorbent cuhcf p at approx 750 c and 600 c for cuhcf and hybrid sorbent respectively the final stage of cuhcf decomposition was observed the final residual mass was approx 45 38 and 20 for cuhcf cuhcf p and pectin only sorbent pectin respectively the crystalline structure of cuhcf cuhcf p sorbent and pectin only sorbent were compared by xrd analysis fig 3b cuhcf powder red line showed five distinct and intense peaks 18 25 36 40 and 44 2theta which indicated the crystalline nature of cuhcf powder these peaks corresponded to the peaks of cu2 fe cn 6 from the database and they identifies obtained powder pectin only sorbent was amorphous in nature black line because no diffraction peaks were registered the diffractogram of the hybrid sorbent cuhcf p blue line showed less intense peaks than the diffractogram of cuhcf powder and they were slightly shifted to higher 2theta values however the packing of the hybrid sorbent with cuhcf powder was confirmed the composition of the obtained cuhcf p composite sorbents was confirmed by ft ir spectroscopy the spectra of cuhcf precipitate hybrid cuhcf p sorbent and only pectin sorbent are summarized in fig 3c the spectra of all the studied materials at 3600 3000 cm 1 showed characteristic broad absorption bands related to symmetric and asymmetric stretching of oh groups from water the peaks at approx 1600 cm 1 were related to the coordination water from cuhcf but also bands from co and c oh groups of pectin were observed characteristic bands of carbohydrates were observed for cuhcf p and only pectin sorbents at 1200 950 cm 1 43 the spectrum of cuhcf precipitate showed a characteristic peak at 2080 cm 1 corresponding to cn group 44 45 this peak was also present in the spectrum of hybrid sorbent cuhcf p which confirmed the immobilization of cuhcf precipitate in the pectin matrix 3 3 sorption experiments 3 3 1 the effect of sorbent dose on sorption capacity and removal efficiency the effect of sorbent dose on the sorption capacity q and efficiency of cesium ion removal r is shown in fig 4 the cesium ions removal ratio increased with increasing sorbent dose reaching 99 8 at the highest sorbent dose studied 6 g l however very high cesium ion removal efficiency above 90 was achieved from sorbent dose of 1 5 g l the sorption capacity was expressed as milligrams of cesium ions per 1 g of sorbent which decreased with increasing sorbent dose and degree of cesium ions removal the highest value of sorption capacity of 147 9 mg g was obtained at 0 2 g l dose whereas the lowest was 6 g l dose 21 1 mg g for further studies a sorbent dose of 1 g l was selected which had high sorption capacity and approx 20 of the initial amount of cesium ions remained in solution after sorption the removal rate of cesium ions at a dose of 1 g l was 75 6 3 3 2 the effect of ph on cesium ions sorption capacity the effect of ph on sorption capacity of the obtained sorbent was also investigated and the results are shown in fig 5 a it was found that the studied sorbent showed very good sorption capacities at ph range of 4 10 slightly lower sorption capacities were obtained for solutions with lower ph 2 and 3 it is worth noting that even under these conditions the proposed sorbent was very effective the reduced capacity of the sorption properties at low ph stemmed from the inhibition of cesium ions sorption in the presence of a large amount of h ions which could compete with cesium ions for active sites additionally in ph range of 2 8 the swelling index of the sorbents did not change significantly fig 5b thus the sorbents exhibited enhanced stability and ability to carry out sorption processes in solutions of various ph hence in the case of real wastewater there would be no need for wastewater ph corrections 3 3 3 effect of interfering cations the effect of na k ca2 and mg2 interference at concentrations of 0 01 m 0 1 m and 0 3 m and sow on the removal efficiency r of cesium ions from solution was investigated it was observed that with increasing concentration of interfering cations the removal efficiency of cesium ions decreased but still was considered high fig 6 for example for k the removal rates were 87 80 and 75 at concentrations of 0 01 m 0 1 m and 0 3 m respectively this relationship was obvious in the partition coefficient kd values table 1 which for example for k ions changed with increasing concentration 6641 4049 and 3029 ml g the presence of interfering ions at 0 01 m concentration had the least effect on the sorption of cesium ions and a slight decrease in the removal rate of cesium ions was observed compared to the solution without these ions at concentrations of 0 1 m and 0 3 m a significant interfering effect on the sorption of cesium ions was observed the presence of mg2 caused a decrease in the removal efficiency of cesium ions below 50 the lowest kd value at the highest concentration of interfering ions a decrease in cesium sorption occurred in the order of mg2 ca2 na k this order followed the same decreasing trend in the hydrated radii of the cations mg2 0 428 nm ca2 0 412 nm na 0 358 nm k 0 331 nm this relationship is commonly used to explain the effect of interfering ions on sorption 46 47 divalent cations are also known to be more easily sorbed than monovalent ones due to their stronger positive charge 29 48 thus the effect of the studied ions on cesium ion sorption of hybrid cuhcf p sorbents was explained in this way in addition it is known that in the environment and especially in seawater the concentrations of mg2 ca2 and k ions are lower than previously tested and therefore the observed decrease in the sorption efficiency of cesium ions in their presence may be considered negligible furthermore it was important to investigate the effect of seawater on the sorption of cesium ions on the tested sorbents in our study we used sow prepared according to the astm d 1141 98 standard 37 under these conditions the cesium ions sorption efficiency was reduced to approx 70 q 104 6 3 5 mg g in sow and kd equaled 2396 ml g however considering the abundant composition of sow the deterioration of sorption properties was negligible and the sorbents were successfully used for cesium ions removal from e g seawater 3 3 4 sorption isotherms the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations were used to characterize the equilibrium sorption of cesium ions on hybrid sorbents these isotherms described the relationship between the sorption capacity of a sorbent and concentration of cesium ions in equilibrium fig 7 the calculated parameters of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms are presented in table 2 a better correlation coefficient was obtained for the langmuir isotherm r2 0 979 compared to the freundlich isotherm r2 0 927 thus experimental results of cesium ions sorption on the studied sorbents provided more compatible the langmuir isotherm model the langmuir isotherm assumes that there is a fixed number of active sites with the same energy on the sorbent where each active site is occupied by one adsorbate molecule and no interaction occurs between the adsorbed molecules on the nearest active sites 49 in contrast the freundlich isotherm assumes the existence of heterogeneous active sites with non uniformly distributed energy 49 therefore since the difference in the correlation coefficients obtained for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms was considered minor it was not concisely determined that the sorption of cesium ions on cuhcf p hybrid sorbent occurred in the monolayer and that all active sites on the sorbent had the same energy hence we examined a hybrid sorbent consisting of two different substances that can trap cesium ions in a completely different way mhcfs exhibit high affinity for cesium ions because of the presence of regular spaces in their structure with dimensions close to those of the hydrated cesium ion that trap cesium ions the mechanism of sorption of cesium ions on fehcf by chemical adsorption through hydrophilic lattice defect sites with proton elimination from coordination water was previously proposed 50 as well as ion exchange between k and cs on cuhcf was also suggested 51 reports have shown that the mechanism of cesium ion adsorption on mhcf is not yet fully understood and is rather controversial 52 53 in addition some cesium ions may be trapped in the swollen pectin matrix on our hybrid sorbent therefore the sorbent should display heterogeneous active sites with different energies additionally the sorption capacity of hybrid cuhcf p sorbent with that of cuhcf powder alone was compared the sorption capacity of the powder was 190 7 mg g at a dose rate of 0 5 g l which corresponded to the hybrid sorbent with a cuhcf p ratio of 1 1 and a dose rate of 1 g l if cuhcf was solely responsible for the sorption capacity of the hybrid sorbent then 95 4 mg of cesium ions should be trapped on 1 g of cuhcf p 1 g of sorbent contained 0 5 g cuhcf and not 143 mg that was determined by the maximum sorption capacity previous reports have proven that the cesium ions sorption capacity of pectin only sorbent beads is rather poor 54 therefore some synergistic effect occurs which stems from a higher total sorption capacity and not as indicated by the content of the active substance in the hybrid sorbent although the presented models could not explain the nature of the sorption they were used to determine various parameters e g maximum sorption capacity from which the properties of the different sorbents were compared the maximum sorption capacity of cuhcf p sorbent calculated from the langmuir equation was 143 6 3 2 mg g table 3 compares the sorption capacities of different sorbents for cesium ions removal and sorption capacity of sole cuhcf powder the materials with higher e g molybdophosphate magnetic fe3o4 chitosan composites securely anchored prussian blue nanocrystals on the surface of porous paam sphere and lower sorption capacities others in the table than hybrid cuhcf p sorbent were obtained furthermore the sorption capacity of the copper ferrocyanide powder was lower than that of the studied cuhcf powder and cuhcf p sorbent also other sorbents containing copper ii hexacyanoferrate e g copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticle decorated biochar produced from pomelo peel copper hexacyanoferrate pan composite electrospun nanofibers embedded with potassium copper hexacyanoferrate copper hexacyanoferrate polymer composite beads or potassium copper hexacyanoferrate embedded magnetic hydrogel beads exhibited worse sorption properties when selecting a sorbent for a specific application in addition to its maximum sorption capacity other properties such as shape ability to be separated from the treated solution and ability to be used in a continuous system must also be considered when radioactive substances are disposed it is also important that the sorbent material is dust free and occupies the smallest possible volume this is due to the only way to dispose of radioactive substances is through decay for this purpose they are usually stored in a solidified form in specially protected and dedicated facilities cuhcf p had a high sorption capacity and was easily separated from the treated solution applicable for flow systems stable over a wide range of ph and temperature dust free and occupied very little volume when dry hence it was capable of trapping cesium ions 3 3 5 sorption kinetics cesium ion sorption kinetics were determined at three temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c using dry sorbent at 22 c with pre swollen sorbent in demineralized water a pseudo first order adsorption model and pseudo second order adsorption model were employed to describe the obtained experimental data the obtained pseudo first and pseudo second kinetic curves are shown in fig 8 and the model parameters are presented in table 4 the sorption kinetics of the pre swollen sorbent were determined at 22 c and denoted as generally higher values of maximum sorption capacities were derived from the pseudo second order equation the highest qmax value 134 2 1 5 mg g was achieved at the lowest temperature on the dry sorbent and lowest 123 9 1 1 mg g at 22 c on the pre swollen sorbent the observed dependence of the sorption rate increased with increasing temperature which indicated that the endothermic nature of cesium ion sorption on the cuhcf p sorbent the most important time period was the first 6 h of the experiment because during this time most cesium ions were trapped on the sorbent the removal efficiency after this time reached 62 70 and 74 at 12 c 22 c and 32 c respectively and 75 at 22 c on pre swollen sorbent equilibrium was reached after 12 18 h of sorption under all conditions removal efficiency 86 89 89 and 89 at 12 c 22 c 32 c and at 22 c on pre swollen sorbent respectively in the initial period sorption occurred fastest on the initially swollen sorbents on dry sorbents the sorption rate increased with increasing temperature this relationship was confirmed by the calculated sorption rates k1 and k2 from the pseudo first and pseudo second order thermodynamics equations the results are summarized in table 4 the highest rate was observed when pre swollen sorbents were employed and for the pseudo second order model was almost twice as high as on dry sorbent at the same temperature based on the linearized form of the pseudo first order adsorption kinetics model eq 12 the initial adsorption rate h which was the adsorption rate when qt t approaches zero was determined the initial adsorption rate was calculated using eq 13 68 the calculated values of the initial adsorption rate are summarized in table 4 similarly to the rate constants k2 the initial adsorption rates increased with increasing temperature the highest value of initial sorption rate was obtained when using the pre swollen sorbent due to ease of access to the active substance on which cesium ions were retained the dry sorbent needed time to swell and allow the cesium ions to the penetrate pectin bead and reached the active sites 12 t qt 1 k2qm 2 t qm 13 h k2qm 2 where qm the cesium ions adsorbed on 1 g of material at equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qt the cesium ions adsorbed on 1

adsorption was examined k2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model was plotted as lnk2 versus 1 t fig 9 with 0 9656 correlation coefficient the activation energy ea was calculated as the slope of the fitted curve multiplied by r and equaled 22 73 kj mol the values of the calculated activation energy were used to determine the sorption s nature it was considered that activation energy lower than 4 2 kj mol was indicative of the physical nature of sorption because physical sorption was usually fast and reversible and therefore did not require much energy however chemical sorption requires more energy owing to it is specific and stronger forces the chemical nature of the sorption was indicated by ea values between 8 4 and 83 7 kj mol 69 72 thus on the basis of the activation energy obtained in our study it was determined that sorption required more energy and was more chemical in nature than physical 3 3 6 dynamic studies the studies of the dynamic system were carried out in glass columns filled with an appropriate amount of hybrid cuhcf p sorbent 1 5 2 and 3 g the sorbent was pre swelled by soaking for at least 2 h in demineralized water before being placed in the column the shape of the sorbent was perfect for flow systems without the risk of clogging or excessively high pressure drop the purified solution was fed to the column with a peristaltic pump which created a practically automated purification process the fed solution was introduced into the column at a flow rate of 30 ml h 25 ml samples were collected until the cesium ion concentration ratio c c0 reached 0 02 the breakthrough point in the effluent three sorbent masses of 1 5 g 2 g and 3 g were used which corresponded to bed heights of 2 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 10 the thick horizontal line on the graph represents the breakthrough point when c c0 reached 0 02 the breakthrough point changed with increasing sorbent amounts and 475 1000 and 1500 ml of purified solution were obtained for bed heights of 2 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively it is known that the more sorbent present the greater the number of active sites on the sorbent and the more effective the purification process however it was observed that by increasing the sorbent mass from 1 5 g to 3 g two fold the three fold increase of purified solution volume was obtained 1500 ml according to the results the relationship between the mass of the sorbent bed height and the amount of purified solution was not proportional to evaluate the relationship between bed height and service time the bed depth service time bdst model was applied 73 74 hence some supporting parameters of cesium ions sorption process on fixed bed column were determined eqs 9 11 the breakthrough times t for each bed height z were calculated by dividing the volume of purified solution at c c0 0 02 by the flow rate 30 ml h and equaled 15 8 h 33 3 h and 50 h respectively the linear flow rate was 17 cm h and concentration ct was equal to the concentration of cesium ions at the breakthrough point cb ct cb 2 6 mg l the linear relationship of t to z eq 9 with 0 983 correlation coefficient was determined n0 37164 mg l was determined from the slope eq 10 of the curve and ka 0 0015 l mg h was determined from the intercept eq 11 furthermore the minimum depth of the bed z0 which was required for the cesium ion concentration to be below 2 6 mg l in the effluent at time t 0 was determined as 1 2 cm the obtained results revealed that the hybrid cuhcf p sorbents proposed for cesium ion removal were also highly effective in the dynamic process in addition the process was easy to automate the sorbent s form allowed easy introduction into the column and enabled proper flow of the purified solution undoubtedly the proposed sorbents show high application potential the suitability of the sorbent from its production to its disposal together with the radioactive material is depicted in scheme 1 importantly the proposed sorbent was synthesized from cheap and readily available substrates and the synthetic method was easy and could be mostly automated as a radioactive substance cesium cannot be disposed of by any means other than the greatest possible concentration and safe storage our sorbent enabled safe long term storage in an air dry dust free state without changing the structure or form of the sorbent grains with a diameter of approx 1 5 mm and moisture content of approx 10 and had the smallest amount possible of material due to high sorption capacity 4 conclusions in this work a highly efficient sorbent for cesium ion removal was proposed the advantages of the proposed sorbent are as follows the preparation method was simple and the obtained sorbent was homogeneous durable and rich in active substance 50 cuhcf it was obtained from readily available and inexpensive raw materials it was in the shape of beads small in size 2 4 mm diameter wet form which allowed easy separation of the used sorbent after the experiment cuhcf p sorbent exhibited a very high sorption capacity 143 6 3 2 mg g determined from the langmuir isotherm compared to other sorbents cuhcf p sorbent was stable and highly efficient over a wide ph range 4 10 and at various temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c the cesium ions sorption kinetic was satisfactory and sorption equilibrium was reached after approx 12 h the proposed sorbent was applied in a dynamic system and on the small amount of sorbent 3 g 1500 ml of cesium solution with an initial concentration of 130 mg l was purified to less than 2 6 mg l the sorbent was sufficiently effective for cesium ions removal from solutions containing na k and ca2 ions of concentrations up to 0 1 m as well as from sow cuhcf p sorbent was dust free and occupied a small volume after drying hence it is a promising material for the treatment of wastewater containing radioactive cesium ions which may be disposed only by

image 1 keywords cesium 137 adsorption batch studies column studies polysaccharide bio based adsorbent 1 introduction water pollution is a major problem in modern society and is mainly caused by human activity that originates from households industry agriculture mines and sometimes infiltration discharged wastewater may contain particularly hazardous substances such as organic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides inorganic compounds heavy metals nitrates organometallic compounds methylmercury tributyltin radioactive elements radon radium uranium cesium strontium and various types of biological materials microorganisms 1 6 in recent years special attention has also been paid to so called contaminants of emerging concerns cecs which include various pharmaceuticals hormones personal care products surfactants pesticides flame retardants heavy metals nanomaterials and microplastics 5 7 8 additionally the high risk factor associated with wastewater containing radioactive elements has encourage more focus on the area radioactive liquid effluent originates from the direct operation of nuclear power plants industrial plants and medical applications furthermore associated wastewaters can stem from for example the processing of spent nuclear fuel and seawater contaminated with radioactive elements as well as laundries washes for floors or other surfaces contaminated with radioactive elements 9 14 among particularly hazardous radionuclides cesium 137 is of particular interest because it has a very long half life 30 years radioactive cesium can be released into the environment for example as a result of a nuclear power plant accident recently the biggest accident was at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant npp in japan which released significant amounts of fission products that contain among others radioisotopes of cesium 15 radioactive cesium can also come from the production and testing of nuclear weapons or production and use of radioisotopes in medicine and industry 16 17 it is also a component of spent nuclear fuel cesium 137 is highly soluble and therefore poses a serious threat to the environment and humans radioactive cesium can easily be incorporated into living organism tissues and cause damage to cells and dna making it very carcinogenic 15 16 18 hence work with radioactive materials their protection and radioactive waste management are strictly regulated by international regulations and periodically controlled depending on the type of waste generated solid gaseous liquid appropriate methods are selected for its disposal or protection however since radionuclide activity can only be reduced by their decay the main purpose of treating and disposal of all types of radioactive waste is their proper segregation volume reduction solidification and storage in a specific manner that makes them safer for all living organisms 19 20 one of the techniques enabling volume reduction or solidification or rather immobilization of a substance on a solid carrier is adsorption adsorption is a low cost and highly efficient technique as it is easily implemented and easy to operate and requires only small qualities of reagents moreover it is suitable for removing contaminants from solutions over a very wide range of concentrations 1 8 21 the spectrum of adsorption applications is very broad and is basically limited to the selection of a suitable sorbent metal hexacyanoferrates mhcf are the best known adsorbents for cesium ions removal with high selectivity and good sorption capacity mhcfs are coordination polymers consisting of a transition metal cation for example fe3 cu2 ni2 zn2 and hexacyanoferrate anions they have a face centered cubic structure that contain channels with dimensions similar to those of hydrated cesium ions therefore cesium ions can be trapped in these channels by simple physical adsorption 22 23 making mhcfs effective and attractive substances for this purpose unfortunately they are obtained as fine powders which are impossible or very difficult to use in static and flow systems to address this problem new advanced materials have been developed to improve the performance of mhcfs in such materials powders are combined with other substances to obtain sorbents with better operating properties e g sodium cobalt hexacyanoferrate encapsulated alginate beads reinforced with highly dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes 24 sludge functionalized with potassium copper hexacyanoferrate 25 electrospun nanofibers embedded with potassium copper hexacyanoferrate 26 porous hydrogel containing prussian blue nanoparticles 27 prussian blue embedded alginate aerogel 28 magnetic bentonite chitosan hybrid beads 29 and from our previously study using hybrid pectin prussian blue beads 30 additionally the literature describes various advanced materials for the removal of many other organic and inorganic contaminants 6 7 21 31 35 the possibility of creating new highly efficient and highly selective sorbents is of great interest when creating a new hybrid sorbent not only should high sorption capacity be considered but also the whole cost of manufacturing and substrate availability in addition in the case of radioactive materials whose activity may be reduced only by decay of sorbents it should be easily storable and dust free therefore in our work we described a method for the preparation of highly efficient copper hexacyanoferrate embedded pectin sorbents for the removal of radioactive cesium ions the proposed sorbents contained copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf as an active sorption substance and pectin as a matrix for its immobilization pectin is a cheap substrate of natural origin and often obtained as a waste product from vegetable and fruit processing additionally it has the ability to gelate in the presence of divalent cations for example calcium ions therefore it can be used as a matrix to produce sorbents the combination of cuhcf sorption properties and pectin gelling ability promoted the formation of a sorbent with very good sorption capacity and desirable shape as well as storage properties to the best of our knowledge the reported composition of cuhcf p sorbent is new and the proposed method can be mostly automated furthermore the preparation of hybrid sorbents employed cheap and readily available substrates proposed sorbent enabled safe long term storage in an air dry dust free state without changing the structure or form of the sorbent grains with a diameter of approx 1 5 mm and moisture content of approx 10 and was very small in volume for a material of high sorption capacity 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and reagents cucl2 sigma aldrich germany and k4 fe cn 6 3h2o sigma aldrich

hexacyanoferrate khcf to cucl2 was 1 2 3 hence 10 solution of khcf 100 ml was slowly poured into a 10 solution of copper chloride 84 ml and intensively stirred with a mechanical stirrer the resulting brown precipitate was stirred with the stock solution for 1 h this was followed with decanting centrifuging and washing with demineralized water finally the precipitate was dried for 24 h at 45 c and then ground using a batch mill and mortar water dispersible cuhcf was prepared by modifying its surface with khcf according to the method proposed by ishizaki et al 36 briefly the obtained cuhcf was stirred for 3 days in 5 khcf solution 4 ml of khcf 1 g of cuhcf then washed with demineralized water the prepared modified cuhcf cuhcf was used to obtain sorbents 2 4 hybrid sorbent preparation a

concentration of cuhcf and pectin in the final solution was 3 cuhcf suspension in pectin was then slowly dropped by peristaltic pump into continuously stirred cold cacl2 solution 1 m 4 c after 24 h of contact with cacl2 the obtained sorbent cuchf p was filtered washed with demineralized water to remove chloride ions and dried at 45 c 2 5 sorption experiments 2 5 1 general procedure for cesium ions sorption examination in general batch sorption experiments were performed by contacting the dry sorbent with a nonradioactive cesium ion solution dry sorbent dose 1 g l c0 130 mg l ph 6 temp 22 1 c t 48 h the concentration of the cesium ions in the initial and purified solution was measured using icp aes or icp ms apparatus the amount of adsorbed cesium was calculated as the difference between the amount of cesium in the initial solution and that in the final solution after sorption the sorption capacity q or the removal efficiency r were calculated using the formula shown in eqs 1 and 2

general sorption examination procedure the effect of ph in the range of 2 10 on cesium ion sorption was also tested according to the general sorption examination procedure in addition the effect of ph on hybrid sorbent swelling index was examined each sample of hybrid cuhcf p sorbent after sorption was carefully dried with a paper towel and immediately weighed the swelling index was calculated

5 4 sorption kinetics the sorption kinetics were determined over a time interval from 1 min to 48 h at three different temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c according to the general sorption examination the sorption kinetics on pre swelled sorbent in demineralized water was also investigated an appropriate amount of sorbent was contacted with demineralized water for 24 h then filtered and dried with a

water for at least 2 h for swelling before introduction to the column the sorbent slurry in water was introduced into the column to avoid the formation of air bubbles the cesium solution was fed into the column using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 30 ml h 25 ml samples were collected until c c0 ratio of 0 02 was reached in the effluent cesium concentration was examined by icp ms a bdst model

as a brown powder fig 1 a which formed agglomerates in water and pectin fig 1b the agglomerates were not desirable as they caused clogging of the peristaltic pump tubing during the preparation of sorbents and made the final materials less homogeneous surface modification of cuhcf was achieved by contacting for 3 days with khcf solution which yielded a homogeneous aqueous dispersion solution of cuhcf the modification caused an amazing change in the surface charge on cuhcf particles where after contact with water and pectin the particles electrostatically repulsed each other to form a homogeneous dispersion fig 1c furthermore sem micrographs of cuhcf powder cuhcf suspension in pectin and suspension of modified cuhcf in pectin are shown in fig 1d e and f the micrographs showed that modified cuhcf was efficiently dispersed compared to unmodified cuhcf fig 1f and d shows numerous fine bright spots of modified cuhcf and nonuniformly distributed clumped cuhcf agglomerates respectively 3 2 hybrid sorbent characteristics the resulting sorbents ranged in size from 2 to 4 mm fig 2 a and 1 2 mm after drying fig 2b the majority of sorbent beads were spherical in shape but some were slightly oblong after drying the difference in the bead s shape was almost unnoticeable the uniform distribution of cuhcf particles was confirmed by sem fig 2c the depicted micrograph showed bright cuhcf spots examples circled in red uniformly distributed in the calcium ion cross linked pectin matrix sem micrograph of only pectin sorbent beads was provided for comparison fig 2 d thermogravimetric analysis was performed under an inert ar atmosphere in a temperature range of 20 1000 c fig 3 a all samples were dried at 80 c before analysis the data revealed that the obtained sorbents cuhcf p cuhcf powder and pectin sorbents were stable up to 150 190 c and only free and interstitial water loss was observed up to this temperature in the case of cuhcf a weight loss was observed up to 125 c whereas for sorbents the weight loss associated with water loss occurred up to approx 190 c weight loss was 2 5 and 3 for cuhcf p and p only pectin sorbent respectively between 125 and 350 c for cuhcf exothermic decomposition of the cyanide groups occurred which formed intermediates and released carbon monoxide nitrogen and ammonia 42 above 200 c the pectin matrix decomposed the mass loss was about 27 for cuhcf and 55 for hybrid sorbent cuhcf p at approx 750 c and 600 c for cuhcf and hybrid sorbent respectively the final stage of cuhcf decomposition was observed the final residual mass was approx 45 38 and 20 for cuhcf cuhcf p and pectin only sorbent pectin respectively the crystalline structure of cuhcf cuhcf p sorbent and pectin only sorbent were compared by xrd analysis fig 3b cuhcf powder red line showed five distinct and intense peaks 18 25 36 40 and 44 2theta which indicated the crystalline nature of cuhcf powder these peaks corresponded to the peaks of cu2 fe cn 6 from the database and they identifies obtained powder pectin only sorbent was amorphous in nature black line because no diffraction peaks were registered the diffractogram of the hybrid sorbent cuhcf p blue line showed less intense peaks than the diffractogram of cuhcf powder and they were slightly shifted to higher 2theta values however the packing of the hybrid sorbent with cuhcf powder was confirmed the composition of the obtained cuhcf p composite sorbents was confirmed by ft ir spectroscopy the spectra of cuhcf precipitate hybrid cuhcf p sorbent and only pectin sorbent are summarized in fig 3c the spectra of all the studied materials at 3600 3000 cm 1 showed characteristic broad absorption bands related to symmetric and asymmetric stretching of oh groups from water the peaks at approx 1600 cm 1 were related to the coordination water from cuhcf but also bands from co and c oh groups of pectin were observed characteristic bands of carbohydrates were observed for cuhcf p and only pectin sorbents at 1200 950 cm 1 43 the spectrum of cuhcf precipitate showed a characteristic peak at 2080 cm 1 corresponding to cn group 44 45 this peak was also present in the spectrum of hybrid sorbent cuhcf p which confirmed the immobilization of cuhcf precipitate in the pectin matrix 3 3 sorption experiments 3 3 1 the effect of sorbent dose on sorption capacity and removal efficiency the effect of sorbent dose on the sorption capacity q and efficiency of cesium ion removal r is shown in fig 4 the cesium ions removal ratio increased with increasing sorbent dose reaching 99 8 at the highest sorbent dose studied 6 g l however very high cesium ion removal efficiency above 90 was achieved from sorbent dose of 1 5 g l the sorption capacity was expressed as milligrams of cesium ions per 1 g of sorbent which decreased with increasing sorbent dose and degree of cesium ions removal the highest value of sorption capacity of 147 9 mg g was obtained at 0 2 g l dose whereas the lowest was 6 g l dose 21 1 mg g for further studies a sorbent dose of 1 g l was selected which had high sorption capacity and approx 20 of the initial amount of cesium ions remained in solution after sorption the removal rate of cesium ions at a dose of 1 g l was 75 6 3 3 2 the effect of ph on cesium ions sorption capacity the effect of ph on sorption capacity of the obtained sorbent was also investigated and the results are shown in fig 5 a it was found that the studied sorbent showed very good sorption capacities at ph range of 4 10 slightly lower sorption capacities were obtained for solutions with lower ph 2 and 3 it is worth noting that even under these conditions the proposed sorbent was very effective the reduced capacity of the sorption properties at low ph stemmed from the inhibition of cesium ions sorption in the presence of a large amount of h ions which could compete with cesium ions for active sites additionally in ph range of 2 8 the swelling index of the sorbents did not change significantly fig 5b thus the sorbents exhibited enhanced stability and ability to carry out sorption processes in solutions of various ph hence in the case of real wastewater there would be no need for wastewater ph corrections 3 3 3 effect of interfering cations the effect of na k ca2 and mg2 interference at concentrations of 0 01 m 0 1 m and 0 3 m and sow on the removal efficiency r of cesium ions from solution was investigated it was observed that with increasing concentration of interfering cations the removal efficiency of cesium ions decreased but still was considered high fig 6 for example for k the removal rates were 87 80 and 75 at concentrations of 0 01 m 0 1 m and 0 3 m respectively this relationship was obvious in the partition coefficient kd values table 1 which for example for k ions changed with increasing concentration 6641 4049 and 3029 ml g the presence of interfering ions at 0 01 m concentration had the least effect on the sorption of cesium ions and a slight decrease in the removal rate of cesium ions was observed compared to the solution without these ions at concentrations of 0 1 m and 0 3 m a significant interfering effect on the sorption of cesium ions was observed the presence of mg2 caused a decrease in the removal efficiency of cesium ions below 50 the lowest kd value at the highest concentration of interfering ions a decrease in cesium sorption occurred in the order of mg2 ca2 na k this order followed the same decreasing trend in the hydrated radii of the cations mg2 0 428 nm ca2 0 412 nm na 0 358 nm k 0 331 nm this relationship is commonly used to explain the effect of interfering ions on sorption 46 47 divalent cations are also known to be more easily sorbed than monovalent ones due to their stronger positive charge 29 48 thus the effect of the studied ions on cesium ion sorption of hybrid cuhcf p sorbents was explained in this way in addition it is known that in the environment and especially in seawater the concentrations of mg2 ca2 and k ions are lower than previously tested and therefore the observed decrease in the sorption efficiency of cesium ions in their presence may be considered negligible furthermore it was important to investigate the effect of seawater on the sorption of cesium ions on the tested sorbents in our study we used sow prepared according to the astm d 1141 98 standard 37 under these conditions the cesium ions sorption efficiency was reduced to approx 70 q 104 6 3 5 mg g in sow and kd equaled 2396 ml g however considering the abundant composition of sow the deterioration of sorption properties was negligible and the sorbents were successfully used for cesium ions removal from e g seawater 3 3 4 sorption isotherms the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations were used to characterize the equilibrium sorption of cesium ions on hybrid sorbents these isotherms described the relationship between the sorption capacity of a sorbent and concentration of cesium ions in equilibrium fig 7 the calculated parameters of the langmuir and freundlich isotherms are presented in table 2 a better correlation coefficient was obtained for the langmuir isotherm r2 0 979 compared to the freundlich isotherm r2 0 927 thus experimental results of cesium ions sorption on the studied sorbents provided more compatible the langmuir isotherm model the langmuir isotherm assumes that there is a fixed number of active sites with the same energy on the sorbent where each active site is occupied by one adsorbate molecule and no interaction occurs between the adsorbed molecules on the nearest active sites 49 in contrast the freundlich isotherm assumes the existence of heterogeneous active sites with non uniformly distributed energy 49 therefore since the difference in the correlation coefficients obtained for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms was considered minor it was not concisely determined that the sorption of cesium ions on cuhcf p hybrid sorbent occurred in the monolayer and that all active sites on the sorbent had the same energy hence we examined a hybrid sorbent consisting of two different substances that can trap cesium ions in a completely different way mhcfs exhibit high affinity for cesium ions because of the presence of regular spaces in their structure with dimensions close to those of the hydrated cesium ion that trap cesium ions the mechanism of sorption of cesium ions on fehcf by chemical adsorption through hydrophilic lattice defect sites with proton elimination from coordination water was previously proposed 50 as well as ion exchange between k and cs on cuhcf was also suggested 51 reports have shown that the mechanism of cesium ion adsorption on mhcf is not yet fully understood and is rather controversial 52 53 in addition some cesium ions may be trapped in the swollen pectin matrix on our hybrid sorbent therefore the sorbent should display heterogeneous active sites with different energies additionally the sorption capacity of hybrid cuhcf p sorbent with that of cuhcf powder alone was compared the sorption capacity of the powder was 190 7 mg g at a dose rate of 0 5 g l which corresponded to the hybrid sorbent with a cuhcf p ratio of 1 1 and a dose rate of 1 g l if cuhcf was solely responsible for the sorption capacity of the hybrid sorbent then 95 4 mg of cesium ions should be trapped on 1 g of cuhcf p 1 g of sorbent contained 0 5 g cuhcf and not 143 mg that was determined by the maximum sorption capacity previous reports have proven that the cesium ions sorption capacity of pectin only sorbent beads is rather poor 54 therefore some synergistic effect occurs which stems from a higher total sorption capacity and not as indicated by the content of the active substance in the hybrid sorbent although the presented models could not explain the nature of the sorption they were used to determine various parameters e g maximum sorption capacity from which the properties of the different sorbents were compared the maximum sorption capacity of cuhcf p sorbent calculated from the langmuir equation was 143 6 3 2 mg g table 3 compares the sorption capacities of different sorbents for cesium ions removal and sorption capacity of sole cuhcf powder the materials with higher e g molybdophosphate magnetic fe3o4 chitosan composites securely anchored prussian blue nanocrystals on the surface of porous paam sphere and lower sorption capacities others in the table than hybrid cuhcf p sorbent were obtained furthermore the sorption capacity of the copper ferrocyanide powder was lower than that of the studied cuhcf powder and cuhcf p sorbent also other sorbents containing copper ii hexacyanoferrate e g copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticle decorated biochar produced from pomelo peel copper hexacyanoferrate pan composite electrospun nanofibers embedded with potassium copper hexacyanoferrate copper hexacyanoferrate polymer composite beads or potassium copper hexacyanoferrate embedded magnetic hydrogel beads exhibited worse sorption properties when selecting a sorbent for a specific application in addition to its maximum sorption capacity other properties such as shape ability to be separated from the treated solution and ability to be used in a continuous system must also be considered when radioactive substances are disposed it is also important that the sorbent material is dust free and occupies the smallest possible volume this is due to the only way to dispose of radioactive substances is through decay for this purpose they are usually stored in a solidified form in specially protected and dedicated facilities cuhcf p had a high sorption capacity and was easily separated from the treated solution applicable for flow systems stable over a wide range of ph and temperature dust free and occupied very little volume when dry hence it was capable of trapping cesium ions 3 3 5 sorption kinetics cesium ion sorption kinetics were determined at three temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c using dry sorbent at 22 c with pre swollen sorbent in demineralized water a pseudo first order adsorption model and pseudo second order adsorption model were employed to describe the obtained experimental data the obtained pseudo first and pseudo second kinetic curves are shown in fig 8 and the model parameters are presented in table 4 the sorption kinetics of the pre swollen sorbent were determined at 22 c and denoted as generally higher values of maximum sorption capacities were derived from the pseudo second order equation the highest qmax value 134 2 1 5 mg g was achieved at the lowest temperature on the dry sorbent and lowest 123 9 1 1 mg g at 22 c on the pre swollen sorbent the observed dependence of the sorption rate increased with increasing temperature which indicated that the endothermic nature of cesium ion sorption on the cuhcf p sorbent the most important time period was the first 6 h of the experiment because during this time most cesium ions were trapped on the sorbent the removal efficiency after this time reached 62 70 and 74 at 12 c 22 c and 32 c respectively and 75 at 22 c on pre swollen sorbent equilibrium was reached after 12 18 h of sorption under all conditions removal efficiency 86 89 89 and 89 at 12 c 22 c 32 c and at 22 c on pre swollen sorbent respectively in the initial period sorption occurred fastest on the initially swollen sorbents on dry sorbents the sorption rate increased with increasing temperature this relationship was confirmed by the calculated sorption rates k1 and k2 from the pseudo first and pseudo second order thermodynamics equations the results are summarized in table 4 the highest rate was observed when pre swollen sorbents were employed and for the pseudo second order model was almost twice as high as on dry sorbent at the same temperature based on the linearized form of the pseudo first order adsorption kinetics model eq 12 the initial adsorption rate h which was the adsorption rate when qt t approaches zero was determined the initial adsorption rate was calculated using eq 13 68 the calculated values of the initial adsorption rate are summarized in table 4 similarly to the rate constants k2 the initial adsorption rates increased with increasing temperature the highest value of initial sorption rate was obtained when using the pre swollen sorbent due to ease of access to the active substance on which cesium ions were retained the dry sorbent needed time to swell and allow the cesium ions to the penetrate

adsorption was examined k2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model was plotted as lnk2 versus 1 t fig 9 with 0 9656 correlation coefficient the activation energy ea was calculated as the slope of the fitted curve multiplied by r and equaled 22 73 kj mol the values of the calculated activation energy were used to determine the sorption s nature it was considered that activation energy lower than 4 2 kj mol was indicative of the physical nature of sorption because physical sorption was usually fast and reversible and therefore did not require much energy however chemical sorption requires more energy owing to it is specific and stronger forces the chemical nature of the sorption was indicated by ea values between 8 4 and 83 7 kj mol 69 72 thus on the basis of the activation energy obtained in our study it was determined that sorption required more energy and was more chemical in nature than physical 3 3 6 dynamic studies the studies of the dynamic system were carried out in glass columns filled with an appropriate amount of hybrid cuhcf p sorbent 1 5 2 and 3 g the sorbent was pre swelled by soaking for at least 2 h in demineralized water before being placed in the column the shape of the sorbent was perfect for flow systems without the risk of clogging or excessively high pressure drop the purified solution was fed to the column with a peristaltic pump which created a practically automated purification process the fed solution was introduced into the column at a flow rate of 30 ml h 25 ml samples were collected until the cesium ion concentration ratio c c0 reached 0 02 the breakthrough point in the effluent three sorbent masses of 1 5 g 2 g and 3 g were used which corresponded to bed heights of 2 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 10 the thick horizontal line on the graph represents the breakthrough point when c c0 reached 0 02 the breakthrough point changed with increasing sorbent amounts and 475 1000 and 1500 ml of purified solution were obtained for bed heights of 2 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively it is known that the more sorbent present the greater the number of active sites on the sorbent and the more effective the purification process however it was observed that by increasing the sorbent mass from 1 5 g to 3 g two fold the three fold increase of purified solution volume was obtained 1500 ml according to the results the relationship between the mass of the sorbent bed height and the amount of purified solution was not proportional to evaluate the relationship between bed height and service time the bed depth service time bdst model was applied 73 74 hence some supporting parameters of cesium ions sorption process on fixed bed column were determined eqs 9 11 the breakthrough times t for each bed height z were calculated by dividing the volume of purified solution at c c0 0 02 by the flow rate 30 ml h and equaled 15 8 h 33 3 h and 50 h respectively the linear flow rate was 17 cm h and concentration ct was equal to the concentration of cesium ions at the breakthrough point cb ct cb 2 6 mg l the linear relationship of t to z eq 9 with 0 983 correlation coefficient was determined n0 37164 mg l was determined from the slope eq 10 of the curve and ka 0 0015 l mg h was determined from the intercept eq 11 furthermore the minimum depth of the bed z0 which was required for the cesium ion concentration to be below 2 6 mg l in the effluent at time t 0 was determined as 1 2 cm the obtained results revealed that the hybrid cuhcf p sorbents proposed for cesium ion removal were also highly effective in the dynamic process in addition the process was easy to automate the sorbent s form allowed easy introduction into the column and enabled proper flow of the purified solution undoubtedly the proposed sorbents show high application potential the suitability of the sorbent from its production to its disposal together with the radioactive material is depicted in scheme 1 importantly the proposed sorbent was synthesized from cheap and readily available substrates and the synthetic method was easy and could be mostly automated as a radioactive substance cesium cannot be disposed of by any means other than the greatest possible concentration and safe storage our sorbent enabled safe long term storage in an air dry dust free state without changing the structure or form of the sorbent grains with a diameter of approx 1 5 mm and moisture content of approx 10 and had the smallest amount possible of material due to high sorption capacity 4 conclusions in this work a highly efficient sorbent for cesium ion removal was proposed the advantages of the proposed sorbent are as follows the preparation method was simple and the obtained sorbent was homogeneous durable and rich in active substance 50 cuhcf it was obtained from readily available and inexpensive raw materials it was in the shape of beads small in size 2 4 mm diameter wet form which allowed easy separation of the used sorbent after the experiment cuhcf p sorbent exhibited a very high sorption capacity 143 6 3 2 mg g determined from the langmuir isotherm compared to other sorbents cuhcf p sorbent was stable and highly efficient over a wide ph range 4 10 and at various temperatures 12 c 22 c and 32 c the cesium ions sorption kinetic was satisfactory and sorption equilibrium was reached after approx 12 h the proposed sorbent was applied in a dynamic system and on the small amount of sorbent 3 g 1500 ml of cesium solution with an initial concentration of 130 mg l was purified to less than 2 6 mg l the sorbent was sufficiently effective for cesium ions removal from solutions containing na k and ca2 ions of concentrations up to 0 1 m as well as from sow cuhcf p sorbent was dust free and occupied a small volume after drying hence it is a promising material for the treatment of wastewater containing radioactive cesium ions which may be disposed only by

corresponding author municipal reclaimed water is increasingly being considered as a sustainable source of makeup water for cooling towers however many oil and gas facilities in the water scarce

critical understanding of several factors including water efficiency biohazards equipment reliability and economics in particular biohazard assessment due to bacteria and virus contamination in hot

operating in severely water scarce middle east region is constantly looking for alternatives for groundwater water related risk for an industry can be physical regulatory or reputational 1 physical risk occurs when regional water supplies are not always available at the quantities or qualities needed to adequately support the myriad of community water dependent needs water availability for industrial use is impacted by many factors including location of existing freshwater resources water management practices competing interests for water supplies development related pollution and climate change water reuse and recycling investments is a sustainable solution for regional water scarcity concerns and or wastewater discharge limitations 2 effective water reuse applications can deliver environmental economic and social benefits to the area it operates 3 in addition water reuse plays an important role in shifting from linear to circular business models and to make water smart circular economy the use of alternative water supplies and water reuse initiatives are increasingly being considered 4 6 treated municipal effluent has already been considered by the power sector to potentially offset water withdrawal and consumption for beneficial uses in many parts of the world 4 7 10 a wide scale application of municipal reclaimed water for industrial application could assist in offsetting groundwater withdrawal in the middle east region open recirculating evaporative cooling towers are the most commonly used cooling technology for commercial air conditioning in open recirculating systems water is withdrawn from the cooling tower s basin to the process equipment that requires cooling and returned back to the top of the cooling tower continuous evaporation of the cooling water results in losses of the water and in increase in total dissolved solid concentration of recirculating water this problem is addressed by continuous water makeup to and blowdown from the basin a conceptual schematic of an evaporative cooling system is presented in fig 1 normal blowdown adds to the evaporation losses another 0 1 1 0 of the recirculation flow and the normal water demand makeup is only 0 9 1 7 of the recirculation flow but can be as high as 5 if the blowdown is not properly controlled drift accounts for a very small portion of uncontrolled losses in the tower most towers are installed with drift eliminators that limit drift to 0 005 of system water volume water evaporation within the evaporative cooling tower accounts for the majority of the heat rejected typically 75 80 of the total heat removed typically cooling towers can consume 20 to 30 of a facility s total water use thus to minimize the dependence on freshwater sources for cooling tower operations the use of alternative water supplies and water reuse initiatives are increasingly being considered by industries 11 16 previous studies reported that municipal reclaimed water as cooling system make up water may pose challenges with respect to enhanced biofouling corrosion and scaling 7 the water quality also determines the cycle of concentration also known as concentration ratio of the operation indicating how efficiently water is recirculated before being lost to blowdown an increase in the cycle of concentration coc reduces water consumption by reducing makeup water volume and wastewater generation blowdown however wide scale application of reclaimed water in the oil and gas industry particularly in the middle eastern region is limited thus a critical understanding of the water quality and operational performance of a cooling system using reclaimed water as makeup water through long term pilot testing in a hot and humid middle eastern region is a contemporary research need one of the challenges of using municipal reclaimed water is biohazards concern in hot environment when water temperatures are in the range of 20 50 c 68 122 f cooling towers have the potential for microbiological growth potential proliferation of bacterial and virus must be controlled for successful implementation the concentration of bacteria and viruses in raw wastewater covers a wide range 17 while primary and secondary treatment processes can reduce virus concentrations they are not specifically designed for this purpose and therefore tertiary treatments such as filtration are often integrated to provide a multiple barrier approach cooling towers have been implicated in many outbreaks of legionnaire s disease worldwide 18 19 bacteria can multiply under favorable nutrient rich condition and cause pneumonia particularly in immune compromised individuals through ingestion of contaminated water or inhalation of contaminated aerosols with dispersion extended over a distance of at least 6 km 23 human exposure through bio aerosols relate primarily to drift from the integral drift eliminators windage directly from the cooling tower basin and fugitive exposures arising from any structural leakage 20 the risk to populations from aerosols infected with viruses arising from a cooling tower system is primarily theoretical not readily borne out by published research on outbreaks viruses does not replicate outside of the host and their environmental fate will be dependent on a range of environmental factors including temperature humidity and sunlight however it is recognized that enteric viruses including rotavirus and adenovirus can present a risk to human health in certain situations such as irrigation of landscapes in un restricted areas and research has shown that use of a primary biocide such as sodium hypochlorite which is the most popular disinfection method may not in itself be able to effectively remove viruses from treated effluent thus understanding of the bacteria and virus in the municipal reclaimed water application and effective disinfection system is critical to protect the public health to date little to no studies have been documented to provide a critical understanding of the effectiveness water treatment for controlling biohazards of utilizing reclaimed water in dry dessert environment with high temperature the novelty of this paper included i this research represents first of its kind in the middle eastern region which has established a platform for viral detection in reclaimed water samples by the latest and advanced molecular diagnostic method ii demonstrates that reclaim water without any expensive advanced water treatment e g demineralization reverse osmosis can replace freshwater groundwater consumption for cooling make up water in the dry dessert environment regions where groundwater is a nonrenewable water supply and iii provides a conceptual decision matrix on the application of reclaimed water for cooling systems the objective of the paper is to present the application of municipal reclaimed water as make up water for cooling system based on water efficiency biohazard equipment reliability and economics 2 materials and methodology 2 1 wastewater treatment plant description the municipal reclaimed water was generated from an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant with a capacity to treat an average daily flow of 13 400 m3 day at an oil and gas facility in saudi arabia a conceptual diagram of the plant is presented in fig 2 the headworks provides preliminary treatment using bar racks to remove debris rags rock material wooden material and grit chamber that allows settlement of heavier material preliminary treated ww from headworks flows to splitter boxes where it is equally split for the aeration tanks secondary wastewater treatment is achieved in the aeration tanks surface aerators in aeration tank are operated to maintain the required level of dissolved oxygen 2 0 mg l for microbiological degradation of organic matter the do level is monitored every day and surface aerator speed is adjusted manually as required daily samples are collected to validate the aeration tank process performance for dissolved oxygen ph temperature clarifier effluent water from the activated sludge process is continuously injected with a coagulant alum to enhance the sand filtration process chlorine is added to clarifier effluent line to prevent microbiological growth on the sand filter media a static mixer installed in the clarifier effluent line for mixing the alum or chlorine solution with the clarifier effluent sand filter building consists of 6 continuous backwash filter cells each with 4 filter modules total filtration surface area is 111 sq meters sand filter effluent flows into a wet well where chlorine is added and the filtered water is discharged to the effluent storage tanks the tertiary treated sewage effluent was analyzed by third party laboratory weekly analyses were conducted for bod cod tss total coliform intestinal eggs ph turbidity and temperature the monthly average concentrations of the grab samples are presented in table 1 2 2 pilot system description the pilot test was conducted with an open loop system cooling tower of 4 2 mw capacity as shown in fig 3 continuous disinfection of the recirculating water was achieved with 12 5 sodium hypochlorite solution as a primary biocide in addition a proprietary corrosion inhibitor 3dt trasar 250 nalco was injected in the cooling tower cells for managing corrosion control during the operations also a non oxidizing biocide isothiozoline was used for short period of time to control algal growth it was discontinued as the phosphate ingredient increases the nutrient concentration online analyzers were used for monitoring residual chlorine ph and temperature of the recirculating water chlorine residual in the range of 1 5 2 5 mg l and ph in the range of 6 8 7 9 were observed 2 3 chemical water quality analysis reclaimed water feed line fl and circulating line cl water qualities were monitored and analyzed for water quality characteristics on a monthly basis the parameters and corresponding analytical methods are presented in table 2 2 4 bacterial analysis microbiological organisms including legionella sp klebsiella pneumoniae and coliforms were monitored for biohazard assessment with samples collected from the back end of recirculating process to reflect worst case condition all analysis were conducted by an accredited local laboratory named als arabia which maintains an a2la accreditation of analytical testing services which covers chemical and biological analytes under certificate numbers 3258 01 and 3258 03 3258 04 3258 05 3258 09 and 3258 10 the testing laboratory complied with iso iec 17025 the units and level of reporting are presented in table 3 in addition to water analysis dipslide testing and biofilm swab sampling were conducted to evaluate the presence of bacteria 21 swab samples from internal cooling tower surfaces sludges and structures were collected by a third party contractor in two separate occasions 8 swab samples during intermediate shutdown and 13 samples at the end of study shutdown and before deep cleaning in each occasion the samples were collected immediately after plant shut down and before deep cleaning was conducted the locations included the basin trough internal packing and drift eliminators 2 5 virus analysis virus analysis was conducted every two weeks at three locations of the pilot system location a sample was collected from the treated sewage effluent tse discharge line of community irrigation pumps cip located at the sewage treatment plant the cip pressurizes the tse community irrigation network which was tied into for supplying the make up water to the cooling tower prior to cip the wastewater undergoes tertiary treatment by activated sludge extended aeration process as mentioned in the method section location b sample was collected from the flushing tap connected to the tse feed line for the cooling tower make up water the sample collected from this location represents any water quality variations that may occur in the tse while transiting from the sewage treatment plant through community irrigation network during low water demand periods water stagnation microbiological growth and bio film formation in the network pipes location c sample was collected from the sampling line connected at the back end of the pipeline re circulating through the cooling tower process the sample represents the tse water quality from the cycle of concentrations the make water up has gone through and the condenser samples were transported to king faisal specialized hospital research center riyadh in special containers under ice within a maximum 6 h transportation time samples were processed under controlled conditions within 12 h of arrival raw effluent sewage water was designed as a control for overall sample quality and integrity to recover viruses two molecular platforms such as multiplex pcr platform that is a new technology introduced in 2018 and the hybridization assay were used in this study kfshrc is an institute that holds the college american pathology cap accredited laboratory for patient care with existing experience in using the luminex technology for gastroenteritis pathogens detection the lab purchased whole virus stocks from the center for disease control and prevention cdc cap usa for each gastroenteritis virus to be utilized as internal control and for the determination of the limit of detection in addition to the raw sewage effluent the second control was 1 l of sterile water spiked with two different gastroenteritis virus in different concentration to create an internal control to validate the viral recovery results 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical water quality performance control of water quality parameters is required to keep cooling system from scaling corrosion and biofouling problems thus an assessment of chemical quality characteristics is one of the principal criteria to evaluate the suitability of use of municipal reclaimed water as make up water critical water quality parameters were monitored in the feed line fl and circulating line cl of the cooling system and the analysis of the data are presented below 3 2 scaling typical scale forming compounds are calcium carbonate calcium phosphate magnesium silicates and calcium sulfates these scale components adhere to the heat transfer surfaces with higher temperature because their solubilities decrease as the ph and water temperature increases the concentrations of calcium and magnesium in the feedline remained in similar magnitude throughout the study period but increased in the circulating line due to increase in cycle of concentration there was an initial increase followed by a decreasing trend both in calcium ions as shown in fig 4 that is attributed to several trials for optimization of chemicals use concentrations langelier saturation index lsi was calculated for cl as it is a measure of a solution s ability to deposit calcium carbonate the lsi values varied from 0 to 0 5 except one data point in may indicating that the scale forming tendency of municipal reclaimed water was low fig 4 the intel temperature was 75 8 f and the outlet temperature was 80 7 f with a difference across the condenser was 4 9 f the ph in the cl line was 7 8 0 4 3 3 corrosion corrosion is one of the concerns of the use of make up water in cooling systems in evaporative cooling systems carbon steel is used for heat exchanger and piping when the carbon steel is in contact with water localized spots of anodes and cathodes are formed on the surface and initiate corrosion in addition to application of a commercial corrosion inhibitor to minimize corrosion potential metals of concern were monitored during the pilot study to evaluate the extent of corrosion if any the study monitored the concentration of cr cu fe mn ni zn ag and al ions in both fl and cl the geochemical analysis of water samples is shown in table 4 the concentrations of cu mn and ni were below the detection limits of 0 01 mg l in fl and cl the concentration of fe in cl was 0 09 ppm during the study period which is low indicating no significant corrosion low concentration of copper in cl is supported by low average ammonia concentrations of 0 5 ppm however concentration values of zn and al are slightly higher compared to other ions in cl the concentration of zn and al in fl was 0 03 and 0 31 mg l respectively al concentration of 0 3 mg l in fl could be attributed to residual coagulant alum added during secondary wastewater treatment stage al concentration increased to an average of 0 45 mg l in cl due to increase in coc from the above it is evident that no significant corrosion occurred due to use of municipal reclaimed water in cooling system during the pilot study the metallurgy of the cooling system includes carbon steel piping and copper tubing in the condenser the corrosion rate of 5 mpy or less is accepted in the company practice for this type of applications the system did not have any corrosion monitoring program in place however for long term application of tse the cooling systems should undergo a regular scheduled turnaround and inspection t i assessment by corrosion specialists if the corrosion rate is found to be a concern adequate preventive measures should be designed and implemented 3 4 nutrients the nutrients present in municipal reclaimed water include nh3 no3 and po4 ions as microorganisms use organic matter and nutrients for their growth high concentrations of these substances in make up water could promote growth of microorganisms and consequent biofouling potential the organic compounds present in the make up water can also deteriorate the effects of biocide by consuming them or by forming the compounds of low biocidal effects thus the concentrations of these nutrient ions were monitored in the fl and cl fig 5 the concentration of nh3 was 0 05 mg l implying its removal in the wastewater treatment processes the concentrations of no3 and po4 nutrients were high as can be seen in fl higher concentration of nitrates in cl is due to increase in coc phosphate is another nutrient that facilitates microbiological fouling and inorganic scaling high concentration of phosphorous discharged to the environment leads to eutrophication of the receiving bodies the average concentration of total phosphates in fl and cl was 8 0 and 13 1 mg l respectively it should be noted that the wastewater treatment plant was not designed for denitrification and advanced phosphate removal however no biological growth was noticed during the pilot study 3 5 water efficiency of using reclaimed water 3 5 1 cycle of concentration in an open circulating cooling system dissolved salts in the make up water are concentrated in the circulating line since the cooling water is lost through evaporation the term coc compares the level of solids of the recirculating cooling tower to the level of solids of the original raw make up water if the circulating water has three times the solids concentration than that of the makeup water then the cycles are 3 a typical cooling tower is estimated to circulate about 3 l per minute per kw of cooling and loses 1 2 to evaporation blowdown and drift the evaporation rate will vary depending on climate zone and cooling load operating hours a cooling tower discharges certain amount of water to avoid the saturation conditions and is called blowdown that includes any controlled or uncontrolled losses in the cooling tower including drift thus the coc should be controlled in order to maintain the cooling water quality and the concentration of chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors and scale inhibitors at their constant level by adjusting the blowdown water quantity blowdown is controlled by measuring conductivity of the recirculating water and varies with coc higher coc results in less frequent blowdown and less water use a simple way of determining coc is given by the ratio of conductivity in cl to conductivity in fl in this study conductivity and chloride concentration was used to calculate the coc as shown in fig 6 prior to the pilot testing with tse groundwater was used for cooling tower the groundwater characteristics consisted of a tds level of 3040 mg l including scale forming ions such as calcium 233 mg l magnesium 97 mg l sulfate 558 mg l and bicarbonate 226 mg l the coc with groundwater was limited to 2 due to higher concentration of scale forming ions the pilot study results suggested that the coc of the cooling tower operation could be almost doubled from 2 to 3 5 with municipal reclaimed water as make up water as shown in fig 6 higher coc means less blowdown frequency and reduction in water demand the lsi values varied from 0 to 0 5 indicating that the scale forming tendency of municipal reclaimed water is low to moderate 3 6 water savings water savings is a function of initial makeup water volume and the change in the cycle of concentration the data was collected for total makeup water blow down water and the observed coc for the period of pilot operations in order to obtain a water savings estimation it was decided to treat the data in two parts i baseline condition with reclaimed water average of five months of operations from april to august during which there was no optimization of operation and the trials started with conditions similar to the operations with groundwater and ii optimized operation with reclaimed water average of three months of operation from september to november during which the optimal operating condition was maintained the baseline make up water was 5172 m3 month i e average of five months of operation and optimized make up water was calculated at 3797 m3 month i e average of three months of operation therefore the average monthly savings on makeup water as a result of the coc increase was 1375 m3 or 27 it is important to note that the coc can be improved with additional treatment for demineralization and biological treatment of tertiary wastewater that will require capital investment this paper demonstrates that the reclaimed water can replace groundwater use even without making a significant capital investment the study findings indicate that a case by case evaluation based on make up water quality and target coc the fit for purpose water treatment should be developed 3 7 biohazard assessment of using municipal reclaimed water during the course of the pilot representative water samples from the cooling tower were analyzed for bacteria and viruses as discussed below 3 8 bacterial study cooling systems particularly open water systems are known to provide a favorable environment for micro organisms growth and biofilm formation if not controlled such biofilms can cause fouling which can adversely affect equipment performance and promote corrosion during the course of the pilot representative water samples from the cooling tower were analyzed for 32 occasions for legionella sp klebsiella and total coliforms the results are presented in table 5 free residual chlorine was noted as typically operating at 2 0 2 5 mg l and observed as minimum target levels for preventing biofilm growth ph was typically 7 4 7 6 the results showed that all water samples were negative for both legionella and klebsiella total coliform an indicator for the presence of possible pathogens including all aerobic and anaerobic gram negative bacteria was assessed to provide an assessment of general biological contamination which is typically observed in an open structure due to dust vegetation and general environmental contaminants of the 32 samples independently tested by the laboratory 29 of these showed coliform levels below detectable limits indicating optimum water treatment program the three exceptions were in july week 33 750 cfu 100 ml august week 35 210 cfu 100 ml october week 44 1200 cfu 100 ml the results of these three data points were not reflected in table 5 as they were outside of the april to november pilot duration presented in the paper the three exceptions were likely to be due to non optimum biocide dosing legionella like to proliferate in cooling systems that are fouled with deposits and biofilm that can protect the organisms from water treatment and provide nutrients to multiply thus swab samples and dipslide tests were conducted in this study a limited number of the swab samples showed positive counts for coliform bacteria but the absence of legionella and klebsiella sp the presence is related to non oxidizing biocide as its ingredient composition included coagulant which was causing sludge formation and deposition for a short period of time dipslide tests were conducted to measure and observe microbial activity in the cooling systems the tests conducted over 5 weeks towards the end of the pilot showed that the results were less than 2 cfu l indicating optimum treatment conditions in place in addition at the end of pilot study additional swab and sludge residue samples were collected throughout the internal structures of cooling tower immediately after plant shut down and before deep cleaning was conducted the locations included the basin trough internal packing and drift eliminators all samples were negative demonstrating the cleanliness of the system and overall efficacy of the disinfection process 3 9 virus study an assessment of enteric viruses e g norovirus adenovirus astrovirus rotavirus sapovirus etc was also conducted during the course of pilot study enteric virus analysis was conducted bi weekly during the 8 month period the results are presented in table 5 all the raw sewage samples contained enteric viruses none of the samples collected from the cooling tower system operation indicated presence of enteric viruses the results demonstrated that the disinfection and biocide treatment was effective in controlling risks to human health the risk from aerosols infected with viruses arising from a cooling tower system was not observed in this study and was also not readily borne out by published research on outbreaks furthermore viruses will not replicate outside of the host and their environmental fate will be dependent on a range of environmental factors including temperature humidity and sunlight 3 10 equipment performance and reliability of using reclaimed water prior to using reclaimed water the cooling system was operated using groundwater consisted of a tds level of 3040 mg l cooling system s condenser operated with groundwater were visually inspected as shown in fig 7 severe scaling was observed on the condenser surfaces with groundwater water as makeup on the contrary the condenser surface was clean without mineral deposit formation when municipal reclaimed water was used as make up water the visual comparison as presented in fig 7 clearly showed the potential operational benefits of utilizing municipal reclaimed water as makeup water it should also be noted that for ground water application the average monthly pressure differential varied form 35 70 kpa but for reclaimed water application the monthly pressure difference was significantly lower and varied from 6 to 27 psi this data also indicates that there is less potential of scaling formation in the condenser tubes while using reclaimed which will improve the heat transfer efficiency 4 economic benefits application of the municipal reclaimed water for cooling tower operations resulted in significant savings of water energy and operating costs during the pilot study the increase in coc resulted in a 27 reduction in water demand because of successful outcome of the pilot study a decision was made to utilize reclaimed water for five cooling towers of the facility with a total cooling capacity of 21 mw for the five cooling towers the annual expected makeup water savings for the entire facility was 82 500 m3 groundwater the saved makeup water also contributed to avoid energy consumption that was required for pumping and treatment of the groundwater annual expected energy savings from five ac plants was estimated to 247 000 kwh during the pilot study the maintenance cost also dropped significantly when using reclaimed water the annual maintenance costs during with groundwater utilization was 80 900 while after converting to municipal reclaimed water the maintenance cost was 15 300 which was significantly lower similar to the outcomes of this study many other studies demonstrated the tangible benefits of using treated municipal reclaimed water for using as cooling system make up water 18 21 22 the pilot also shows that good make up water quality including acceptable tds and low nutrient levels is critical for cooling systems operation 5 conclusions the outcome of this pilot study indicated that municipal reclaimed water is a viable water source as cooling tower makeup water in the dry hot climate the inorganic scale forming tendency of municipal reclaimed water was lower at optimized cycle of concentration with no significant scale deposition on cooling system surfaces the bio hazard assessment for typical microbiological parameters associated with cooling tower operations showed that the application of a comprehensive water treatment system disinfection and associated robust operating procedures were effective in controlling risks to human health in addition the enteric virus study results demonstrated that the sodium hypochlorite treatment for inactivation of enteric viruses was effective and produced acceptable results in order to develop a successful reclaimed water application program for cooling systems a number of factors need to be evaluated the factors are regulatory responsibilities water quality of the reclaimed water design and operation of the wastewater facilities generating the reclaimed water diurnal and seasonal fluctuation in water quality biological growth control treatment process control and monitoring of chemical feed system economics of using reclaimed water and integrated planning between wastewater treatment plant and cooling tower operations the water treatment program including disinfection should be designed by a qualified specialist who understands the relationship between water chemistry microbiology equipment material and cooling system operations a conceptual decision matrix on the water treatment optimization for the application of reclaimed water in cooling systems is

basin a conceptual schematic of an evaporative cooling system is presented in fig 1 normal blowdown adds to the evaporation losses another 0 1 1 0 of the recirculation flow and the normal water demand makeup is only 0 9 1 7 of the recirculation flow but can be as high as 5 if the blowdown is not properly controlled drift accounts for a very small portion of uncontrolled losses in the tower most towers are installed with drift eliminators that limit drift to 0 005 of system water volume water evaporation within the evaporative cooling tower accounts for the majority of the heat rejected typically 75 80 of the total heat removed typically cooling towers can consume 20 to 30 of a facility s total water use thus to minimize the dependence on freshwater sources for cooling tower operations the use of alternative water supplies and water reuse initiatives are increasingly being considered by industries 11 16 previous studies reported that municipal reclaimed water as cooling system make up water may pose challenges with respect to enhanced biofouling corrosion and scaling 7 the water quality also determines the cycle of concentration also known as concentration ratio of the operation indicating how efficiently water is recirculated before being lost to blowdown an increase in the cycle of concentration coc reduces water consumption by reducing makeup water volume and wastewater generation blowdown however wide scale application of reclaimed water in the oil and gas industry particularly in the middle eastern region is limited thus a critical understanding of the water quality and operational performance of a cooling system using reclaimed water as makeup water through long term pilot testing in a hot and humid middle eastern region is a contemporary research need one of the challenges of using municipal reclaimed water is biohazards concern in hot environment when water temperatures are in the range of 20 50 c 68 122 f cooling towers have the potential for microbiological growth potential proliferation of bacterial and virus must be controlled for successful implementation the concentration of bacteria and viruses in raw wastewater covers a wide range 17 while primary and secondary treatment processes can reduce virus concentrations they are not specifically designed for this purpose and therefore tertiary treatments such as filtration are often integrated to provide a multiple barrier approach cooling towers have been implicated in many outbreaks of legionnaire s disease worldwide 18 19 bacteria can multiply under favorable nutrient rich condition and cause pneumonia particularly in immune compromised individuals through ingestion of contaminated water or inhalation of contaminated aerosols with dispersion extended over a distance of at least 6 km 23 human exposure through bio aerosols relate primarily to drift from the integral drift eliminators windage directly from the cooling tower basin and fugitive exposures arising from any structural leakage 20 the risk to populations from aerosols infected with viruses arising from a cooling tower system is primarily theoretical not readily borne out by published research on outbreaks viruses does not replicate outside of the host and their environmental fate will be dependent on a range of environmental factors including temperature humidity and sunlight however it is recognized that enteric viruses including rotavirus and adenovirus can present a risk to human health in certain situations such as irrigation of landscapes in un restricted areas and research has shown that use of a primary biocide such as sodium hypochlorite which is the most popular disinfection method may not in itself be able to effectively remove viruses from treated effluent thus understanding of the bacteria and virus in the municipal reclaimed water application and effective disinfection system is critical to protect the public health to date little to no studies have been documented to provide a critical understanding of the effectiveness water treatment for controlling biohazards of utilizing reclaimed water in dry dessert environment with high temperature the novelty of this paper included i this research represents first of its kind in the middle eastern region which has established a platform for viral detection in reclaimed water samples by the latest and advanced molecular diagnostic method ii demonstrates that reclaim water without any expensive advanced water treatment e g demineralization reverse osmosis can replace freshwater groundwater consumption for cooling make up water in the dry dessert environment regions where groundwater is a nonrenewable water supply and iii provides a conceptual decision matrix on the application of reclaimed water for cooling systems the objective of the paper is to present the application of municipal reclaimed water as make up water for cooling system based on water efficiency biohazard equipment reliability and economics 2 materials and methodology 2 1 wastewater treatment plant description the municipal reclaimed water was generated from an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant with a capacity to treat an average daily flow of 13 400 m3 day at an oil and gas facility in saudi arabia a conceptual diagram of the plant is presented in fig 2 the headworks provides preliminary treatment using bar racks to remove debris rags rock material wooden material and grit chamber that allows settlement of heavier material preliminary treated ww from headworks flows to splitter boxes where it is equally split for the aeration tanks secondary wastewater treatment is achieved in the aeration tanks surface aerators in aeration tank are operated to maintain the required level of dissolved oxygen 2 0 mg l for microbiological degradation of organic matter the do level is monitored every day and surface aerator speed is adjusted manually as required daily samples are collected to validate the aeration tank process performance for dissolved oxygen ph temperature clarifier effluent water from the activated sludge process is continuously injected with a coagulant alum to enhance the sand filtration process chlorine is added to clarifier effluent line to prevent microbiological growth on the sand filter media a static mixer installed in the clarifier effluent line for mixing the alum or chlorine solution with the clarifier effluent sand filter building consists of 6 continuous backwash filter cells each with 4 filter modules total filtration surface area is 111 sq meters sand filter effluent flows into a wet well where chlorine is added and the filtered water is discharged to the effluent storage tanks the tertiary treated sewage effluent was analyzed by third party laboratory weekly analyses were conducted for bod cod tss total coliform intestinal eggs ph turbidity and temperature the monthly average concentrations of the grab samples are presented in table 1 2 2 pilot system description the pilot test was conducted with an open loop system cooling tower of 4 2 mw capacity as shown in fig 3 continuous disinfection of the recirculating water was achieved with 12 5 sodium hypochlorite solution as a primary biocide in addition a proprietary corrosion inhibitor 3dt trasar 250 nalco was injected in the cooling tower cells for managing corrosion control during the operations also a non oxidizing biocide isothiozoline was used for short period of time to control algal growth it was discontinued as the phosphate ingredient increases the nutrient concentration online analyzers were used for monitoring residual chlorine ph and temperature of the recirculating water chlorine residual in the range of 1 5 2 5 mg l and ph in the range of 6 8 7 9 were observed 2 3 chemical water quality analysis reclaimed water feed line fl and circulating line cl water qualities were monitored and analyzed for water quality characteristics on a monthly basis the parameters and corresponding analytical methods are presented in table 2 2 4 bacterial analysis microbiological organisms including legionella sp klebsiella pneumoniae and coliforms were monitored for biohazard assessment with samples collected from the back end of recirculating process to reflect worst case condition all analysis were conducted by an accredited local laboratory named als arabia which maintains an a2la accreditation of analytical testing services which covers chemical and biological analytes under certificate numbers 3258 01 and 3258 03 3258 04 3258 05 3258 09 and 3258 10 the testing laboratory complied with iso iec 17025 the units and level of reporting are presented in table 3 in addition to water analysis dipslide testing and biofilm swab sampling were conducted to evaluate the presence of bacteria 21 swab samples from internal cooling tower surfaces sludges and structures were collected by a third party contractor in two separate occasions 8 swab samples during intermediate shutdown and 13 samples at the end of study shutdown and before deep cleaning in each occasion the samples were collected immediately after plant shut down and before deep cleaning was conducted the locations included the basin trough internal packing and drift eliminators 2 5 virus analysis virus analysis was conducted every two weeks at three locations of the pilot system location a sample was collected from the treated sewage effluent tse discharge line of community irrigation pumps cip located at the sewage treatment plant the cip pressurizes the tse community irrigation network which was tied into for supplying the make up water to the cooling tower prior to cip the wastewater undergoes tertiary treatment by activated sludge extended aeration process as mentioned in the method section location b sample was collected from the flushing tap connected to the tse feed line for the cooling tower make up water the sample collected from this location represents any water quality variations that may occur in the tse while transiting from the sewage treatment plant through community irrigation network during low water demand periods water stagnation microbiological growth and bio film formation in the network pipes location c sample was collected from the sampling line connected at the back end of the pipeline re circulating through the cooling tower process the sample represents the tse water quality from the cycle of concentrations the make water up has gone through and the condenser samples were transported to king faisal specialized hospital research center riyadh in special containers under ice within a maximum 6 h transportation time samples were processed under controlled conditions within 12 h of arrival raw effluent sewage water was designed as a control for overall sample quality and integrity to recover viruses two molecular platforms such as multiplex pcr platform that is a new technology introduced in 2018 and the hybridization assay were used in this study kfshrc is an institute that holds the college american pathology cap accredited laboratory for patient care with existing experience in using the luminex technology for gastroenteritis pathogens detection the lab purchased whole virus stocks from the center for disease control and prevention cdc cap usa for each gastroenteritis virus to be utilized as internal control and for the determination of the limit of detection in addition to the raw sewage effluent the second control was 1 l of sterile water spiked with two different gastroenteritis virus in different concentration to create an internal control to validate the viral recovery results 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical water quality performance control of water quality parameters is required to keep cooling system from scaling corrosion and biofouling problems thus an assessment of chemical quality characteristics is one of the principal criteria to evaluate the suitability of use of municipal reclaimed water as make up water critical water quality parameters were monitored in the feed line fl and circulating line cl of the cooling system and the analysis of the data are presented below 3 2 scaling typical scale forming compounds are calcium carbonate calcium phosphate magnesium silicates and calcium sulfates these scale components adhere to the heat transfer surfaces with higher temperature because their solubilities decrease as the ph and water temperature increases the concentrations of calcium and magnesium in the feedline remained in similar magnitude throughout the study period but increased in the circulating line due to increase in cycle of concentration there was an initial increase followed by a decreasing trend both in calcium ions as shown in fig 4 that is attributed to several trials for optimization of chemicals use concentrations langelier saturation index lsi was calculated for cl as it is a measure of a solution s ability to deposit calcium carbonate the lsi values varied from 0 to 0 5 except one data point in may indicating that the scale forming tendency of municipal reclaimed water was low fig 4 the intel temperature was 75 8 f and the outlet temperature was 80 7 f with a difference across the condenser was 4 9 f the ph in the cl line was 7 8 0 4 3 3 corrosion corrosion is one of the concerns of the use of make up water in cooling systems in evaporative cooling systems carbon steel is used for heat exchanger and piping when the carbon steel is in contact with water localized spots of anodes and cathodes are formed on the surface and initiate corrosion in addition to application of a commercial corrosion inhibitor to minimize corrosion potential metals of concern were monitored during the pilot study to evaluate the extent of corrosion if any the study monitored the concentration of cr cu fe mn ni zn ag and al ions in both fl and cl the geochemical analysis of water samples is shown in table 4 the concentrations of cu mn and ni were below the detection limits of 0 01 mg l in fl and cl the concentration of fe in cl was 0 09 ppm during the study period which is low indicating no significant corrosion low concentration of copper in cl is supported by low average ammonia concentrations of 0 5 ppm however concentration values of zn and al are slightly higher compared to other ions in cl the concentration of zn and al in fl was 0 03 and 0 31 mg l respectively al concentration of 0 3 mg l in fl could be attributed to residual coagulant alum added during secondary wastewater treatment stage al concentration increased to an average of 0 45 mg l in cl due to increase in coc from the above it is evident that no significant corrosion occurred due to use of municipal reclaimed water in cooling system during the pilot study the metallurgy of the cooling system includes carbon steel piping and copper tubing in the condenser the corrosion rate of 5 mpy or less is accepted in the company practice for this type of applications the system did not have any corrosion monitoring program in place however for long term application of tse the cooling systems should undergo a regular scheduled turnaround and inspection t i assessment by corrosion specialists if the corrosion rate is found to be a concern adequate preventive measures should be designed and implemented 3 4 nutrients the nutrients present in municipal reclaimed water include nh3 no3 and po4 ions as microorganisms use organic matter and nutrients for their growth high concentrations of these substances in make up water could promote growth of microorganisms and consequent biofouling potential the organic compounds present in the make up water can also deteriorate the effects of biocide by consuming them or by forming the compounds of low biocidal effects thus the concentrations of these nutrient ions were monitored in the fl and cl fig 5 the concentration of nh3 was 0 05 mg l implying its removal in the wastewater treatment processes the concentrations of no3 and po4 nutrients were high as can be seen in fl higher concentration of nitrates in cl is due to increase in coc phosphate is another nutrient that facilitates microbiological fouling and inorganic scaling high concentration of phosphorous discharged to the environment leads to eutrophication of the receiving bodies the average concentration of total phosphates in fl and cl was 8 0 and 13 1 mg l respectively it should be noted that the wastewater treatment plant was not designed for denitrification and advanced phosphate removal however no biological growth was noticed during the pilot study 3 5 water efficiency of using reclaimed water 3 5 1 cycle of concentration in an open circulating cooling system dissolved salts in the make up water are concentrated in the circulating line since the cooling water is lost through evaporation the term coc compares the level of solids of the recirculating cooling tower to the level of solids of the original raw make up water if the circulating water has three times the solids concentration than that of the makeup water then the cycles are 3 a typical cooling tower is estimated to circulate about 3 l per minute per kw of cooling and loses 1 2 to evaporation blowdown and drift the evaporation rate will vary depending on climate zone and cooling load operating hours a cooling tower discharges certain amount of water to avoid the saturation conditions and is called blowdown that includes any controlled or uncontrolled losses in the cooling tower including drift thus the coc should be controlled in order to maintain the cooling water quality and the concentration of chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors and scale inhibitors at their constant level by adjusting the blowdown water quantity blowdown is controlled by measuring conductivity of the recirculating water and varies with coc higher coc results in less frequent blowdown and less water use a simple way of determining coc is given by the ratio of conductivity in cl to conductivity in fl in this study conductivity and chloride concentration was used to calculate the coc as shown in fig 6 prior to the pilot testing with tse groundwater was used for cooling tower the groundwater characteristics consisted of a tds level of 3040 mg l including scale forming ions such as calcium 233 mg l magnesium 97 mg l sulfate 558 mg l and bicarbonate 226 mg l the coc with groundwater was limited to 2 due to higher concentration of scale forming ions the pilot study results suggested that the coc of the cooling tower operation could be almost doubled from 2 to 3 5 with municipal reclaimed water as make up water as shown in fig 6 higher coc means less blowdown frequency and reduction in water demand the lsi values varied from 0 to 0 5 indicating that the scale forming tendency of municipal reclaimed water is low to moderate 3 6 water savings water savings is a function of initial makeup water volume and the change in the cycle of concentration the data was collected for total makeup water blow down water and the observed coc for the period of pilot operations in order to obtain a water savings estimation it was decided to treat the data in two parts i baseline condition with reclaimed water average of five months of operations from april to august during which there was no optimization of operation and the trials started with conditions similar to the operations with groundwater and ii optimized operation with reclaimed water average of three months of operation from september to november during which the optimal operating condition was maintained the baseline make up water was 5172 m3 month i e average of five months of operation and optimized make up water was calculated at 3797 m3 month i e average of three months of operation therefore the average monthly savings on makeup water as a result of the coc increase was 1375 m3 or 27 it is important to note that the coc can be improved with additional treatment for demineralization and biological treatment of tertiary wastewater that will require capital investment this paper demonstrates that the reclaimed water can replace groundwater use even without making a significant capital investment the study findings indicate that a case by case evaluation based on make up water quality and target coc the fit for purpose water treatment should be developed 3 7 biohazard assessment of using municipal reclaimed water during the course of the pilot representative water samples from the cooling tower were analyzed for bacteria and viruses as discussed below 3 8 bacterial study cooling systems particularly open water systems are known to provide a favorable environment for micro organisms growth and biofilm formation if not controlled such biofilms can cause fouling which can adversely affect equipment performance and promote corrosion during the course of the pilot representative water samples from the cooling tower were analyzed for 32 occasions for legionella sp klebsiella and total coliforms the results are presented in table 5 free residual chlorine was noted as typically operating at 2 0 2 5 mg l and observed as minimum target levels for preventing biofilm growth ph was typically 7 4 7 6 the results showed that all water samples were negative for both legionella and klebsiella total coliform an indicator for the presence of possible pathogens including all aerobic and anaerobic gram negative bacteria was assessed to provide an assessment of general biological contamination which is typically observed in an open structure due to dust vegetation and general environmental contaminants of the 32 samples independently tested by the laboratory 29 of these showed coliform levels below detectable limits indicating optimum water treatment program the three exceptions were in july week 33 750 cfu 100 ml august week 35 210 cfu 100 ml october week 44 1200 cfu 100 ml the results of these three data points were not reflected in table 5 as they were outside of the april to november pilot duration presented in the paper the three exceptions were likely to be due to non optimum biocide dosing legionella like to proliferate in cooling systems that are fouled with deposits and biofilm that can protect the organisms from water treatment and provide nutrients to multiply thus swab samples and dipslide tests were conducted in this study a limited number of the swab samples showed positive counts for coliform bacteria but the absence of legionella and klebsiella sp the presence is related to non oxidizing biocide as its ingredient composition included coagulant which was causing sludge formation and deposition for a short period of time dipslide tests were conducted to measure and observe microbial activity in the cooling systems the tests conducted over 5 weeks towards the end of the pilot showed that the results were less than 2 cfu l indicating optimum treatment conditions in place in addition at the end of pilot study additional swab and sludge residue samples were collected throughout the internal structures of cooling tower immediately after plant shut down and before deep cleaning was conducted the locations included the basin trough internal packing and drift eliminators all samples were negative demonstrating the cleanliness of the system and overall efficacy of the disinfection process 3 9 virus study an assessment of enteric viruses e g norovirus adenovirus astrovirus rotavirus sapovirus etc was also conducted during the course of pilot study enteric virus analysis was conducted bi weekly during the 8 month period the results are presented in table 5 all the raw sewage samples contained enteric viruses none of the samples collected from the cooling tower system operation indicated presence of enteric viruses the results demonstrated that the disinfection and biocide treatment was effective in controlling risks to human health the risk from aerosols infected with viruses arising from a cooling tower system was not observed in this study and was also not readily borne out by published research on outbreaks furthermore viruses will not replicate outside of the host and their environmental fate will be dependent on a range of environmental factors including temperature humidity and sunlight 3 10 equipment performance and reliability of using reclaimed water prior to using reclaimed water the cooling system was operated using groundwater consisted of a tds level of 3040 mg l cooling system s condenser operated with groundwater were visually inspected as shown in fig 7 severe scaling was observed on the condenser surfaces with groundwater water as makeup on the contrary the condenser surface was clean without mineral deposit formation when municipal reclaimed water was used as make up water the visual comparison as presented in fig 7 clearly showed the potential operational benefits of utilizing municipal reclaimed water as makeup water it should also be noted that for ground water application the average monthly pressure differential varied form 35 70 kpa but for reclaimed water application the monthly pressure difference was significantly lower and varied from 6 to 27 psi this data also indicates that there is less potential of scaling formation in the condenser tubes while using reclaimed which will improve the heat transfer efficiency 4 economic benefits application of the municipal reclaimed water for cooling tower operations resulted in significant savings of water energy and operating costs during the pilot study the increase in coc resulted in a 27 reduction in water demand because of successful outcome of the pilot study a decision was made to utilize reclaimed water for five cooling towers of the facility with a total cooling capacity of 21 mw for the five cooling towers the annual expected makeup water savings for the entire facility was 82 500 m3 groundwater the saved makeup water also contributed to avoid energy consumption that was required for pumping and treatment of the groundwater annual expected energy savings from five ac plants was estimated to 247 000 kwh during the pilot study the maintenance cost also dropped significantly when using reclaimed water the annual maintenance costs during with groundwater utilization was 80 900 while after converting to municipal reclaimed water the maintenance cost was 15 300 which was significantly lower similar to the outcomes of this study many other studies demonstrated the tangible benefits of using treated municipal reclaimed water for using as cooling system make up water 18 21 22 the pilot also shows that good make up water quality including acceptable tds and low nutrient levels is critical for cooling systems operation 5 conclusions the outcome of this pilot study indicated that municipal reclaimed water is a viable water source as cooling tower makeup water in the dry hot climate the inorganic scale forming tendency of municipal reclaimed water was lower at optimized cycle of concentration with no significant scale deposition on cooling system surfaces the bio hazard assessment for typical microbiological parameters associated with cooling tower operations showed that the application of a comprehensive water treatment system disinfection and associated robust operating procedures were effective in controlling risks to human health in addition the enteric virus study results demonstrated that the sodium hypochlorite treatment for inactivation of enteric viruses was effective and produced acceptable results in order to develop a successful reclaimed water application program for cooling systems a number of factors need to be evaluated the factors are regulatory responsibilities water quality of the reclaimed water design and operation of the wastewater facilities generating the reclaimed water diurnal and seasonal fluctuation in water quality biological growth control treatment process control and monitoring of chemical feed system economics of using reclaimed water and integrated planning between wastewater treatment plant and cooling tower operations the water treatment program including disinfection should be designed by a qualified specialist who understands the relationship between water chemistry microbiology equipment material and cooling system operations a conceptual decision matrix on the water treatment optimization for the application of reclaimed water in cooling systems is
