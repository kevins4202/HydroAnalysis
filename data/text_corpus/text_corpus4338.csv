undulation on the hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding behavior of the circular cylinder are examined the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient are reduced up to 27 5 and 54 9 respectively in the presence of a wavy plate additionally the vortex formation length is elongated and the wake width is shortened illustrating the suppression of vortex shedding according to the flow control performance the 1 5d length d is the cylinder diameter wavy plate with wavelength of 3d is employed to control the vortex induced vibration viv the two degree of freedom of flow induced vibration is computed for a wide range of reduced velocities u r 2 20 in comparison with a bare cylinder the results indicate the initial and lower branches of viv are effectively suppressed by the

in galloping branch shows a greater potential for energy harvesting keywords flow control wavy plate vortex induced vibration galloping flow wake 1 introduction over the past century the flow behavior around circular cylinders has received increasing attention due to its importance in numerous engineering applications and the remarkable interest in fundamental physics of fluid circular cylinders immersed in fluid flow are vulnerable to fatigue damage as a result of periodic surface loading induced by vortex shedding when the reynolds number re u in d ν where u in is the free stream velocity d is the diameter of cylinder and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity is larger than a critical value that is 47 for a stationary circular cylinder henderson 1997 the unsteady forces result in the self sustained oscillation with certain values of amplitude and frequency bearman 1984 termed as vortex induced vibration viv splitter plates were proposed and employed as a passive device to control viv in the past decades the relevant studies of flow past a circular cylinder with a splitter plate may go back to the experiments conducted by roshko 1955 in his experiments a rigid splitter plate was placed in the wake of a stationary circular cylinder the mitigation of vortex shedding and the reduction of drag force were achieved by introducing a splitter plate with appropriate length and distance after that the use of rigid splitter plates for alleviating vortex shedding or reducing drag force has been extensively studied both numerically and experimentally apelt et al 1973 and apelt and west 1975 examined the effect of a rear splitter plate in high reynolds number range of 104 5 104 and pointed out that a short splitter plate in the wake of a circular cylinder can significantly modify the characteristics of flow past the cylinder by disrupting the communication between two sides of the wake based on the numerical results of the laminar vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder with a splitter plate kwon and choi 1996 reported that the vortex shedding can be completely suppressed when the plate length is larger than a critical value which is proportional to the reynolds number in the simulations conducted by hwang et al 2003 it was observed that a detached splitter plate with the same length as the cylinder diameter i e l d 1 l is the plate length and d is the cylinder diameter can also significantly reduce the drag force and lift fluctuation at g d 2 6 g is the distance between the rear base point of the cylinder and the leading edge of the splitter plate however the flow induced forces sharply increased as the plate was placed further downstream from the experiments on vortex shedding of a circular cylinder in shallow water with a detached splitter plate of l d 1 akilli et al 2005 also found that the plate lost its effect when the gap increased to 2d the similar phenomenon was observed in the direct numerical simulation dns carried out by serson et al 2014 and zhu et al 2020a and the experimental study performed by liu et al 2016 apart from the rigid plates rotatable plates that are free to rotate about the cylinder axis cimbala and chen 1994 lu et al 2016 flapping or hinged plates that are forced to undergo periodic oscillation wu and shu 2011 sudhakar and vengadesan 2012 and flexible plates that are free to continuously deform along its length lee and you 2013 shukla et al 2013 are evaluated for their ability to reduce hydrodynamic forces and to suppress the primary vortex shedding the common feature for these splitter plates is the flow wake of the circular cylinder is continuously interfered with the motion or deformation of plates among them the flexible plates have the relatively ease of deployment according to the computational analysis of the vibration of a flexible plate behind a cylinder at a low reynolds number of 100 lee and you 2013 concluded that the plate length and the young s modulus and natural frequency of the plate determine the deflection shape and amplitude of the flexible plate and hence the adjustment of flow wake shukla et al 2013 experimentally observed a periodic traveling wave type deformation from the flexible splitter plate in the wake of a circular cylinder based on the particle image velocimetry piv visualization results yayla and teksin 2018 found that the shear layers were transported downstream by aid of the wave type deformed splitter plate abdi et al 2019 pointed out that small vortices are generated on the tip of flexible plate and the tip vortices either cut the cylinder vortex which has an opposite vorticity contributing to the separation and shedding of the vortex or get combined with the cylinder vortex which has the same rotational direction resulting in the enlargement of vortex wang et al 2018 numerically studied the flow induced vibration of a flexible plate located in the wake of a stationary circular cylinder and up to 0 958d amplitude was observed for the plate tip due to the vigorous oscillation of flexible plates the vortex formation length of circular cylinder is shortened in some conditions and thereby the diminishing of flow control the concerned circular cylinders are stationary in the aforementioned literature the effectiveness of splitter plates in viv suppression was examined numerically and experimentally in recent years huera huarte 2014 experimentally investigated the viv suppression of flexible cylinders with plastic plates a 90 reduction in the maximum amplitude as well as a 50 drag reduction was achieved by splitter plates that covered less than half of the cylinder span the similar experiments were carried out by lou et al 2016 and the better suppression effects were found in the cases of plate lengths l d 1 0 1 25 and 1 5 nevertheless in the experimental investigation of a circular cylinder fitted with solid and slotted splitter plates assi and bearman 2015 pointed out that the displacement of controlled cylinder monotonically increases with flow speed and becomes larger than the bare cylinder at higher reduced velocities due to the reattachment of the free shear layers on the tip of plates the same profile of vibration displacement was observed by wu et al 2014 in the viv simulations of a circular cylinder with a hinged flat plate assi et al 2009 categorized this kind of structure instability as galloping which is characterized by a large amplitude and a low frequency zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 galloping is commonly observed for a body with a non circular cross section owing to the continuous change in the attack angle between the moving body and incoming flow blevins 1990 the response of viv followed by galloping was found by liang et al 2018a law and jaiman 2017 and sahu et al 2019 in their numerical studies on the oscillation of a circular cylinder with a rigid flat plate liang et al 2018a reported that a full interaction of viv and galloping was generated for the cylinder with flat plates of l d 1 0 and 1 5 namely the onset of galloping shifted to a much smaller reduced velocity sahu et al 2019 also observed that the galloping appeared before the end of viv lock in branch for the cylinder with a flat plate of l d 1 5 to some extent the viv suppression effect may be guaranteed by increasing the onset reduced velocity of galloping additionally although the amplitude in viv branches got a certain reduction the lock in phenomenon still occurred with the introduction of flat plates law and jaiman 2017 sahu et al 2019 apart from the rigid flat plates the vibration suppression effect of flexible plates has been evaluated by several researchers balint and lucey 2005 numerically investigated the flow induced vibration of a flexible cantilevered plate and the plate was found to lose its stability in a flutter pattern yadykin et al 2003 found that the added mass decreased with the increase of the vibration mode of flexible plate contributing to the enhancement of vibration hua et al 2013 reported that flapping plate could promote the structure motion depending on the heaving amplitude and the bending rigidity of the flexible plate liang et al 2018b observed that the synchronized region was significantly broadened and severe galloping as well as higher harmonic components emerged when the cylinder was attached with a flexible splitter plate in general rigid flat plates can partly suppress the viv initial and lower branches in the cost of early appearance of galloping while the flapping and deformation of flexible plates result in much more violent vibration in some conditions a rigid wavy plate therefore is proposed in this work to avoid the uncontrolled vigorous deformation of flexible plate and to completely separate the viv and galloping the hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding behavior of the circular cylinder with a wavy plate at re 150 are investigated and compared first for five plate lengths l d 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and three wavelengths l w d 1 2 and 3 then a wavy plate possessing the good performance in drag and lift reduction and vortex shedding suppression is employed to control viv and the vibration response of controlled cylinder is examined in the reduced velocity range of 2 20 then the hydrodynamic coefficients response amplitude and frequency phase difference between the lift force and cross flow amplitude and flow wake structures are presented and discussed numerical results allow an improved understanding of the wake flow structure interaction which will be of great interest in offshore engineering such as subsea manifold jumper tube and umbilical cable installed or laid on the seabed under the similar low re flows 2 problem description as shown in fig 1 the rigid wavy plate is attached to the rear surface of a circular cylinder with its direction parallel to the free stream the thickness δ of the plate is fixed at 0 05d in all cases and the plate length l ranges from 1d to 3d which is recommended with respect to vortex shedding suppression in previous literature kwon and choi 1996 hwang et al 2003 akilli et al 2005 the wavy plate has a sinusoidal profile along the streamwise direction and the wavelength l w ranges from 1d to 3d with a fixed wave height h of 0 15d in the comparing simulations where the height of the wave plate is selected in consideration of the negative influence created by a higher waviness as the violent deformation of flexible plates wang et al 2018 hua et al 2013 liang et al 2018b abdi et al 2019 the shape of the wavy plate is expressed as 1 y x h 2 h 2 cos 2 π l w x d 2 where the origin of coordinates locates at the cylinder center and x and y are the in line and cross flow directions respectively the circular cylinder is elastically mounted with linear spring and damper and is free to oscillate in both in line and cross flow directions in the examined reduced velocity range of 2 20 the reduced velocity u r is defined as u in f n d where f n is the natural frequency of the structure the mass damping coefficient m ζ of the structure is 0 0372 the main parameters are summarized in table 1 a rectangular computational domain of 90d 60d is employed for the flow past the circular cylinder attached with a wavy plate the cylinder center is located at a distance of 30d from the upstream and the two lateral boundaries thus the blockage is smaller than 2 referring to fig 1 the boundary conditions are specified as follows at the inlet the velocity components in the streamwise and transverse directions are specified as u u in and v 0 respectively the slip wall boundary condition is imposed on the lateral boundaries and no slip boundary condition is imposed on the structure wall neumann boundary condition is applied at the outlet u x 0 and v y 0 3 computational model and method 3 1 governing equations and solution methodology as a low reynolds number of 150 is applied in this work two dimensional 2d numerical simulations are conducted using the open source cfd solver openfoam which is composed of c libraries solving the unsteady navier stokes ns equations with the finite volume discretization method fvdm and the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm the 2d incompressible unsteady navier stokes ns equations are expressed as 2 u x v y 0 3 u t u u x v u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 4 v t u v x v v y 1 ρ p y ν 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where x and y are the coordinates in in line and cross flow direction respectively u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions t is the flow time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and ν is the corresponding kinematic viscosity of fluid the second order upwind scheme and the gauss linear approach are used to deal with the convective and diffusion terms respectively amiraslanpour et al 2017 a blended scheme composed of the gauss linear approach and the first order euler implicit scheme is employed to handle the time derivative term due to the stability problem of the flow structure interaction jiang et al 2016 the flow induced vibration fiv of the controlled circular cylinder is triggered by the unsteady hydrodynamic forces exerted on its surface by the fluid flow where the hydrodynamic forces including the drag and lift forces are obtained from the integration of the pressure and shear stress on the structure surface after the flow field is computed the two degrees of freedom oscillating equations are expressed as 5 x 4 π f n ζ x 4 π 2 f n 2 x f d t m 6 y 4 π f n ζ y 4 π 2 f n 2 y f l t m where m is the mass of the structure x x and x are the in line acceleration velocity and displacement of the structure respectively while y y and y represent the same quantities associated with the cross flow oscillation ζ is the damping ratio f d t and f l t are the drag and lift forces respectively the sequential two way coupling method is employed in the simulations where the fluid flow around the cylinder and the dynamic response of the structure are solved alternately in each time step the flow field is computed first by solving the ns equations eqs 2 4 the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress exerted on the structure surface by the fluid flow then the hydrodynamic forces are substituted into eqs 5 and 6 to compute the vibration displacements of the cylinder by aid of the fourth order runge kutta method subsequently the computational mesh is updated according to the displacements of the structure preparing for the fluid flow calculation in the next time step the normalized time step for the flow solver is u in δt d 0 001 ensuring the courant friedrichs lewy number less than 0 5 in the entire computational domain the convergent criteria for iteration is set as that the residual in the control volume for each parameter is smaller than 10 5 and the calculation was running until sufficient periodic results were obtained for statistical analysis 3 2 computational mesh and mesh dependence check as shown in fig 1 a large circle enveloping the structure is used to divide the computational domain into two zones accompanying moving zone and dynamic zone the radius of the accompanying moving zone equals to 0 5d l 0 5d where the first 0 5d is the radius of the circular cylinder and the second 0 5d is the distance from the rear of the wavy plate the accompanying moving zone follows the movement of the structure and hence no requirement of mesh update while the mesh in the dynamic zone is updated in each time step as depicted in fig 2 the accompanying moving zone is divided by quadrilateral cells and the perimeter of the circular cylinder is equally discretized by 240 nodes the grid along the radial direction is denser near the cylinder surface with the height of the first layer grid 0 0042d y 0 1 and the cell expansion ratio of 1 05 the triangular cells are adopted in the dynamic zone for local re meshing and the cell expansion ratio is below 1 1 the grid independence test was conducted first for the freely oscillating circular cylinder with a wavy plate table 2 compares the computed important quantities for four different mesh resolutions where a x and a y are the normalized vibration amplitudes in the in line and cross flow directions respectively and c d and c l are the time averaged drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient respectively expressed as 7 c d 1 n i 1 n 2 f d t ρ u i n 2 d 8 c l 2 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 in which 9 c l 2 f l t ρ u i n 2 d 10 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i where n is the number of values in the time history for statistics c l and c l are the lift coefficient and its time averaged value it is seen that the percentage changes are reduced as the mesh resolution increases the mesh resolution implemented in m3 is used for the computations in this work since both hydrodynamic forces and vibration amplitudes are converged at this mesh resolution 3 3 model validation the computational approach used in this work is validated with several reported results wu et al 2014 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 bao et al 2011 for the viv of a bare circular cylinder at the same parameters m 2 ζ 0 and re 150 as shown in fig 3 the response curve presents three distinct branchs the initial branch ib the lower branch lb and the desynchronization branch db the absence of the upper branch observed by williamson and govardhan 2004 in medium reynolds numbers is attributed to the greater viscous force at a low re which has been confirmed in many previous studies zhu et al 2019 singh and mittal 2005 in the lower branch the maximum percentage difference is 8 56 as compared to the published data in bao et al 2011 whereas it is within 5 0 in comparison with other two literature the difference in response amplitudes is possibly attributed to the different numerical approaches the characteristic based split finite element method was employed in bao et al 2011 while the immersed boundary method was adopted in wu et al 2014 and borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 overall the present results are in consistent with the reported literature 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow control of a stationary circular cylinder with a wavy plate the flow control of a fixed circular cylinder with a wavy plate in five plate lengths l d 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and three wavelengths l w d 1 2 and 3 is examined first fig 4 compares the time mean drag coefficient c d and the time mean pressure coefficient c p along the cylinder surface for the equipped cylinder against the bare one the time mean drag coefficient of the bare cylinder c d 1 33 at re 150 is also plotted in fig 4 a as a black dashed line for comparison it is clearly seen that the all the cylinders fitted with wavy plates attain a significant drag reduction as compared to the bare cylinder and the drag reduction grows with increasing of the plate length the maximum drag reduction of 27 5 in comparison with the bare cylinder is achieved by attaching a wavy plate of l 3d in the rear stagnation point of the circular cylinder in contrast the wavelength of the plate has no apparent impact on the drag reduction it implies that the drag force mainly depends on the pressure distribution around the cylinder as shown in fig 4 b the pressure along the leeward surface of the circular cylinder is increased after the cylinder is attached with a wavy plate the longer the wavy plate the smaller the maximum value of c p it explains the profiles of the time mean drag coefficients in fig 4 a it is noted that the c p curve is discontinuous around θ 180 which is attributed to the presence of the wavy plate furthermore the cylinder surface pressure on both sides of the wavy plate is different resulting in a pressure jump at the attachment point it indicates the wavy surface of the rear plate alters the symmetric distribution of flow wake which is different from a flat plate the relatively large pressure along the upper surface of circular cylinder arises a downward force partly contributing to the negative time mean lift coefficient as depicted in fig 5 fig 5 shows the time averaged and fluctuation of lift coefficient c l and cl against the plate length l d both the c l and cl are computed from the integration of stresses over both the circular cylinder surface and the surface of wavy plate it is seen from fig 5 that the negative time mean lift coefficient emerges in all the cases of equipped cylinders the difference of the pressure distribution between the two sides of the wavy plate contributes to the non zero time mean lift coefficient compared to the upper side a relatively low pressure zone is generated below the connection point between the wavy plate and the circular cylinder due mainly to the downward curvature of the nearest surface of the wavy plate close to the cylinder base the time mean lift coefficient varies with the plate length and the wavelength while the change law is not apparent the combination effect of the vortex shedding from the cylinder surface the non uniform and asymmetric pressure distribution along the wavy plate and its interference to the flow wake may cause the irregular profile of c l by contrast the dependence of the fluctuation of lift coefficient on the plate length and the wavelength is obvious as the plate length increases the lift fluctuation is enlarged this is principally because the loading surface of the plate becomes larger with increasing of its length the fluctuation of lift coefficient at l w d 2 and l w d 3 keeps smaller than the corresponding value of bare cylinder in the range of l d 1 3 indicating a good performance in suppressing the lift amplitude the largest reduction of lift fluctuation is 54 9 attained by the 1 5d length plate with l w 3d comparatively the performance of the wavy plate with l w d 1 is lower than the former two moreover the lift fluctuation of the cylinder fitted with this small wavelength splitter plate l w d 1 even becomes larger than the associated value of the bare cylinder as the plate length increases to 2 5d it indicates that the small wavelength plate introduces greater interference into the flow wake and the longer the plate length the stronger the influence fig 6 plots the time histories of the lift coefficients for the cylinder fitted with a 1 5d length plate in three different wavelengths and the associated pressure coefficient distribution at two typical moments corresponding to c lmax and c lmin it more clearly displays the reduction of lift fluctuation and the negative time mean lift coefficient in comparison with the bare cylinder when the lift coefficient reaches its maximum value at t t 1 t u in t d the pressure on the lower surface of the wavy plate is higher than that on the upper surface explaining the upward lift force conversely the upper surface pressure is greater than the lower surface pressure at t t 2 corresponding to the minimum lift coefficient furthermore the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides at t t 2 is larger than that at t t 1 providing an interpretation for the negative time averaged lift coefficient it is worth noting that the pressure varies along the splitter plate length although the pressure generally increases from the cylinder base to the tip of plate it experiences some fluctuations caused by the wavy surface of the plate the smaller the wavelength of the plate the more obvious the pressure fluctuation on the plate surface this phenomenon was observed by lee and you 2013 and díaz ojeda et al 2019 in their investigations of flexible splitter plates it implies the rigid wavy plate plays the similar role on the wake adjustment as the flexible plates to have a better understanding of the influence of wavy undulation on the near wake dynamics of the cylinder with a 1 5d length plate the processes of vortex shedding and associated streamlines during one shedding period are illustrated in fig 7 for the case of l w d 1 at t 1 it can be seen that the flow separating from the upper surface of the cylinder generates a recirculating region above the wavy plate as indicated by the streamlines this region grows to a larger size at t 2 and its center arrives at the tip of plate after that it is split into two parts by a thickening local shear layer that enveloped the wavy plate with opposite sign as shown in the left column of fig 7 at instants t 3 and t 4 the shear layer at the rear tip of the plate shrinks when the upper vortex is shed into the wake at t 5 this process repeats symmetrically for the lower side the cases of l w d 2 and l w d 3 present the similar shedding process as l w d 1 whereas the former cases take longer to complete a cycle compared to the plates of l w d 2 and l w d 3 the more violent undulation of the plate l w d 1 causes the split of local shear layers along the plate surface introducing more perturbation into the shear layers of the cylinder and hence the earlier vortex shedding consequently the strohual number st becomes smaller with increasing l w d as shown in fig 8 the wavy plate prevents the interaction between the two shear layers from the cylinder surface forcing the vortices to form further downstream of the cylinder additionally a shear layer with counterclockwise vorticity is generated on the upper surface of the plate close to its rear tip and another shear layer with clockwise vorticity is created on the lower surface around the protrusion in contrast the two shear layers formed from the cylinder surface present the opposite vorticities the upper layer has clockwise vorticity and the lower one has counterclockwise vorticity on either side the plate s shear layer in opposite sense of rotation partly contributes to the elongation of the cylinder s shear layer it is seen that the shear layer dose not roll up until it crosses the plate rear edge this observation consists well with the numerical results of abdi et al 2017 2019 at l w d 1 the shear layer thickness along the wavy plate fluctuates relatively fiercely due to its more undulating surface this phenomenon becomes more obvious as the plate length increases the increasing variation of the plate s shear layer is the main reason for the increase of lift fluctuation as seen in fig 5 apart from the prolongation of shear layers the streamwise distance between two adjacent vortices is also increased after the cylinder is attached with a wavy plate although the wavy plate remarkably alters the flow wake the vortex shedding still presents the 2s pattern two vortices are shed per cycle one vortex clockwise and the other counterclockwise as the bare cylinder at this low reynolds number of 150 fig 9 compares the vortex shedding frequency f s of the cylinder fitted with a wavy plate in different lengths the corresponding frequency of the bare cylinder is also included for comparison it is clearly observed that the shedding frequency is decreased in the presence of wavy plate leading to the increase of the streamwise distance between shed vortices as the plate length increases the shedding frequency is generally reduced which is associated with the vortex formation length additionally more low frequency peaks emerge owing to the disturbance introduced by the wavy plate fig 10 shows the contours of the root mean square rms values of the streamwise velocity u rms u rms u for the cylinder fitted with a wavy plate there are two peaks of u rms symmetrically distributed about the wake centerline indicating the shear layer rolling positions on both sides the streamwise distance between the cylinder center and the shear layer rolling position is defined as the vortex formation length l f while the transverse distance between the two peaks of u rms is defined as the wake width w bai and alam 2018 zhu et al 2020b additionally the white curve in the panel represents the contour line of u 0 which is usually used to illustrate the streamwise length l r of the recirculation region and the separation point of boundary layer zhu et al 2019 compared to the bare cylinder the boundary layer separation points have no obvious movement after the installation of wavy plate while both the vortex formation length and the streamwise length of the recirculation region are elongated and the wake width is narrowed it illustrates that the wavy plate effectively suppress the vortex shedding of the circular cylinder there is a slight variation of l f l r and w as the wavelength of plate changes comparatively the dependence of l f and l r on the plate length is evident both l f and l r generally increase with increasing of plate length explaining the reduction of shedding frequency as seen in fig 9 at l w d 3 the wake width undergoes a fluctuation as the plate length increases although the fluctuation is below 0 16d it is mainly attributed to the variation of the angle between the plate tail and the flow direction on the base of comprehensive consideration of the drag and lift reduction and the vortex shedding suppression the 1 5d long wavy plate with l w d 3 is selected for the examination of viv control 4 2 vibration response of a circular cylinder with a wavy plate fig 11 a plots the time mean drag coefficient of the controlled cylinder against the reduced velocity in comparison with the bare cylinder the drag coefficient of the bare cylinder evidently depends on the reduced velocity experiencing a sharp rise followed by a decline as the reduced velocity increases from 2 to 7 when the reduced velocity is larger than 8 the variation of c d is negligible the largest time mean drag coefficient c d 2 029 occurs at u r 5 which coincides with the results reported by wu et al 2014 the profile of c d u r is well explained by the curves of pressure coefficient around the cylinder surface as shown in fig 11 b at u r 5 the lowest pressure on the leeward surface of circular cylinder leads to the largest drag force additionally the pressure coefficient shows no obvious variation at u r 8 resulting in the ignorable change of c d on the contrary the reduced velocity has little impact on the time mean drag coefficient of the controlled cylinder as the reduced velocity increases from 4 to 5 a slight increment of 4 6 appears for c d while the value is only 54 of the corresponding value of bare cylinder after that c d gradually decreases to the same level as the value at u r 4 as the reduced velocity further increases from 5 to 8 another small increment of c d occurs in the range of 8 u r 15 and then the variation becomes negligible at u r 15 the lower pressure coefficient at the cylinder base explains the greater drag force at higher reduced velocities u r 12 compared to the bare cylinder the time mean drag coefficient is significantly reduced with the introduction of a wavy plate in the whole reduced velocity range of 2 20 it is noted from fig 11 b that the pressure coefficient experiences a jump across the wavy plate this jump is relatively small at u r 3 and u r 5 while it becomes larger at u r 12 indicating the wavy plate alters the pressure distribution more significantly at higher reduced velocities this kind of alteration tightly affects the lift coefficient as shown in fig 12 a similar trend as c d is observed for c l of the bare cylinder the use of wavy plate leads to a reduction in c l in the range of 2 u r 8 while a significant growth in the range of 8 u r 20 as compared to the bare cylinder the variation of c l is associated with the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the structure as depicted in fig 12 b a great pressure difference appears in the surface of bare cylinder at u r 5 while the pressure difference is obviously reduced when the wavy plate is attached to the cylinder base and hence the reduction in c l conversely the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the controlled cylinder becomes larger than the corresponding value of bare cylinder at u r 9 mainly contributing to the increase of c l in addition the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the wavy plate also makes contribution to the variation of c l as shown in fig 12 c the blue lines marked in the snapshots of velocity vectors are the contours of u 0 it is seen that the shear layers from the circular cylinder reattach the tip of wavy plate at u r 5 and u r 9 and the recirculation region basically envelops the plate consequently the pressure difference between the two sides of the plate is relatively small in contrast the shear layers from the circular cylinder reattach on the wavy plate surface at u r 15 and u r 18 resulting in a greater pressure difference across the plate as the observation in assi and bearman 2015 assi et al 2009 and liang et al 2018a b this asymmetric and larger pressure difference partly contributes to the growth of c l for the equipped cylinder compared to the bare one fig 13 compares the response amplitude and frequency of the controlled cylinder to the bare one for the bare cylinder the response amplitudes including the in line il and cross flow cf amplitudes a x and a y which are normalized the cylinder diameter rise smoothly as u r increases from 2 to 4 and then grows sharply when u r continuously increases to 5 in the range of 2 u r 5 the cf and il response frequencies f x and f y which are normalized the natural frequency follow the lines of st 0 18 and 2st respectively where st is the strohual number according to the dependence of a and f on u r the initial branch ib of viv occurs at u r 5 for the bare cylinder as u r further increases to 8 the amplitudes decrease gradually while the frequencies are locked on f 1 and f 2 in the cf and il directions respectively these response features indicate the lower branch lb the response frequencies shift back to follow the profiles of st and 2 st at u r 8 and the corresponding variations in response amplitudes become negligible illustrating the desynchronization branch db when the cylinder is fitted with a wavy plate the response amplitudes are evidently reduced in the range of 2 u r 8 showing a good behavior in viv suppression the amplitude reduction up to 92 44 is achieved at u r 5 illustrating the advantage over flat splitter plates liang et al 2018a sahu et al 2019 although the variation of response amplitudes is slight the border between the ib and lb can be identified from the variation of response frequencies which show the same trend as the bare cylinder the notable difference appears at u r 8 where the amplitudes of the equipped cylinder monotonically increase with u r and the cf frequency becomes lower than the natural frequency but remains almost constant with u r these characteristics demonstrate the cylinder undergoes galloping with the presence of wavy plate the same phenomenon was observed in rigid flat plates assi et al 2009 liang et al 2018a b sahu et al 2019 as the axisymmetry of circular cylinder is destroyed by the wavy plate the change in orientation of the controlled cylinder with respect to incoming flow leads to the larger fluctuating force as seen in fig 12 exciting the galloping instability as galloping emerges after the lower branch of viv there is no interaction between them falling in the first type of viv galloping response proposed by mannini et al 2014 it indicates the full interaction between viv and galloping is vanished and the onset of galloping shifts to a higher reduced velocity nevertheless the cf amplitude reaches 1 115d at u r 20 2 14 times as large as the peak amplitude of viv indicating a great potential for energy harvesting the oscillation trajectories of the controlled cylinder are plotted in fig 14 as compared to the bare cylinder it is clearly seen that both the bare cylinder and the controlled cylinder oscillate in regular or irregular figure eight orbits indicating f x 2f y jauvtis and williamson 2004 gedikli and dah 2017 in general a regular figure eight orbital response is seen in the lower branch of the bare cylinder while the orbit of controlled cylinder evolves becomes more irregular as the reduced velocity increases in the galloping branch due mainly to the instability the phase difference between the lift force and the cf amplitude is plotted in fig 15 for the bare cylinder there is a phase jump around 180 as the response shifts from the ib to lb and then the phase angle remains around 180 in the db it coincides well with the previous reported results khalak and williamson 1999 jauvtis and williamson 2003 with the introduction of wavy plate the same phase jump occurs at the transition from ib to lb as the bare cylinder after that the phase angle returns to about 0 at u r 9 at which point the frequency passes through the natural frequency again and the response transfers from lb to gb similar observation has been reported by sahu et al 2019 in their numerical study on flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a rigid flat plate in consonance with previous literature assi and bearman 2015 the lift force and the motion of the structure are always in phase in gb resulting in the increase of vibration amplitude nevertheless assi and bearman 2015 have not observed any phase jump in the whole considered reduced velocity range for the cylinder with a rigid splitter plate the main reason is that the full interaction of viv and galloping occurs in their work where galloping takes the place of the lower branch of viv the instantaneous flow structures behind the controlled cylinder at two typical moments corresponding to a ymax and a ymin are depicted in fig 16 in comparison with the bare cylinder it is clearly seen that the 2s vortex shedding mode is the predominant pattern for the bare cylinder due mainly to the same natural frequencies in the two directions as reported by bao et al 2012 the vortex shedding evolves from one row structure into two row one as u r increases from 3 to 5 resulting in a wider wake as u r further increases the wake structure returns to one row configuration corresponding to the response transition from lb to db when the wavy plate is introduced the vortex structure at u r 5 retains the one row 2s mode as that at u r 3 illustrating the suppression of vortex shedding due to the prevention of communication between the two shear layers created from the cylinder the vortex formation length is significantly elongated in the presence of wavy plate nevertheless as the response transforms from lb to gb the flow wake is obviously altered it is seen that the shear layers separated from the cylinder surface alternately reattach on the plate surface and the tip of plate is immersed in the shear layers accordingly at u r 9 the plate tip cuts the shear layer and contributes to the formation of vortices this phenomenon becomes more evident as u r increases from 9 to 18 owing to the interference of wavy plate the vortex shedding evolves to p s mode a single vortex and a pair of opposite signed vortices released per cycle of shedding in gb the reattachment of shear layers on plate surface and the asymmetric vortex structure render the unstable fluid force and hence the fierce vibration liang et al 2018a b the comparison of the iso contours of root mean square streamwise velocities between the bare cylinder and the controlled cylinder is depicted in fig 17 it is seen that the wake width behind the bare cylinder is w 1 1403 at u r 5 while it is reduced to 1 0628 with the installation of the wavy plate additionally both the streamwise length of the recirculation region and the vortex formation length are significantly elongated as compared to the bare cylinder further demonstrating the viv suppression on the contrary the wake width becomes larger than that of bare cylinder as the response evolves from viv to galloping moreover the width of flow wake grows quickly with increasing of the reduced velocity indicating the wake instability 5 conclusions in this work the passive control effectiveness of a rigid wavy splitter plate attached to the rear stagnation point of a circular cylinder at low reynolds number of 150 is numerically investigated using two dimensional direct numerical simulation for the stationary circular cylinder both the mean drag and lift fluctuation are significantly reduced with the introduction of an attached rear wavy plate the maximum reductions for c d and cl are 27 5 and 54 9 respectively as the plate length increases the drag reduction increases due to the rise of base pressure while the lift fluctuation is enlarged because of the growing loading surface although the wavelength of plate has no obvious influence on the drag reduction the uneven surface renders the pressure fluctuation along the plate length and the variation of the plate s shear layer thickness affecting the lift fluctuation the shear layers of circular cylinder are evidently elongated with the installation of wavy plate resulting in the prolongation of vortex formation length and the decrease of shedding frequency the longer the plate the greater the performance in suppression of vortex shedding the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder attached by a 1 5d length wavy plate with wavelength of 3d is examined in reduced velocity range of u r 2 20 on one hand the wavy plate plays a positive role in suppressing viv in both the initial and lower branches the reduction in cross flow amplitude reaches 92 44 at u r 5 where the one row 2s vortex shedding mode is retained and the wake width is significantly reduced as compared to the bare cylinder on the other hand instead of the desynchronization branch the vigorous galloping is excited at u r 8 the shear layers from the cylinder surface alternately reattach on the surface of wavy plate making the plate tip reach into them by turns as a result the shear layers are cut and vortices are formed subsequently the p s shedding pattern is observed with a wider wake as the galloping emerges after the lower branch of viv the phase difference between the lift force and the cross flow amplitude experiences two jumps of around 180 corresponding to the response transition from the initial branch to the lower branch and then to the galloping credit authorship contribution statement

21690,flow past a circular cylinder fitted with a rear rigid wavy plate at a low reynolds number of re 150 is first numerically studied in this work the effects of the plate length and the surface undulation on the hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding behavior of the circular cylinder are examined the mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient are reduced up to 27 5 and 54 9 respectively in the presence of a wavy plate additionally the vortex formation length is elongated and the wake width is shortened illustrating the suppression of vortex shedding according to the flow control performance the 1 5d length d is the cylinder diameter wavy plate with wavelength of 3d is employed to control the vortex induced vibration viv the two degree of freedom of flow induced vibration is computed for a wide range of reduced velocities u r 2 20 in comparison with a bare cylinder the results indicate the initial and lower branches of viv are effectively suppressed by the wavy plate with the maximum reduction of cross flow amplitude up to 92 44 nevertheless the reattachment of shear layers on the wavy plate surface and the asymmetric p s a single vortex and a pair of opposite signed vortices released per cycle of shedding vortex structure stir the galloping instability at u r 8 instead of the desynchronization branch the monotonic increase of vibration amplitude in galloping branch shows a greater potential for energy harvesting keywords flow control wavy plate vortex induced vibration galloping flow wake 1 introduction over the past century the flow behavior around circular cylinders has received increasing attention due to its importance in numerous engineering applications and the remarkable interest in fundamental physics of fluid circular cylinders immersed in fluid flow are vulnerable to fatigue damage as a result of periodic surface loading induced by vortex shedding when the reynolds number re u in d ν where u in is the free stream velocity d is the diameter of cylinder and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity is larger than a critical value that is 47 for a stationary circular cylinder henderson 1997 the unsteady forces result in the self sustained oscillation with certain values of amplitude and frequency bearman 1984 termed as vortex induced vibration viv splitter plates were proposed and employed as a passive device to control viv in the past decades the relevant studies of flow past a circular cylinder with a splitter plate may go back to the experiments conducted by roshko 1955 in his experiments a rigid splitter plate was placed in the wake of a stationary circular cylinder the mitigation of vortex shedding and the reduction of drag force were achieved by introducing a splitter plate with appropriate length and distance after that the use of rigid splitter plates for alleviating vortex shedding or reducing drag force has been extensively studied both numerically and experimentally apelt et al 1973 and apelt and west 1975 examined the effect of a rear splitter plate in high reynolds number range of 104 5 104 and pointed out that a short splitter plate in the wake of a circular cylinder can significantly modify the characteristics of flow past the cylinder by disrupting the communication between two sides of the wake based on the numerical results of the laminar vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder with a splitter plate kwon and choi 1996 reported that the vortex shedding can be completely suppressed when the plate length is larger than a critical value which is proportional to the reynolds number in the simulations conducted by hwang et al 2003 it was observed that a detached splitter plate with the same length as the cylinder diameter i e l d 1 l is the plate length and d is the cylinder diameter can also significantly reduce the drag force and lift fluctuation at g d 2 6 g is the distance between the rear base point of the cylinder and the leading edge of the splitter plate however the flow induced forces sharply increased as the plate was placed further downstream from the experiments on vortex shedding of a circular cylinder in shallow water with a detached splitter plate of l d 1 akilli et al 2005 also found that the plate lost its effect when the gap increased to 2d the similar phenomenon was observed in the direct numerical simulation dns carried out by serson et al 2014 and zhu et al 2020a and the experimental study performed by liu et al 2016 apart from the rigid plates rotatable plates that are free to rotate about the cylinder axis cimbala and chen 1994 lu et al 2016 flapping or hinged plates that are forced to undergo periodic oscillation wu and shu 2011 sudhakar and vengadesan 2012 and flexible plates that are free to continuously deform along its length lee and you 2013 shukla et al 2013 are evaluated for their ability to reduce hydrodynamic forces and to suppress the primary vortex shedding the common feature for these splitter plates is the flow wake of the circular cylinder is continuously interfered with the motion or deformation of plates among them the flexible plates have the relatively ease of deployment according to the computational analysis of the vibration of a flexible plate behind a cylinder at a low reynolds number of 100 lee and you 2013 concluded that the plate length and the young s modulus and natural frequency of the plate determine the deflection shape and amplitude of the flexible plate and hence the adjustment of flow wake shukla et al 2013 experimentally observed a periodic traveling wave type deformation from the flexible splitter plate in the wake of a circular cylinder based on the particle image velocimetry piv visualization results yayla and teksin 2018 found that the shear layers were transported downstream by aid of the wave type deformed splitter plate abdi et al 2019 pointed out that small vortices are generated on the tip of flexible plate and the tip vortices either cut the cylinder vortex which has an opposite vorticity contributing to the separation and shedding of the vortex or get combined with the cylinder vortex which has the same rotational direction resulting in the enlargement of vortex wang et al 2018 numerically studied the flow induced vibration of a flexible plate located in the wake of a stationary circular cylinder and up to 0 958d amplitude was observed for the plate tip due to the vigorous oscillation of flexible plates the vortex formation length of circular cylinder is shortened in some conditions and thereby the diminishing of flow control the concerned circular cylinders are stationary in the aforementioned literature the effectiveness of splitter plates in viv suppression was examined numerically and experimentally in recent years huera huarte 2014 experimentally investigated the viv suppression of flexible cylinders with plastic plates a 90 reduction in the maximum amplitude as well as a 50 drag reduction was achieved by splitter plates that covered less than half of the cylinder span the similar experiments were carried out by lou et al 2016 and the better suppression effects were found in the cases of plate lengths l d 1 0 1 25 and 1 5 nevertheless in the experimental investigation of a circular cylinder fitted with solid and slotted splitter plates assi and bearman 2015 pointed out that the displacement of controlled cylinder monotonically increases with flow speed and becomes larger than the bare cylinder at higher reduced velocities due to the reattachment of the free shear layers on the tip of plates the same profile of vibration displacement was observed by wu et al 2014 in the viv simulations of a circular cylinder with a hinged flat plate assi et al 2009 categorized this kind of structure instability as galloping which is characterized by a large amplitude and a low frequency zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 galloping is commonly observed for a body with a non circular cross section owing to the continuous change in the attack angle between the moving body and incoming flow blevins 1990 the response of viv followed by galloping was found by liang et al 2018a law and jaiman 2017 and sahu et al 2019 in their numerical studies on the oscillation of a circular cylinder with a rigid flat plate liang et al 2018a reported that a full interaction of viv and galloping was generated for the cylinder with flat plates of l d 1 0 and 1 5 namely the onset of galloping shifted to a much smaller reduced velocity sahu et al 2019 also observed that the galloping appeared before the end of viv lock in branch for the cylinder with a flat plate of l d 1 5 to some extent the viv suppression effect may be guaranteed by increasing the onset reduced velocity of galloping additionally although the amplitude in viv branches got a certain reduction the lock in phenomenon still occurred with the introduction of flat plates law and jaiman 2017 sahu et al 2019 apart from the rigid flat plates the vibration suppression effect of flexible plates has been evaluated by several researchers balint and lucey 2005 numerically investigated the flow induced vibration of a flexible cantilevered plate and the plate was found to lose its stability in a flutter pattern yadykin et al 2003 found that the added mass decreased with the increase of the vibration mode of flexible plate contributing to the enhancement of vibration hua et al 2013 reported that flapping plate could promote the structure motion depending on the heaving amplitude and the bending rigidity of the flexible plate liang et al 2018b observed that the synchronized region was significantly broadened and severe galloping as well as higher harmonic components emerged when the cylinder was attached with a flexible splitter plate in general rigid flat plates can partly suppress the viv initial and lower branches in the cost of early appearance of galloping while the flapping and deformation of flexible plates result in much more violent vibration in some conditions a rigid wavy plate therefore is proposed in this work to avoid the uncontrolled vigorous deformation of flexible plate and to completely separate the viv and galloping the hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding behavior of the circular cylinder with a wavy plate at re 150 are investigated and compared first for five plate lengths l d 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and three wavelengths l w d 1 2 and 3 then a wavy plate possessing the good performance in drag and lift reduction and vortex shedding suppression is employed to control viv and the vibration response of controlled cylinder is examined in the reduced velocity range of 2 20 then the hydrodynamic coefficients response amplitude and frequency phase difference between the lift force and cross flow amplitude and flow wake structures are presented and discussed numerical results allow an improved understanding of the wake flow structure interaction which will be of great interest in offshore engineering such as subsea manifold jumper tube and umbilical cable installed or laid on the seabed under the similar low re flows 2 problem description as shown in fig 1 the rigid wavy plate is attached to the rear surface of a circular cylinder with its direction parallel to the free stream the thickness δ of the plate is fixed at 0 05d in all cases and the plate length l ranges from 1d to 3d which is recommended with respect to vortex shedding suppression in previous literature kwon and choi 1996 hwang et al 2003 akilli et al 2005 the wavy plate has a sinusoidal profile along the streamwise direction and the wavelength l w ranges from 1d to 3d with a fixed wave height h of 0 15d in the comparing simulations where the height of the wave plate is selected in consideration of the negative influence created by a higher waviness as the violent deformation of flexible plates wang et al 2018 hua et al 2013 liang et al 2018b abdi et al 2019 the shape of the wavy plate is expressed as 1 y x h 2 h 2 cos 2 π l w x d 2 where the origin of coordinates locates at the cylinder center and x and y are the in line and cross flow directions respectively the circular cylinder is elastically mounted with linear spring and damper and is free to oscillate in both in line and cross flow directions in the examined reduced velocity range of 2 20 the reduced velocity u r is defined as u in f n d where f n is the natural frequency of the structure the mass damping coefficient m ζ of the structure is 0 0372 the main parameters are summarized in table 1 a rectangular computational domain of 90d 60d is employed for the flow past the circular cylinder attached with a wavy plate the cylinder center is located at a distance of 30d from the upstream and the two lateral boundaries thus the blockage is smaller than 2 referring to fig 1 the boundary conditions are specified as follows at the inlet the velocity components in the streamwise and transverse directions are specified as u u in and v 0 respectively the slip wall boundary condition is imposed on the lateral boundaries and no slip boundary condition is imposed on the structure wall neumann boundary condition is applied at the outlet u x 0 and v y 0 3 computational model and method 3 1 governing equations and solution methodology as a low reynolds number of 150 is applied in this work two dimensional 2d numerical simulations are conducted using the open source cfd solver openfoam which is composed of c libraries solving the unsteady navier stokes ns equations with the finite volume discretization method fvdm and the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm the 2d incompressible unsteady navier stokes ns equations are expressed as 2 u x v y 0 3 u t u u x v u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 4 v t u v x v v y 1 ρ p y ν 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where x and y are the coordinates in in line and cross flow direction respectively u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions t is the flow time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and ν is the corresponding kinematic viscosity of fluid the second order upwind scheme and the gauss linear approach are used to deal with the convective and diffusion terms respectively amiraslanpour et al 2017 a blended scheme composed of the gauss linear approach and the first order euler implicit scheme is employed to handle the time derivative term due to the stability problem of the flow structure interaction jiang et al 2016 the flow induced vibration fiv of the controlled circular cylinder is triggered by the unsteady hydrodynamic forces exerted on its surface by the fluid flow where the hydrodynamic forces including the drag and lift forces are obtained from the integration of the pressure and shear stress on the structure surface after the flow field is computed the two degrees of freedom oscillating equations are expressed as 5 x 4 π f n ζ x 4 π 2 f n 2 x f d t m 6 y 4 π f n ζ y 4 π 2 f n 2 y f l t m where m is the mass of the structure x x and x are the in line acceleration velocity and displacement of the structure respectively while y y and y represent the same quantities associated with the cross flow oscillation ζ is the damping ratio f d t and f l t are the drag and lift forces respectively the sequential two way coupling method is employed in the simulations where the fluid flow around the cylinder and the dynamic response of the structure are solved alternately in each time step the flow field is computed first by solving the ns equations eqs 2 4 the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress exerted on the structure surface by the fluid flow then the hydrodynamic forces are substituted into eqs 5 and 6 to compute the vibration displacements of the cylinder by aid of the fourth order runge kutta method subsequently the computational mesh is updated according to the displacements of the structure preparing for the fluid flow calculation in the next time step the normalized time step for the flow solver is u in δt d 0 001 ensuring the courant friedrichs lewy number less than 0 5 in the entire computational domain the convergent criteria for iteration is set as that the residual in the control volume for each parameter is smaller than 10 5 and the calculation was running until sufficient periodic results were obtained for statistical analysis 3 2 computational mesh and mesh dependence check as shown in fig 1 a large circle enveloping the structure is used to divide the computational domain into two zones accompanying moving zone and dynamic zone the radius of the accompanying moving zone equals to 0 5d l 0 5d where the first 0 5d is the radius of the circular cylinder and the second 0 5d is the distance from the rear of the wavy plate the accompanying moving zone follows the movement of the structure and hence no requirement of mesh update while the mesh in the dynamic zone is updated in each time step as depicted in fig 2 the accompanying moving zone is divided by quadrilateral cells and the perimeter of the circular cylinder is equally discretized by 240 nodes the grid along the radial direction is denser near the cylinder surface with the height of the first layer grid 0 0042d y 0 1 and the cell expansion ratio of 1 05 the triangular cells are adopted in the dynamic zone for local re meshing and the cell expansion ratio is below 1 1 the grid independence test was conducted first for the freely oscillating circular cylinder with a wavy plate table 2 compares the computed important quantities for four different mesh resolutions where a x and a y are the normalized vibration amplitudes in the in line and cross flow directions respectively and c d and c l are the time averaged drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient respectively expressed as 7 c d 1 n i 1 n 2 f d t ρ u i n 2 d 8 c l 2 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 in which 9 c l 2 f l t ρ u i n 2 d 10 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i where n is the number of values in the time history for statistics c l and c l are the lift coefficient and its time averaged value it is seen that the percentage changes are reduced as the mesh resolution increases the mesh resolution implemented in m3 is used for the computations in this work since both hydrodynamic forces and vibration amplitudes are converged at this mesh resolution 3 3 model validation the computational approach used in this work is validated with several reported results wu et al 2014 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 bao et al 2011 for the viv of a bare circular cylinder at the same parameters m 2 ζ 0 and re 150 as shown in fig 3 the response curve presents three distinct branchs the initial branch ib the lower branch lb and the desynchronization branch db the absence of the upper branch observed by williamson and govardhan 2004 in medium reynolds numbers is attributed to the greater viscous force at a low re which has been confirmed in many previous studies zhu et al 2019 singh and mittal 2005 in the lower branch the maximum percentage difference is 8 56 as compared to the published data in bao et al 2011 whereas it is within 5 0 in comparison with other two literature the difference in response amplitudes is possibly attributed to the different numerical approaches the characteristic based split finite element method was employed in bao et al 2011 while the immersed boundary method was adopted in wu et al 2014 and borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 overall the present results are in consistent with the reported literature 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow control of a stationary circular cylinder with a wavy plate the flow control of a fixed circular cylinder with a wavy plate in five plate lengths l d 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and three wavelengths l w d 1 2 and 3 is examined first fig 4 compares the time mean drag coefficient c d and the time mean pressure coefficient c p along the cylinder surface for the equipped cylinder against the bare one the time mean drag coefficient of the bare cylinder c d 1 33 at re 150 is also plotted in fig 4 a as a black dashed line for comparison it is clearly seen that the all the cylinders fitted with wavy plates attain a significant drag reduction as compared to the bare cylinder and the drag reduction grows with increasing of the plate length the maximum drag reduction of 27 5 in comparison with the bare cylinder is achieved by attaching a wavy plate of l 3d in the rear stagnation point of the circular cylinder in contrast the wavelength of the plate has no apparent impact on the drag reduction it implies that the drag force mainly depends on the pressure distribution around the cylinder as shown in fig 4 b the pressure along the leeward surface of the circular cylinder is increased after the cylinder is attached with a wavy plate the longer the wavy plate the smaller the maximum value of c p it explains the profiles of the time mean drag coefficients in fig 4 a it is noted that the c p curve is discontinuous around θ 180 which is attributed to the presence of the wavy plate furthermore the cylinder surface pressure on both sides of the wavy plate is different resulting in a pressure jump at the attachment point it indicates the wavy surface of the rear plate alters the symmetric distribution of flow wake which is different from a flat plate the relatively large pressure along the upper surface of circular cylinder arises a downward force partly contributing to the negative time mean lift coefficient as depicted in fig 5 fig 5 shows the time averaged and fluctuation of lift coefficient c l and cl against the plate length l d both the c l and cl are computed from the integration of stresses over both the circular cylinder surface and the surface of wavy plate it is seen from fig 5 that the negative time mean lift coefficient emerges in all the cases of equipped cylinders the difference of the pressure distribution between the two sides of the wavy plate contributes to the non zero time mean lift coefficient compared to the upper side a relatively low pressure zone is generated below the connection point between the wavy plate and the circular cylinder due mainly to the downward curvature of the nearest surface of the wavy plate close to the cylinder base the time mean lift coefficient varies with the plate length and the wavelength while the change law is not apparent the combination effect of the vortex shedding from the cylinder surface the non uniform and asymmetric pressure distribution along the wavy plate and its interference to the flow wake may cause the irregular profile of c l by contrast the dependence of the fluctuation of lift coefficient on the plate length and the wavelength is obvious as the plate length increases the lift fluctuation is enlarged this is principally because the loading surface of the plate becomes larger with increasing of its length the fluctuation of lift coefficient at l w d 2 and l w d 3 keeps smaller than the corresponding value of bare cylinder in the range of l d 1 3 indicating a good performance in suppressing the lift amplitude the largest reduction of lift fluctuation is 54 9 attained by the 1 5d length plate with l w 3d comparatively the performance of the wavy plate with l w d 1 is lower than the former two moreover the lift fluctuation of the cylinder fitted with this small wavelength splitter plate l w d 1 even becomes larger than the associated value of the bare cylinder as the plate length increases to 2 5d it indicates that the small wavelength plate introduces greater interference into the flow wake and the longer the plate length the stronger the influence fig 6 plots the time histories of the lift coefficients for the cylinder fitted with a 1 5d length plate in three different wavelengths and the associated pressure coefficient distribution at two typical moments corresponding to c lmax and c lmin it more clearly displays the reduction of lift fluctuation and the negative time mean lift coefficient in comparison with the bare cylinder when the lift coefficient reaches its maximum value at t t 1 t u in t d the pressure on the lower surface of the wavy plate is higher than that on the upper surface explaining the upward lift force conversely the upper surface pressure is greater than the lower surface pressure at t t 2 corresponding to the minimum lift coefficient furthermore the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides at t t 2 is larger than that at t t 1 providing an interpretation for the negative time averaged lift coefficient it is worth noting that the pressure varies along the splitter plate length although the pressure generally increases from the cylinder base to the tip of plate it experiences some fluctuations caused by the wavy surface of the plate the smaller the wavelength of the plate the more obvious the pressure fluctuation on the plate surface this phenomenon was observed by lee and you 2013 and díaz ojeda et al 2019 in their investigations of flexible splitter plates it implies the rigid wavy plate plays the similar role on the wake adjustment as the flexible plates to have a better understanding of the influence of wavy undulation on the near wake dynamics of the cylinder with a 1 5d length plate the processes of vortex shedding and associated streamlines during one shedding period are illustrated in fig 7 for the case of l w d 1 at t 1 it can be seen that the flow separating from the upper surface of the cylinder generates a recirculating region above the wavy plate as indicated by the streamlines this region grows to a larger size at t 2 and its center arrives at the tip of plate after that it is split into two parts by a thickening local shear layer that enveloped the wavy plate with opposite sign as shown in the left column of fig 7 at instants t 3 and t 4 the shear layer at the rear tip of the plate shrinks when the upper vortex is shed into the wake at t 5 this process repeats symmetrically for the lower side the cases of l w d 2 and l w d 3 present the similar shedding process as l w d 1 whereas the former cases take longer to complete a cycle compared to the plates of l w d 2 and l w d 3 the more violent undulation of the plate l w d 1 causes the split of local shear layers along the plate surface introducing more perturbation into the shear layers of the cylinder and hence the earlier vortex shedding consequently the strohual number st becomes smaller with increasing l w d as shown in fig 8 the wavy plate prevents the interaction between the two shear layers from the cylinder surface forcing the vortices to form further downstream of the cylinder additionally a shear layer with counterclockwise vorticity is generated on the upper surface of the plate close to its rear tip and another shear layer with clockwise vorticity is created on the lower surface around the protrusion in contrast the two shear layers formed from the cylinder surface present the opposite vorticities the upper layer has clockwise vorticity and the lower one has counterclockwise vorticity on either side the plate s shear layer in opposite sense of rotation partly contributes to the elongation of the cylinder s shear layer it is seen that the shear layer dose not roll up until it crosses the plate rear edge this observation consists well with the numerical results of abdi et al 2017 2019 at l w d 1 the shear layer thickness along the wavy plate fluctuates relatively fiercely due to its more undulating surface this phenomenon becomes more obvious as the plate length increases the increasing variation of the plate s shear layer is the main reason for the increase of lift fluctuation as seen in fig 5 apart from the prolongation of shear layers the streamwise distance between two adjacent vortices is also increased after the cylinder is attached with a wavy plate although the wavy plate remarkably alters the flow wake the vortex shedding still presents the 2s pattern two vortices are shed per cycle one vortex clockwise and the other counterclockwise as the bare cylinder at this low reynolds number of 150 fig 9 compares the vortex shedding frequency f s of the cylinder fitted with a wavy plate in different lengths the corresponding frequency of the bare cylinder is also included for comparison it is clearly observed that the shedding frequency is decreased in the presence of wavy plate leading to the increase of the streamwise distance between shed vortices as the plate length increases the shedding frequency is generally reduced which is associated with the vortex formation length additionally more low frequency peaks emerge owing to the disturbance introduced by the wavy plate fig 10 shows the contours of the root mean square rms values of the streamwise velocity u rms u rms u for the cylinder fitted with a wavy plate there are two peaks of u rms symmetrically distributed about the wake centerline indicating the shear layer rolling positions on both sides the streamwise distance between the cylinder center and the shear layer rolling position is defined as the vortex formation length l f while the transverse distance between the two peaks of u rms is defined as the wake width w bai and alam 2018 zhu et al 2020b additionally the white curve in the panel represents the contour line of u 0 which is usually used to illustrate the streamwise length l r of the recirculation region and the separation point of boundary layer zhu et al 2019 compared to the bare cylinder the boundary layer separation points have no obvious movement after the installation of wavy plate while both the vortex formation length and the streamwise length of the recirculation region are elongated and the wake width is narrowed it illustrates that the wavy plate effectively suppress the vortex shedding of the circular cylinder there is a slight variation of l f l r and w as the wavelength of plate changes comparatively the dependence of l f and l r on the plate length is evident both l f and l r generally increase with increasing of plate length explaining the reduction of shedding frequency as seen in fig 9 at l w d 3 the wake width undergoes a fluctuation as the plate length increases although the fluctuation is below 0 16d it is mainly attributed to the variation of the angle between the plate tail and the flow direction on the base of comprehensive consideration of the drag and lift reduction and the vortex shedding suppression the 1 5d long wavy plate with l w d 3 is selected for the examination of viv control 4 2 vibration response of a circular cylinder with a wavy plate fig 11 a plots the time mean drag coefficient of the controlled cylinder against the reduced velocity in comparison with the bare cylinder the drag coefficient of the bare cylinder evidently depends on the reduced velocity experiencing a sharp rise followed by a decline as the reduced velocity increases from 2 to 7 when the reduced velocity is larger than 8 the variation of c d is negligible the largest time mean drag coefficient c d 2 029 occurs at u r 5 which coincides with the results reported by wu et al 2014 the profile of c d u r is well explained by the curves of pressure coefficient around the cylinder surface as shown in fig 11 b at u r 5 the lowest pressure on the leeward surface of circular cylinder leads to the largest drag force additionally the pressure coefficient shows no obvious variation at u r 8 resulting in the ignorable change of c d on the contrary the reduced velocity has little impact on the time mean drag coefficient of the controlled cylinder as the reduced velocity increases from 4 to 5 a slight increment of 4 6 appears for c d while the value is only 54 of the corresponding value of bare cylinder after that c d gradually decreases to the same level as the value at u r 4 as the reduced velocity further increases from 5 to 8 another small increment of c d occurs in the range of 8 u r 15 and then the variation becomes negligible at u r 15 the lower pressure coefficient at the cylinder base explains the greater drag force at higher reduced velocities u r 12 compared to the bare cylinder the time mean drag coefficient is significantly reduced with the introduction of a wavy plate in the whole reduced velocity range of 2 20 it is noted from fig 11 b that the pressure coefficient experiences a jump across the wavy plate this jump is relatively small at u r 3 and u r 5 while it becomes larger at u r 12 indicating the wavy plate alters the pressure distribution more significantly at higher reduced velocities this kind of alteration tightly affects the lift coefficient as shown in fig 12 a similar trend as c d is observed for c l of the bare cylinder the use of wavy plate leads to a reduction in c l in the range of 2 u r 8 while a significant growth in the range of 8 u r 20 as compared to the bare cylinder the variation of c l is associated with the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the structure as depicted in fig 12 b a great pressure difference appears in the surface of bare cylinder at u r 5 while the pressure difference is obviously reduced when the wavy plate is attached to the cylinder base and hence the reduction in c l conversely the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the controlled cylinder becomes larger than the corresponding value of bare cylinder at u r 9 mainly contributing to the increase of c l in addition the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the wavy plate also makes contribution to the variation of c l as shown in fig 12 c the blue lines marked in the snapshots of velocity vectors are the contours of u 0 it is seen that the shear layers from the circular cylinder reattach the tip of wavy plate at u r 5 and u r 9 and the recirculation region basically envelops the plate consequently the pressure difference between the two sides of the plate is relatively small in contrast the shear layers from the circular cylinder reattach on the wavy plate surface at u r 15 and u r 18 resulting in a greater pressure difference across the plate as the observation in assi and bearman 2015 assi et al 2009 and liang et al 2018a b this asymmetric and larger pressure difference partly contributes to the growth of c l for the equipped cylinder compared to the bare one fig 13 compares the response amplitude and frequency of the controlled cylinder to the bare one for the bare cylinder the response amplitudes including the in line il and cross flow cf amplitudes a x and a y which are normalized the cylinder diameter rise smoothly as u r increases from 2 to 4 and then grows sharply when u r continuously increases to 5 in the range of 2 u r 5 the cf and il response frequencies f x and f y which are normalized the natural frequency follow the lines of st 0 18 and 2st respectively where st is the strohual number according to the dependence of a and f on u r the initial branch ib of viv occurs at u r 5 for the bare cylinder as u r further increases to 8 the amplitudes decrease gradually while the frequencies are locked on f 1 and f 2 in the cf and il directions respectively these response features indicate the lower branch lb the response frequencies shift back to follow the profiles of st and 2 st at u r 8 and the corresponding variations in response amplitudes become negligible illustrating the desynchronization branch db when the cylinder is fitted with a wavy plate the response amplitudes are evidently reduced in the range of 2 u r 8 showing a good behavior in viv suppression the amplitude reduction up to 92 44 is achieved at u r 5 illustrating the advantage over flat splitter plates liang et al 2018a sahu et al 2019 although the variation of response amplitudes is slight the border between the ib and lb can be identified from the variation of response frequencies which show the same trend as the bare cylinder the notable difference appears at u r 8 where the amplitudes of the equipped cylinder monotonically increase with u r and the cf frequency becomes lower than the natural frequency but remains almost constant with u r these characteristics demonstrate the cylinder undergoes galloping with the presence of wavy plate the same phenomenon was observed in rigid flat plates assi et al 2009 liang et al 2018a b sahu et al 2019 as the axisymmetry of circular cylinder is destroyed by the wavy plate the change in orientation of the controlled cylinder with respect to incoming flow leads to the larger fluctuating force as seen in fig 12 exciting the galloping instability as galloping emerges after the lower branch of viv there is no interaction between them falling in the first type of viv galloping response proposed by mannini et al 2014 it indicates the full interaction between viv and galloping is vanished and the onset of galloping shifts to a higher reduced velocity nevertheless the cf amplitude reaches 1 115d at u r 20 2 14 times as large as the peak amplitude of viv indicating a great potential for energy harvesting the oscillation trajectories of the controlled cylinder are plotted in fig 14 as compared to the bare cylinder it is clearly seen that both the bare cylinder and the controlled cylinder oscillate in regular or irregular figure eight orbits indicating f x 2f y jauvtis and williamson 2004 gedikli and dah 2017 in general a regular figure eight orbital response is seen in the lower branch of the bare cylinder while the orbit of controlled cylinder evolves becomes more irregular as the reduced velocity increases in the galloping branch due mainly to the instability the phase difference between the lift force and the cf amplitude is plotted in fig 15 for the bare cylinder there is a phase jump around 180 as the response shifts from the ib to lb and then the phase angle remains around 180 in the db it coincides well with the previous reported results khalak and williamson 1999 jauvtis and williamson 2003 with the introduction of wavy plate the same phase jump occurs at the transition from ib to lb as the bare cylinder after that the phase angle returns to about 0 at u r 9 at which point the frequency passes through the natural frequency again and the response transfers from lb to gb similar observation has been reported by sahu et al 2019 in their numerical study on flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder with a rigid flat plate in consonance with previous literature assi and bearman 2015 the lift force and the motion of the structure are always in phase in gb resulting in the increase of vibration amplitude nevertheless assi and bearman 2015 have not observed any phase jump in the whole considered reduced velocity range for the cylinder with a rigid splitter plate the main reason is that the full interaction of viv and galloping occurs in their work where galloping takes the place of the lower branch of viv the instantaneous flow structures behind the controlled cylinder at two typical moments corresponding to a ymax and a ymin are depicted in fig 16 in comparison with the bare cylinder it is clearly seen that the 2s vortex shedding mode is the predominant pattern for the bare cylinder due mainly to the same natural frequencies in the two directions as reported by bao et al 2012 the vortex shedding evolves from one row structure into two row one as u r increases from 3 to 5 resulting in a wider wake as u r further increases the wake structure returns to one row configuration corresponding to the response transition from lb to db when the wavy plate is introduced the vortex structure at u r 5 retains the one row 2s mode as that at u r 3 illustrating the suppression of vortex shedding due to the prevention of communication between the two shear layers created from the cylinder the vortex formation length is significantly elongated in the presence of wavy plate nevertheless as the response transforms from lb to gb the flow wake is obviously altered it is seen that the shear layers separated from the cylinder surface alternately reattach on the plate surface and the tip of plate is immersed in the shear layers accordingly at u r 9 the plate tip cuts the shear layer and contributes to the formation of vortices this phenomenon becomes more evident as u r increases from 9 to 18 owing to the interference of wavy plate the vortex shedding evolves to p s mode a single vortex and a pair of opposite signed vortices released per cycle of shedding in gb the reattachment of shear layers on plate surface and the asymmetric vortex structure render the unstable fluid force and hence the fierce vibration liang et al 2018a b the comparison of the iso contours of root mean square streamwise velocities between the bare cylinder and the controlled cylinder is depicted in fig 17 it is seen that the wake width behind the bare cylinder is w 1 1403 at u r 5 while it is reduced to 1 0628 with the installation of the wavy plate additionally both the streamwise length of the recirculation region and the vortex formation length are significantly elongated as compared to the bare cylinder further demonstrating the viv suppression on the contrary the wake width becomes larger than that of bare cylinder as the response evolves from viv to galloping moreover the width of flow wake grows quickly with increasing of the reduced velocity indicating the wake instability 5 conclusions in this work the passive control effectiveness of a rigid wavy splitter plate attached to the rear stagnation point of a circular cylinder at low reynolds number of 150 is numerically investigated using two dimensional direct numerical simulation for the stationary circular cylinder both the mean drag and lift fluctuation are significantly reduced with the introduction of an attached rear wavy plate the maximum reductions for c d and cl are 27 5 and 54 9 respectively as the plate length increases the drag reduction increases due to the rise of base pressure while the lift fluctuation is enlarged because of the growing loading surface although the wavelength of plate has no obvious influence on the drag reduction the uneven surface renders the pressure fluctuation along the plate length and the variation of the plate s shear layer thickness affecting the lift fluctuation the shear layers of circular cylinder are evidently elongated with the installation of wavy plate resulting in the prolongation of vortex formation length and the decrease of shedding frequency the longer the plate the greater the performance in suppression of vortex shedding the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder attached by a 1 5d length wavy plate with wavelength of 3d is examined in reduced velocity range of u r 2 20 on one hand the wavy plate plays a positive role in suppressing viv in both the initial and lower branches the reduction in cross flow amplitude reaches 92 44 at u r 5 where the one row 2s vortex shedding mode is retained and the wake width is significantly reduced as compared to the bare cylinder on the other hand instead of the desynchronization branch the vigorous galloping is excited at u r 8 the shear layers from the cylinder surface alternately reattach on the surface of wavy plate making the plate tip reach into them by turns as a result the shear layers are cut and vortices are formed subsequently the p s shedding pattern is observed with a wider wake as the galloping emerges after the lower branch of viv the phase difference between the lift force and the cross flow amplitude experiences two jumps of around 180 corresponding to the response transition from the initial branch to the lower branch and then to the galloping credit authorship contribution statement

smaller than one the convergence criteria for all simulations is set as 10 6 fig 1 shows the overall schematic of the geometry and domain used for numerical simulation where a 457 mm is the width of the square cross section and b 1200 mm is the tunnel length the distance from the center of the rov to the inlet is 330 mm moreover different angles of the attack are created by rotating the models around the vertical axis yaw axis direction for the boundary conditions at the inlet a velocity inlet boundary condition is considered where a uniform velocity is assumed also the turbulent intensity i is considered to be 3 at the outlet boundary the outflow boundary condition is chosen in this boundary condition the normal gradient of all variables is zero the wall boundary condition is set for the surfaces around the channel and the rov device surfaces all velocity components have zero value due to the no slip condition on the wall 3 experimental setup in addition to the numerical simulation the experimental investigation is performed to examine the hydrodynamic performance of the rov 3 1 wind tunnel properties and calibration the present experimental study is conducted in a low speed wind tunnel including a test room with the 4 2 m length and the square cross section of 457 457 mm 2 see fig 2 the maximum wind tunnel speed is about 25 m s and the turbulence intensity of the free flow is less than 3 the wind tunnel has a centrifugal fan with forward inclined blades with low broadband and tonal noise signature the rov hydrodynamic forces are measured by a device called tq te81 including three components balance with measuring accuracy of 0 01 n and recording frequency of 100 hz the accuracy of the motor s controller is 3 to verify the wind tunnel performance at the first step a circular cross section cylinder is used and then the rov models are tested at the velocities of 5 10 15 and 20 m s according to the low values of velocities in this research the wind tunnel can be used to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of the flow around the rov 3 2 the rov models because of the wind tunnel s limitation the weight of the models must be less than 1 kg so the models were made from plexi by a 3d printer to achieve high precision fabrication the weight of the model is 200g by this procedure the rov model used in this research is a simplified of a real device the full scale and wind tunnel scale dimensions of the rov model are presented in table 1 in the present work the maximum velocity of the rov model is 20 m s according to table 1 this velocity is equal to 1 06 m s for the real rov device which is close to the maximum operating velocity of rov devices fig 3 shows the rov model the sharp edge model and the fillet edge model the working fluid is the air with the density of 1 25 kg m 3 and dynamic viscosity of 1 41 10 5 pa s the characteristic length in calculating the reynolds number is 110 8 mm in this work the hydrodynamic behavior of rov in different operating conditions is investigated by considering the various angles of attack in the range of 0 45 which is important to control the stability of these devices fig 4 displays the sample placement status in the wind tunnel the results are obtained in the four velocities of 5 10 15 and 20 for each model 3 3 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis expresses the measured data deviation rate from their real value if the variable of r is the function of multiple variables such as x 1 x 2 x n so that the uncertainty analysis is computed by the eq 12 moffat 1988 12 w r r x 1 w 1 r x 2 w 2 r x n w n the uncertainty values for the parameters of this investigation are presented in table 2 4 results and discussion in this section the numerical and experimental results are presented for the rov model sharp and fillet edge at different reynolds numbers 39291 78582 117872 and 157163 and different attack angles 0 45 4 1 numerical results controlling the size of cells near the rov is important in the grid generation accordingly the computational domain is divided into blocks to control the size of cells in the region that the velocity gradient is considerable due to the complex geometry of the rov it is complicated to build a structured grid around and on the rov surfaces as shown in figs 5 and 6 the grid generation around the models includes an unstructured grid with a tetrahedral cell near the model and a structured grid with quadrilateral cells elsewhere in the computational domain as shown in fig 6 the size of cells in the wake region of the rov is small due to the formation of vortexes the grid independence study is conducted for the rov at α 0 and r e 157163 in this study by changing the mesh elements qualities four different grids with the cell numbers of 792594 1811510 3975662 and 5794720 are generated the grid properties are listed in table 3 the mesh refinement results are presented in fig 7 when the mesh resolution is refined from 3 9 m million to 5 8 m of mesh cells the variations of the drag coefficient are significantly reduced therefore the grid with the cell number of 3 9 m is used for the rest of the simulations 4 1 1 reynolds number effect in this section the reynolds number effect on hydrodynamic characteristics is studied fig 8 shows the z direction vorticity contour around models for different reynolds numbers black for positive vorticity and white for negative vorticity the vorticity of rov device at the low and high re is ω z 701 s and ω z 3001 s for the fillet edge cubic is ω z 701 s and ω z 1501 s and for the sharp edge cubic is ω z 701 s and ω z 3001 s respectively it can be realized that the vorticity power for each model is increased by increasing the reynolds number in sharp edge and fillet edge cases that the positive and negative vortices are distributed symmetrically on the top and bottom of the model however for the sharp edge the vorticity contour is formed more widely around it so the vortex size is larger than the other models and causes an increase in the drag coefficient in the fillet edge model due to delaying in the flow separation the vorticity contour is smaller than the sharp edge model therefore the drag coefficient is expected to be lower than the sharp edge model in the rov model unlike the other two models vorticity contour is not symmetric and positive and negative vortices are combined therefore the rov drag coefficient is expected to be lower than the sharp edge model fig 9 shows the streamline contour around the models at xy and xz planes at α 0 a n d r e 78582 as expected the flow pattern in the sharp edge and fillet edge models is symmetric however the vortex length of the sharp edge model is greater than the vortex length of the fillet edge model and therefore will have a higher drag coefficient the streamlines around and in cavities of the rov model are irregular and asymmetric furthermore in addition to the vortex behind the sharp edge model vortices on its top and bottom surfaces increase the drag coefficient therefore the fillet edge drag coefficient is expected to be lower than the rov model the filleting of the edge reduces the size of the vortex in the fillet edge cube model compared to other models the rov model cavities have increased flow mixing and created larger vortices than the fillet edge model fig 10 shows the velocity magnitude in the centerline of the xy plane at α 0 a n d r e 157163 the length of the created vortices can be calculated the sharp edge model s vortex length is longer than the other models 0 22 m however for the fillet edge model in addition to the shorter vortex length the velocity behind the model has grown faster than the sharp edge model fig 11 displays the vorticity contour in the x direction ωx on the yz plane for all the models at zero angle of attack for the different reynolds numbers the complexity of the flow positive and negative vorticity and mixing the flow behind the models are observed as it is expected the strength of vortices which affects the hydrodynamic forces is increased by increasing the reynolds number fig 12 shows the turbulence kinetic energy k contour on the xy plane around the models at α 0 and r e 157163 the highest value of the turbulence kinetic energy was observed for the sharp edge rectangular cubic with respect to the other models especially in the region where flow separation has occurred and vortices have formed for the rov model the maximum value of k was observed at the front edge where the flow separation occurred the turbulence kinetic energy is transferred downstream and dissipated by viscous forces to compare the performance of the models the quantity of k can be compared the maximum value of k is related to the sharp edge because the viscous layer around the sharp edge model is the widest and its drag coefficient is the highest among the tested shapes to compare the turbulence kinetic energy of two sharp edge and fillet edge models the value of k is depicted on the centerline of the xy plane at α 0 and r e 78582 see fig 13 it can be seen that k value is higher for the sharp edge geometry indicating that its drag coefficient should be higher when compared to that of the fillet edge model fig 14 shows the pressure contour for all reynolds numbers at α 0 the pressure contour is almost symmetry for the top and bottom of the sharp edge and fillet edge cubic and it is expected that the lift coefficient does not increase significantly contrary to what is seen for the rov model also it can be predicted that the drag force is higher than the lift force the mean pressure difference on the front and back sides of the model creates a pressure drag which is the highest for the sharp edge model therefore one should expect the sharp edge model drag coefficient to be higher than the other models the lift and drag forces and coefficients results are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively as expected the drag force of the sharp edge cubic model is the highest when compared to the other models moreover all the drag forces increase with the reynolds number and the drag coefficient growth rate is the highest for the sharp edge cubic the lift force value for the sharp edge and the fillet edge cubic at α 0 is approximately insignificant because the pressure distribution of top and bottom of them is symmetry the lift force for the rov is the highest among all the models according to the dependency between hydrodynamic coefficients with velocity and forces it can be concluded that the lift coefficient for all models is negligible also the drag coefficient is reduced by increasing the reynolds number the drag coefficient of the rov and fillet edge devices does not change significantly by increasing the reynolds number the flow separation location does not depend on the reynolds number especially at the high reynolds number range sohankar 2006 the vortex region near the walls for the fillet edge cubic and the rov device is so smaller than for the sharp edge cubic and can be negligible hence the vortex zone does not change significantly with increasing the reynolds number for the rov device and fillet edge cubic so the drag coefficient of these models does not change significantly too as mentioned before according to fig 16 the drag coefficient of the fillet edge model is lower than the rov model in fact the effect of filleting the cube edges has greatly reduced the drag coefficient 4 1 2 angles of attack effect in fig 17 the pressure and x vorticity contours for the rov model at the angles of attack of 0 25 and 45 and r e 78582 are shown as the angle of attack changes the flow pattern is completely changed fig 18 and the pressure distribution will be different it can be concluded that as increasing the angle of attack the pressure difference between the two sides of the rov is increased and so the drag coefficient is enhanced numerical and experimental results confirm this hypothesis 4 2 the experimental results fig 19 and fig 20 show the experimental results for the lift and drag forces and coefficients for different reynolds numbers at α 0 in general the drag coefficient is decreased with increasing the reynolds number although such a decrease was not so significant for the rov model the lift coefficient is also close to zero for the models and can be ignored the experimental results of the drag coefficient at re 78582 and different angles of attack are presented in fig 21 the flow separation takes place in various locations at different angles of attack and causes an asymmetric pressure distribution around the rov and also increases the pressure difference on both sides of it the drag coefficient is boosted by increasing the angle of attack for all models and the largest values are related to the sharp edge cubic in the range of α 25 to 30 the changes in the drag coefficient of rov and fillet edge cubic are considerable at most angles of attack the drag coefficient of the fillet edge model is lower than the rov model fig 22 and fig 23 show the numerical and experimental drag and lift coefficients for the rov device respectively the relative error between the numerical and the experimental drag coefficient is in the range from 7 to 14 which can be related to the geometry complexity turbulence model and measurement instrument this range of difference is reasonable as well as that has been reported in the related researches jagadeesh et al 2009 and jagadeesh and murali 2010 5 conclusion in this paper numerical and experimental investigations were conducted to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the rov sharp edge and fillet edge rectangular cubic the 3d urans equations and the sst k ρ turbulence model were utilized to simulate the fluid flow for the reynolds number ranging from 39291 to 157163 and angle of attack ranging from 0 to 45 the numerical simulation results showed that the mean pressures on the top and bottom sides of all models are almost similar at different reynolds numbers whereas the mean pressure difference on the front and rear sides of all models is increased by enhancing the reynolds number hence the lift force for all models is insignificant and the drag force is boosted by increasing the reynolds number since the vortex region near the walls of both the rov device fillet edge cubic model does not change significantly at all the reynolds number and the drag coefficient is almost constant for both of them at all the reynolds numbers the flow separation location of the rov device

angle of attack mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 studied the effect of a free surface on drag and lift coefficients of the auv at various submergence depths and auv velocities numerically and experimentally they obtained the drag coefficient near the free surface is greater than those obtained at higher depths the hydrodynamic forces acting on an auv when operating close to a larger submarine were investigated by leong et al 2015 by numerical and experimental tests the results indicated that the maximum sway force exerting on the auv due to the presence of submarine occurs when the auv is located behind the nose of the larger moving vehicle the effect of two shapes of the bow on the hydrodynamic performance of the underwater vehicle at different froude numbers was

smaller than one the convergence criteria for all simulations is set as 10 6 fig 1 shows the overall schematic of the geometry and domain used for numerical simulation where a 457 mm is the width of the square cross section and b 1200 mm is the tunnel length the distance from the center of the rov to the inlet is 330 mm moreover different angles of the attack are created by rotating the models around the vertical axis yaw axis direction for the boundary conditions at the inlet a velocity inlet boundary condition is considered where a uniform velocity is assumed also the turbulent intensity i is considered to be 3 at the outlet boundary the outflow boundary condition is chosen in this boundary condition the normal gradient of all variables is zero the wall boundary condition is set for the surfaces around the channel and the rov device surfaces all velocity components have zero value due to the no slip condition on the wall 3 experimental setup in addition to the numerical simulation the experimental investigation is performed to examine the hydrodynamic performance of the rov 3 1 wind tunnel properties and calibration the present experimental study is conducted in a low speed wind tunnel including a test room with the 4 2 m length and the square cross section of 457 457 mm 2 see fig 2 the maximum wind tunnel speed is about 25 m s and the turbulence intensity of the free flow is less than 3 the wind tunnel has a centrifugal fan with forward inclined blades with low broadband and tonal noise signature the rov hydrodynamic forces are measured by a device called tq te81 including three components balance with measuring accuracy of 0 01 n and recording frequency of 100 hz the accuracy of the motor s controller is 3 to verify the wind tunnel performance at the first step a circular cross section cylinder is used and then the rov models are tested at the velocities of 5 10 15 and 20 m s according to the low values of velocities in this research the wind tunnel can be used to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of the flow around the rov 3 2 the rov models because of the wind tunnel s limitation the weight of the models must be less than 1 kg so the models were made from plexi by a 3d printer to achieve high precision fabrication the weight of the model is 200g by this procedure the rov model used in this research is a simplified of a real device the full scale and wind tunnel scale dimensions of the rov model are presented in table 1 in the present work the maximum velocity of the rov model is 20 m s according to table 1 this velocity is equal to 1 06 m s for the real rov device which is close to the maximum operating velocity of rov devices fig 3 shows the rov model the sharp edge model and the fillet edge model the working fluid is the air with the density of 1 25 kg m 3 and dynamic viscosity of 1 41 10 5 pa s the characteristic length in calculating the reynolds number is 110 8 mm in this work the hydrodynamic behavior of rov in different operating conditions is investigated by considering the various angles of attack in the range of 0 45 which is important to control the stability of these devices fig 4 displays the sample placement status in the wind tunnel the results are obtained in the four velocities of 5 10 15 and 20 for each model 3 3 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis expresses the measured data deviation rate from their real value if the variable of r is the function of multiple variables such as x 1 x 2 x n so that the uncertainty analysis is computed by the eq 12 moffat 1988 12 w r r x 1 w 1 r x 2 w 2 r x n w n the uncertainty values for the parameters of this investigation are presented in table 2 4 results and discussion in this section the numerical and experimental results are presented for the rov model sharp and fillet edge at different reynolds numbers 39291 78582 117872 and 157163 and different attack angles 0 45 4 1 numerical results controlling the size of cells near the rov is important in the grid generation accordingly the computational domain is divided into blocks to control the size of cells in the region that the velocity gradient is considerable due to the complex geometry of the rov it is complicated to build a structured grid around and on the rov surfaces as shown in figs 5 and 6 the grid generation around the models includes an unstructured grid with a tetrahedral cell near the model and a structured grid with quadrilateral cells elsewhere in the computational domain as shown in fig 6 the size of cells in the wake region of the rov is small due to the formation of vortexes the grid independence study is conducted for the rov at α 0 and r e 157163 in this study by changing the mesh elements qualities four different grids with the cell numbers of 792594 1811510 3975662 and 5794720 are generated the grid properties are listed in table 3 the mesh refinement results are presented in fig 7 when the mesh resolution is refined from 3 9 m million to 5 8 m of mesh cells the variations of the drag coefficient are significantly reduced therefore the grid with the cell number of 3 9 m is used for the rest of the simulations 4 1 1 reynolds number effect in this section the reynolds number effect on hydrodynamic characteristics is studied fig 8 shows the z direction vorticity contour around models for different reynolds numbers black for positive vorticity and white for negative vorticity the vorticity of rov device at the low and high re is ω z 701 s and ω z 3001 s for the fillet edge cubic is ω z 701 s and ω z 1501 s and for the sharp edge cubic is ω z 701 s and ω z 3001 s respectively it can be realized that the vorticity power for each model is increased by increasing the reynolds number in sharp edge and fillet edge cases that the positive and negative vortices are distributed symmetrically on the top and bottom of the model however for the sharp edge the vorticity contour is formed more widely around it so the vortex size is larger than the other models and causes an increase in the drag coefficient in the fillet edge model due to delaying in the flow separation the vorticity contour is smaller than the sharp edge model therefore the drag coefficient is expected to be lower than the sharp edge model in the rov model unlike the other two models vorticity contour is not symmetric and positive and negative vortices are combined therefore the rov drag coefficient is expected to be lower than the sharp edge model fig 9 shows the streamline contour around the models at xy and xz planes at α 0 a n d r e 78582 as expected the flow pattern in the sharp edge and fillet edge models is symmetric however the vortex length of the sharp edge model is greater than the vortex length of the fillet edge model and therefore will have a higher drag coefficient the streamlines around and in cavities of the rov model are irregular and asymmetric furthermore in addition to the vortex behind the sharp edge model vortices on its top and bottom surfaces increase the drag coefficient therefore the fillet edge drag coefficient is expected to be lower than the rov model the filleting of the edge reduces the size of the vortex in the fillet edge cube model compared to other models the rov model cavities have increased flow mixing and created larger vortices than the fillet edge model fig 10 shows the velocity magnitude in the centerline of the xy plane at α 0 a n d r e 157163 the length of the created vortices can be calculated the sharp edge model s vortex length is longer than the other models 0 22 m however for the fillet edge model in addition to the shorter vortex length the velocity behind the model has grown faster than the sharp edge model fig 11 displays the vorticity contour in the x direction ωx on the yz plane for all the models at zero angle of attack for the different reynolds numbers the complexity of the flow positive and negative vorticity and mixing the flow behind the models are observed as it is expected the strength of vortices which affects the hydrodynamic forces is increased by increasing the reynolds number fig 12 shows the turbulence kinetic energy k contour on the xy plane around the models at α 0 and r e 157163 the highest value of the turbulence kinetic energy was observed for the sharp edge rectangular cubic with respect to the other models especially in the region where flow separation has occurred and vortices have formed for the rov model the maximum value of k was observed at the front edge where the flow separation occurred the turbulence kinetic energy is transferred downstream and dissipated by viscous forces to compare the performance of the models the quantity of k can be compared the maximum value of k is related to the sharp edge because the viscous layer around the sharp edge model is the widest and its drag coefficient is the highest among the tested shapes to compare the turbulence kinetic energy of two sharp edge and fillet edge models the value of k is depicted on the centerline of the xy plane at α 0 and r e 78582 see fig 13 it can be seen that k value is higher for the sharp edge geometry indicating that its drag coefficient should be higher when compared to that of the fillet edge model fig 14 shows the pressure contour for all reynolds numbers at α 0 the pressure contour is almost symmetry for the top and bottom of the sharp edge and fillet edge cubic and it is expected that the lift coefficient does not increase significantly contrary to what is seen for the rov model also it can be predicted that the drag force is higher than the lift force the mean pressure difference on the front and back sides of the model creates a pressure drag which is the highest for the sharp edge model therefore one should expect the sharp edge model drag coefficient to be higher than the other models the lift and drag forces and coefficients results are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively as expected the drag force of the sharp edge cubic model is the highest when compared to the other models moreover all the drag forces increase with the reynolds number and the drag coefficient growth rate is the highest for the sharp edge cubic the lift force value for the sharp edge and the fillet edge cubic at α 0 is approximately insignificant because the pressure distribution of top and bottom of them is symmetry the lift force for the rov is the highest among all the models according to the dependency between hydrodynamic coefficients with velocity and forces it can be concluded that the lift coefficient for all models is negligible also the drag coefficient is reduced by increasing the reynolds number the drag coefficient of the rov and fillet edge devices does not change significantly by increasing the reynolds number the flow separation location does not depend on the reynolds number especially at the high reynolds number range sohankar 2006 the vortex region near the walls for the fillet edge cubic and the rov device is so smaller than for the sharp edge cubic and can be negligible hence the vortex zone does not change significantly with increasing the reynolds number for the rov device and fillet edge cubic so the drag coefficient of these models does not change significantly too as mentioned before according to fig 16 the drag coefficient of the fillet edge model is lower than the rov model in fact the effect of filleting the cube edges has greatly reduced the drag coefficient 4 1 2 angles of attack effect in fig 17 the pressure and x vorticity contours for the rov model at the angles of attack of 0 25 and 45 and r e 78582 are shown as the angle of attack changes the flow pattern is completely changed fig 18 and the pressure distribution will be different it can be concluded that as increasing the angle of attack the pressure difference between the two sides of the rov is increased and so the drag coefficient is enhanced numerical and experimental results confirm this hypothesis 4 2 the experimental results fig 19 and fig 20 show the experimental results for the lift and drag forces and coefficients for different reynolds numbers at α 0 in general the drag coefficient is decreased with increasing the reynolds number although such a decrease was not so significant for the rov model the lift coefficient is also close to zero for the models and can be ignored the experimental results of the drag coefficient at re 78582 and different angles of attack are presented in fig 21 the flow separation takes place in various locations at different angles of attack and causes an asymmetric pressure distribution around the rov and also increases the pressure difference on both sides of it the drag coefficient is boosted by increasing the angle of attack for all models and the largest values are related to the sharp edge cubic in the range of α 25 to 30 the changes in the drag coefficient of rov and fillet edge cubic are considerable at most angles of attack the drag coefficient of the fillet edge model is lower than the rov model fig 22 and fig 23 show the numerical and experimental drag and lift coefficients for the rov device respectively the relative error between the numerical and the experimental drag coefficient is in the range from 7 to 14 which can be related to the geometry complexity turbulence model and measurement instrument this range of difference is reasonable as well as that has been reported in the related researches jagadeesh et al 2009 and jagadeesh and murali 2010 5 conclusion in this paper numerical and experimental investigations were conducted to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the rov sharp edge and fillet edge rectangular cubic the 3d urans equations and the sst k ρ turbulence model were utilized to simulate the fluid flow for the reynolds number ranging from 39291 to 157163 and angle of attack ranging from 0 to 45 the numerical simulation results showed that the mean pressures on the top and bottom sides of all models are almost similar at different reynolds numbers whereas the mean pressure difference on the front and rear sides of all models is increased by enhancing the reynolds number hence the lift force for all models is insignificant and the drag force is boosted by increasing the reynolds number since the vortex region near the walls of both the rov device fillet edge cubic

21692,large diameter monopiles are the most commonly used foundation to support offshore wind turbines early designs usually adopted pile diameters d between 4 and 6 m which is recently extended to 8 m and will target 10 m in the future it is increasingly evident that the existing design method i e api s p y model can significantly under predict the lateral stiffness and capacity of large diameter monopiles in soft clay due to ignoring the soil resistances from base shear and base moment which become more pronounces as l d reduces in this study a two spring approach is proposed aiming to predict the lateral behaviour of monopiles with varied l d ratios in a unified manner in light of the soil flow mechanisms around monopiles the pure lateral soil resistance above the rotation point rp is quantified using a p y model while the resistances below the rp including the base shear and base moment are integrated into a moment rotation spring characterized by a m r θ r model at the rp it can naturally recover to a p y model while analyzing flexible piles where θ r 0 at rp formulations of the p y m r θ r model including diameter related p y and m r θ r models and the depth of the rp are proposed based on the results of a series of well calibrated 3d numerical models the proposed model has satisfactorily reproduced a number of field and centrifuge test results on laterally loaded monopiles with a wide range of l d ratios including flexible semi rigid and rigid piles using a unified set of parameters compared to the standard p y model the adoption of the proposed p y m r θ r model is shown to substantially reduce design conservatism keywords monopile soft clay p y reaction model base reaction model length to diameter ratio finite element analysis 1 introduction monopiles are the most commonly adopted foundation for supporting offshore wind turbines owts zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 2019 accounting for more than 80 of the readily installed owts ewea 2016 due to the extreme environmental loads and increasing turbine sizes early designs usually adopted pile diameters d between 4 and 6 m leblanc et al 2010 negro et al 2017 stone et al 2018 with recent designs extending to 8 m byrne et al 2017 zhang and andersen 2019 achmus et al 2019 and future designs exceeding 10 m shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 byrne et al 2017 the embedded pile length to diameter ratio l d of a monopile is typically in the range of 4 8 doherty and gavin 2012 qi et al 2016 murphy et al 2018 with future designs anticipating l d ratios of 3 or smaller for super large monopiles murphy et al 2018 the design for a laterally loaded monopile which is mainly concerned with the initial stiffness and the ultimate capacity is typically based on the winkler approach 1867 in conjunction with p y models api 2014 dnvgl 2016 the original p y curves were deduced from the field tests on long slender piles with d 0 324 m and l d 39 matlock 1970 and have been widely used for the design of slender piles supporting offshore oil and gas platforms for decades in recent years attempts have been made to apply these p y models for the design of monopiles supporting offshore wind turbines which have larger d and much smaller l d ratios than the slender piles for offshore oil and gas structures it becomes increasingly evident that the original p y curves are insufficient to capture large diameter monopiles with varied l d ratios due to the significant deviation of the geometries of the monopiles from those adopted in the early calibration field tests stevens and audibert 1979 lam and martin 1986 jeanjean 2009 madabhushi and haiderali 2013 achmus and thieken 2016 finn and dowling 2016 wang et al 2015 lau 2015 he 2016 hong et al 2017a byrne et al 2017 zhang and andersen 2019 for this reason the recent edition of the dnvgl 2016 guideline has been updated to suggest that any method used for monopile design should be validated by other means such as finite element analyses it is also worth noting that the track records of success using the existing design guidelines api 2014 dnvgl 2016 are mainly proven in the design of monopiles in european wind farms where overconsolidated stiff clay or dense sand are usually encountered lau 2015 wang et al 2018 these guidelines do not appear to be very suitable for designing monopiles in normally consolidated clay zhu et al 2017 as widely deposited in offshore china cai et al 2010 di et al 2013 nan et al 2018 given the research gaps identified above this study aims to develop a unified lateral soil reaction model for monopiles in soft clay with consideration of various length to diameter l d ratios in the following the soil flow mechanisms around monopiles with varied l d ratios in conjunction with some existing mechanism based conceptual explicit models are reviewed with their merits and potential demerits highlighted the lessons learned from the review has led to the development of a new hybrid p y m r θ r approach that is capable of predicting lateral behaviour of monopiles with varied l d ratios using a unified set of parameters the validity of the unified model is justified against a number of field and centrifuge model tests in soft clay embedded with monopiles which cover a broad range of l d ratios 2 soil flow mechanisms around monopiles and the existing mechanism based soil pile interaction models a review the previous centrifuge and numerical analyses have revealed that the l d ratio of a monopile controlling the relative soil pile stiffness plays an important role in determining its nearby soil flow mechanisms and thus the modes of soil pile interaction hong et al 2017a lai et al 2019 fig 1 a and b and 1 c show the soil flow mechanism and lateral displacement profile of a typical flexible pile l d 30 a semi rigid pile l d 8 and a rigid pile l d 4 respectively lai et al 2019 which were computed by well calibrated 3d numerical models while fig 2 illustrates the measured soil flow mechanisms around a semi rigid pile in soft clay as quantified through the particle image velocimetry technique piv in half model centrifuge tests hong et al 2017a for the flexible pile l d 30 see fig 1 a the soil flow mechanisms are composed of wedge type flow near the ground surface and full flow below the wedge with zero pile deflection and rotation at the pile base under this circumstance the lateral load imposed on the pile head is mostly resisted by mobilizing the lateral soil resistance in the wedge and full flow zones as the l d ratio of the pile reduces the piles behave as semi rigid or rigid piles fig 1 a and b and fig 2 which do not only bend but also rotates with a distinct pile toe kick an additional flow mechanism namely rotational flow near the lower half of the piles see fig 1 a and b and fig 2 is thus involved in the semi rigid or rigid piles in other words the lateral load imposed to the semi rigid or rigid piles is not only resisted by the lateral soil resistance near its upper half but also by a rotational moment near its lower half with contributions from base shear base moment and rotational soil flow this explains the inadequacy of the api 2014 s approach to capture the lateral behaviour of monopiles with small l d ratios due to the ignorance of the latter mechanism gerolymos and gazetas 2006 lam 2009 gao et al 2015 byrne et al 2017 2019a 2019b mcadam et al 2019 taborda et al 2019 zdravković et al 2019 to better predict the lateral behaviour of monopiles with relatively small l d ratios i e semi rigid or rigid piles a number of improved soil pile interaction models have been proposed over the last decades most of these models were proposed based on semi empirical approaches by adding some lump sum factors into the p y curves stevens and audibert 1979 o neill and gazioglu 1984 lau 2015 hong et al 2017a without explicitly consider the contributions from the base shear base moment and vertical shaft shear stress these semi empirical approaches have worked well case specifically but would probably not be able to predict lateral behaviour of piles with a wide range of l d in a unified manner in view of the limitation stated above mechanism based soil pile interaction models were recently reported by byrne et al 2017 2019a and zhang and andersen 2019 which explicitly consider the resistances from the pile base compared to the traditional one kind spring p y model see fig 3 a byrne et al 2017 2019a s four spring conceptual framework as elaborated in fig 3 b comprehensively considers all the four components resisting a laterally loaded monopile namely i lateral soil resistance p y springs ii base shear s b y b spring iii base moment m b θ b spring and iv vertical shaft shear stress m p θ p springs however the four spring model should be calibrated using a set of bespoke 3d finite element analyses of monopile performance for pile characteristics and loading conditions that span a predefined design space byrne et al 2019a on the other hand zhang and andersen 2019 s two spring model as shown in fig 3 c accounts for two components resisting a laterally loaded monopile including i lateral soil resistance p y springs and ii base shear s b y b spring for the ease of practical design the equations of these springs are intended to be linked to the elemental stress strain response of the soil zhang et al 2016 zhang and andersen 2017 the resistance due to the base moment which could also be an important resistance component as quantified in sub section 4 4 is ignored in the two spring model due to this omission the two spring model is likely to under predict the lateral pile stiffness and capacity 3 a new conceptual framework for unified modelling of monopiles with varied l d based on the merits and potential demerits of the existing models this study proposes a new two spring model i e p y m r θ r model as shown in fig 4 it considers the three most important components resisting a laterally loaded monopile namely i lateral soil resistance ii base shear and iii base moment above the rotation point the lateral soil resistance is modelled by distributed lateral translational springs p y springs as routinely practiced while the overall resistances at and below the rotation point including the contributions from the rotational soil flow as evident numerically and experimentally see figs 1 and 2 base shear and base moment are integrated into a concentrated rotational spring m r θ r spring at the rotation point the rotation point which involves a pure rotation with little lateral displacement randolph and gourvenec 2011 zhang and ahmari 2011 lau 2015 is usually located within a narrow range of depth z 0 75 0 80l achmus et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 ahmed and hawlader 2016 he 2016 truong and lehane 2017 murphy et al 2018 the well defined boundary conditions and location of the rotation point bring convenience for constructing the p y m r θ r model for unified modelling on flexible semi rigid and rigid piles the proposed p y m r θ r model is anticipated to remain the flexibility of adjusting the relative contribution of p y and m r θ r depending on l d ratios for example the p y m r θ r model should naturally recover to the conventional p y model while analysing a flexible pile the detailed formulations for the p y and the m r θ r springs including the depth of the rotation point are proposed based on a series of well calibrated finite element analyses which simulate piles with a broad range of l d in soft clay the numerical analysis and the formulation of the p y m r θ r model are presented in the following two sections 4 quantifying effect of l d ratio on lateral response of monopiles in soft clay 3d numerical parametric study 4 1 objective and program this section aims to quantify the lateral behaviour of piles with varied length to diameter ratios i e l d in soft clay through a series of numerical parametric study using a well calibrated hypoplastic clay model the computed results are to form the bases for formulating the proposed p y m r θ r model which is mainly concerned with the p y relation above the rotation point m r θ r relation at the rotation point and the depth of the rotation point a wide range of l d between 3 and 30 is considered in the numerical parametric study where l is constantly taken as 30 m with the pile diameter d varying between 1 and 10 m the pile wall thickness t was determined based on the following equation recommended by the api 2014 code 1 t 0 00635 d 100 table 1 summarizes the program for the numerical parametric study three different values of load eccentricity above the mudline h 2d 4d and 7d are considered the two spring model and model parameters were derived based on the analyses with h 2d and used to predict the lateral behavior of the piles with h 4d and 7d aiming to check the applicability of the proposed p y m r θ r model for piles with varying load eccentricity the parameters of malaysia kaolin which has been well characterized and is widely used in geotechnical model tests ilyas et al 2004 xie et al 2012 hong et al 2017b 2019 zhu et al 2018 was adopted in each analysis table 1 also includes the relative pile soil stiffness e p i p e s l 4 poulos and hull 1989 e s denotes the soil modulus at middle pile depth which is equal to 400 times of s u for malaysia kaolin lai et al 2019 2020 as can be seen in the table the piles with d between 1 and 2 3 6 and 7 10 m tend to behave as flexible semi rigid and rigid piles respectively 4 2 finite element mesh and boundary conditions each numerical analysis is performed in the finite element program abaqus fig 5 shows an isometric view of a typical finite element mesh which contains a pile with d 6 m and l d 5 by taking advantage of symmetry only half of the pile model was modelled for computational efficiency to minimize the boundary effect the diameter of the cylindrical computation domain and the distance from the pile base to the bottom boundary were chosen to be 20d and 5d respectively chen and poulos 1993 each lateral boundary and the bottom boundary of the finite element mesh is constrained by roller and pinned supports respectively the suitability of the mesh density is justified by halving the current size of the mesh and running one more analysis the computed load displacement response from the analyses with the two mesh sizes differs by no more than 3 confirming the validity of the mesh size adopted in the present study the clay and the pile are modelled using eight node brick with pore pressure c3d8p elements and eight node brick c3d8 elements respectively the interface shear behaviour between the pile and the soil is modelled based on the coulomb friction law where the tangential frictional stress is linearly proportional to the normal stress the interface frictional coefficient μ 0 31 was adopted in this study following randolph and wroth 1981 4 3 constitutive model and model parameters an advanced hypoplastic clay model with consideration of small strain stiffness mašín 2005 which has been calibrated against centrifuge tests on a lateral pile in kaolin hong et al 2017a he et al 2019 is adopted for this numerical parametric study the hypoplastic model formulates the nonlinear stress strain behaviour of soil based on the combination of a linear and a non linear term as follows wu and kolymbas 1990 wu et al 1996 gudehus 1996 2 t f s l d f a n d where t and d represent the objective stress rate and the euler stretching tensor respectively l and n are fourth and second order constitutive tensors and f s and f d are two scale factors more details of each term in eq 2 are given in mašín 2005 2014 the strength anisotropy is considered in the model which follows matsuoka and nakai 1974 failure criterion the non linearity of soil stiffness at small strains which governs the initial stiffness of laterally loaded pile is considered in the hypoplastic model with the aid of the intergranular strain concept niemunis and herle 1997 the model consists of eleven parameters five of these parameters i e ϕ c n λ κ and ν are identical or similar to those defined in the cam clay based models wang et al 2016 hong et al 2020 parameters n λ and κ define the position of the isotropic virgin compression slope of the isotropic virgin compression and the slope of the unloading line in the ln 1 e ln p plane e void ratio and p mean effective stress respectively the parameter ν controls the proportion of bulk and shear stiffness in addition to the five basic model parameters there are six parameters controlling the non linearity of small strain stiffness i e r m rat β r χ a g and n g the parameter r denotes the size of the elastic range the parameter m rat controls the very small strain behaviour upon strain path reversals the parameters β r and χ control the rate of stiffness degradation the remaining parameters a g and n g influence the initial shear modulus through the equation wroth and houlsby 1985 3a g 0 p r a g p p r n g where p r is a reference pressure of 1 kpa these parameters for kaolin clay have been calibrated against triaxial tests hong et al 2017b 2019 and centrifuge model tests on laterally loaded piles in kaolin hong et al 2017a he et al 2019 as summarized in table 2 normally consolidated clay is modelled in each analysis of this study where the undrained shear strength being a function of void ratio increases with depth 4 4 computed lateral load displacement response of piles with varying l d fig 6 a and b and 6 c show the computed by 3d fea load displacement response at the head of a flexible d 2 m l d 15 semi rigid d 4 m l d 7 5 and rigid pile d 10 m l d 3 respectively each figure also includes the calculated load displacement response at the pile head via beam on elastic foundation analyses using api 2014 s p y curves and using the p y relations extracted from the three piles in 3d fea analysis as shown in each figure the lateral load of each pile increases with head displacement but at a decreasing rate with the load displacement curve eventually reaching a plateau the lateral load at the plateau is defined as the ultimate lateral pile capacity f u in this study lau 2015 truong and lehane 2017 it can be seen from fig 6 a that for the flexible pile l d 15 the adoption of api 2014 s p y curves underestimates the lateral stiffness and the ultimate lateral pile capacity compared to the computed lateral pile load displacement curves from 3d fea similar observations were also made by jeanjean 2009 zakeri et al 2016 and truong and lehane 2017 with the increase of pile diameter i e reducing l d the underestimation of lateral pile stiffness and capacity by api 2014 becomes more pronounced as shown in fig 6 b and c in particular the analysis based on api 2014 has underestimated the lateral pile capacity of the monopile with l d 3 fig 6 c is by 152 implying the current design practice may be over conservative for rigid piles based on the p y curves extracted from the piles in the 3d fea the beam on elastic foundation analysis calculates almost the same load displacement curve for the flexible pile l d 15 this is anticipated because the lateral load applied to the head of a flexible pile is almost resisted by the lateral resistance of soil characterized by p y curves for the semi rigid pile l d 7 5 and the rigid pile l d 3 however the calculated load displacement relationship using the p y curves extracted from the 3d fea underestimates the computed response the degree of the underestimation increases with the pile diameter i e reducing l d this is because the lateral load imposed to the semi rigid or rigid piles is not only taken by the lateral soil resistance but also the base shear base moment and vertical shaft stress which cannot be captured with sole consideration of p y curves quantitatively it can be seen from fig 6 c that the base shear base moment and vertical shaft shear stress contribute to approximately 25 of the ultimate lateral capacity for the monopile with l d 3 the contribution of the base shear base moment and vertical shaft shear stress to the afore mentioned flexible semi rigid and rigid piles are quantified based on the 3d fea results as shown in fig 7 as anticipated the contribution of the three resistance components increases with a decrease in l d among these resistance components the base shear shows the greatest contribution to the ultimate lateral pile capacity up to 13 followed by the base moment up to 8 while the contribution of the vertical shaft shear stress smaller than 5 appears to be marginal and may be ignored these observations suggest that the two spring model proposed by zhang and andersen 2019 which considers the lateral soil resistance and base shear may be further improved by accounting for the contribution from the base moment in this study the combined effects of the base shear and base moment are integrated into one single spring of m r θ r while the lateral soil resistance is still quantified using the p y curves the proposed p y m r θ r model is formulated in the following section by generalizing the computed lateral responses of piles with varying pile geometries 5 proposed p y m r θ r approach 5 1 generalizing p y curves this section aims to generalize a unified p y formulation that is able to capture the lateral behaviour of piles with varied pile diameters using a single set of parameters based on the computed p y curves via the 3d fea for this purpose the p y curves of all the ten piles i e d 1 10 m were extracted fig 8 a shows the typical computed p y curves at the shallow depths which cover the region of wedge or full flow types of soil flow mechanisms of the typical piles with d 2 4 5 6 8 and 10 m as illustrated in different colours the lateral soil resistance p was normalised by the ultimate lateral soil resistance p u while the lateral pile displacement y was normalised by the pile diameter d the normalised api p y curve is also plotted in the figure for comparison it can be seen that for each pile the p y curves at different depths of pile embedded within the region of wedge or full flow types of soil flow mechanisms are largely similar while for piles with varied pile diameters the increase of the pile diameter has led to a higher initial stiffness and smaller lateral displacement for reaching p u these trends are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the previous experimental and numerical investigations carter 1984 ling 1988 jeong et al 2011 he 2016 futai et al 2018 the figure also shows the normalised api 2014 p y curve which does not consider the effect of pile diameter predicts a softer behaviour than all the piles ranging from flexible to rigid piles simulated in this study this has necessitated the development of new p y formulation which considers the effect of pile diameter attempts were made to fit the computed p y curves see fig 8 a with three functions that typically for this purpose i e parabolic function matlock 1970 hyperbolic function georgiadis et al 1992 dewaikar and patil 2006 and hyperbolic tangent function gabr et al 1994 jeanjean 2009 truong and lehane 2017 among the three choices the hyperbolic tangent function shown in eq 3 best captures all the computed p y curves see fig 8 b and is thus adopted for the p y formulation in this study 3b p p u tanh a y d b where a and b are two fitting parameters it is found that the values of a and b for all the piles considered in this study are well correlated to the pile diameter d through a quadratic polynomial as shown in fig 9 a and formulated in eq 4 and a linear relationship as shown in fig 9 b and formulated in eq 5 respectively 4 a 0 25 d d ref 2 0 23 d d ref 7 15 5 b 0 017 d d ref 0 53 where d ref is a reference pile diameter of 1 m after determining the functional form of the p y curves with consideration of pile geometry see eqs 3 5 the remaining issue is concerned with the value of ultimate soil resistance p u which can be calculated by 6 p u n p s u d fig 10 shows the computed distributions of the lateral bearing capacity factor n p of each pile within shallow depth where the wedge and full flow types of mechanisms are involved i e the depth relevant to the p y curves in the figure the n p distributions recommended by api 2014 stevens and audibert 1979 jeanjean 2009 and truong and lehane 2017 are also included for comparison the equations for these n p distributions are summarized in table 3 it can be seen that the computed distribution of n p for piles with varied diameters broadly merge into a single trend because of identical soil flow mechanisms involved in the piles and depths of interests i e wedge or full flow mechanism among the exiting approaches which all appear to broadly capture the computed n p distribution with depth jeanjean 2009 s equation offers the best prediction and is thus adopted in the proposed p y formulation see eq 3 it can also be seen from figs 9 and 10 that a single set of parameters including a and b featuring the shape of p y and n p describing the ultimate soil resistance can satisfactorily describe the p y curves of piles with varying load eccentricity h 2d to 7d in a unified manner it is also found by zhu et al 2018 through a numerical study that the p y curves of a pile in soft clay were merely altered by a significant variation of h between 20 and 35d 5 2 determination of rotation point in addition to the p y formulation another key element of the proposed p y m r θ r model is the depth of the rotation point or the point with minimum lateral displacement where the m r θ r spring is located fig 11 shows the change of the depth of the rotation point normalised by pile embedded depth l with an increase of lateral pile head displacement as the pile head is laterally displaced the depth of the rotation point shifts downwards tending to stabilize at a depth of about z 0 8l regardless of d and l d ratio this depth i e z 0 8l falls within the reported range of depth for the rotation point of laterally loaded piles with varied l d i e z 0 75 0 80l achmus et al 2009 klinkvort and hededal 2011 zhang et al 2013 ahmed and hawlader 2016 he 2016 truong and lehane 2017 murphy et al 2018 fig 11 also suggests that despite the wide range of load eccentricity considered in this study h 2d to 7d the resulted depths of rotation point in all the analyses are almost identical approximately 0 8l below the mudline it is thus decided to adopt a fixed depth of z 0 8l for the rotation points 5 3 generalizing m r θ r relation to generalize the m r θ r relation at the rotation point the computed relationship between the pile bending moment m r and the rotation angle θ r at the rotation point z 0 8l for piles with varied geometries i e d 3 10 m are shown in fig 12 a it is worth noting that the computed m r θ r curves for the piles with d 1 and 2 m i e l d 30 and 15 are not included in the figure because of zero rotation at z 0 8l for these two flexible piles as illustrated for a constant pile embedded depth in this study i e l 30 m the initial stiffness and the ultimate bending moment m u both increase with pile diameter this is because the lateral soil resistance and the contribution of the base shear and base moment to the bending becomes more pronounced for piles with a larger diameter as evident in fig 7 of this study and reported elsewhere byrne et al 2017 murphy et al 2018 by normalizing each m r θ r curve in fig 12 a with its ultimate m u value all the results for piles with varied d or l d ratios converge to a single trend as shown in fig 12 b this trend can be best captured by the following hyperbolic tangent function 8 m r m u tanh 33 5 θ r 0 73 the remaining issue is to formulate m u as a function of pile geometries i e d and l a careful inspection of the computed results in fig 13 has led to the following linear correlation between normalised m u by s u 0 8l dl 2 where s u 0 8l is undrained shear strength at z 0 8l and pile diameter d 9 m u s u 0 8 l d l 2 0 015 d d ref 0 25 in other words the value of m u for piles can be readily calculated from eq 9 simply based on pile geometries i e d and l and shear strength profile it can also be seen from figs 12 and 13 that the choice of the different load eccentricity considered in this study h 2d to 7d has little influence on the m r θ r formulations by combining the formulations in the above sub sections the proposed p y m r θ r model for piles with varied l d has been readily available table 4 summarizes the equations for each component of the model including the p y formulation location of the ration point and the m r θ r formulation at the rotation point it is worth noting that for a flexible pile which experiences zero rotation at the rotation point the term m r θ r vanishes according to eq 8 under this circumstance the proposed p y m r θ r model naturally recovers to the conventional p y model in other words the proposed p y m r θ r model has the flexibility of adjusting the relative contribution of p y i e lateral soil resistance and m r θ r resistance by base shear and base moment to the lateral behaviour of piles according to pile rigidity 5 4 discussion it is worth noting that the two spring model developed in this study includes 3 of the 4 resistance components that are proposed in the pisa s model namely i lateral soil resistance ii base shear and iii base moment while the resistance component of vertical shaft shear stress is ignored for simplicity the impact of this simplification is further examined in fig 6 by comparing the computed load displacement relations at the pile head with those predicted by the newly proposed two spring model the difference between the computed and the predicted lateral pile capacity is resulted from the ignorance of the vertical shaft shear stress in the two spring model it can be seen from fig 6 a that the proposed model well reproduced the load displacement response of the flexible pile l d 15 suggesting the lateral behavior of flexible pile is merely affected by the vertical shaft shear stress similar conclusion was also made by zhang and andersen 2019 when l d decreases as shown in fig 6 b and c the two spring model underestimates the pile capacity due to the omission of the contribution from pile vertical shaft shear stress the percentage underestimation for lateral pile capacity due to the ignorance of vertical shaft shear stress increases as the l d ratio decreases this has also been observed by byrne et al 2017 through field pile tests and murphy et al 2018 through 3d fea to quantify when the simplification in the two spring model might impact the response the percentage contributions of the vertical shaft shear stress to the lateral capacity for all the analyses reported herein where l d 3 to 30 see table 1 are extracted as summarized in table 5 it can be seen that for flexible piles in this study 10 l d 30 the effect of vertical shaft shear stress is likely to be negligible with its percentage contribution to the lateral capacity smaller than 1 on the other hand the ignorance of the vertical shaft shear stress might impact the response for semi rigid and rigid piles 3 l d 10 where its percentage contribution to the lateral capacity can be up to 6 the above quantitative conclusions were drawn from analyses of laterally loaded piles in normally consolidated soft clay comparatively a less pronounced contribution of vertical shaft shear stress is anticipated for piles in over consolidated clay stiff clay due to the developed tension gap at the rear of the pile randolph and gourvenec 2011 zhang et al 2016 which reduces the contact area between the soil and the pile shaft 6 validation of the proposed p y m r θ r model this section aims to verify the predictive capability of the proposed p y m r θ r model against published test results on monopiles with a broad range of length to diameter ratios l d in soft clay these have included field tests on flexible pile with l d 24 and 26 in soft clay zhu et al 2017 centrifuge tests in soft clay involving semi rigid pile with l d 10 lai et al 2019 2020 and rigid pile with l d 2 murali et al 2015 2019 the geometric and stiffness parameters of the piles in the field and centrifuge experiments are summarized in table 6 the performance of the proposed p y m r θ r model is evaluated in the following sub sections and compared to that of the api 2014 s p y model 6 1 field tests on flexible piles in soft clay zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 performed field tests on two laterally loaded piles which were driven offshore in soft clay at guishan offshore wind farms in guangdong province china the two piles referred as pile gk04 and gk08 were composed of q345b steel with a pile diameter of 2 2 m and a wall thickness of 0 03 m the embedded length l of pile gk04 and gk08 are 57 4 and 52 5 m respectively the load eccentricities for pile gk04 and gk08 are 12 6 and 13 5 m respectively the dominating soil strata supporting pile gk04 and gk08 are soft clay the in situ undrained shear strength s u of the soft clay which was characterized through cone penetration tests cpts increases almost linearly with depth z i e s u 5 0 75z zhu et al 2017 the measured pile displacement profiles under lateral loading indicate that pile gk04 and gk08 behave as flexible piles fig 14 compares the measured lateral head displacements of the two piles and the predicted results using the proposed p y m r θ r model as well as api 2014 s p y model the proposed p y m r θ r model is shown to reasonably capture the measured pile head responses while the lateral pile responses predicted by api 2014 appear to be over conservative in addition to the pile head response the adoption of the proposed p y m r θ r model has also led to reasonable predictions for bending moment and lateral pile displacement profiles of the flexible piles gk 04 see fig 15 and gk08 see fig 16 on the other hand the api 2014 method overestimates the maximum pile displacement up to 120 and bending moment up to 23 of the piles 6 2 centrifuge tests on flexible and semi rigid piles in soft clay lai et al 2019 2020 lai et al 2019 2020 reported centrifuge tests on two laterally loaded large diameter long monopiles in normally consolidated soft clay the two piles have an identical embedded depth l 60 m in prototype but different diameters d 4 and 6 m in prototype leading to l d ratios of 10 and 15 the model pile was made of type 7075 t6 aluminium alloy pipe young s modulus 72 gpa with a thickness of 2 mm t 0 2 m in prototype each pile was instrumented with 27 levels of full wheatstone bridge strain gauges to obtain the bending moment profile the soil used in the centrifuge tests was malaysia kaolin which is the same as the soil simulated in the numerical parametric analyses reported herein the measured strength profile exhibits an approximately linear increase of s u with depth the increasing rate of s u per unit depth is 1 54 kpa m in prototype scale according to the criterion proposed by poulos and hull 1989 the pile with d of 4 and 6 m are characterized as a flexible pile and a semi rigid pile respectively more details are given in lai et al 2019 2020 fig 17 compares the measured and predicted pile head load displacements of the flexible l d 15 and the semi rigid monopile l d 10 the predicted results are based on the proposed p y m r θ r model and api 2014 s p y model it can be seen that the api 2014 s p y model underestimates the initial stiffness and capacity for both piles with the level of underestimation increasing with pile diameter while the computed load displacement relations by the proposed p y m r θ r model show satisfactory agreements with the measured data of both flexible and semi rigid piles in addition as can be seen in fig 18 and fig 19 the bending moment and lateral displacement profiles of the flexible and semi rigid piles at different loading stages have been reasonably reproduced by the proposed p y m r θ r model with a maximum percentage error of 15 however using api 2014 method results in an overestimation in maximum pile bending moment up to 35 and pile displacement up to 120 6 3 centrifuge tests on rigid piles in soft clay murali et al 2015 2019 murali et al 2015 2019 presented four centrifuge tests on lateral behaviour of a rigid monopile l d 2 where l and d are 7 1 and 3 47 m in prototype in normally consolidated soft clay four eccentricities of lateral load above the ground surface i e h 1 2 1 5 2 5 and 3 5d were considered in their tests the pile load tests with the eccentricity of 1 2 and 3 5d were carried out in clay bed 1 while the remaining were conducted in clay bed 2 the undrained shear strength profiles of the clay beds 1 and 2 are approximately s u 1 1 1z and s u 1 1 3z respectively fig 20 compares the measured load displacement relationships at the head of the four rigid piles and the predicted results using the proposed p y m r θ r model as well as api 2014 s model the proposed p y m r θ r model has broadly captured the lateral behaviour of the four extremely short and rigid piles l d 2 due to proper consideration of the contributions from base shear and base moment which are essential for piles with small l d with ignorance of the contributions from the pile base api 2014 s p y model has predicted a much softer lateral response of the four rigid piles 7 summary and conclusions this study proposed a mechanism based unified p y m r θ r model for predicting lateral behaviour of monopiles in soft clay with varied length to diameter l d ratios it considers all the important components contributing to the lateral resistance of a monopile namely lateral soil resistance base shear and base moment in the proposed approach the lateral soil resistance above the rotation point is described by a p y model while the resistance below the rotation point including the pile base shear and base moment which is important for piles with relatively small l d are integrated into a moment rotation spring characterized by a m r θ r model at the rotational point the formulation of the proposed p y m r θ r model including the p y model the m r θ r model and the location of the rotation point are proposed based on a series of well verified 3d finite element fe analyses considering a wide range of l d the formulated p y m r θ r model can then be applied to a 1d winkler model for efficient computation with comparable accuracy to the underlying 3d fe model the proposed p y m r θ r model is capable of capturing the behaviour of monopiles with varied l d ratios in a unified manner because of its ability to adjust the relative contribution of p y and m r θ r to the lateral behaviour of piles considering pile diameter effects it naturally recovers to a p y model while analyzing flexible piles where θ r 0 at the rotation point the validity of the model has been well justified against a number of field and centrifuge model tests in soft clay embedded with laterally loaded monopiles which cover a broad range of l d ratios including flexible semi rigid and rigid piles on the other hand the standard p y method e g api 2014 significantly under predict the lateral stiffness and capacity of the piles in these field and centrifuge model tests particularly for piles with low l d ratios adoption of the proposed model therefore has shown the potential in reduced design conservatism and better economies for future wind farms credit authorship contribution

21692,large diameter monopiles are the most commonly used foundation to support offshore wind turbines early designs usually adopted pile diameters d between 4 and 6 m which is recently extended to 8 m and will target 10 m in the future it is increasingly evident that the existing design method i e api s p y model can significantly under predict the lateral stiffness and capacity of large diameter monopiles in soft clay due to ignoring the soil resistances from base shear and base moment which become more pronounces as l d reduces in this study a two spring approach is proposed aiming to predict the lateral behaviour of monopiles with varied l d ratios in a unified manner in light of the soil flow mechanisms around monopiles the pure lateral soil resistance above the rotation point rp is quantified using a p y model while the resistances below the rp including the base shear and base moment are integrated into a moment rotation spring characterized by a m r θ r model at the rp it can naturally recover to a p y model while analyzing flexible piles where θ r 0 at rp formulations of the p y m r θ r model including diameter related p y and m r θ r models and the depth of the rp are proposed based on the results of a series of well calibrated 3d numerical models the proposed model has satisfactorily reproduced a number of field and centrifuge test results on laterally loaded monopiles with a wide range of l d ratios including flexible semi rigid and rigid piles using a unified set of parameters compared to the standard p y model the adoption of the proposed p y m r θ r model is shown to substantially reduce design conservatism keywords monopile soft clay p y reaction model base reaction model length to diameter ratio finite element analysis 1 introduction monopiles

extreme environmental loads and increasing turbine sizes early designs usually adopted pile diameters d between 4 and 6 m leblanc et al 2010 negro et al 2017 stone et al 2018 with recent designs extending to 8 m byrne et al 2017 zhang and andersen 2019 achmus et al 2019 and future designs exceeding 10 m shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 byrne et al 2017 the embedded pile length to diameter ratio l d of a monopile is typically in the range of 4 8 doherty and gavin 2012 qi et al 2016 murphy et al 2018 with future designs anticipating l d ratios of 3 or smaller for super large monopiles murphy et al 2018 the design for a laterally loaded monopile which is mainly concerned with the initial stiffness and the ultimate capacity is typically based on the winkler approach 1867 in conjunction with p y models api 2014 dnvgl 2016 the original p y curves were deduced from the field tests on long slender piles with d 0 324 m and l d 39 matlock 1970 and have been widely used for the design of slender piles supporting offshore oil and gas platforms for decades in recent years attempts have been made to apply these p y models for the design of monopiles supporting offshore wind turbines which have larger d and much smaller l d ratios than the slender piles for offshore oil and gas structures it becomes increasingly evident that the original p y curves are insufficient to capture large diameter monopiles with varied l d ratios due to the significant deviation of the geometries of the monopiles from those adopted in the early calibration field tests stevens and audibert 1979 lam and martin 1986 jeanjean 2009 madabhushi and haiderali 2013 achmus and thieken 2016 finn and dowling 2016 wang et al 2015 lau 2015 he 2016 hong et al 2017a byrne et al 2017 zhang and andersen 2019 for this reason the recent edition of the dnvgl 2016 guideline has been updated to suggest that any method used for monopile design should be validated by other means such as finite element analyses it is also worth noting that the track records of success using the existing design guidelines api 2014 dnvgl 2016 are mainly proven in the design of monopiles in european wind farms where overconsolidated stiff clay or dense sand are usually encountered lau 2015 wang et al 2018 these guidelines do not appear to be very suitable for designing monopiles in normally consolidated clay zhu et al 2017 as widely deposited in offshore china cai et al 2010 di et al 2013 nan et al 2018 given the research gaps identified above this study aims to develop a unified lateral soil reaction model for monopiles in soft clay with consideration of various length to diameter l d ratios in the following the soil flow mechanisms around monopiles with varied l d ratios in conjunction with some existing mechanism based conceptual explicit models are reviewed with their merits and potential demerits highlighted the lessons learned from the review has led to the development of a new hybrid p y m r θ r approach that is capable of predicting lateral behaviour of monopiles with varied l d ratios using a unified set of parameters the validity of the unified model is justified against a number of field and centrifuge model tests in soft clay embedded with monopiles which cover a broad range of l d ratios 2 soil flow mechanisms around monopiles and the existing mechanism based soil pile interaction models a review the previous centrifuge and numerical analyses have revealed that the l d ratio of a monopile controlling the relative soil pile stiffness plays an important role in determining its nearby soil flow mechanisms and thus the modes of soil pile interaction hong et al 2017a lai et al 2019 fig 1 a and b and 1 c show the soil flow mechanism and lateral displacement profile of a typical flexible pile l d 30 a semi rigid pile l d 8 and a rigid pile l d 4 respectively lai et al 2019 which were computed by well calibrated 3d numerical models while fig 2 illustrates the measured soil flow mechanisms around a semi rigid pile in soft clay as quantified through the particle image velocimetry technique piv in half model centrifuge tests hong et al 2017a for the flexible pile l d 30 see fig 1 a the soil flow mechanisms are composed of wedge type flow near the ground surface and full flow below the wedge with zero pile deflection and rotation at the pile base under this circumstance the lateral load imposed on the pile head is mostly resisted by mobilizing the lateral soil resistance in the wedge and full flow zones as the l d ratio of the pile reduces the piles behave as semi rigid or rigid piles fig 1 a and b and fig 2 which do not only bend but also rotates with a distinct pile toe kick an additional flow mechanism namely rotational flow near the lower half of the piles see fig 1 a and b and fig 2 is thus involved in the semi rigid or rigid piles in other words the lateral load imposed to the semi rigid or rigid piles is not only resisted by the lateral soil resistance near its upper half but also by a rotational moment near its lower half with contributions from base shear base moment and rotational soil flow this explains the inadequacy of the api 2014 s approach to capture the lateral behaviour of monopiles with small l d ratios due to the ignorance of the latter mechanism gerolymos and gazetas 2006 lam 2009 gao et al 2015 byrne et al 2017 2019a 2019b mcadam et al 2019 taborda et al 2019 zdravković et al 2019 to better predict the lateral behaviour of monopiles with relatively small l d ratios i e semi rigid or rigid piles a number of improved soil pile interaction models have been proposed over the last decades most of these models were proposed based on semi empirical approaches by adding some lump sum factors into the p y curves stevens and audibert 1979 o neill and gazioglu 1984 lau 2015 hong et al 2017a without explicitly consider the contributions from the base shear base moment and vertical shaft shear stress these semi empirical approaches have worked well case specifically but would probably not be able to predict lateral behaviour of piles with a wide range of l d in a unified manner in view of the limitation stated above mechanism based soil pile interaction models were recently reported by byrne et al 2017 2019a and zhang and andersen 2019 which explicitly consider the resistances from the pile base compared to the traditional one kind spring p y model see fig 3 a byrne et al 2017 2019a s four spring conceptual framework as elaborated in fig 3 b comprehensively considers all the four components resisting a laterally loaded monopile namely i lateral soil resistance p y springs ii base shear s b y b spring iii base moment m b θ b spring and iv vertical shaft shear stress m p θ p springs however the four spring model should be calibrated using a set of bespoke 3d finite element analyses of monopile performance for pile characteristics and loading conditions that span a predefined design space byrne et al 2019a on the other hand zhang and andersen 2019 s two spring model as shown in fig 3 c accounts for two components resisting a laterally loaded monopile including i lateral soil resistance p y springs and ii base shear s b y b spring for the ease of practical design the equations of these springs are intended to be linked to the elemental stress strain response of the soil zhang et al 2016 zhang and andersen 2017 the resistance due to the base moment which could also be an important resistance component as quantified in sub section 4 4 is ignored in the two spring model due to this omission the two spring model is likely to under predict the lateral pile stiffness and capacity 3 a new conceptual framework for unified modelling of monopiles with varied l d based on the merits and potential demerits of the existing models this study proposes a new two spring model i e p y m r θ r model as shown in fig 4 it considers the three most important components resisting a laterally loaded monopile namely i lateral soil resistance ii base shear and iii base moment above the rotation point the lateral soil resistance is modelled by distributed lateral translational springs p y springs as routinely practiced while the overall resistances at and below the rotation point including the contributions from the rotational soil flow as evident numerically and experimentally see figs 1 and 2 base shear and base moment are integrated into a concentrated rotational spring m r θ r spring at the rotation point the rotation point which involves a pure rotation with little lateral displacement randolph and gourvenec 2011 zhang and ahmari 2011 lau 2015 is usually located within a narrow range of depth z 0 75 0 80l achmus et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 ahmed and hawlader 2016 he 2016 truong and lehane 2017 murphy et al 2018 the well defined boundary conditions and location of the rotation point bring convenience for constructing the p y m r θ r model for unified modelling on flexible semi rigid and rigid piles the proposed p y m r θ r model is anticipated to remain the flexibility of adjusting the relative contribution of p y and m r θ r depending on l d ratios for example the p y m r θ r model should naturally recover to the conventional p y model while analysing a flexible pile the detailed formulations for the p y and the m r θ r springs including the depth of the rotation point are proposed based on a series of well calibrated finite element analyses which simulate piles with a broad range of l d in soft clay the numerical analysis and the formulation of the p y m r θ r model are presented in the following two sections 4 quantifying effect of l d ratio on lateral response of monopiles in soft clay 3d numerical parametric study 4 1 objective and program this section aims to quantify the lateral behaviour of piles with varied length to diameter ratios i e l d in soft clay through a series of numerical parametric study using a well calibrated hypoplastic clay model the computed results are to form the bases for formulating the proposed p y m r θ r model which is mainly concerned with the p y relation above the rotation point m r θ r relation at the rotation point and the depth of the rotation point a wide range of l d between 3 and 30 is considered in the numerical parametric study where l is constantly taken as 30 m with the pile diameter d varying between 1 and 10 m the pile wall thickness t was determined based on the following equation recommended by the api 2014 code 1 t 0 00635 d 100 table 1 summarizes the program for the numerical parametric study three different values of load eccentricity above the mudline h 2d 4d and 7d are considered the two spring model and model parameters were derived based on the analyses with h 2d and used to predict the lateral behavior of the piles with h 4d and 7d aiming to check the applicability of the proposed p y m r θ r model for piles with varying load eccentricity the parameters of malaysia kaolin which has been well characterized and is widely used in geotechnical model tests ilyas et al 2004 xie et al 2012 hong et al 2017b 2019 zhu et al 2018 was adopted in each analysis table 1 also includes the relative pile soil stiffness e p i p e s l 4 poulos and hull 1989 e s denotes the soil modulus at middle pile depth which is equal to 400 times of s u for malaysia kaolin lai et al 2019 2020 as can be seen in the table the piles with d between 1 and 2 3 6 and 7 10 m tend to behave as flexible semi rigid and rigid piles respectively 4 2 finite element mesh and boundary conditions each numerical analysis is performed in the finite element program abaqus fig 5 shows an isometric view of a typical finite element mesh which contains a pile with d 6 m and l d 5 by taking advantage of symmetry only half of the pile model was modelled for computational efficiency to minimize the boundary effect the diameter of the cylindrical computation domain and the distance from the pile base to the bottom boundary were chosen to be 20d and 5d respectively chen and poulos 1993 each lateral boundary and the bottom boundary of the finite element mesh is constrained by roller and pinned supports respectively the suitability of the mesh density is justified by halving the current size of the mesh and running one more analysis the computed load displacement response from the analyses with the two mesh sizes differs by no more than 3 confirming the validity of the mesh size adopted in the present study the clay and the pile are modelled using eight node brick with pore pressure c3d8p elements and eight node brick c3d8 elements respectively the interface shear behaviour between the pile and the soil is modelled based on the coulomb friction law where the tangential frictional stress is linearly proportional to the normal stress the interface frictional coefficient μ 0 31 was adopted in this study following randolph and wroth 1981 4 3 constitutive model and model parameters an advanced hypoplastic clay model with consideration of small strain stiffness mašín 2005 which has been calibrated against centrifuge tests on a lateral pile in kaolin hong et al 2017a he et al 2019 is adopted for this numerical parametric study the hypoplastic model formulates the nonlinear stress strain behaviour of soil based on the combination of a linear and a non linear term as follows wu and kolymbas 1990 wu et al 1996 gudehus 1996 2 t f s l d f a n d where t and d represent the objective stress rate and the euler stretching tensor respectively l and n are fourth and second order constitutive tensors and f s and f d are two scale factors more details of each term in eq 2 are given in mašín 2005 2014 the strength anisotropy is considered in the model which follows matsuoka and nakai 1974 failure criterion the non linearity of soil stiffness at small strains which governs the initial stiffness of laterally loaded pile is considered in the hypoplastic model with the aid of the intergranular strain concept niemunis and herle 1997 the model consists of eleven parameters five of these parameters i e ϕ c n λ κ and ν are identical or similar to those defined in the cam clay based models wang et al 2016 hong et al 2020 parameters n λ and κ define the position of the isotropic virgin compression slope of the isotropic virgin compression and the slope of the unloading line in the ln 1 e ln p plane e void ratio and p mean effective stress respectively the parameter ν controls the proportion of bulk and shear stiffness in addition to the five basic model parameters there are six parameters controlling the non linearity of small strain stiffness i e r m rat β r χ a g and n g the parameter r denotes the size of the elastic range the parameter m rat controls the very small strain behaviour upon strain path reversals the parameters β r and χ control the rate of stiffness degradation the remaining parameters a g and n g influence the initial shear modulus through the equation wroth and houlsby 1985 3a g 0 p r a g p p r n g where p r is a reference pressure of 1 kpa these parameters for kaolin clay have been calibrated against triaxial tests hong et al 2017b 2019 and centrifuge model tests on laterally loaded piles in kaolin hong et al 2017a he et al 2019 as summarized in table 2 normally consolidated clay is modelled in each analysis of this study where the undrained shear strength being a function of void ratio increases with depth 4 4 computed lateral load displacement response of piles with varying l d fig 6 a and b and 6 c show the computed by 3d fea load displacement response at the head of a flexible d 2 m l d 15 semi rigid d 4 m l d 7 5 and rigid pile d 10 m l d 3 respectively each figure also includes the calculated load displacement response at the pile head via beam on elastic foundation analyses using api 2014 s p y curves and using the p y relations extracted from the three piles in 3d fea analysis as shown in each figure the lateral load of each pile increases with head displacement but at a decreasing rate with the load displacement curve eventually reaching a plateau the lateral load at the plateau is defined as the ultimate lateral pile capacity f u in this study lau 2015 truong and lehane 2017 it can be seen from fig 6 a that for the flexible pile l d 15 the adoption of api 2014 s p y curves underestimates the lateral stiffness and the ultimate lateral pile capacity compared to the computed lateral pile load displacement curves from 3d fea similar observations were also made by jeanjean 2009 zakeri et al 2016 and truong and lehane 2017 with the increase of pile diameter i e reducing l d the underestimation of lateral pile stiffness and capacity by api 2014 becomes more pronounced as shown in fig 6 b and c in particular the analysis based on api 2014 has underestimated the lateral pile capacity of the monopile with l d 3 fig 6 c is by 152 implying the current design practice may be over conservative for rigid piles based on the p y curves extracted from the piles in the 3d fea the beam on elastic foundation analysis calculates almost the same load displacement curve for the flexible pile l d 15 this is anticipated because the lateral load applied to the head of a flexible pile is almost resisted by the lateral resistance of soil characterized by p y curves for the semi rigid pile l d 7 5 and the rigid pile l d 3 however the calculated load displacement relationship using the p y curves extracted from the 3d fea underestimates the computed response the degree of the underestimation increases with the pile diameter i e reducing l d this is because the lateral load imposed to the semi rigid or rigid piles is not only taken by the lateral soil resistance but also the base shear base moment and vertical shaft stress which cannot be captured with sole consideration of p y curves quantitatively it can be seen from fig 6 c that the base shear base moment and vertical shaft shear stress contribute to approximately 25 of the ultimate lateral capacity for the monopile with l d 3 the contribution of the base shear base moment and vertical shaft shear stress to the afore mentioned flexible semi rigid and rigid piles are quantified based on the 3d fea results as shown in fig 7 as anticipated the contribution of the three resistance components increases with a decrease in l d among these resistance components the base shear shows the greatest contribution to the ultimate lateral pile capacity up to 13 followed by the base moment up to 8 while the contribution of the vertical shaft shear stress smaller than 5 appears to be marginal and may be ignored these observations suggest that the two spring model proposed by zhang and andersen 2019 which considers the lateral soil resistance and base shear may be further improved by accounting for the contribution from the base moment in this study the combined effects of the base shear and base moment are integrated into one single spring of m r θ r while the lateral soil resistance is still quantified using the p y curves the proposed p y m r θ r model is formulated in the following section by generalizing the computed lateral responses of piles with varying pile geometries 5 proposed p y m r θ r approach 5 1 generalizing p y curves this section aims to generalize a unified p y formulation that is able to capture the lateral behaviour of piles with varied pile diameters using a single set of parameters based on the computed p y curves via the 3d fea for this purpose the p y curves of all the ten piles i e d 1 10 m were extracted fig 8 a shows the typical computed p y curves at the shallow depths which cover the region of wedge or full flow types of soil flow mechanisms of the typical piles with d 2 4 5 6 8 and 10 m as illustrated in different colours the lateral soil resistance p was normalised by the ultimate lateral soil resistance p u while the lateral pile displacement y was normalised by the pile diameter d the normalised api p y curve is also plotted in the figure for comparison it can be seen that for each pile the p y curves at different depths of pile embedded within the region of wedge or full flow types of soil flow mechanisms are largely similar while for piles with varied pile diameters the increase of the pile diameter has led to a higher initial stiffness and smaller lateral displacement for reaching p u these trends are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the previous experimental and numerical investigations carter 1984 ling 1988 jeong et al 2011 he 2016 futai et al 2018 the figure also shows the normalised api 2014 p y curve which does not consider the effect of pile diameter predicts a softer behaviour than all the piles ranging from flexible to rigid piles simulated in this study this has necessitated the development of new p y formulation which considers the effect of pile diameter attempts were made to fit the computed p y curves see fig 8 a with three functions that typically for this purpose i e parabolic function matlock 1970 hyperbolic function georgiadis et al 1992 dewaikar and patil 2006 and hyperbolic tangent function gabr et al 1994 jeanjean 2009 truong and lehane 2017 among the three choices the hyperbolic tangent function shown in eq 3 best captures all the computed p y curves see fig 8 b and is thus adopted for the p y formulation in this study 3b p p u tanh a y d b where a and b are two fitting parameters it is found that the values of a and b for all the piles considered in this study are well correlated to the pile diameter d through a quadratic polynomial as shown in fig 9 a and formulated in eq 4 and a linear relationship as shown in fig 9 b and formulated in eq 5 respectively 4 a 0 25 d d ref 2 0 23 d d ref 7 15 5 b 0 017 d d ref 0 53 where d ref is a reference pile diameter of 1 m after determining the functional form of the p y curves with consideration of pile geometry see eqs 3 5 the remaining issue is concerned with the value of ultimate soil resistance p u which can be calculated by 6 p u n p s u d fig 10 shows the computed distributions of the lateral bearing capacity factor n p of each pile within shallow depth where the wedge and full flow types of mechanisms are involved i e the depth relevant to the p y curves in the figure the n p distributions recommended by api 2014 stevens and audibert 1979 jeanjean 2009 and truong and lehane 2017 are also included for comparison the equations for these n p distributions are summarized in table 3 it can be seen that the computed distribution of n p for piles with varied diameters broadly merge into a single trend because of identical soil flow mechanisms involved in the piles and depths of interests i e wedge or full flow mechanism among the exiting approaches which all appear to broadly capture the computed n p distribution with depth jeanjean 2009 s equation offers the best prediction and is thus adopted in the proposed p y formulation see eq 3 it can also be seen from figs 9 and 10 that a single set of parameters including a and b featuring the shape of p y and n p describing the ultimate soil resistance can satisfactorily describe the p y curves of piles with varying load eccentricity h 2d to 7d in a unified manner it is also found by zhu et al 2018 through a numerical study that the p y curves of a pile in soft clay were merely altered by a significant variation of h between 20 and 35d 5 2 determination of rotation point in addition to the p y formulation another key element of the proposed p y m r θ r model is the depth of the rotation point or the point with minimum lateral displacement where the m r θ r spring is located fig 11 shows the change of the depth of the rotation point normalised by pile embedded depth l with an increase of lateral pile head displacement as the pile head is laterally displaced the depth of the rotation point shifts downwards tending to stabilize at a depth of about z 0 8l regardless of d and l d ratio this depth i e z 0 8l falls within the reported range of depth for the rotation point of laterally loaded piles with varied l d i e z 0 75 0 80l achmus et al 2009 klinkvort and hededal 2011 zhang et al 2013 ahmed and hawlader 2016 he 2016 truong and lehane 2017 murphy et al 2018 fig 11 also suggests that despite the wide range of load eccentricity considered in this study h 2d to 7d the resulted depths of rotation point in all the analyses are almost identical approximately 0 8l below the mudline it is thus decided to adopt a fixed depth of z 0 8l for the rotation points 5 3 generalizing m r θ r relation to generalize the m r θ r relation at the rotation point the computed relationship between the pile bending moment m r and the rotation angle θ r at the rotation point z 0 8l for piles with varied geometries i e d 3 10 m are shown in fig 12 a it is worth noting that the computed m r θ r curves for the piles with d 1 and 2 m i e l d 30 and 15 are not included in the figure because of zero rotation at z 0 8l for these two flexible piles as illustrated for a constant pile embedded depth in this study i e l 30 m the initial stiffness and the ultimate bending moment m u both increase with pile diameter this is because the lateral soil resistance and the contribution of the base shear and base moment to the bending becomes more pronounced for piles with a larger diameter as evident in fig 7 of this study and reported elsewhere byrne et al 2017 murphy et al 2018 by normalizing each m r θ r curve in fig 12 a with its ultimate m u value all the results for piles with varied d or l d ratios converge to a single trend as shown in fig 12 b this trend can be best captured by the following hyperbolic tangent function 8 m r m u tanh 33 5 θ r 0 73 the remaining issue is to formulate m u as a function of pile geometries i e d and l a careful inspection of the computed results in fig 13 has led to the following linear correlation between normalised m u by s u 0 8l dl 2 where s u 0 8l is undrained shear strength at z 0 8l and pile diameter d 9 m u s u 0 8 l d l 2 0 015 d d ref 0 25 in other words the value of m u for piles can be readily calculated from eq 9 simply based on pile geometries i e d and l and shear strength profile it can also be seen from figs 12 and 13 that the choice of the different load eccentricity considered in this study h 2d to 7d has little influence on the m r θ r formulations by combining the formulations in the above sub sections the proposed p y m r θ r model for piles with varied l d has been readily available table 4 summarizes the equations for each component of the model including the p y formulation location of the ration point and the m r θ r formulation at the rotation point it is worth noting that for a flexible pile which experiences zero rotation at the rotation point the term m r θ r vanishes according to eq 8 under this circumstance the proposed p y m r θ r model naturally recovers to the conventional p y model in other words the proposed p y m r θ r model has the flexibility of adjusting the relative contribution of p y i e lateral soil resistance and m r θ r resistance by base shear and base moment to the lateral behaviour of piles according to pile rigidity 5 4 discussion it is worth noting that the two spring model developed in this study includes 3 of the 4 resistance components that are proposed in the pisa s model namely i lateral soil resistance ii base shear and iii base moment while the resistance component of vertical shaft shear stress is ignored for simplicity the impact of this simplification is further examined in fig 6 by comparing the computed load displacement relations at the pile head with those predicted by the newly proposed two spring model the difference between the computed and the predicted lateral pile capacity is resulted from the ignorance of the vertical shaft shear stress in the two spring model it can be seen from fig 6 a that the proposed model well reproduced the load displacement response of the flexible pile l d 15 suggesting the lateral behavior of flexible pile is merely affected by the vertical shaft shear stress similar conclusion was also made by zhang and andersen 2019 when l d decreases as shown in fig 6 b and c the two spring model underestimates the pile capacity due to the omission of the contribution from pile vertical shaft shear stress the percentage underestimation for lateral pile capacity due to the ignorance of vertical shaft shear stress increases as the l d ratio decreases this has also been observed by byrne et al 2017 through field pile tests and murphy et al 2018 through 3d fea to quantify when the simplification in the two spring model might impact the response the percentage contributions of the vertical shaft shear stress to the lateral capacity for all the analyses reported herein where l d 3 to 30 see table 1 are extracted as summarized in table 5 it can be seen that for flexible piles in this study 10 l d 30 the effect of vertical shaft shear stress is likely to be negligible with its percentage contribution to the lateral capacity smaller than 1 on the other hand the ignorance of the vertical shaft shear stress might impact the response for semi rigid and rigid piles 3 l d 10 where its percentage contribution to the lateral capacity can be up to 6 the above quantitative conclusions were drawn from analyses of laterally loaded piles in normally consolidated soft clay comparatively a less pronounced contribution of vertical shaft shear stress is anticipated for piles in over consolidated clay stiff clay due to the developed tension gap at the rear of the pile randolph and gourvenec 2011 zhang et al 2016 which reduces the contact area between the soil and the pile shaft 6 validation of the proposed p y m r θ r model this section aims to verify the predictive capability of the proposed p y m r θ r model against published test results on monopiles with a broad range of length to diameter ratios l d in soft clay these have included field tests on flexible pile with l d 24 and 26 in soft clay zhu et al 2017 centrifuge tests in soft clay involving semi rigid pile with l d 10 lai et al 2019 2020 and rigid pile with l d 2 murali et al 2015 2019 the geometric and stiffness parameters of the piles in the field and centrifuge experiments are summarized in table 6 the performance of the proposed p y m r θ r model is evaluated in the following sub sections and compared to that of the api 2014 s p y model 6 1 field tests on flexible piles in soft clay zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 performed field tests on two laterally loaded piles which were driven offshore in soft clay at guishan offshore wind farms in guangdong province china the two piles referred as pile gk04 and gk08 were composed of q345b steel with a pile diameter of 2 2 m and a wall thickness of 0 03 m the embedded length l of pile gk04 and gk08 are 57 4 and 52 5 m respectively the load eccentricities for pile gk04 and gk08 are 12 6 and 13 5 m respectively the dominating soil strata supporting pile gk04 and gk08 are soft clay the in situ undrained shear strength s u of the soft clay which was characterized through cone penetration tests cpts increases almost linearly with depth z i e s u 5 0 75z zhu et al 2017 the measured pile displacement profiles under lateral loading indicate that pile gk04 and gk08 behave as flexible piles fig 14 compares the measured lateral head displacements of the two piles and the predicted results using the proposed p y m r θ r model as well as api 2014 s p y model the proposed p y m r θ r model is shown to reasonably capture the measured pile head responses while the lateral pile responses predicted by api 2014 appear to be over conservative in addition to the pile head response the adoption of the proposed p y m r θ r model has also led to reasonable predictions for bending moment and lateral pile displacement profiles of the flexible piles gk 04 see fig 15 and gk08 see fig 16 on the other hand the api 2014 method overestimates the maximum pile displacement up to 120 and bending moment up to 23 of the piles 6 2 centrifuge tests on flexible and semi rigid piles in soft clay lai et al 2019 2020 lai et al 2019 2020 reported centrifuge tests on two laterally loaded large diameter long monopiles in normally consolidated soft clay the two piles have an identical embedded depth l 60 m in prototype but different diameters d 4 and 6 m in prototype leading to l d ratios of 10 and 15 the model pile was made of type 7075 t6 aluminium alloy pipe young s modulus 72 gpa with a thickness of 2 mm t 0 2 m in prototype each pile was instrumented with 27 levels of full wheatstone bridge strain gauges to obtain the bending moment profile the soil used in the centrifuge tests was malaysia kaolin which is the same as the soil simulated in the numerical parametric analyses reported herein the measured strength profile exhibits an approximately linear increase of s u with depth the increasing rate of s u per unit depth is 1 54 kpa m in prototype scale according to the criterion proposed by poulos and hull 1989 the pile with d of 4 and 6 m are characterized as a flexible pile and a semi rigid pile respectively more details are given in lai et al 2019 2020 fig 17 compares the measured and predicted pile head load displacements of the flexible l d 15 and the semi rigid monopile l d 10 the predicted results are based on the proposed p y m r θ r model and api 2014 s p y model it can be seen that the api 2014 s p y model underestimates the initial stiffness and capacity for both piles with the level of underestimation increasing with pile diameter while the computed load displacement relations by the proposed p y m r θ r model show satisfactory agreements with the measured data of both flexible and semi rigid piles in addition as can be seen in fig 18 and fig 19 the bending moment and lateral displacement profiles of the flexible and semi rigid piles at different loading stages have been reasonably reproduced by the proposed p y m r θ r model with a maximum percentage error of 15 however using api 2014 method results in an overestimation in maximum pile bending moment up to 35 and pile displacement up to 120 6 3 centrifuge tests on rigid piles in soft clay murali et al 2015 2019 murali et al 2015 2019 presented four centrifuge tests on lateral behaviour of a rigid monopile l d 2 where l and d are 7 1 and 3 47 m in prototype in normally consolidated soft clay four eccentricities of lateral load above the ground surface i e h 1 2 1 5 2 5 and 3 5d were considered in their tests the pile load tests with the eccentricity of 1 2 and 3 5d were carried out in clay bed 1 while the remaining were conducted in clay bed 2 the undrained shear strength profiles of the clay beds 1 and 2 are approximately s u 1 1 1z and s u 1 1 3z respectively fig 20 compares the measured load displacement relationships at the head of the four rigid piles and the predicted results using the proposed p y m r θ r model as well as api 2014 s model the proposed p y m r θ r model has broadly captured the lateral behaviour of the four extremely short and rigid piles l d 2 due to proper consideration of the contributions from base shear and base moment which are essential for piles with small l d with ignorance of the contributions from the pile base api 2014 s p y model has predicted a much softer lateral response of the four rigid piles 7 summary and conclusions this study proposed a mechanism based unified p y m r θ r model for predicting lateral behaviour of monopiles in soft clay with varied length to diameter l d ratios it considers all the important components contributing to the lateral resistance of a monopile namely lateral soil resistance base shear and base moment in the proposed approach the lateral soil resistance above the rotation point is described by a p y model while the resistance below the rotation point including the pile base shear and base moment which is important for piles with relatively small l d are integrated into a moment rotation spring characterized by a m r θ r model at the rotational point the formulation of the proposed p y m r θ r model including the p y model the m r θ r model and the location of the rotation point are proposed based on a series of well verified 3d finite element fe analyses considering a wide range of l d the formulated p y m r θ r model can then be applied to a 1d winkler model for efficient computation with comparable accuracy to the underlying 3d fe model the proposed p y m r θ r model is capable of capturing the behaviour of monopiles with varied l d ratios in a unified manner because of its ability to adjust the relative contribution of p y and m r θ r to the lateral behaviour of piles considering pile diameter effects it naturally recovers to a p y model while analyzing flexible piles where θ r 0 at the rotation point the validity of the model has been well justified against a number of field and centrifuge model tests in soft clay embedded with laterally loaded monopiles which cover a broad range of l d ratios including flexible semi rigid and rigid piles on the other hand the standard p y method e g api 2014 significantly under predict the lateral stiffness and capacity of the piles in these field and centrifuge model tests particularly for piles with low l d ratios adoption of the proposed model therefore has shown the potential in reduced design conservatism and better economies for future wind farms credit authorship contribution

series solutions of steady state resonant waves are first obtained by homotopy analysis method ham theoretical solutions together with disturbances of different orders of magnitude are then served as

with the huge literature concerning the wave spectrum evolution due to the wave resonant interactions the investigation of steady state wave groups under the resonance condition is considerably less

experimental investigation of the steady state resonant waves has been conducted by liu et al 2015 in a basin with limit size effect of the default error in wave making system on the time independent spectrum was considered but the basin was not long enough to study the dynamics evolution of steady state resonant waves to consider the evolution of steady state resonant waves in a more realistic

yue 1987 west et al 1987 besides simulations of the steady state resonant waves with random disturbances are also considered to study the evolution of nonlinear wave groups the ham does not depend on small physical parameters and provides freedom to choose the initial guess and auxiliary linear operator so that the small divisors caused by multiple nearly resonant components can be removed

initial conditions we use the open source code hos ocean from lhee lab ducrozet et al 2007 bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2016 for the numerical simulations to simulate the steady state resonant waves the third order nonlinear effect has to be reproduced in the hos model toffoli et al 2010 xiao et al 2013 five different orders of nonlinearity m 3 4 5 6 and 7 are tested and m 5 is used in this work to balance the accuracy and cost in all simulations we use the periodic boundary condition space period of the wave system in x direction strictly equals the length of the space domain with l x 400 π m and n x 4096 for the given theoretical series solutions of steady state resonant waves wave components with different orders of magnitude are considered step by step see section 3 at the initial stage of numerical simulation wave elevation η and velocity potential φ are calculated at all n x 4096 nodes the wave field evolves from the initial spectrum as the simulation begins 3 numerical simulation with increasing number of wave components we consider all wave components with amplitude larger than 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 in the initial condition from case s1 to case s6 the number of components considered increases from 5 to 235 in all six cases the wave system evolves until the slope along the propagation direction is too large to keep un breaking seiffert and ducrozet 2016 define simulation time t s m as the time five time periods t of the primary wave component k 1 before the wave breaking and define steady state time t s s as the time amplitude of one of the two primary components changes over 1 then for each case the dynamic evolution time t d e t s m t s s table 1 shows the simulation time for cases s1 s6 as the number of components considered at the initial stage increases it can be found that both the simulation time t s m and the steady state time t s s increase continuously thus it is reasonable to conclude that if sufficient number of wave components are generated at the initial stage steady state resonant waves with time independent spectra could be obtained this provides the numerical confirmation of the existence of the steady state resonant waves besides as the number of components considered increases from 156 to 235 from case s5 to s6 the simulation time t s m increases 8 t and the steady steady time t s s increases only 4 t components with amplitude in the range of 1 0 7 1 0 6 neglected in case s5 seem to play trivial roles in the evolution of steady state resonant waves therefore it is reasonable to believe that the wave breaking in cases s5 and s6 are mainly due to the accumulative error of the numerical simulation enough components have been considered in these two cases to study the evolution of steady state resonant waves consider evolution of the four largest wave components in the theoretical series solutions two primary components k 1 and k 2 and other two components k 3 0 57 and k 4 1 215 form an exact resonant quartet fig 4 shows time history of amplitude of the four largest components for cases s1 s6 vertical dash lines represent the ends of the steady state time for cases s2 s6 in fig 4 a and b in case s1 only 5 wave components are generated at the initial stage amplitude of wave components k 1 and k 4 fluctuates distinctly in fig 4 a and d energy transfer among different wave components appears at the very early stage of simulation from case s2 to s6 more wave components are generated at the initial stage and amplitude of the four largest components keeps unchanged for a longer time fig 5 shows the theoretical and numerical free surface profiles at the end of steady state time for cases s2 s6 in all five cases theoretical and numerical free surface profiles match well with each other at the end of the steady state time fig 4 shows that amplitudes of all four initial largest wave components start to decrease until the waves break wave energy transfers from the four initial largest wave components to other components that may have not been generated at the initial stage taking a new generated wave component k 0 645 as example fig 6 shows that the corresponding amplitude increases with time fig 7 shows the wave number amplitude spectra of cases s1 s6 at the end of simulation time the largest few wave components change from case to case while the spectra peaks change little compared with the spectrum of theoretical wave system in fig 3a more components are indeed generated during the dynamic evolution time for all six cases table 2 shows the ten largest wave components at the end of simulation time for cases s1 s6 it could be found that every large wave component actually satisfies the four wave resonance condition it means that the four wave resonant interaction transfers energy among different wave components and hence dominates the wave evolutions 4 numerical simulation with random disturbances of different orders of magnitude in this section we investigate the evolution of steady state resonant wave systems with random disturbances in more realistic situations due to the inherent error of the wave generation system the waves generated in physical experiments are not exactly the same as the target ones usually the discrepancy of amplitude between the generated wave and the target one is required to be less than 5 exact steady state resonant waves together with disturbances of different orders of magnitude will be considered and the related spectra will be analyzed we choose case s6 as the undisturbed wave group for wave components in the range of two adjacent orders of magnitude 1 0 n 1 1 0 n random errors e r r less than 5 are added on the corresponding undisturbed amplitude η o and velocity potential φ o s then we get the disturbed amplitude η d η o 1 e r r and velocity potential φ d s φ o s 1 e r r at the initial stage the order of magnitude of components considered to add random errors decreases from 1 0 1 1 0 0 to 1 0 7 1 0 6 from case r1 to case r7 as shown in table 3 for each case 200 numerical simulations with different random disturbances have been conducted the simulation time is defined as the shortest one of the 200 simulations define steepness of the wave groups h s over the 200 simulations as 23 h s k d i 1 200 m a x η d i ξ 1 ξ 2 m i n η d i ξ 1 ξ 2 400 ξ i 0 2 π where k d is wave number of the largest component in the average spectrum it can be found from table 3 that as the random disturbances decreases both the average simulation time t s m and average steady state time t s s increase continuously it confirms again the existence of steady state resonant waves numerically besides as the order of magnitude of components considered to add the random disturbances decreases from 1 0 6 1 0 5 to 1 0 7 1 0 6 from case r6 to r7 the average simulation time t s m and average steady state time t s s increases only 7 t and 6 t the small random disturbances in case r7 seem to have little impact on the wave evolution so wave breaking in case r6 and r7 may both caused by the accumulative error of the numerical simulation fig 8 shows the average wave number amplitude spectra over 200 simulations at the end of the simulation time it can be found that as the random disturbances decrease from case r1 to r7 the spectrum becomes more complex as more wave components join the resonance therefore steepness of the wave group h s increases from 0 28 to 0 39 from case r1 to r7 as shown in table 3 shape of the spectrum changes little from case r1 to r3 though the average steady state time t s s and the average dynamic evolution time t d e change significantly from case r1 to r3 the average simulation time t s m increases little it seems that the wave breaking happens before any significant energy transfer appears from case r1 to r3 besides shape of the spectrum changes obviously from case r3 to r6 random disturbances in the range of 1 0 4 1 0 7 change effectively the spectra of the whole wave group and should be not neglected when considering the evolution of steady state wave systems fig 9 shows the average amplitude evolution over 200 simulations for the second primary component k 2 and one new generated component k 0 645 it can be found that average amplitude of the second primary component decreases with time meanwhile amplitude of another component increases with time energy transfer indeed happens among different components besides as the order of magnitude of random disturbance decreases energy transfer among different components becomes more remarkable specifically the average amplitudes of both two components change little from case r1 to r3 and from case r5 to r7 meanwhile the average amplitudes change obviously from case r3 to r5 this indicates again the significant role of the random disturbances in the range of 1 0 4 1 0 7 play on the whole wave group in each case the ten largest wave components at the end of the simulation time are chosen and sixteen components are obtained from case r1 to r7 table 4 shows the detailed wave components together with the resonance sets formed by these components it can be found that all sixteen wave components join the resonance by four wave resonant interactions which indicates again that the four wave resonance dominates the evolution of steady state resonant waves in deep water 5 conclusion evolution of steady state resonant waves in a more realistic situation has been considered in deep water the ham is used to provide the accurate series solutions of collinear steady state resonant waves and the hos is used to simulate the evolution of steady state resonant waves with disturbances it is found that the steady state resonant waves could be obtained in the numerical simulation if enough accurate components of the steady state resonant waves are considered at the initial stage during the dynamic evolution stage wave energy transfers among different components due to the four wave resonant interactions energy spreading is more remarkable for small random disturbances before the wave breaking this work focuses on the evolution of collinear steady state resonant

initial conditions we use the open source code hos ocean from lhee lab ducrozet et al 2007 bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2016 for the numerical simulations to simulate the steady state resonant waves the third order nonlinear effect has to be reproduced in the hos model toffoli et al 2010 xiao et al 2013 five different orders of nonlinearity m 3 4 5 6 and 7 are tested and m 5 is used in this work to balance the accuracy and cost in all simulations we use the periodic boundary condition space period of the wave system in x direction strictly equals the length of the space domain with l x 400 π m and n x 4096 for the given theoretical series solutions of steady state resonant waves wave components with different orders of magnitude are considered step by step see section 3 at the initial stage of numerical simulation wave elevation η and velocity potential φ are calculated at all n x 4096 nodes the wave field evolves from the initial spectrum as the simulation begins 3 numerical simulation with increasing number of wave components we consider all wave components with amplitude larger than 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 in the initial condition from case s1 to case s6 the number of components considered increases from 5 to 235 in all six cases the wave system evolves until the slope along the propagation direction is too large to keep un breaking seiffert and ducrozet 2016 define simulation time t s m as the time five time periods t of the primary wave component k 1 before the wave breaking and define steady state time t s s as the time amplitude of one of the two primary components changes over 1 then for each case the dynamic evolution time t d e t s m t s s table 1 shows the simulation time for cases s1 s6 as the number of components considered at the initial stage increases it can be found that both the simulation time t s m and the steady state time t s s increase continuously thus it is reasonable to conclude that if sufficient number of wave components are generated at the initial stage steady state resonant waves with time independent spectra could be obtained this provides the numerical confirmation of the existence of the steady state resonant waves besides as the number of components considered increases from 156 to 235 from case s5 to s6 the simulation time t s m increases 8 t and the steady steady time t s s increases only 4 t components with amplitude in the range of 1 0 7 1 0 6 neglected in case s5 seem to play trivial roles in the evolution of steady state resonant waves therefore it is reasonable to believe that the wave breaking in cases s5 and s6 are mainly due to the accumulative error of the numerical simulation enough components have been considered in these two cases to study the evolution of steady state resonant waves consider evolution of the four largest wave components in the theoretical series solutions two primary components k 1 and k 2 and other two components k 3 0 57 and k 4 1 215 form an exact resonant quartet fig 4 shows time history of amplitude of the four largest components for cases s1 s6 vertical dash lines represent the ends of the steady state time for cases s2 s6 in fig 4 a and b in case s1 only 5 wave components are generated at the initial stage amplitude of wave components k 1 and k 4 fluctuates distinctly in fig 4 a and d energy transfer among different wave components appears at the very early stage of simulation from case s2 to s6 more wave components are generated at the initial stage and amplitude of the four largest components keeps unchanged for a longer time fig 5 shows the theoretical and numerical free surface profiles at the end of steady state time for cases s2 s6 in all five cases theoretical and numerical free surface profiles match well with each other at the end of the steady state time fig 4 shows that amplitudes of all four initial largest wave components start to decrease until the waves break wave energy transfers from the four initial largest wave components to other components that may have not been generated at the initial stage taking a new generated wave component k 0 645 as example fig 6 shows that the corresponding amplitude increases with time fig 7 shows the wave number amplitude spectra of cases s1 s6 at the end of simulation time the largest few wave components change from case to case while the spectra peaks change little compared with the spectrum of theoretical wave system in fig 3a more components are indeed generated during the dynamic evolution time for all six cases table 2 shows the ten largest wave components at the end of simulation time for cases s1 s6 it could be found that every large wave component actually satisfies the four wave resonance condition it means that the four wave resonant interaction transfers energy among different wave components and hence dominates the wave evolutions 4 numerical simulation with random disturbances of different orders of magnitude in this section we investigate the evolution of steady state resonant wave systems with random disturbances in more realistic situations due to the inherent error of the wave generation system the waves generated in physical experiments are not exactly the same as the target ones usually the discrepancy of amplitude between the generated wave and the target one is required to be less than 5 exact steady state resonant waves together with disturbances of different orders of magnitude will be considered and the related spectra will be analyzed we choose case s6 as the undisturbed wave group for wave components in the range of two adjacent orders of magnitude 1 0 n 1 1 0 n random errors e r r less than 5 are added on the corresponding undisturbed amplitude η o and velocity potential φ o s then we get the disturbed amplitude η d η o 1 e r r and velocity potential φ d s φ o s 1 e r r at the initial stage the order of magnitude of components considered to add random errors decreases from 1 0 1 1 0 0 to 1 0 7 1 0 6 from case r1 to case r7 as shown in table 3 for each case 200 numerical simulations with different random disturbances have been conducted the simulation time is defined as the shortest one of the 200 simulations define steepness of the wave groups h s over the 200 simulations as 23 h s k d i 1 200 m a x η d i ξ 1 ξ 2 m i n η d i ξ 1 ξ 2 400 ξ i 0 2 π where k d is wave number of the largest component in the average spectrum it can be found from table 3 that as the random disturbances decreases both the average simulation time t s m and average steady state time t s s increase continuously it confirms again the existence of steady state resonant waves numerically besides as the order of magnitude of components considered to add the random disturbances decreases from 1 0 6 1 0 5 to 1 0 7 1 0 6 from case r6 to r7 the average simulation time t s m and average steady state time t s s increases only 7 t and 6 t the small random disturbances in case r7 seem to have little impact on the wave evolution so wave breaking in case r6 and r7 may both caused by the accumulative error of the numerical simulation fig 8 shows the average wave number amplitude spectra over 200 simulations at the end of the simulation time it can be found that as the random disturbances decrease from case r1 to r7 the spectrum becomes more complex as more wave components join the resonance therefore steepness of the wave group h s increases from 0 28 to 0 39 from case r1 to r7 as shown in table 3 shape of the spectrum changes little from case r1 to r3 though the average steady state time t s s and the average dynamic evolution time t d e change significantly from case r1 to r3 the average simulation time t s m increases little it seems that the wave breaking happens before any significant energy transfer appears from case r1 to r3 besides shape of the spectrum changes obviously from case r3 to r6 random disturbances in the range of 1 0 4 1 0 7 change effectively the spectra of the whole wave group and should be not neglected when considering the evolution of steady state wave systems fig 9 shows the average amplitude evolution over 200 simulations for the second primary component k 2 and one new generated component k 0 645 it can be found that average amplitude of the second primary component decreases with time meanwhile amplitude of another component increases with time energy transfer indeed happens among different components besides as the order of magnitude of random disturbance decreases energy transfer among different components becomes more remarkable specifically the average amplitudes of both two components change little from case r1 to r3 and from case r5 to r7 meanwhile the average amplitudes change obviously from case r3 to r5 this indicates again the significant role of the random disturbances in the range of 1 0 4 1 0 7 play on the whole wave group in each case the ten largest wave components at the end of the simulation time are chosen and sixteen components are obtained from case r1 to r7 table 4 shows the detailed wave components together with the resonance sets formed by these components it can be found that all sixteen wave components join the resonance by four wave resonant interactions which indicates again that the four wave resonance dominates the evolution of steady state resonant waves in deep water 5 conclusion evolution of steady state resonant waves in a more realistic situation has been considered in deep water the ham is used to provide the accurate series solutions of collinear steady state resonant waves and the hos is used to simulate the evolution of steady state resonant waves with disturbances it is found that the steady state resonant waves could be obtained in the numerical simulation if enough accurate components of the steady state resonant waves are considered at the initial stage during the dynamic evolution stage wave energy transfers among different components due to the four wave resonant interactions energy spreading is more remarkable for small random disturbances before the wave breaking this work focuses on the evolution of collinear steady state resonant waves in deep water evolution of wave groups in water of finite depth and shallow water will be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement zhiyong yan software validation formal

21694,tubular k joints frequently employed in offshore structures are subjected to multiaxial stresses it is difficult to accurately assess fatigue strength of tubular k joints using the uniaxial fatigue theory in this paper a multiaxial fatigue life prediction method for tubular k joints is proposed which is based on an improved zero point structure stress zpss approach that accounts for the stress gradient in the thickness direction to quantify the structure stress at the weld toe of a tubular k joint the multiaxial fatigue life is predicted making use of the modified wöhler curve method mwcm as the multiaxial damage criterion it is found that the multiaxial fatigue estimation using the proposed method predicts the fatigue critical point well meanwhile the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are much closer to experimental lives in comparison with the uniaxial fatigue estimation using the cidect specification graphical abstract in this paper an improved zero point structure stress zpss approach for tubular k joints is proposed with which the multiaxial stress state at fatigue critical point can be extracted conveniently combined with the modified wöhler curve method mwcm the multiaxial fatigue life of tubular k joints can be predicted well in terms of zpss as shown in fig 1 a the stress classification line scl which is perpendicular to the tube surface at the weld toe is adopted as the reference line of zpss calculation for tubular k joints the structural stress distribution can be calculated by integrating the notch stress σ ln at the points along the scl and the structural stress at the interaction point between the structural stress distribution and the notch stress distribution is the zpss on some one plane then through traversing the zpss results on all planes across scl as shown in fig 1 b the final zpss can be obtained a scl definition b notch stress distribution along scl on one plane fig 1 zpss calculation of tubular joints image 1 keywords tubular k joints structure stress multiaxial fatigue stress gradient experiment 1 introduction tubular k joints are widely used in offshore industry however tubular joints are susceptible to fatigue damage caused by high stress concentration and cyclic wave induced loading ahmadi 2016 furthermore due to the combination of elementary loadings applied to tubular k joints in service and complex geometry around weld toe the multiaxial stress state along the weld intersection leads to the fatigue life assessment of tubular k joints more complicated in practice uniaxial fatigue theory is recommended for fatigue life estimation of tubular k joints which is based on the hot spot stress hss approach with uniaxial s n curves generally a hss can be calculated directly by multiplying the nominal stress by a stress concentration factor scf at a hot spot based on the work of romeijn 1994 dijkstra et al 1996 and karamanos 1997 several parametric scf equations at saddle and crown point of uniplanar k joints under elementary loadings are provided in the design rule of tubular joints cidect zhao et al 2000 however a scf under combined loading cannot be derived from these parametric equations shao et al 2009 due to the fact that a theoretical hot spot can be at any point along the weld intersection when subjected to combined loadings and even fixed elementary loadings shao et al 2006 shao 2007 american petroleum institute api 1993 proposed a simplified method that the scf under combined loading is defined as the sum of the scfs of the various uniaxial loadings this approach however is deemed excessively conservative because the hot spots under elementary loadings differ shao et al 2009 a superimposition method was utilized to calculate a more accurate hss of a tubular joint under combined loading by superposing the stress distributions from each of uniaxial loadings gulati et al 1982 chang and dover 1999a 1999b proposed several sets of parametric equations to predict the stress distribution along chord brace intersections of tubular y t joints despite of the advantages this method tends to predict fatigue lives of greater dispersions using the hss approach for fatigue assessment of tubular k joints can be problematic firstly the hss indicates the surface peak stress but not the stress gradient it has been found through experiments that fatigue lives of welded structures not only depend on the peak stress on the surface but also on the stress gradient in the thickness direction connolly 1986 ahmadi and shadi 2016 secondly shell elements are often used for finite element fe analysis of tubular joints which do not accurately account for the three dimensional behavior of the welded joints radaj et al 1998 through numbers of numerical simulations it was found that solid element is the best element in modeling tubular joints herion et al 1996 in addition the multiaxial stress state along the weld intersections of tubular joints has not been considered in the traditional uniaxial fatigue theory thévenet 2013 investigated the fatigue behavior of tubular t joints under deviated bending using the uniaxial s n curve method recommended in iiw hobbacher 2008 and found that the fatigue life predicted tended to be scattered compared with the experiment data the multiaxial stress state has a significant effect on fatigue life especially when the phase correlation exists between multiaxial components recent experiments show that a non proportional shear stress superimposed on a normal stress causes a significant reduction in fatigue life of ductile materials sonsino 2020 herein it is of great significance to develop a multiaxial fatigue life prediction method that multiaxial stress state as well as stress gradient effect can be considered which stands for the effect of stress variation along the tube thickness on fatigue life for improving fatigue strength assessment accuracy of tubular k joints in recent years the modified wöhler curve method mwcm has been introduced for multiaxial fatigue assessment susmel and lazzarin 2002 susmel and tovo 2004 using the mwcm the multiaxial fatigue s n curve is calibrated by the uniaxial tension and torsion fatigue curve in standard codes the hss approach was utilized to assess multiaxial fatigue strength of flange plate structures combined with mwcm and the results showed a good agreement with the experimental data susmel and tovo 2006 susmel 2009 however the hss approach cannot be simply integrated with the mwcm for fatigue life prediction of tubular k joints it has to extrapolate the normal stress perpendicular to the weld toe the shear stress parallel and perpendicular to the weld toe separately in view of this the zero point structure stress zpss approach was proposed for multiaxial fatigue assessment liu et al 2014 2015 in which the zpss can be extracted directly from a post processing of a fe analysis without multiaxial stress extrapolation however it was not possible to apply this method to calculate multiaxial stress state of tubular k joints in this paper a multiaxial fatigue life assessment method based on an improved zpss approach is proposed the rest of this article is organized as following firstly the improved zpss approach for stress calculation of tubular k joints is described secondly the zpss distributions along the weld intersection of k joints are analyzed under three elementary loadings with the multiaxial fatigue life of tubular k joints estimated finally the accuracy of the proposed method is compared with the experiment data as well as the numerical results based on the uniaxial standard cidect method followed by discussions and conclusions 2 zpss approach for tubular k joints 2 1 zpss definition in general the local notch stress σ ln along the chord brace intersection of tubular joints can be separated into two components as shown in fig 1 a one part is the structure stress σ ss which is the sum of the membrane stress σ m and the bending stress σ b the other part is the nonlinear peak stress σ nlp which is caused by highly localized deformations around weld toe the nonlinear peak stress may be critical for crack initiation but it is not the controlling factor as cracks propagate through thickness in addition the nonlinear peak stress varies with geometry parameters of weld that a deterministic value is hard to reach chang and dover 1999a for this reason only the structure stress is adopted to predict the fatigue strength of tubular k joints the stress components can be obtained through refined stress analysis using equations as follows liu et al 2014 1 σ m 1 t 0 t σ ln x d x 2 σ b 6 t 2 0 t σ ln x t 2 x d x 3 σ nlp x σ ln x σ m 1 2 x t σ b where t is the tube thickness and σ ln x is the local notch stress distribution from x 0 at surface to x t along the tube thickness the structure stress has a linear distribution along the tube thickness and balances the external loads the nonlinear peak stress should therefore be in self equilibrium thus the nonlinear peak stress has to come to zero value at a point along tube thickness liu et al 2014 named the point as zero point zp at the zp the local notch stress is equal to the structure stress without the notch effect of the weld toe as shown in fig 1 b similar to the hss approach the structure stress at the zp is taken as the reference stress in fatigue strength assessment which can be obtained directly through fe post processing the location of the zp can be obtained by solving the intersection point of the structure stress curve and the notch stress curve as shown in the following equation liu et al 2014 4 d zp σ m σ b σ ln d zp 2 σ b t where d zp is the distance from the zero point to the outer surface of the tube as shown in fig 1 b 2 2 the zpss calculation of tubular k joints in comparison with plate welded joints tubular k joints require zpss analyses at all the evaluation points along the weld intersection to obtain the zpss distribution which makes the zpss calculation of tubular k joints more complicated in addition during the zpss analysis of tubular k joints the coordinates of each evaluation point are extracted directly to establish the local coordinate system at the weld toe compared with the previous zpss approach the zpss calculation of k joints becomes more convenient and effective as shown in fig 2 the evaluation points are placed at the weld toe on the chord at an interval of 22 5 and the peripheral angle φ is measured from the heel to the crown as illustrated in fig 3 a the stress classification line scl is the reference line perpendicular to the tube surface asme 2004 the notch stress σ ln perpendicular to the scl is used to calculate the zpss at each peripheral angle φ it is firstly necessary to transform the stress tensor into the local coordinate system at the weld toe three directions of local coordinate are perpendicular to weld toe parallel to weld toe and along the scl respectively then through traversing the zpss results on all planes along scl the largest zpss and its corresponding zp are taken as the zpss and the zp at this evaluation point as shown in fig 3 b the δ1 δ2 δ3 means some of the planes across the scl the calculation flowchart of the zpss distribution for tubular k joints is illustrated in fig 4 2 3 fe model of tubular k joints as shown in fig 5 the crown heel point a the saddle point b and the crown toe point c around the weld intersection are located at points where φ 0 φ 90 and φ 180 respectively the 6 non dimensional geometric parameters shown in table 1 are adopted to analyze the stress distribution along the intersection of a tubular k joint in this study a mathematic model proposed by cao et al 1997 is adopted to build the space curvature of tubular joints without considering the weld profile a 20 node quadrilateral solid element is employed in ansys to establish fe model to consider the modeling of weld intersection another mathematic model proposed by lie et al 2001 is used it is proved that the mathematic model meets the requirement of the minimum thickness for the weld size in aws 2002 the sub zone mesh generation method was utilized to guarantee the mesh quality in the circumference direction the weld intersection region is divided into 64 elements since a zpss analysis requires high mesh density in the thickness direction five mesh sizes 0 10t 0 05t 0 025t 0 02t and 0 01t are selected to perform the convergence test the zpss distributions along weld intersection are compared and the result is shown in fig 6 according to the convergence test results 0 025t is selected as the final mesh density along tube thickness for zpss analysis of k joints fig 7 shows the fe model of tubular k joints in a zpss analysis 2 4 fe analysis of scfzp for tubular k joints the fe model in the hss calculation is illustrated in fig 8 according to the mesh requirement of dnv dnv 2010 the chord tube is divided into three layers in the thickness direction at the refined weld region the same 64 elements are divided in circumference direction the membrane stress and bending stress on the section at the weld toe can be obtained through integrating the notch stress along the scl at the estimation point using the equations 1 3 meanwhile the structural stress is also obtained by superimposing these two kinds of stresses then the zp can be located by finding out the interaction point between the calculated structural stress distribution and the notch stress distribution the stress state at the zp is taken as the zpss of tubular k joints through analyzing the stress state of the zpss it is found that the gradient of the bending stress at each estimation point is different the variation between the zpss and the hss will be grater where the gradient of the bending stress is large the zpss hss distributions along the weld intersection under the three elementary loadings are illustrated in fig 9 a c under the three elementary loadings the zpss hss distribution along the weld intersection of the tubular k joint have the same tendency but the absolute value of the scfzp is always somewhat smaller than that of the scfhs in some regions this is because the localized bending effect along the weld intersection caused by deformation compatibility between the chords and the braces resulting in a stress gradient through tube thickness since the zpss approach takes the structure stress at a point under the tube surface as reference stress it accounts for the stress gradient in tube thickness direction to some extent as shown in fig 9 a under axial loading when the peripheral angle φ is located between 100 and 300 close to the crown the zpss is significantly smaller than the hss which is mainly due to the obvious bending stress existing on the stress analysis plane across the scl in this region it is seen from the other two figures that there are similar local regions along the weld intersection which has a large stress gradient along thickness under in plane bending loading and out of plane bending loading 2 5 verification of the zpss approach for tubular k joints shao 2007 and shao et al 2009 obtained a large amount of stress distribution data along the weld intersection of tubular k joints by experiments and fe analyses accordingly the zpss calculation approach in this study is verified through comparison with the experimental data and the fe results in shao s work table 2 shows the geometric parameters of k joint specimen in shao s experiments shao 2007 the specimen is subjected to balanced axial loading with both ends of the chord fixed a tensile force is applied to one end of the brace while a compressive force is applied to the other end the zpss distribution along the weld intersection of shao s tubular k joint specimen is calculated using the proposed method fig 10 shows the comparison between the zpss results and shao s experimental and fe analysis results of hss it is seen that the zpss results almost have the same distribution tendency with both of the experimental and the fe results but there are still some differences between the scf values first of all at peripheral position φ 50 125 5 the scf of the zpss are bigger than the experimental scf which is abnormal this is because in the proposed method the aws specification is adopted to model the weld profile of tubular k joints and the weld size in aws specification is smaller than actual weld size resulting in a relatively conservative simulation shao 2007 this is also the reason why the zpss analysis results in present study are closer to shao s fe analysis results however around some regions the zpss analysis results are somewhat smaller than shao s fe analysis results especially around the crown area φ 150 250 this is because under axial loading there is a significant bending effect existing around crown area which causes the stress gradient in the tube thickness direction in contrast the hss results obtained in shao s work cannot reflect the stress variation in thickness direction the zpss approach for tubular k joints makes up for the defect and consider the stress gradient to some extent it makes to the zpss results somewhat smaller than shao s fe analysis results 3 multiaxial fatigue life estimation of tubular k joints 3 1 multiaxial stress state along weld intersection for tubular k joints in service axial loading in plane bending loading and its combination remain representative which result in a multiaxial stress state in addition due to the complex geometry of weld intersections the stress state at the weld toe becomes more complicated thus stress components distribution along weld intersection is analyzed under axial loading and combined loading in terms of zpss in this study the stress components are mainly divided into the normal stress perpendicular to weld toe σ shear stress parallel to weld toe τ and shear stress perpendicular to weld toe τ as shown in fig 11 the σ also belongs to the structural stress σ ss three results of stress components distribution are shown in fig 12 a b it is seen from fig 12 a that even under the uniaxial loading in spite of the obvious normal stress perpendicular to the weld toe the punching shear stress perpendicular to the weld is also significant while the shear stress parallel to the weld is substantially zero the tubular k joint is obviously located in the multiaxial fatigue stress state and the shear stress has the same magnitude as the normal stress furthermore the multiaxial degree of the stress state varies with the peripheral angle the stress component distributions under combined loading are shown in fig 12 b it is seen that under combined loading the punching shear stress is more significant and the shear stress parallel to the weld toe is still fluctuated at zero level compared with the uniaxial loading the variation of the multiaxial stress components is larger in sum under both uniaxial loading and combined loading the critical area of tubular k joints is always located in multiaxial fatigue damage state and the punching shear stress should not be ignored in fatigue analysis therefore it is more reasonable to use multiaxial fatigue theory to assess fatigue life of tubular k joints 3 2 modified wöhler curve method mwcm recently mwcm has been widely used in multiaxial fatigue strength assessment susmel et al 2017 hu et al 2019 the material plane that experiences the maximum shear stress range δ τ is taken as the critical plane in this method the normal stress range on the critical plane δ σ n is also used to evaluate the complexity of stress state of evaluation point through defining the following stress ratio 5 ρ w δ σ n δ τ the modified wohler curve can be univocally identified by its negative inverse slope k ρ w and by the reference shear stress δ τ a ref ρ w at n a cycles to failure the multiaxial s n curve used in mwcm is linearly calibrated the uniaxial tension s n curve and uniaxial torsion s n curve in standard codes through the stress ratio as specified in iiw guideline hobbacher 2008 when using structural stress to assess fatigue strength of welded steel structures fat 90 and fat 100 are recommended under tension loading and torsion loading respectively meanwhile susmel 2009 applied the tension fat 90 and torsion fat 100 s n curves to estimate the multiaxial fatigue strength of welded steel structures under the combination loading of tension and torsion and obtained satisfying estimation results in the present study the fat 90 uniaxial tension s n curve and fat100 uniaxial torsion s n curve are used to calibrate the mwcm s governing equations imposing the survival

are utilized in this study in the experiment the overall geometric parameters of k joint specimen and the boundary condition are shown in fig 13 fatigue tests were carried out under both constant and variable amplitude loading both the brace tubes and one single side of chord are subject to axial tensile compressive loading r 1 two failure criteria were defined for presentation of the test results the fatigue life to the initiation of a crack n 1 with a depth of α 1 00 mm and the fatigue life when a crack breaks through whole tube n 3 the fatigue test results are listed in table 3 sonsino 2012 since cracks were observed at the weld toe on chord within peripheral angles of 60 90 three evaluation points are added between evaluation points of 67 5 and 90 in order to find out the fatigue critical point of tubular k joint specimen to compare the deference between multiaxial fatigue estimation and uniaxial fatigue estimation the fatigue lives of tubular k joint specimen are also evaluated using uniaxial design rule cidect the comparison results under the constant amplitude loading are shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows the comparison of the multiaxial and the uniaxial fatigue estimations the multiaxial estimation results indicate that the critical area of tubular k joint specimen is located around the saddle point which is near to the heel φ is located between 67 5 and 90 and the most dangerous point is located at φ 73 125 however the uniaxial estimation results show that the critical area is located around the saddle point which is close to the crown φ is located between 90 and 112 5 and the most dangerous point is located at φ 90 saddle furthermore on the basis of the observed crack initiation the critical area of tubular k joint specimen is at φ 60 90 radaj et al 1998 the peripheral position φ 75 has been taken as the hot spot based on the advance decision of the eu report umbach and sonsino 1993 based on this analysis it seems that the fatigue critical point predicted using the proposed multiaxial fatigue estimation method is closer to the experimental results the detail calculation results are illustrated in tables 4 5 the stress state calculated in multiaxial fatigue analysis is shear stress and normal stress on the critical plane which experiences the maximum shear stress range while the uniaxial fatigue life estimation uses hot spot stress since they are different types of stress states it is not beneficial to compare the stress states shown in tables 3 5 directly therefore to have a better illustration of the proposed method only multiaxial and uniaxial fatigue lives are compared with the experimental data according to the description above in the following comparison of lives the result at φ 73 125 is taken as the final multiaxial fatigue life of the tubular k joint specimen while the result at φ 90 is adopted as the uniaxial fatigue life of the specimen the estimated n e vs experimental n f fatigue life diagram under constant amplitude loading is illustrated in fig 15 it is seen that the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives agree well with the experimental results of k joint specimen under the constant amplitude loading for both types of fatigue life the estimated multiaxial fatigue results are all located in the scatter band of error 300 especially in terms of n 1 life the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are very close to the experimental data compared with the n 3 life the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives tend to be somewhat conservative the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives in cidect show a too much conservative trend towards both types of experimental fatigue lives therefore it concludes that estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are closer to the experimental data in addition the two fatigue critical points are determined after comparing fatigue lives of all estimation points under constant amplitude loading for variable amplitude loading the critical points should be calculated again the multiaxial fatigue lives estimation under the variable amplitude loading is also performed using the zpss approach integrated mwcm in the variable amplitude loading tests the spectrum of relative load applied is colos common load sequence which has a maximum cumulative frequency of l s 4 94 10 5 cycles the calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 16 using equations as following 9 d s p e c i 1 n h i n f i 10 n c a l c l s d s p e c d r e a l the damage sum d r e a l is determined as 0 5 after eu report umbach and sonsino 1993 the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives under variable amplitude using the proposed method and the uniaxial estimation results are illustrated in fig 17 as is shown in fig 17 the multiaxial fatigue estimation results also agree well with the experiment results and tend to be precise with the n 1 life compared with experimental results the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives based on cidect are much conservative for n 3 life which are out of the error bands the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives show a trend to lie within the n 1 life and n 3 life but close to the n 1 life in terms of the n 3 life the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are somewhat conservative 4 discussions 4 1 stress analysis there are two difficulties in multiaxial fatigue estimation for tubular k joints one is how to account for the multiaxial stress state at the weld toe and the other one is how to obtain the stress components that can be conveniently integrated with multiaxial fatigue damage criterion the hss approach is widely utilized to calculate the stress state in engineering however since the hss approach only considers the peak stress at tube surface and the multiaxial stress components need to be extrapolated separately to obtain the multiaxial stress state at hot spots it is hard to use the hss approach to assess multiaxial fatigue strength comprehensively in this paper the zpss approach is improved to analyze the structure stress distribution along the weld intersection of tubular k joints one advantage of the zpss approach is that it can obtain the multiaxial stress state directly from fe analysis without stress extrapolation in multi direction therefore it is convenient to use the zpss approach to assess multiaxial fatigue strength of complex structures combined with multiaxial fatigue damage criterion such as mwcm in addition it can also consider the stress gradient in the thickness direction to some extent which leads to a higher accuracy in stress analysis of tubular joints than the hss approach through the comparison between zpss and hss distribution along the weld intersection of tubular k joints under different loadings it is found that in certain areas there would be a significant bending effect which causes an obvious stress gradient in the thickness direction where the zpss is much smaller than the hss on the surface in such areas the hss approach gives a relatively conservative estimation in contrast the zpss approach uses the structure stress at a point which is near to tube surface to reflect the stress condition of whole tube section therefore the zpss distribution is considered to represent the magnitude of stress along the weld intersection as well as the stress distribution along tube thickness according to the comparison with shao s experimental data and fe analysis results the zpss distribution agrees well with shao s numerical results meanwhile the zpss value tends to be somewhat smaller than shao s fe analysis results which indicates that the zpss takes account for the stress gradient effect since the zpss distribution of tubular k joints varies with geometric parameters the authors performed a sensitivity analysis with the five geometric parameters α β γ τ θ it is found that α has no effect on the zpss distribution or the value while θ influences the zpss distribution and values significantly the other 3 parameters also have some influence on the zpss distribution therefore it concludes that the zpss analysis of tubular k joints is pretty sensitive to the parameter θ which will be taken as the main parameter in the subsequent research of parametric equation of zpss distribution 4 2 multiaxial fatigue life prediction in order to consider the multiaxial stress state in fatigue life estimation the mwcm is integrated with zpss approach in this paper to develop a multiaxial fatigue life prediction method for tubular k joints the multiaxial stress states along weld intersection are analyzed in terms of zpss the results show that although the normal stress perpendicular to the weld toe dominates the punching shear stress perpendicular to weld toe cannot be ignored in fatigue lives assessment of tubular k joints therefore the multiaxial fatigue criterion is more reasonable to assess fatigue lives of tubular k joints in this study the multiaxial fatigue estimation results indicate that the critical area of specimen is around the saddle point chose to heel φ 67 5 90 and final hot spot of tubular k joint specimen is determined at the peripheral position φ 73 125 radaj et al 1998 pointed out that the crack initiation was observed around the position 0 30 from the saddle point to the heel and the peripheral angle φ 75 was taken as the hot spot in fatigue analysis therefore we conclude that our multiaxial fatigue lives estimation method predicts the crack initiation point with good accuracy in contrast the uniaxial estimation using design rule cidect finds that the critical area lied between the saddle and the crown φ 90 112 5 and the hot spot is determined at the peripheral position φ 90 it is obviously that uniaxial estimation method deviates from experiment results actually the same analysis phenomenon happened in sonsino s work radaj et al 1998 also used the hss approach to reevaluate the fatigue lives of tubular k joint specimen his analysis results showed that the calculated maximum structure stress occurred at the peripheral position φ 50 and the critical area were located around φ 0 50 it was seen that his prediction also had a deviation from experiment results radaj et al 1998 explained this by the inappropriateness of fe model using shell element the authors used solid element to model the tubular k joint specimen and analyzed its uniaxial fatigue lives using the hss approach in this paper the results indicated that the maximum structure stress area is not the crack initiation area and has a deviation in hot spot determination in the authors opinion it may be due to the effect of shear stress existing along weld intersection it is because the multiaxial fatigue lives estimation method proposed in this paper can fully consider the multiaxial stress state so that it can make a reliable prediction of critical point of the k joint specimen furthermore in terms of lives values the comparison of multiaxial fatigue estimation cidect estimation and experiment data shows that estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are closer to experimental results under both constant and variable amplitude loading the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives of the tubular k joint specimen tend to be too conservative which is in line with the results of sonsino 2012 one of the reasons would be because the hss can only represent the surface peak stress without considering stress gradient effect another factor may be due to the conservation of uniaxial tubular s n curve itself even though only the normal stress is considered the results still tend to be conservative on the contrary the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives using mwcm in terms of zpss have a precise agreement with the n 1 life and tend to be conservative towards the n 3 life generally the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives show a trend to be located within the n 1 and n 3 life which is more reasonable and acceptable in engineering furthermore although the test data point numbers are limited the multiaxial fatigue estimation results are closer to experimental data points compared to the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives it indicates that the proposed method gives a better multiaxial fatigue life estimation to some extent in general using the proposed method the multiaxial stress state could be considered through defining the stress ratio on the critical plane it is found in this study that for the same tubular joint the stress ratio varies if the evaluation points are changed which implies the modified s n curves are not identical at different evaluation points therefore it may happen that under a cyclic loading of same type but of different amplitudes the critical points for fatigue life may occur at different locations of test specimens of the same geometry this is because s n curves with different slopes intercept it means that at a certain loading amplitude the fatigue lives at variable estimation points are the same meanwhile other loading amplitudes located at two sides of that amplitude would result in a different determination of which point has the minimum life therefore it leads to the phenomenon that the critical point in multiaxial fatigue life estimation moves with loading amplitudes however the tests are too few to draw any conclusions in future the authors plan to carry more fatigue tests of with wider force ranges to further verify the proposed multiaxial fatigue assessment method 5 conclusion in this paper an improved zero point structural stress method is used to analyze the stress distribution along weld intersection of tubular k joints combined with the mwcm method as multiaxial fatigue damage criterion a multiaxial fatigue life assessment method for tubular k joints is proposed in terms of stress analysis the proposed method has two major advantages firstly the stress components of the zero position can be extracted directly from fe analysis results without any multiaxial stress extrapolation secondly the comparison between shao s results of scf distribution and zpss analysis results show that the method not only reflects the stress distribution along the weld intersection but also accounts for the stress gradient in the thickness direction to some extent in terms of fatigue life prediction the comparisons show that proposed method predicts the fatigue critical point well it is also found that the multiaxial fatigue life predicted using the proposed method agrees well with the experimental results credit authorship contribution statement chuanheng xu software validation data curation writing original draft gang

21694,tubular k joints frequently employed in offshore structures are subjected to multiaxial stresses it is difficult to accurately assess fatigue strength of tubular k joints using the uniaxial fatigue theory in this paper a multiaxial fatigue life prediction method for tubular k joints is proposed which is based on an improved zero point structure stress zpss approach that accounts for the stress gradient in the thickness direction to quantify the structure stress at the weld toe of a tubular k joint the multiaxial fatigue life is predicted making use of the modified wöhler curve method mwcm as the multiaxial damage criterion it is found that the multiaxial fatigue estimation using the proposed method predicts the fatigue critical point well meanwhile the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are much closer to experimental lives in comparison with the uniaxial fatigue estimation using the cidect specification graphical abstract in this paper an improved zero point structure stress zpss approach for tubular k joints is proposed with which the multiaxial stress state at fatigue critical point can be extracted conveniently combined with the modified wöhler curve method mwcm the multiaxial fatigue life of tubular k joints can be predicted well in terms of zpss as shown in fig 1 a the stress classification line scl which is perpendicular to the tube surface at the weld toe is adopted as the reference line of zpss calculation for tubular k joints the structural stress distribution can be calculated by integrating the notch stress σ ln at the points along the scl and the structural stress at the interaction point between the structural stress distribution and the notch stress distribution is the zpss on some one plane then through traversing the zpss results on all planes across scl as shown in fig 1 b the final zpss can be obtained a scl definition b notch stress distribution along scl on one plane fig 1 zpss calculation of tubular joints image 1 keywords tubular k joints structure stress multiaxial fatigue stress gradient experiment 1 introduction tubular k joints are widely used in offshore industry however tubular joints are susceptible to fatigue damage caused by high stress concentration and cyclic wave induced loading ahmadi 2016 furthermore due to the combination of elementary loadings applied to tubular k joints in service and complex geometry around weld toe the multiaxial stress state along the weld intersection leads to the fatigue life assessment of tubular k joints more complicated in practice uniaxial fatigue theory is recommended for fatigue life estimation of tubular k joints which is based on the hot spot stress hss approach with uniaxial s n curves generally a hss can be calculated directly by multiplying the nominal stress by a stress concentration factor scf at a hot spot based on the work of romeijn 1994 dijkstra et al 1996 and karamanos 1997 several parametric scf equations at saddle and crown point of uniplanar k joints under elementary loadings are provided in the design rule of tubular joints cidect zhao et al 2000 however a scf under combined loading cannot be derived from these parametric equations shao et al 2009 due to the fact that a theoretical hot spot can be at any point along the weld intersection when subjected to combined loadings and even fixed elementary loadings shao et al 2006 shao 2007 american petroleum institute api 1993 proposed a simplified method that the scf under combined loading is defined as the sum of the scfs of the various uniaxial loadings this approach however is deemed excessively conservative because the hot spots under elementary loadings differ shao et al 2009 a superimposition method was utilized to calculate a more accurate hss of a tubular joint under combined loading by superposing the stress distributions from each of uniaxial loadings gulati et al 1982 chang and dover 1999a 1999b proposed several sets of parametric equations to predict the stress distribution along chord brace intersections of tubular y t joints despite of the advantages this method tends to predict fatigue lives of greater dispersions using the hss approach for fatigue assessment of tubular k joints can be problematic firstly the hss indicates the surface peak stress but not the stress gradient it has been found through experiments that fatigue lives of welded structures not only depend on the peak stress on the surface but also on the stress gradient in the thickness direction connolly 1986 ahmadi and shadi 2016 secondly shell elements are often used for finite element fe analysis of tubular joints which do not accurately account for the three dimensional behavior of the welded joints radaj et al 1998 through numbers of numerical simulations it was found that solid element is the best element in modeling tubular joints herion et al 1996 in addition the multiaxial stress state along the weld intersections of tubular joints has not been considered in the traditional uniaxial fatigue theory thévenet 2013 investigated the fatigue behavior of tubular t joints under deviated bending using the uniaxial s n curve method recommended in iiw hobbacher 2008 and found that the fatigue life predicted tended to be scattered compared with the experiment data the multiaxial stress state has a significant effect on fatigue life especially when the phase correlation exists between multiaxial components recent experiments show that a non proportional shear stress superimposed on a normal stress causes a significant reduction in fatigue life of ductile materials sonsino 2020 herein it is of great significance to develop a multiaxial fatigue life prediction method that multiaxial stress state as well as stress gradient effect can be considered which stands for the effect of stress variation along the tube thickness on fatigue life for improving fatigue strength assessment accuracy of tubular k joints in recent years the modified wöhler curve method mwcm has been introduced for multiaxial fatigue assessment susmel and lazzarin 2002 susmel and tovo 2004 using the mwcm the multiaxial fatigue s n curve is calibrated by the uniaxial tension and torsion fatigue curve in standard codes the hss approach was utilized to assess multiaxial fatigue strength of flange plate structures combined with mwcm and the results showed a good agreement with the experimental data susmel and tovo 2006 susmel 2009 however the hss approach cannot be simply integrated with the mwcm for fatigue life prediction of tubular k joints it has to extrapolate the normal stress perpendicular to the weld toe the shear stress parallel and perpendicular to the weld toe separately in view of this the zero point structure stress zpss approach was proposed for multiaxial fatigue assessment liu et al 2014 2015 in which the zpss can be extracted directly from a post processing of a fe analysis without multiaxial stress extrapolation however it was not possible to apply this method to calculate multiaxial stress state of tubular k joints in this paper a multiaxial fatigue life assessment method based on an improved zpss approach is proposed the rest of this article is organized as following firstly the improved zpss approach for stress calculation of tubular k joints is described secondly the zpss distributions along the weld intersection of k joints are analyzed under three elementary loadings with the multiaxial fatigue life of tubular k joints estimated finally the accuracy of the proposed method is compared with the experiment data as well as the numerical results based on the uniaxial standard cidect method followed by discussions and conclusions 2 zpss approach for tubular k joints 2 1 zpss definition in general the local notch stress σ ln along the chord brace intersection of tubular joints can be separated into two components as shown in fig 1 a one part is the structure stress σ ss which is the sum of the membrane stress σ m and the bending stress σ b the other part is the nonlinear peak stress σ nlp which is caused by highly localized deformations around weld toe the nonlinear peak stress may be critical for crack initiation but it is not the controlling factor as cracks propagate through thickness in addition the nonlinear peak stress varies with geometry parameters of weld that a deterministic value is hard to reach chang and dover 1999a for this reason only the structure stress is adopted to predict the fatigue strength of tubular k joints the stress components can be obtained through refined stress analysis using equations as follows liu et al 2014 1 σ m 1 t 0 t σ ln x d x 2 σ b 6 t 2 0 t σ ln x t 2 x d x 3 σ nlp x σ ln x σ m 1 2 x t σ b where t is the tube thickness and σ ln x is the local notch stress distribution from x 0 at surface to x t along the tube thickness the structure stress has a linear distribution along the tube thickness and balances the external loads the nonlinear peak stress should therefore be in self equilibrium thus the nonlinear peak stress has to come to zero value at a point along tube thickness liu et al 2014 named the point as zero point zp at the zp the local notch stress is equal to the structure stress without the notch effect of the weld toe as shown in fig 1 b similar to the hss approach the structure stress at the zp is taken as the reference stress in fatigue strength assessment which can be obtained directly through fe post processing the location of the zp can be obtained by solving the intersection point of the structure stress curve and the notch stress curve as shown in the following equation liu et al 2014 4 d zp σ m σ b σ ln d zp 2 σ b t where d zp is the distance from the zero point to the outer surface of the tube as shown in fig 1 b 2 2 the zpss calculation of tubular k joints in comparison with plate welded joints tubular k joints require zpss analyses at all the evaluation points along the weld intersection to obtain the zpss distribution which makes the zpss calculation of tubular k joints more complicated in addition during the zpss analysis of tubular k joints the coordinates of each evaluation point are extracted directly to establish the local coordinate system at the weld toe compared with the previous zpss approach the zpss calculation of k joints becomes more convenient and effective as shown in fig 2 the evaluation points are placed at the weld toe on the chord at an interval of 22 5 and the peripheral angle φ is measured from the heel to the crown as illustrated in fig 3 a the stress classification line scl is the reference line perpendicular to the tube surface asme 2004 the notch stress σ ln perpendicular to the scl is used to calculate the zpss at each peripheral angle φ it is firstly necessary to transform the stress tensor into the local coordinate system at the weld toe three directions of local coordinate are perpendicular to weld toe parallel to weld toe and along the scl respectively then through traversing the zpss results on all planes along scl the largest zpss and its corresponding zp are taken as the zpss and the zp at this evaluation point as shown in fig 3 b the δ1 δ2 δ3 means some of the planes across the scl the calculation flowchart of the zpss distribution for tubular k joints is illustrated in fig 4 2 3 fe model of tubular k joints as shown in fig 5 the crown heel point a the saddle point b and the crown toe point c around the weld intersection are located at points where φ 0 φ 90 and φ 180 respectively the 6 non dimensional geometric parameters shown in table 1 are adopted to analyze the stress distribution along the intersection of a tubular k joint in this study a mathematic model proposed by cao et al 1997 is adopted to build the space curvature of tubular joints without considering the weld profile a 20 node quadrilateral solid element is employed in ansys to establish fe model to consider the modeling of weld intersection another mathematic model proposed by lie et al 2001 is used it is proved that the mathematic model meets the requirement of the minimum thickness for the weld size in aws 2002 the sub zone mesh generation method was utilized to guarantee the mesh quality in the circumference direction the weld intersection region is divided into 64 elements since a zpss analysis requires high mesh density in the thickness direction five mesh sizes 0 10t 0 05t 0 025t 0 02t and 0 01t are selected to perform the convergence test the zpss distributions along weld intersection are compared and the result is shown in fig 6 according to the convergence test results 0 025t is selected as the final mesh density along tube thickness for zpss analysis of k joints fig 7 shows the fe model of tubular k joints in a zpss analysis 2 4 fe analysis of scfzp for tubular k joints the fe model in the hss calculation is illustrated in fig 8 according to the mesh requirement of dnv dnv 2010 the chord tube is divided into three layers in the thickness direction at the refined weld region the same 64 elements are divided in circumference direction the membrane stress and bending stress on the section at the weld toe can be obtained through integrating the notch stress along the scl at the estimation point using the equations 1 3 meanwhile the structural stress is also obtained by superimposing these two kinds of stresses then the zp can be located by finding out the interaction point between the calculated structural stress distribution and the notch stress distribution the stress state at the zp is taken as the zpss of tubular k joints through analyzing the stress state of the zpss it is found that the gradient of the bending stress at each estimation point is different the variation between the zpss and the hss will be grater where the gradient of the bending stress is large the zpss hss distributions along the weld intersection under the three elementary loadings are illustrated in fig 9 a c under the three elementary loadings the zpss hss distribution along the weld intersection of the tubular k joint have the same tendency but the absolute value of the scfzp is always somewhat smaller than that of the scfhs in some regions this is because the localized bending effect along the weld intersection caused by deformation compatibility between the chords and the braces resulting in a stress gradient through tube thickness since the zpss approach takes the structure stress at a point under the tube surface as reference stress it accounts for the stress gradient in tube thickness direction to some extent as shown in fig 9 a under axial loading when the peripheral angle φ is located between 100 and 300 close to the crown the zpss is significantly smaller than the hss which is mainly due to the obvious bending stress existing on the stress analysis plane across the scl in this region it is seen from the other two figures that there are similar local regions along the weld intersection which has a large stress gradient along thickness under in plane bending loading and out of plane bending loading 2 5 verification of the zpss approach for tubular k joints shao 2007 and shao et al 2009 obtained a large amount of stress distribution data along the weld intersection of tubular k joints by experiments and fe analyses accordingly the zpss calculation approach in this study is verified through comparison with the experimental data and the fe results in shao s work table 2 shows the geometric parameters of k joint specimen in shao s experiments shao 2007 the specimen is subjected to balanced axial loading with both ends of the chord fixed a tensile force is applied to one end of the brace while a compressive force is applied to the other end the zpss distribution along the weld intersection of shao s tubular k joint specimen is calculated using the proposed method fig 10 shows the comparison between the zpss results and shao s experimental and fe analysis results of hss it is seen that the zpss results almost have the same distribution tendency with both of the experimental and the fe results but there are still some differences between the scf values first of all at peripheral position φ 50 125 5 the scf of the zpss are bigger than the experimental scf which is abnormal this is because in the proposed method the aws specification is adopted to model the weld profile of tubular k joints and the weld size in aws specification is smaller than actual weld size resulting in a relatively conservative simulation shao 2007 this is also the reason why the zpss analysis results in present study are closer to shao s fe analysis results however around some regions the zpss analysis results are somewhat smaller than shao s fe analysis results especially around the crown area φ 150 250 this is because under axial loading there is a significant bending effect existing around crown area which causes the stress gradient in the tube thickness direction in contrast the hss results obtained in shao s work cannot reflect the stress variation in thickness direction the zpss approach for tubular k joints makes up for the defect and consider the stress gradient to some extent it makes to the zpss results somewhat smaller than shao s fe analysis results 3 multiaxial fatigue life estimation of tubular k joints 3 1 multiaxial stress state along weld intersection for tubular k joints in service axial loading in plane bending loading and its combination remain representative which result in a multiaxial stress state in addition due to the complex geometry of weld intersections the stress state at the weld toe becomes more complicated thus stress components distribution along weld intersection is analyzed under axial loading and combined loading in terms of zpss in this study the stress components are mainly divided into the normal stress perpendicular to weld toe σ shear stress parallel to weld toe τ and shear stress perpendicular to weld toe τ as shown in fig 11 the σ also belongs to the structural stress σ ss three results of stress components distribution are shown in fig 12 a b it is seen from fig 12 a that even under the uniaxial loading in spite of the obvious normal stress perpendicular to the weld toe the punching shear stress perpendicular to the weld is also significant while the shear stress parallel to the weld is substantially zero the tubular k joint is obviously located in the multiaxial fatigue stress state and the shear stress has the same magnitude as the normal stress furthermore the multiaxial degree of the stress state varies with the peripheral angle the stress component distributions under combined loading are shown in fig 12 b it is seen that under combined loading the punching shear stress is more significant and the shear stress parallel to the weld toe is still fluctuated at zero level compared with the uniaxial loading the variation of the multiaxial stress components is larger in sum under both uniaxial loading and combined loading the critical area of tubular k joints is always located in multiaxial fatigue damage state and the punching shear stress should not be ignored in fatigue analysis therefore it is more reasonable to use multiaxial fatigue theory to assess fatigue life of tubular k joints 3 2 modified wöhler curve method mwcm recently mwcm has been widely used in multiaxial fatigue strength assessment susmel et al 2017 hu et al 2019 the material plane that experiences the maximum shear stress range δ τ is taken as the critical plane in this method the normal stress range on the critical plane δ σ n is also used to evaluate the complexity of stress state of evaluation point through defining the following stress ratio 5 ρ w δ σ n δ τ the modified wohler curve can be univocally identified by its negative inverse slope k ρ w and by the reference shear stress δ τ a ref ρ w at n a cycles to failure the multiaxial s n curve used in mwcm is linearly calibrated the uniaxial tension s n curve and uniaxial torsion s n curve in standard codes through the stress ratio as specified in iiw guideline hobbacher 2008 when using structural stress to assess fatigue strength of welded steel structures fat 90 and fat 100 are recommended under tension loading and torsion loading respectively meanwhile susmel 2009 applied the tension fat 90 and torsion fat 100 s n curves to estimate the multiaxial fatigue strength of welded steel structures under the combination loading of tension and torsion and obtained satisfying estimation results in the present study the fat 90 uniaxial tension s n curve and fat100 uniaxial torsion s n curve are used to calibrate the mwcm s governing equations imposing the survival probability to 50 the equations are depicted as follows 6 k ρ w 2 ρ w 5 0 ρ w 1 4 k ρ w 3 ρ w 1 4 7 δ τ a ref ρ w 83 ρ w 149 mpa 0 ρ w 1 4 δ τ a ref ρ w 32 8 mpa ρ w 1 4 the multiaxial fatigue lifetime can be calculated using following equation 8 n f n a δ τ a ref ρ w δ τ k τ ρ w 3 3 multiaxial fatigue life prediction of tubular k joints experimental results from literature radaj et al 1998 are utilized in this study in the experiment the overall geometric parameters of k joint specimen and the boundary condition are shown in fig 13 fatigue tests were carried out under both constant and variable amplitude loading both the brace tubes and one single side of chord are subject to axial tensile compressive loading r 1 two failure criteria were defined for presentation of the test results the fatigue life to the initiation of a crack n 1 with a depth of α 1 00 mm and the fatigue life when a crack breaks through whole tube n 3 the fatigue test results are listed in table 3 sonsino 2012 since cracks were observed at the weld toe on chord within peripheral angles of 60 90 three evaluation points are added between evaluation points of 67 5 and 90 in order to find out the fatigue critical point of tubular k joint specimen to compare the deference between multiaxial fatigue estimation and uniaxial fatigue estimation the fatigue lives of tubular k joint specimen are also evaluated using uniaxial design rule cidect the comparison results under the constant amplitude loading are shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows the comparison of the multiaxial and the uniaxial fatigue estimations the multiaxial estimation results indicate that the critical area of tubular k joint specimen is located around the saddle point which is near to the heel φ is located between 67 5 and 90 and the most dangerous point is located at φ 73 125 however the uniaxial estimation results show that the critical area is located around the saddle point which is close to the crown φ is located between 90 and 112 5 and the most dangerous point is located at φ 90 saddle furthermore on the basis of the observed crack initiation the critical area of tubular k joint specimen is at φ 60 90 radaj et al 1998 the peripheral position φ 75 has been taken as the hot spot based on the advance decision of the eu report umbach and sonsino 1993 based on this analysis it seems that the fatigue critical point predicted using the proposed multiaxial fatigue estimation method is closer to the experimental results the detail calculation results are illustrated in tables 4 5 the stress state calculated in multiaxial fatigue analysis is shear stress and normal stress on the critical plane which experiences the maximum shear stress range while the uniaxial fatigue life estimation uses hot spot stress since they are different types of stress states it is not beneficial to compare the stress states shown in tables 3 5 directly therefore to have a better illustration of the proposed method only multiaxial and uniaxial fatigue lives are compared with the experimental data according to the description above in the following comparison of lives the result at φ 73 125 is taken as the final multiaxial fatigue life of the tubular k joint specimen while the result at φ 90 is adopted as the uniaxial fatigue life of the specimen the estimated n e vs experimental n f fatigue life diagram under constant amplitude loading is illustrated in fig 15 it is seen that the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives agree well with the experimental results of k joint specimen under the constant amplitude loading for both types of fatigue life the estimated multiaxial fatigue results are all located in the scatter band of error 300 especially in terms of n 1 life the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are very close to the experimental data compared with the n 3 life the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives tend to be somewhat conservative the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives in cidect show a too much conservative trend towards both types of experimental fatigue lives therefore it concludes that estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are closer to the experimental data in addition the two fatigue critical points are determined after comparing fatigue lives of all estimation points under constant amplitude loading for variable amplitude loading the critical points should be calculated again the multiaxial fatigue lives estimation under the variable amplitude loading is also performed using the zpss approach integrated mwcm in the variable amplitude loading tests the spectrum of relative load applied is colos common load sequence which has a maximum cumulative frequency of l s 4 94 10 5 cycles the calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 16 using equations as following 9 d s p e c i 1 n h i n f i 10 n c a l c l s d s p e c d r e a l the damage sum d r e a l is determined as 0 5 after eu report umbach and sonsino 1993 the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives under variable amplitude using the proposed method and the uniaxial estimation results are illustrated in fig 17 as is shown in fig 17 the multiaxial fatigue estimation results also agree well with the experiment results and tend to be precise with the n 1 life compared with experimental results the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives based on cidect are much conservative for n 3 life which are out of the error bands the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives show a trend to lie within the n 1 life and n 3 life but close to the n 1 life in terms of the n 3 life the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are somewhat conservative 4 discussions 4 1 stress analysis there are two difficulties in multiaxial fatigue estimation for tubular k joints one is how to account for the multiaxial stress state at the weld toe and the other one is how to obtain the stress components that can be conveniently integrated with multiaxial fatigue damage criterion the hss approach is widely utilized to calculate the stress state in engineering however since the hss approach only considers the peak stress at tube surface and the multiaxial stress components need to be extrapolated separately to obtain the multiaxial stress state at hot spots it is hard to use the hss approach to assess multiaxial fatigue strength comprehensively in this paper the zpss approach is improved to analyze the structure stress distribution along the weld intersection of tubular k joints one advantage of the zpss approach is that it can obtain the multiaxial stress state directly from fe analysis without stress extrapolation in multi direction therefore it is convenient to use the zpss approach to assess multiaxial fatigue strength of complex structures combined with multiaxial fatigue damage criterion such as mwcm in addition it can also consider the stress gradient in the thickness direction to some extent which leads to a higher accuracy in stress analysis of tubular joints than the hss approach through the comparison between zpss and hss distribution along the weld intersection of tubular k joints under different loadings it is found that in certain areas there would be a significant bending effect which causes an obvious stress gradient in the thickness direction where the zpss is much smaller than the hss on the surface in such areas the hss approach gives a relatively conservative estimation in contrast the zpss approach uses the structure stress at a point which is near to tube surface to reflect the stress condition of whole tube section therefore the zpss distribution is considered to represent the magnitude of stress along the weld intersection as well as the stress distribution along tube thickness according to the comparison with shao s experimental data and fe analysis results the zpss distribution agrees well with shao s numerical results meanwhile the zpss value tends to be somewhat smaller than shao s fe analysis results which indicates that the zpss takes account for the stress gradient effect since the zpss distribution of tubular k joints varies with geometric parameters the authors performed a sensitivity analysis with the five geometric parameters α β γ τ θ it is found that α has no effect on the zpss distribution or the value while θ influences the zpss distribution and values significantly the other 3 parameters also have some influence on the zpss distribution therefore it concludes that the zpss analysis of tubular k joints is pretty sensitive to the parameter θ which will be taken as the main parameter in the subsequent research of parametric equation of zpss distribution 4 2 multiaxial fatigue life prediction in order to consider the multiaxial stress state in fatigue life estimation the mwcm is integrated with zpss approach in this paper to develop a multiaxial fatigue life prediction method for tubular k joints the multiaxial stress states along weld intersection are analyzed in terms of zpss the results show that although the normal stress perpendicular to the weld toe dominates the punching shear stress perpendicular to weld toe cannot be ignored in fatigue lives assessment of tubular k joints therefore the multiaxial fatigue criterion is more reasonable to assess fatigue lives of tubular k joints in this study the multiaxial fatigue estimation results indicate that the critical area of specimen is around the saddle point chose to heel φ 67 5 90 and final hot spot of tubular k joint specimen is determined at the peripheral position φ 73 125 radaj et al 1998 pointed out that the crack initiation was observed around the position 0 30 from the saddle point to the heel and the peripheral angle φ 75 was taken as the hot spot in fatigue analysis therefore we conclude that our multiaxial fatigue lives estimation method predicts the crack initiation point with good accuracy in contrast the uniaxial estimation using design rule cidect finds that the critical area lied between the saddle and the crown φ 90 112 5 and the hot spot is determined at the peripheral position φ 90 it is obviously that uniaxial estimation method deviates from experiment results actually the same analysis phenomenon happened in sonsino s work radaj et al 1998 also used the hss approach to reevaluate the fatigue lives of tubular k joint specimen his analysis results showed that the calculated maximum structure stress occurred at the peripheral position φ 50 and the critical area were located around φ 0 50 it was seen that his prediction also had a deviation from experiment results radaj et al 1998 explained this by the inappropriateness of fe model using shell element the authors used solid element to model the tubular k joint specimen and analyzed its uniaxial fatigue lives using the hss approach in this paper the results indicated that the maximum structure stress area is not the crack initiation area and has a deviation in hot spot determination in the authors opinion it may be due to the effect of shear stress existing along weld intersection it is because the multiaxial fatigue lives estimation method proposed in this paper can fully consider the multiaxial stress state so that it can make a reliable prediction of critical point of the k joint specimen furthermore in terms of lives values the comparison of multiaxial fatigue estimation cidect estimation and experiment data shows that estimated multiaxial fatigue lives are closer to experimental results under both constant and variable amplitude loading the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives of the tubular k joint specimen tend to be too conservative which is in line with the results of sonsino 2012 one of the reasons would be because the hss can only represent the surface peak stress without considering stress gradient effect another factor may be due to the conservation of uniaxial tubular s n curve itself even though only the normal stress is considered the results still tend to be conservative on the contrary the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives using mwcm in terms of zpss have a precise agreement with the n 1 life and tend to be conservative towards the n 3 life generally the estimated multiaxial fatigue lives show a trend to be located within the n 1 and n 3 life which is more reasonable and acceptable in engineering furthermore although the test data point numbers are limited the multiaxial fatigue estimation results are closer to experimental data points compared to the estimated uniaxial fatigue lives it indicates that the proposed method gives a better multiaxial fatigue life estimation to some extent in general using the proposed method the multiaxial stress state could be considered through defining the stress ratio on the critical plane it is found in this study that for the same tubular joint the stress ratio varies if the evaluation points are changed which implies the modified s n curves are not identical at different evaluation points therefore it may happen that under a cyclic loading of same type but of different amplitudes the critical points for fatigue life may occur at different locations of test specimens of the same geometry this is because s n curves with different slopes intercept it means that at a certain loading amplitude the fatigue lives at variable estimation points are the same meanwhile other loading amplitudes located at two sides of that amplitude would result in a different determination of which point has the minimum life therefore it leads to the phenomenon that the critical point in multiaxial fatigue life estimation moves with loading amplitudes however the tests are too few to draw any conclusions in future the authors plan to carry more fatigue tests of with wider force ranges to further verify the proposed multiaxial fatigue assessment method 5 conclusion in this paper an improved zero point structural stress method is used to analyze the stress distribution along weld intersection of tubular k joints combined with the mwcm method as multiaxial fatigue damage criterion a multiaxial fatigue life assessment method for tubular k joints is proposed in terms of stress analysis the proposed method has two major advantages firstly the stress components of the zero position can be extracted directly from fe analysis results without any multiaxial stress extrapolation secondly the comparison between shao s results of scf distribution and zpss analysis results show that the method not only reflects the stress distribution along the weld intersection but also accounts for the stress gradient in the thickness direction to some extent in terms of fatigue life prediction the comparisons show that proposed method predicts the fatigue critical point well it is also found that the multiaxial fatigue life predicted using the proposed method agrees well with the experimental results credit authorship contribution statement chuanheng xu software validation data curation writing original draft gang
