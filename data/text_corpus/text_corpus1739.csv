8695,water is one of the most important inputs in the production process especially for the manufacturing sector however at the same time this resource can present shortage problems mainly due to a lack of knowledge about its value in most emerging countries the monetary value of water used in the production process does not necessarily reflect that there is a shortage or the costs of catchment and treatment thus the real cost of water is not paid in addition it is vital that the various manufacturing industries consider the opportunity cost or shadow price of consuming water for its production processes therefore this paper estimates the economic value of water evw for the manufacturing industry in a water basin with shortage problems valley of mexico basin vmb mexico this is understood as the shadow price using the concept of production elasticity with respect to water input εw and the value of the marginal product ρw to that end we used information from 69 984 economic units surveyed in 2013 and considered one type of production function i e translog the εw was estimated at 0 061 and the ρw at us 19 4 m3 the ρw ranged from us 2 3 m3 for the wood sector to us 20 1 m3 for the beverage and tobacco sector demonstrating variation in ρw by sector the results have important implications for several areas of industrial water management especially for water basins where this resource presents shortage problems any investment in new industrial water supply projects requires information on the industrial evw that information is also needed in order to determine how to efficiently distribute scarce water resources across sectors keywords economic value water manufacturing industry scarcity 1 introduction while the supply of water in mexico is considered abundant in absolute terms the country faces a serious problem with relative shortage 1 this problem is reflected in an inability to meet water demand in some of the country s basins especially those that have undergone greater population growth over the years the valley of mexico basin vmb occupies less than 1 of the national territory and yet it is inhabited by 20 of the country s total population and generates approximately 31 3 of the nation s gross domestic product gdp 2 in 2015 the water demand for population and economic activities in the vmb was 3330 1 hm3 which exceeded what the basin could offer in per capita terms this represents a water usage of 155 5 m3 year which is well above the 89 8 m3 year of renewable water captured in the basin natural media availability nma 1 this excessive extraction over and above the nma is explained by the overexploitation of aquifers in the basin 36 2 m3 year and the importation of water from other basins 29 4 m3 year the relative water stress index rwsi which links the total volume of water allotted through concessions and the nma of the water multiplied by 100 is 140 4 for the vmb making it one of the regions with the greatest pressure on its water resources along with yemen and the united arab emirates in this context of extreme water stress it is imperative to adopt policies that ensure that the various water uses in basins are efficient the main sectors that currently consume water in the vmb are in order of importance urban domestic agricultural industrial and livestock 2 the manufacturing industry plays a key role in the dynamics of the economic activity of the vmb it accounts for one fifth of the basin s gdp generates employment as well as goods and services for consumption by the region s population and exports outside the basin and the country 1 water is an essential resource for the production processes that are carried out by the industries located in the basin in 2015 alone they used approximately 127 million m3 for those processes which is 10 1 of the water used by industry nationwide 3 the manufacturing industry extracts most of the water it uses for its production processes from aquifers which are currently so overexploited that they have been declared closed with a reported null availability of the resource further exploitation would cause them irreversible damage in addition to complement its water needs industry uses water from the urban public supply which also mainly comes from aquifers with the same adverse impacts on those bodies of water 4 however as in most emerging or developing countries the monetary value of this resource for the production process does not necessarily reflect water shortages or catchment and treatment costs that is the real cost of the water is not paid which prevents awareness of its inefficient use waste and contamination 5 in addition overall in mexico and in the vmb in particular the state generally regulates the price of water and therefore that price general does not reflect the importance of the water s value to industry the use of water by the manufacturing industry adds value to the product or service that is sold and this additional value is the value of the water that is incorporated into its process which reflects what consumers effectively pay for the use of the resource this article is aimed at estimating this value of the water used by the manufacturing industry in the vmb in order to identify the sectors or sub industries that generate more added value and those that generate less moreover knowing the economic value of water evw both generally and by economic sector is useful for properly and efficiently managing water 5 first it provides a tool that decision makers on water issues can use to determine future investments based on technical criteria this is useful given that nations continue to invest in water resources especially developing countries and thus water is one of the main components of public infrastructure budgets second an economic evaluation is important because it makes it possible to determine whether or not a company or in this case companies would favor water supply projects lastly the evw is useful for evaluating the design and implementation of public policies not only for investments in construction but also in more efficient water management for example the economic value of water can be used to optimize the allocation of the resource among the various sectors and objectives when there is a shortage water imbalance or a disruption in the supply as in the vmb water users may not be able to obtain all the water they need for their economic activities and therefore sharing the limited supply can become a central concern for those involved in water management decisions there is relatively little international literature on evw estimations for developing or emerging countries with serious water shortage problems and most is focused on agricultural and domestic sectors this article seeks to fill this gap by estimating the evw for the manufacturing industry in the valley of mexico basin a basin that faces high water stress in addition to the introduction this article includes six sections the next section presents a literature review followed by information about the study site the methodology and results are then described and lastly the sixth section presents the conclusions and recommendations 2 literature review the production of any good or service requires a combination of resources such as equipment labor management capital space and natural resources among others together these contribute to the total value of production 6 in the case of the industrial manufacturing sector the value it assigns to water is classified as a direct use value which is determined according to the market price at which an industry accesses water for use in its industrial process 7 however the market price of products does not necessarily reflect their true value three theoretical approaches can be used to attempt to study and calculate this production value 1 determining water demand 2 studying cost structures and 3 investigating the structure of production the first approach estimates water demand based on direct regressions in order to study the relationship between the amount of water consumed as the dependent variable and the price of water production labor and other socio environmental factors as independent variables 8 16 the second approach based on cost structure relates total costs as the dependent variable and the prices of the various production components including water and production as regressors 17 19 lastly the third approach uses a production function which relates the value of production as a dependent variable and the value or quantities of the various components of production 6 20 this last approach is more valuable since its methodology enables recovering the marginal productivity of each productive factor in accordance with the implicit market price of this resource this situation is advisable for cases in which the marginal price of water is zero or unknown for example when establishing public or market policies that provide benefits to economic units such as subsidies which are commonly employed in developing or emerging countries that is the case in mexico where subsidies and or the inputs in the production process do not reflect the true value for example manufacturing companies have access to water at low prices that do not reflect the true scarcity of the resource particularly when it is primarily supplied by overexploited aquifers and where those are the only or most important source of water such as in the vmb according to the economic literature the first two approaches are used most however they require the establishment of a water market which requires setting and adequately implementing an adequate fee structure with the corresponding costs and marginal prices of inputs 21 nevertheless average prices are used as proxies of marginal prices which translates into a deliberate bias 5 because in perfect competition firms reach their optimal marginal prices 22 in addition for industries the water market depends on the source of the water for example self supply has little or no external cost 23 for companies while supply from the public network involves an increasing block price structure however if market simplification is not possible that is if average prices cannot be used and the fee structure is unknown or apparently exists but is not properly implemented then the marginal productivity approach can be used to evaluate the marginal value of industrial water since that does not require input prices likewise there are fewer studies on the evw for industrial water usage than for agricultural and domestic usage this is mainly because the price of inputs such as water used by industry are usually subsidized and pricing policies do not reflect full market values with regard to studies that use the third approach wang lall 20 estimated the marginal value of water for a sample of approximately 2000 industrial companies in china they estimated a marginal value of us 0 02 m3 for the electric sector as much as us 11 5 m3 for the transport equipment sector and an average value of us 1 1 m3 for all industries aylward et al 24 conducted a review of studies in countries in asia and north america finding a marginal water productivity ranging from us 0 01 m3 to us 6 94 m3 for the industrial sector these studies used production functions to determine the values associated with industrial water which were based on large datasets of information related to water use and financial business data ku yoo 6 estimated the value of marginal water productivity for the manufacturing industry in korea estimating an industry wide average of us 3 7 m3 with the lowest value corresponding to the precision instrument sector and the highest to the transportation equipment sector us 1 4 m3 and us 44 3 m3 respectively lastly vargas 25 estimated a marginal value of us 30 9 m3 for the chilean manufacturing industry with a range between us 11 8 m3 and us 75 3 m3 for textiles and metals respectively 3 valley of mexico basin vmb 3 1 location of the vmb the valley of mexico basin vmb is located in central mexico 19 03 36 and 20 11 24 n 98 12 00 and 99 31 12 longitude w 26 fig 1 the basin has a width of approximately 135 km and a length of 180 km 4 in hydrological terms it contains 85 municipalities belonging to the state of mexico 50 municipalities mexico city 16 municipalities hidalgo 15 municipalities and tlaxcala 4 municipalities the vmb is mexico s most densely populated region with 22 million inhabitants 54 6 in the state of mexico 40 9 in mexico city and the rest in other states and approximately 2234 inhabitants per km2 making this one of the densest populations in the world while it occupies less than 1 of the national territory 20 of the country s total population inhabits the region where approximately 31 3 of the national gdp is generated 4 the vmb has a relative water stress index of 140 4 and it contains seven aquifers 70 of which are being overexploited the vast majority of the economic activities in the region extract the water they need from the following seven water bodies 1 mexico city metropolitan zone overexploited 2 cuautitán pachuca overexploited 3 texcoco overexploited 4 chalco amecameca overexploited 5 tecocomulco underexploited 6 apan underexploited and 7 soltepec underexploited it is also important to mention that the majority of inhabitants and thus most of the economic activities are located in regions with overexploited aquifers 3 2 the manufacturing industry in the vmb the economic units eu are the manufacturing plants from which data are collected these are mainly dedicated to some type of ongoing activity in permanent facilities and actions and resources are controlled by a single owner or controlling entity in order to produce goods and services for commercial or non commercial purposes the manufacturing sector in the vmb is represented by 69 984 economic units eu that are concentrated in the urban areas of the state of mexico 34 630 eu mexico city 31 325 eu hidalgo 3538 eu and tlaxcala 491 eu the production value of the vmb s manufacturing sector was us 59 462 million in 2013 accounting for 35 of the production of the entire basin and generating employment for 751 178 people therefore this sector is key to the well being of the population of that region the economic importance and dynamism of the vmb s manufacturing sector suggests the need to investigate the impact of its demand for water as a production input particularly since it is located in a region characterized by an absolute shortage of the resource since the water that the manufacturing sector incorporates in its processes is a consumptive use when it is extracted from bodies of water it does not return the annual water volume demanded by the entire manufacturing sector is 127 hm3 for first use water 85 of which is extracted from aquifers located in the vmb and 15 from the urban public supply table 1 presents the industries operating in the basin and their respective proportion of water usage by industrial sector as well as their share of the annual manufacturing production this information shows the pressure exerted by each industry on the water resources and their importance in terms of the economic activity in the region it also presents the liters of water used to calculate the weight of the value of production for each industry as well as water use intensity which is an indicator of the technology used by each industry to incorporate fresh water directly into its process 27 there are six industries that exert the most pressure on water resources in the vmb food beverages and tobacco chemical industry paper plastic and rubber and transportation equipment these industries are grouped under the label high pressure industries because together they account for 75 of all the water required annually by the manufacturing sector and 75 of the value of production according to the water use intensity wui of these six industries they require an average of 2 57 liters to produce 1 us of production value which is greater than the average 2 14 liters required by the vmb s manufacturing industry as a whole this clearly demonstrates the intensive profile of their water use among the high pressure industries beverages and tobacco has the highest wui requiring 5 52 liters of water per 1 us of production value while transportation equipment has the lowest wui with 0 79 liters per 1 of production the remaining 14 industries in the basin do not exert significant pressure on the water resources since collectively they represent 25 of all water required annually by the manufacturing sector and produce less than one third of the production value of the basin s manufacturing sector this was found even when including sectors such as electronic appliances whose technology requires 2 32 liters to produce 1 dollar of production value furthermore this scenario in the vmb is complemented by the marginal value of the water used by the manufacturing industry in order to understand the importance of this resource to the production process 4 methodology 4 1 model the cobb douglas cd production function is typically employed for the empirical analysis of factor markets and the production of goods and services however this function presents constraints which have been developed and studied over time and are mainly due to the assumption of additivity and homogeneity therefore christensen et al 28 proposed the trans log tl function to overcome these constraints and demonstrated that this technique provides a wider range of substitution of transformation patterns than those that are constrained by the constant elasticity of substitution as is the case of the cd function 20 as baumann et al 29 indicated the cd function requires all inputs in the production function to be substitutes thereby limiting the degree of substitution by using a constant value that is the same for all which is better known as unitary elasticity of substitution this is contrary to what happens with a tl production function at the same time both the cd and tl functions can be used to calculate the elasticity of scale and the product elasticities with respect to the different inputs in the production process in addition the tl can calculate the different cross price elasticities between different inputs which is not possible with the cd function thus the present study used the tl function given its advantages over the cd nevertheless in order to estimate the tl function it is necessary to start with the cd function 4 2 cobb douglas function model cd and translog function model tl the production function for a good or service where water is considered an input can be represented as q f k l w m where q is the final output of the good or service analyzed k is the capital employed l is the workers employed w is the water used in production and m is the remaining intermediate inputs in the production process considering that the eu under study are located in aquifers with varying degrees of over exploitation a dichotomous variable was introduced in the production function this variable expresses whether the eu is located in an aquifer that is being underexploited or overexploited moreover it specifically includes variables for the different aquifers that indicate whether or not an economic unit exists in the area of a particular aquifer that may be overexploited or underexploited therefore the cobb douglas production function considers the capital labor water and materials as inputs and the situation of overexploitation of aquifers as a variable related to the natural resource 1 ln qi ln a α1 lnli α2 lnwi α3 lnmi α4 lnki

statistics and geography inegi spanish acronym through the automated system of census information saic spanish acronym table 1 this economic census includes the economic units eu that are engaged in various industrial activities and it collects information such as wages and salaries value and volume of production as well as machinery and equipment among others the information that was processed pertained to the eu belonging to the manufacturing sector codes 31 32 and 33 located in the municipalities of the valley of mexico vmb state of mexico mexico city hidalgo and tlaxcala that is the inegi contains information about 69 894 eu that are located throughout the 85 municipalities in the basin the manufacturing eu were added according to subsector and municipality thereby obtaining approximately 895 observations in the vmb for 2013 this aggregation was due to the inegi confidentiality law which prohibits information from being individually displayed in order to prevent its use for tax legal or administrative purposes in addition some industries have little information at the municipal level nonetheless the data offer an aggregate by municipality and for each subsector of economic activity and although there are fewer observations the information is still important for the analysis since it does not alter the characteristics of the manufacturing sector aggregating sectors by municipality assumes constant returns to scale crs at the manufacturing eu level the annual variables used to estimate the production function were a value of products processed q us which quantifies the monetary value of all goods and services produced or marketed by the eu as a result its activities b total staff employed l number comprising all persons working during the reference period subject to the direction and control of the eu c raw materials and materials that are integrated into production m us which is the monetary value of the cost of acquisition from the domestic market or abroad of raw materials and auxiliaries consumed in production processes excluding water d the total value of fixed assets k us which is the current value of all assets owned by the eu with the capacity to produce or provide the conditions required for producing the goods and services such as buildings equipment and machinery taking into account depreciation and e water used in the production process w m3 moreover since the amount of water used was not reported by the census it was estimated based on census information regarding monetary expenditure by the eu the amounts spent on water by each eu was divided by the corresponding cost per m3 of water consumption this cost is an average of the rate of use per m3 of water from deep aquifers which was us 1 02 for all the eu in the study area regardless of the aquifers from which the water was extracted or the rate of water from the public network it is important to mention that nearly 85 of the water used by the eu in the manufacturing sector came from aquifers and the remaining from the public network there is no information with which to adjust the water volume estimate by the degree of recirculation by the eu unlike developed countries or emerging markets few economic units in mexico recirculate or recycle water used in the production process including those belonging to non manufacturing sectors hence the results need to be carefully interpreted if it is the case that the amount of water used in the production process should be adjusted and used as a variable in the production function as failure to do so could overestimate the results the water expenditures us by the eu were transformed into the amount of water used m3 in the production process in order to better interpret the results and to compare them with findings from other studies in addition the production function included the location of the different eu and the seven aquifers in the valley of mexico basin vmb and therefore it took into account whether or not an eu is located in the area of an overexploited or underexploited aquifer dichotomous variable when using a logarithmic production function with the different variables except dichotomous all are transformed into percentages to be interpreted as elasticities to estimate the function a database of the respective variables was generated for the different sectors at the municipal level according to the north american industry classification system naics codes 31 32 and 33 lastly it is advisable to use caution when interpreting the findings especially with regard to the marginal value of water ρtl w given that the information provided by the economic units with respect to water expenditures may be underestimated and the value of ρtl w may be overestimated 5 results 5 1 overall analysis of information the total value of the products processed q for all eu belonging to manufacturing sectors in the vmb amounted to us 59 462 million per year table 1 the food industry 311 clearly had the highest total value of q us 13 615 million while the oil and coal products manufacturing industry 324 had the lowest value us 122 million in the case of water consumption w the total annual consumption by all sectors amounted to 127 million m3 the foods 311 and beverages 312 sectors had the highest consumption 23 and 26 million m3 respectively while the leather and leather tanning and finishing sector 316 had the lowest consumption 175 000 m3 in the case of expenditures on raw materials and materials that are integrated into production m in total the sectors spent nearly us 32 billion with the chemical industry 325 having the highest expenditure us 6884 million in total the staff employed l by all sectors amounted to 751 000 workers with the chemical industry 325 employing the largest number of workers 90 000 and the oil and coal products manufacturing industry 324 employing the least number of workers 4 386 with regard to total fixed assets k the total value of the eu was approximately us 21 billion the chemical industry 325 had the highest value us 3838 million and tanning and finishing leather 316 had the lowest value us 45 million 5 2 estimates of elasticities ε and marginal value of water ρ table 2 presents the results from the estimation of the model for the entire manufacturing industry sixty seven percent of the variables of the tl function were individually statistically significant the majority having a 1 significance level the statistical adjustment r2 of the tl function was 91 indicating that the set of independent variables explained 91 of the total variation in the dependent variable in addition given the value of the fisher test prob f the null hypothesis that all coefficients are simultaneously equal to zero was rejected the form of the tl indicates water elasticity εtl w of 0 061 throughout the manufacturing industry and a marginal value of water ρtl w of us 19 4 per m3 table 3 table 3 presents the results for the different sectors that make up the manufacturing industry the estimate of the elasticity of the product with respect to water consumption ranged from 0 004 for the wood sector to 0 205 for the chemical sector and the marginal value of water ranged from us 2 3 per m3 for the wood sector to us 20 1 for the beverage and tobacco sector the elasticity of scale for the whole manufacturing sector is equal to the sum of the different elasticities of the factors of production εtl sc εtl w εtl l εtl m εtl k for this case εtl sc was equal to 1 01 which represented constant returns to scale as a result the null hypothesis that εtl sc is equal to 1 was accepted table 3 indicating that the percentage increase in the level of production was equal to the percentage increase of all the factors of production as a whole table 4 presents the different cross elasticities of the input with regard to other factors involved in the production process for the manufacturing sector as a whole water w capital k and labor l were clearly complementary goods while water and the remaining inputs m were substitute goods at the subsector level beverages and tobacco 312 presented the greatest elasticity and marginal value of production for this sector water was a substitute factor along with capital and the remaining inputs but it was also a complementary good along with the workforce two other important sectors that were analyzed were food 311 and transport equipment 336 for the food sector water w was a complementary good along with labor l and the remaining inputs m while for the transport equipment sector water was a complementary along with capital k and a substitute along with labor l and the remaining inputs m it is important to mention that on average the cross elasticity values for these last two sectors were higher than all the other sectors it is also important to note that the cross elasticities between water w and labor l capital k or other inputs m mainly depends on the sector analyzed lastly the information and models generated made it possible to estimate the impact on production according to whether the eu were located in overexploited or underexploited aquifers as well as to calculate the different elasticities εw and marginal values of the product ρw for each aquifer in the vmb for example in relation to the soltepec aquifer underexploited this study found that the cdmx texcoco chalco and cuautitlan pachuca aquifers overexploited generated approximately 15 12 11 and 12 more in production value respectively table 2 and underexploited aquifers clearly had both higher elasticities and marginal values than overexploited aquifers on average for example manufacturing industries that used water from the apan aquifer underexploited had an elasticity of 0 090 and each cubic meter of water included in the production process generated an added value of 27 9 meanwhile industries located in the cdmx aquifer overexploited generated an additional production value of 17 0 dollars per cubic meter this may be due to the fact that the largest number of companies in the sector were located in regions with overexploited aquifers given that they were also located in municipalities with the largest number of inhabitants and therefore the demand for their products was greater table 3 it is also worth mentioning that the economic units that used water from overexploited aquifers obtained this resource at the same price per cubic meter as those that used water from underexploited aquifers a situation that should be changed and should express the scarcity of the resource lastly it must be taken into account that although there was a price for economic units to access and use water in their productive process it was relatively low in comparison with other inputs 6 conclusions and recommendations despite the importance of the industrial use of water and aspects that distinguish it from other uses the role of water in the industry has clearly not been greatly studied in developing or emerging countries 30 for the case of the valley of mexico vmb the findings from modeling the behavior of water used by the manufacturing industry confirms a sensitivity to economic variables specifically the marginal value of the water used in the production process was estimated at us 19 4 per m3 in comparison international estimates of this indicator have ranged from us 0 01 m3 to us 7 00 m3 for asian and north american countries excluding mexico 24 and an average of us 30 9 m3 has been estimated for the manufacturing industry in chile 25 the value found by this research which was higher than the international average can be explained mainly by the low cost at which the economic units eu acquired water which was lower than in other countries the eu in the vmb paid us 1 02 m3 on average for water rights provided by the state while countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd paid an average of us 1 38 m3 31 that is approximately 75 more since the manufacturing industry uses water as an input for a variety of products this resource is one of the most important inputs in the production process in addition a stable source of water is very important for manufacturing companies because it helps to prevent problems arising from shortages and mainly it generates value added for their products however few studies have analyzed water usage by industries and its added value in developing or emerging countries such as mexico in the mexican case the price of water is generally regulated by the state which has not taken into account the actual degree of its importance and its added value to the final goods this research estimated the elasticity of the product εw and the marginal value of water ρw used by the industrial manufacturing sectors in the valley of mexico vmb based on information from over 69 000 economic units eu that were grouped into 895 observations at the municipal level through econometric modeling with the trans logarithmic tl functional form of production in terms of water for the entire manufacturing industry in the vmb the elasticity of the product was estimated to be 0 061 and the marginal value of water was us 19 4 for each m3 used in the production process the ρw was found to range from us 2 3 per m3 for the wood sector to us 20 1 for the beverage and tobacco sector reflecting a variation in ρw according to sector moreover if an additional cubic meter i e 1000 liters can increase the output value by us 19 4 then one additional dollar of production would require 54 3 liters this is consistent with the water use intensity presented in table 1 which shows the need for 2 14 liters of direct fresh water per dollar of manufacturing production on average since the marginal product of water is the value added that is generated by the water input in order to produce one dollar of added value more water is required than that which is directly incorporated into producing one more dollar of production the difference between these two amounts is explained by the indirect water required by the inputs in the production process 32 this finding shows that including the value of the marginal product results in capturing the total water use intensity direct and indirect of the manufacturing industry it also confirms that the water use intensity of the manufacturing industry in the vmb is high from a public policy point of view the information found by this type of research can be used to identify and quantify the monetary value of the impacts that are made by public investments in providing water to the manufacturing sector or some of its subsectors that is the monetary benefit from supplying water to an industry as a result of investing in a new water supply project can be calculated for example in the case of the vmb each m3 of water that is provided to the manufacturing sector by investing in a new water supply project would generate approximately us 19 in additional economic benefit for the production process for the investment to be viable and profitable it is important that the cost of water per m3 incurred by the state or the company providing the water service be lower than that economic benefit of us 19 in addition since the eu in the vmb spend us 1 02 per each m3 used in the production process on average then the state has some degree of margin with which to consider adjusting the fees charged for using process water especially in basins with water shortages given this finding the state appears to have room to raise water supply prices for industry which in this case can include the costs of damage to re exploited aquifers this price change would improve water use efficiency and the location of resources increase government revenues and increase the government s knowledge of water usage in situations of water stress as evidenced in the vmb efficient water use should take into account certain factors for example the added value provided by each m3 that each subsector in the manufacturing sector uses in the production process for example 1 m3 of water used by the wood sector generates approximately us 2 3 of value added while 1 m3 used by the beverage and tobacco sector generates us 20 1 of added value that is nearly 12 times more value nonetheless it is necessary to mention that this added value represents an economic point of view only it does not consider the effects on third parties such as a variety of negative externalities of different magnitudes which are specific to the subsector analyzed and the economic factors involved thus while estimating the marginal value of water by subsector can serve as a decision making tool to reallocate water usage especially when there are water shortage problems in certain basins parallel studies are needed that evaluate the socio economic impact on environmental goods and services moreover this study demonstrates that the traditional economic variables described in the literature are affected by the water stress that has been documented in the aquifers exploited by the eu it is important to note that the marginal value of the output of an economic unit that is geographically located in the region of a particular overexploited aquifer will be lower on average than that of an economic unit located in an aquifer that is not overexploited wang and lall 20 reported similar results in which they found a relationship similar to the case of industry in china in addition when interpreting results from the determination of the marginal value of water it is advisable to consider variables or situations that are different from those described by the literature such as the location of the demand for the manufactured products the location of the economic units the natural source of the water supply and the prices or cost of access to water for the economic units among others for example different rates of access to water resources for economic units can be designed and proposed based on the scarcity of the resource while also considering the ability of the government or the responsible authority to monitor and enforce the design the information found in this research provides reasonable technical criteria for making decisions about the efficient allocation and use of water therefore it is expected that estimates from this type of study will be useful to the design of future fee structures and the development of water management policies by governments or administrations in charge of this scarce natural resource nevertheless the results of this type of study should be interpreted with caution since the economic units themselves usually provide the information for designing public policy on water issues in emerging or developing countries and thus there is a possibility of over or under estimations however it is necessary to increase knowledge about the use of industrial water and to generate instruments that enable attaining rational water management this is of concern when a growing demand for water such as in the vmb and in other regions of mexico and the world exerts more pressure on overexploited water bodies better and greater benefits for society will be achieved if all the different users and the industrial users in this case manage water resources in a more efficient and sustainable manner acknowledgements the article was prepared with the financial support of the national council of science

8695,water is one of the most important inputs in the production process especially for the manufacturing sector however at the same time this resource can present shortage problems mainly due to a lack of knowledge about its value in most emerging countries the monetary value of water used in the production process does not necessarily reflect that there is a shortage or the costs of catchment and treatment thus the real cost of water is not paid in addition it is vital that the various manufacturing industries consider the opportunity cost or shadow price of consuming water for its production processes therefore this paper estimates the economic value of water evw for the manufacturing industry in a water basin with shortage problems valley of mexico basin vmb mexico this is understood as the shadow price using the concept of production elasticity with respect to water input εw and the value of the marginal product ρw to that end we used information from 69 984 economic units surveyed in 2013 and considered one type of production function i e translog the εw was estimated at 0 061 and the ρw at us 19 4 m3 the ρw ranged from us 2 3 m3 for the wood sector to us 20 1 m3 for the beverage and tobacco sector demonstrating variation in ρw by sector the results have important implications for several areas of industrial water management especially for water basins where this resource presents shortage problems any investment in new industrial water supply projects requires information on the industrial evw that information is also needed in order to determine how to efficiently distribute scarce water resources across sectors keywords economic value water manufacturing industry scarcity 1 introduction while the supply of water in mexico is considered abundant in absolute terms the country faces a serious problem with relative shortage 1 this problem is reflected in an inability to meet water demand in some of the country s basins especially those that have undergone greater population growth over the years the valley of mexico basin vmb occupies less than 1 of the national territory and yet it is inhabited by 20 of the country s total population and generates approximately 31 3 of the nation s gross domestic product gdp 2 in 2015 the water demand for population and economic activities in the vmb was 3330 1 hm3 which exceeded what the basin could offer in per capita terms this represents a water usage of 155 5 m3 year which is well above the 89 8 m3 year of renewable water captured in the basin natural media availability nma 1 this excessive extraction over and above the nma is explained by the overexploitation of aquifers in the basin 36 2 m3 year and the importation of water from other basins 29 4 m3 year the relative water stress index rwsi which links the total volume of water allotted through concessions and the nma of the water multiplied by 100 is 140 4 for the vmb making it one of the regions with the greatest pressure on its water resources along with yemen and the united arab emirates in this context of extreme water stress it is imperative to adopt policies that ensure that the various water uses in basins are efficient the main sectors that currently consume water in the vmb are in order of importance urban domestic agricultural industrial and livestock 2 the manufacturing industry plays a key role in the dynamics of the economic activity of the vmb it accounts for one fifth of the basin s gdp generates employment as well as goods and services for consumption by the region s population and exports outside the basin and the country 1 water is an essential resource for the production processes that are carried out by the industries located in the basin in 2015 alone they used approximately 127 million m3 for those processes which is 10 1 of the water used by industry nationwide 3 the manufacturing industry extracts most of the water it uses for its production processes from aquifers which are currently so overexploited that they have been declared closed with a reported null availability of the resource further exploitation would cause them irreversible damage in addition to complement its water needs industry uses water from the urban public supply which also mainly comes from aquifers with the same adverse impacts on those bodies of water 4 however as in most emerging or developing countries the monetary value of this resource for the production process does not necessarily reflect water shortages or catchment and treatment costs that is the real cost of the water is not paid which prevents awareness of its inefficient use waste and contamination 5 in addition overall in mexico and in the vmb in particular the state generally regulates the price of water and therefore that price general does not reflect the importance of the water s value to industry the use of water by the manufacturing industry adds value to the product or service that is sold and this additional value is the value of the water that is incorporated into its process which reflects what consumers effectively pay for the use of the resource this article is aimed at estimating this value of the water used by the manufacturing industry in the vmb in order to identify the sectors or sub industries that generate more added value and those that generate less moreover knowing the economic value of water evw both generally and by economic sector is useful for properly and efficiently managing water 5 first it provides a tool that decision makers on water issues can use to determine future investments based on technical criteria this is useful given that nations continue to invest in water resources especially developing countries and thus water is one of the main components of public infrastructure budgets second an economic evaluation is important because it makes it possible to determine whether or not a company or in this case companies would favor water supply projects lastly the evw is useful for evaluating the design and implementation of public policies not only for investments in construction but also in more efficient water management for example the economic value of water can be used to optimize the allocation of the resource among the various sectors and objectives when there is a shortage water imbalance or a disruption in the supply as in the vmb water users may not be able to obtain all the water they need for their economic activities and therefore sharing the limited supply can become a central concern for those involved in water management decisions there is relatively little international literature on evw estimations for developing or emerging countries with serious water shortage problems and most is focused on agricultural and domestic sectors this article seeks to fill this gap by estimating the evw for the manufacturing industry in the valley of mexico basin a basin that faces high water stress in addition to the introduction this article includes six sections the next section presents a literature review followed by information about the study site the methodology and results are then described and lastly the sixth section presents the conclusions and recommendations 2 literature review the production of any good or service requires a combination of resources such as equipment labor management capital space and natural resources among others together these contribute to the total value of production 6 in the case of the industrial manufacturing sector the value it assigns to water is classified as a direct use value which is determined according to the market price at which an industry accesses water for use in its industrial process 7 however the market price of products does not necessarily reflect their true value three theoretical approaches can be used to attempt to study and calculate this production value 1 determining water demand 2 studying cost structures and 3 investigating the structure of production the first approach estimates water demand based on direct regressions in order to study the relationship between the amount of water consumed as the dependent variable and the price of water production labor and other socio environmental factors as independent variables 8 16 the second approach based on cost structure relates total costs as the dependent variable and the prices of the various production components including water and production as regressors 17 19 lastly the third approach uses a production function which relates the value of production as a dependent variable and the value or quantities of the various components of production 6 20 this last approach is more valuable since its methodology enables recovering the marginal productivity of each productive factor in accordance with the implicit market price of this resource this situation is advisable for cases in which the marginal price of water is zero or unknown for example when establishing public or market policies that provide benefits to economic units such as subsidies which are commonly employed in developing or emerging countries that is the case in mexico where subsidies and or the inputs in the production process do not reflect the true value for example manufacturing companies have access to water at low prices that do not reflect the true scarcity of the resource particularly when it is primarily supplied by overexploited aquifers and where those are the only or most important source of water such as in the vmb according to the economic literature the first two approaches are used most however they require the establishment of a water market which requires setting and adequately implementing an adequate fee structure with the corresponding costs and marginal prices of inputs 21 nevertheless average prices are used as proxies of marginal prices which translates into a deliberate bias 5 because in perfect competition firms reach their optimal marginal prices 22 in addition for industries the water market depends on the source of the water for example self supply has little or no external cost 23 for companies while supply from the public network involves an increasing block price structure however if market simplification is not possible that is if average prices cannot be used and the fee structure is unknown or apparently exists but is not properly implemented then the marginal productivity approach can be used to evaluate the marginal value of industrial water since that does not require input prices likewise there are fewer studies on the evw for industrial water usage than for agricultural and domestic usage this is mainly because the price of inputs such as water used by industry are usually subsidized and pricing policies do not reflect full market values with regard to studies that use the third approach wang lall 20 estimated the marginal value of water for a sample of approximately 2000 industrial companies in china they estimated a marginal value of us 0 02 m3 for the electric sector as much as us 11 5 m3 for the transport equipment sector and an average value of us 1 1 m3 for all industries aylward et al 24 conducted a review of studies in countries in asia and north america finding a marginal water productivity ranging from us 0 01 m3 to us 6 94 m3 for the industrial sector these studies used production functions to determine the values associated with industrial water which were based on large datasets of information related to water use and financial business data ku yoo 6 estimated the value of marginal water productivity for the manufacturing industry in korea estimating an industry wide average of us 3 7 m3 with the lowest value corresponding to the precision instrument sector and the highest to the transportation equipment sector us 1 4 m3 and us 44 3 m3 respectively lastly vargas 25 estimated a marginal value of us 30 9 m3 for the chilean manufacturing industry with a range between us 11 8 m3 and us 75 3 m3 for textiles and metals respectively 3 valley of mexico basin vmb 3 1 location of the vmb the valley of mexico basin vmb is located in central mexico 19 03 36 and 20 11 24 n 98 12 00 and 99 31 12 longitude w 26 fig 1 the basin has a width of approximately 135 km and a length of 180 km 4 in hydrological terms it contains 85 municipalities belonging to the state of mexico 50 municipalities mexico city 16 municipalities hidalgo 15 municipalities and tlaxcala 4 municipalities the vmb is mexico s most densely populated region with 22 million inhabitants 54 6 in the state of mexico 40 9 in mexico city and the rest in other states and approximately 2234 inhabitants per km2 making this one of the densest populations in the world while it occupies less than 1 of the national territory 20 of the country s total population inhabits the region where approximately 31 3 of the national gdp is generated 4 the vmb has a relative water stress index of 140 4 and it contains seven aquifers 70 of which are being overexploited the vast majority of the economic activities in the region extract the water they need from the following seven water bodies 1 mexico city metropolitan zone overexploited 2 cuautitán pachuca overexploited 3 texcoco overexploited 4 chalco amecameca overexploited 5 tecocomulco underexploited 6 apan underexploited and 7 soltepec underexploited it is also important to mention that the majority of inhabitants and thus most of the economic activities are located in regions with overexploited aquifers 3 2 the manufacturing industry in the vmb the economic units eu are the manufacturing plants from which data are collected these are mainly dedicated to some type of ongoing activity in permanent facilities and actions and resources are controlled by a single owner or controlling entity in order to produce goods and services for commercial or non commercial purposes the manufacturing sector in the vmb is represented by 69 984 economic units eu that are concentrated in the urban areas of the state of mexico 34 630 eu mexico city 31 325 eu hidalgo 3538 eu and tlaxcala 491 eu the production value of the vmb s manufacturing sector was us 59 462 million in 2013 accounting for 35 of the production of the entire basin and generating employment for 751 178 people therefore this sector is key to the well being of the population of that region the economic importance and dynamism of the vmb s manufacturing sector suggests the need to investigate the impact of its demand for water as a production input particularly since it is located in a region characterized by an absolute shortage of the resource since the water that the manufacturing sector incorporates in its processes is a consumptive use when it is extracted from bodies of water it does not return the annual water volume demanded by the entire manufacturing sector is 127 hm3 for first use water 85 of which is extracted from aquifers located in the vmb and 15 from the urban public supply table 1 presents the industries operating in the basin and their respective proportion of water usage by industrial sector as well as their share of the annual manufacturing production this information shows the pressure exerted by each industry on the water resources and their importance in terms of the economic activity in the region it also presents the liters of water used to calculate the weight of the value of production for each industry as well as water use intensity which is an indicator of the technology used by each industry to incorporate fresh water directly into its process 27 there are six industries that exert the most pressure on water resources in the vmb food beverages and tobacco chemical industry paper plastic and rubber and transportation equipment these industries are grouped under the label high pressure industries because together they account for 75 of all the water required annually by the manufacturing sector and 75 of the value of production according to the water use intensity wui of these six industries they require an average of 2 57 liters to produce 1 us of production value which is greater than the average 2 14 liters required by the vmb s manufacturing industry as a whole this clearly demonstrates the intensive profile of their water use among the high pressure industries beverages and tobacco has the highest wui requiring 5 52 liters of water per 1 us of production value while transportation equipment has the lowest wui with 0 79 liters per 1 of production the remaining 14 industries in the basin do not exert significant pressure on the water resources since collectively they represent 25 of all water required annually by the manufacturing sector and produce less than one third of the production value of the basin s manufacturing sector this was found even when including sectors such as electronic appliances whose technology requires 2 32 liters to produce 1 dollar of production value furthermore this scenario in the vmb is complemented by the marginal value of the water used by the manufacturing industry in order to understand the importance of this resource to the production process 4 methodology 4 1 model the cobb douglas cd production function is typically employed for the empirical analysis of factor markets and the production of goods and services however this function presents constraints which have been developed and studied over time and are mainly due to the assumption of additivity and homogeneity therefore christensen et al 28 proposed the trans log tl function to overcome these constraints and demonstrated that this technique provides a wider range of substitution of transformation patterns than those that are constrained by the constant elasticity of substitution as is the case of the cd function 20 as baumann et al 29 indicated the cd function requires all inputs in the production function to be substitutes thereby limiting the degree of substitution by using a constant value that is the same for all which is better known as unitary elasticity of substitution this is contrary to what happens with a tl production function at the same time both the cd and tl functions can be used to calculate the elasticity of scale and the product elasticities with respect to the different inputs in the production process in addition the tl can calculate the different cross price elasticities between different inputs which is not possible with the cd function thus the present study used the tl function given its advantages over the cd nevertheless in order to estimate the tl function it is necessary to start with the cd function 4 2 cobb douglas function model cd and translog function model tl the production function for a good or service where water is considered an input can be represented as q f k l w m where q is the final output of the good or service analyzed k is the capital employed l is the workers employed w is the water used in production and m is the remaining intermediate inputs in the production process considering that the eu under study are located in aquifers with varying degrees of over exploitation a dichotomous variable was introduced in the production function this variable expresses whether the eu is located in an aquifer that is being underexploited or overexploited moreover it specifically includes variables for the different aquifers that indicate whether or not an economic unit exists in the area of a particular aquifer that may be overexploited or underexploited therefore the cobb douglas production function considers the capital labor water and materials as inputs and the situation of overexploitation of aquifers as a variable related to the natural resource 1 ln qi ln a α1 lnli α2 lnwi α3 lnmi α4 lnki

statistics and geography inegi spanish acronym through the automated system of census information saic spanish acronym table 1 this economic census includes the economic units eu that are engaged in various industrial activities and it collects information such as wages and salaries value and volume of production as well as machinery and equipment among others the information that was processed pertained to the eu belonging to the manufacturing sector codes 31 32 and 33 located in the municipalities of the valley of mexico vmb state of mexico mexico city hidalgo and tlaxcala that is the inegi contains information about 69 894 eu that are located throughout the 85 municipalities in the basin the manufacturing eu were added according to subsector and municipality thereby obtaining approximately 895 observations in the vmb for 2013 this aggregation was due to the inegi confidentiality law which prohibits information from being individually displayed in order to prevent its use for tax legal or administrative purposes in addition some industries have little information at the municipal level nonetheless the data offer an aggregate by municipality and for each subsector of economic activity and although there are fewer observations the information is still important for the analysis since it does not alter the characteristics of the manufacturing sector aggregating sectors by municipality assumes constant returns to scale crs at the manufacturing eu level the annual variables used to estimate the production function were a value of products processed q us which quantifies the monetary value of all goods and services produced or marketed by the eu as a result its activities b total staff employed l number comprising all persons working during the reference period subject to the direction and control of the eu c raw materials and materials that are integrated into production m us which is the monetary value of the cost of acquisition from the domestic market or abroad of raw materials and auxiliaries consumed in production processes excluding water d the total value of fixed assets k us which is the current value of all assets owned by the eu with the capacity to produce or provide the conditions required for producing the goods and services such as buildings equipment and machinery taking into account depreciation and e water used in the production process w m3 moreover since the amount of water used was not reported by the census it was estimated based on census information regarding monetary expenditure by the eu the amounts spent on water by each eu was divided by the corresponding cost per m3 of water consumption this cost is an average of the rate of use per m3 of water from deep aquifers which was us 1 02 for all the eu in the study area regardless of the aquifers from which the water was extracted or the rate of water from the public network it is important to mention that nearly 85 of the water used by the eu in the manufacturing sector came from aquifers and the remaining from the public network there is no information with which to adjust the water volume estimate by the degree of recirculation by the eu unlike developed countries or emerging markets few economic units in mexico recirculate or recycle water used in the production process including those belonging to non manufacturing sectors hence the results need to be carefully interpreted if it is the case that the amount of water used in the production process should be adjusted and used as a variable in the production function as failure to do so could overestimate the results the water expenditures us by the eu were transformed into the amount of water used m3 in the production process in order to better interpret the results and to compare them with findings from other studies in addition the production function included the location of the different eu and the seven aquifers in the valley of mexico basin vmb and therefore it took into account whether or not an eu is located in the area of an overexploited or underexploited aquifer dichotomous variable when using a logarithmic production function with the different variables except dichotomous all are transformed into percentages to be interpreted as elasticities to estimate the function a database of the respective variables was generated for the different sectors at the municipal level according to the north american industry classification system naics codes 31 32 and 33 lastly it is advisable to use caution when interpreting the findings especially with regard to the marginal value of water ρtl w given that the information provided by the economic units with respect to water expenditures may be underestimated and the value of ρtl w may be overestimated 5 results 5 1 overall analysis of information the total value of the products processed q for all eu belonging to manufacturing sectors in the vmb amounted to us 59 462 million per year table 1 the food industry 311 clearly had the highest total value of q us 13 615 million while the oil and coal products manufacturing industry 324 had the lowest value us 122 million in the case of water consumption w the total annual consumption by all sectors amounted to 127 million m3 the foods 311 and beverages 312 sectors had the highest consumption 23 and 26 million m3 respectively while the leather and leather tanning and finishing sector 316 had the lowest consumption 175 000 m3 in the case of expenditures on raw materials and materials that are integrated into production m in total the sectors spent nearly us 32 billion with the chemical industry 325 having the highest expenditure us 6884 million in total the staff employed l by all sectors amounted to 751 000 workers with the chemical industry 325 employing the largest number of workers 90 000 and the oil and coal products manufacturing industry 324 employing the least number of workers 4 386 with regard to total fixed assets k the total value of the eu was approximately us 21 billion the chemical industry 325 had the highest value us 3838 million and tanning and finishing leather 316 had the lowest value us 45 million 5 2 estimates of elasticities ε and marginal value of water ρ table 2 presents the results from the estimation of the model for the entire manufacturing industry sixty seven percent of the variables of the tl function were individually statistically significant the majority having a 1 significance level the statistical adjustment r2 of the tl function was 91 indicating that the set of independent variables explained 91 of the total variation in the dependent variable in addition given the value of the fisher test prob f the null hypothesis that all coefficients are simultaneously equal to zero was rejected the form of the tl indicates water elasticity εtl w of 0 061 throughout the manufacturing industry and a marginal value of water ρtl w of us 19 4 per m3 table 3 table 3 presents the results for the different sectors that make up the manufacturing industry the estimate of the elasticity of the product with respect to water consumption ranged from 0 004 for the wood sector to 0 205 for the chemical sector and the marginal value of water ranged from us 2 3 per m3 for the wood sector to us 20 1 for the beverage and tobacco sector the elasticity of scale for the whole manufacturing sector is equal to the sum of the different elasticities of the factors of production εtl sc εtl w εtl l εtl m εtl k for this case εtl sc was equal to 1 01 which represented constant returns to scale as a result the null hypothesis that εtl sc is equal to 1 was accepted table 3 indicating that the percentage increase in the level of production was equal to the percentage increase of all the factors of production as a whole table 4 presents the different cross elasticities of the input with regard to other factors involved in the production process for the manufacturing sector as a whole water w capital k and labor l were clearly complementary goods while water and the remaining inputs m were substitute goods at the subsector level beverages and tobacco 312 presented the greatest elasticity and marginal value of production for this sector water was a substitute factor along with capital and the remaining inputs but it was also a complementary good along with the workforce two other important sectors that were analyzed were food 311 and transport equipment 336 for the food sector water w was a complementary good along with labor l and the remaining inputs m while for the transport equipment sector water was a complementary along with capital k and a substitute along with labor l and the remaining inputs m it is important to mention that on average the cross elasticity values for these last two sectors were higher than all the other sectors it is also important to note that the cross elasticities between water w and labor l capital k or other inputs m mainly depends on the sector analyzed lastly the information and models generated made it possible to estimate the impact on production according to whether the eu were located in overexploited or underexploited aquifers as well as to calculate the different elasticities εw and marginal values of the product ρw for each aquifer in the vmb for example in relation to the soltepec aquifer underexploited this study found that the cdmx texcoco chalco and cuautitlan pachuca aquifers overexploited generated approximately 15 12 11 and 12 more in production value respectively table 2 and underexploited aquifers clearly had both higher elasticities and marginal values than overexploited aquifers on average for example manufacturing industries that used water from the apan aquifer underexploited had an elasticity of 0 090 and each cubic meter of water included in the production process generated an added value of 27 9 meanwhile industries located in the cdmx aquifer overexploited generated an additional production value of 17 0 dollars per cubic meter this may be due to the fact that the largest number of companies in the sector were located in regions with overexploited aquifers given that they were also located in municipalities with the largest number of inhabitants and therefore the demand for their products was greater table 3 it is also worth mentioning that the economic units that used water from overexploited aquifers obtained this resource at the same price per cubic meter as those that used water from underexploited aquifers a situation that should be changed and should express the scarcity of the resource lastly it must be taken into account that although there was a price for economic units to access and use water in their productive process it was relatively low in comparison with other inputs 6 conclusions and recommendations despite the importance of the industrial use of water and aspects that distinguish it from other uses the role of water in the industry has clearly not been greatly studied in developing or emerging countries 30 for the case of the valley of mexico vmb the findings from modeling the behavior of water used by the manufacturing industry confirms a sensitivity to economic variables specifically the marginal value of the water used in the production process was estimated at us 19 4 per m3 in comparison international estimates of this indicator have ranged from us 0 01 m3 to us 7 00 m3 for asian and north american countries excluding mexico 24 and an average of us 30 9 m3 has been estimated for the manufacturing industry in chile 25 the value found by this research which was higher than the international average can be explained mainly by the low cost at which the economic units eu acquired water which was lower than in other countries the eu in the vmb paid us 1 02 m3 on average for water rights provided by the state while countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd paid an average of us 1 38 m3 31 that is approximately 75 more since the manufacturing industry uses water as an input for a variety of products this resource is one of the most important inputs in the production process in addition a stable source of water is very important for manufacturing companies because it helps to prevent problems arising from shortages and mainly it generates value added for their products however few studies have analyzed water usage by industries and its added value in developing or emerging countries such as mexico in the mexican case the price of water is generally regulated by the state which has not taken into account the actual degree of its importance and its added value to the final goods this research estimated the elasticity of the product εw and the marginal value of water ρw used by the industrial manufacturing sectors in the valley of mexico vmb based on information from over 69 000 economic units eu that were grouped into 895 observations at the municipal level through econometric modeling with the trans logarithmic tl functional form of production in terms of water for the entire manufacturing industry in the vmb the elasticity of the product was estimated to be 0 061 and the marginal value of water was us 19 4 for each m3 used in the production process the ρw was found to range from us 2 3 per m3 for the wood sector to us 20 1 for the beverage and tobacco sector reflecting a variation in ρw according to sector moreover if an additional cubic meter i e 1000 liters can increase the output value by us 19 4 then one additional dollar of production would require 54 3 liters this is consistent with the water use intensity presented in table 1 which shows the need for 2 14 liters of direct fresh water per dollar of manufacturing production on average since the marginal product of water is the value added that is generated by the water input in order to produce one dollar of added value more water is required than that which is directly incorporated into producing one more dollar of production the difference between these two amounts is explained by the indirect water required by the inputs in the production process 32 this finding shows that including the value of the marginal product results in capturing the total water use intensity direct and indirect of the manufacturing industry it also confirms that the water use intensity of the manufacturing industry in the vmb is high from a public policy point of view the information found by this type of research can be used to identify and quantify the monetary value of the impacts that are made by public investments in providing water to the manufacturing sector or some of its subsectors that is the monetary benefit from supplying water to an industry as a result of investing in a new water supply project can be calculated for example in the case of the vmb each m3 of water that is provided to the manufacturing sector by investing in a new water supply project would generate approximately us 19 in additional economic benefit for the production process for the investment to be viable and profitable it is important that the cost of water per m3 incurred by the state or the company providing the water service be lower than that economic benefit of us 19 in addition since the eu in the vmb spend us 1 02 per each m3 used in the production process on average then the state has some degree of margin with which to consider adjusting the fees charged for using process water especially in basins with water shortages given this finding the state appears to have room to raise water supply prices for industry which in this case can include the costs of damage to re exploited aquifers this price change would improve water use efficiency and the location of resources increase government revenues and increase the government s knowledge of water usage in situations of water stress as evidenced in the vmb efficient water use should take into account certain factors for example the added value provided by each m3 that each subsector in the manufacturing sector uses in the production process for example 1 m3 of water used by the wood sector generates approximately us 2 3 of value added while 1 m3 used by the beverage and tobacco sector generates us 20 1 of added value that is nearly 12 times more value nonetheless it is necessary to mention that this added value represents an economic point of view only it does not consider the effects on third parties such as a variety of negative externalities of different magnitudes which are specific to the subsector analyzed and the economic factors involved thus while estimating the marginal value of water by subsector can serve as a decision making tool to reallocate water usage especially when there are water shortage problems in certain basins parallel studies are needed that evaluate the socio economic impact on environmental goods and services moreover this study demonstrates that the traditional economic variables described in the literature are affected by the water stress that has been documented in the aquifers exploited by the eu it is important to note that the marginal value of the output of an economic unit that is geographically located in the region of a particular overexploited aquifer will be lower on average than that of an economic unit located in an aquifer that is not overexploited wang and lall 20 reported similar results in which they found a relationship similar to the case of industry in china in addition when interpreting results from the determination of the marginal value of water it is advisable to consider variables or situations that are different from those described by the literature such as the location of the demand for the manufactured products the location of the economic units the natural source of the water supply and the prices or cost of access to water for the economic units among others for example different rates of access to water resources for economic units can be designed and proposed based on the scarcity of the resource while also considering the ability of the government or the responsible authority to monitor and enforce the design the information found in this research provides reasonable technical criteria for making decisions about the efficient allocation and use of water therefore it is expected that estimates from this type of study will be useful to the design of future fee structures and the development of water management policies by governments or administrations in charge of this scarce natural resource nevertheless the results of this type of study should be interpreted with caution since the economic units themselves usually provide the information for designing public policy on water issues in emerging or developing countries and thus there is a possibility of over or under estimations however it is necessary to increase knowledge about the use of industrial water and to generate instruments that enable attaining rational water management this is of concern when a growing demand for water such as in the vmb and in other regions of mexico and the world exerts more pressure on overexploited water bodies better and greater benefits for society will be achieved if all the different users and the

8696,an urban water network with storage and uncertain environmental water inflows is modelled this three period model is analytically tractable and allows for a straightforward study of the relative economic impact of different policy regimes the model is used to identify the water authority s first best pricing policy and its relation to long run marginal cost pricing the model is then used to identify the implications of adopting the most commonly used rationing method when environmental flows are uncertain setting a smoothed priced often lrmc exclusive of scarcity value and using moral suasion rather than pricing to control the demand for water the optimal manner to address water security is also addressed keywords efficient urban water pricing moral suasion environmental uncertainty storage levels 1 introduction being a public utility it is common for the price set by urban water networks to be regulated regulators have been advised that setting the volumetric rate of urban water equal to its long run marginal cost lrmc will achieve economic efficiency for example 1 2 3 this pricing methodology is devised to price efficiently when ongoing increases in demand necessitates lumpy capacity expansion 1 4 5 in recent years regulators in some jurisdictions have set a volumetric rate for urban water that takes into account their estimate of its lrmc 1 1 it is common for australian regulators to utilise estimates of lrmc in their pricing for example independent competition and regulatory commission 34 and independent pricing and regulatory tribunal 35 p 136 it should be noted that these jurisdictions are ones with large storages and uncertain environmental inflows into those storages nonetheless there are numerous examples of regulators who have deviated from lrmc pricing of urban water 6 11 due to reasons such as complications in determining the full cost of supplying water 12 or taking into account social considerations 13 this calculation of lrmc usually assumes steady demand growth and minimal uncertainty in the availability of supply when the water available to the water utility from the environment referred to as environmental flows below is uncertain regulators typically set a smoothed price and use water restrictions and moral suasion to reduce demand at times of water scarcity during droughts for instance it is common for the population to be called on to reduce their consumption of urban water for the common good however there has been a growing recognition that this methodology particularly that of maintaining a steady price may mis price water in environments in which there is supply uncertainly due to environmental fluctuations 14 15 in addition this methodology does not effectively consider the role of storage in managing uncertain environmental flows this paper develops a theoretical economic model of an urban water network with uncertain environmental flows and storage the aim of this analysis is to determine the impact of regulators pricing storage and capacity expansion decisions and thus to develop a coherent analytical framework that can be used to inform policy issues as they arise as such the model provides a qualitative insight into important water pricing issues e g refs 6 16 19 and also the optimal investment in water infrastructure e g refs 20 21 typically regulators face an economic environment which is complex to model and analyse both the academic literature and policy work rely on numerical simulations see for example 22 2 2 numerical models are often used to model the pricing and capacity options for particular urban water networks for example see refs 20 22 numerical models provide detailed insight into specific scenarios however by their nature numerical models are tailored to particular networks it is often not clear how to generalise results from numerical models therefore their conclusions are not readily adapted to analyse different scenarios in different networks the three period model developed in this paper is analytically tractable indeed it can be summarised on a single diagram however it incorporates some key characteristics of urban water supply networks thus has sufficient detail to reveal underlying principles at play when regulating urban water utilities specifically the model is applied to the analysis of moral suasion when used as a tool to reduce demand during droughts it is also used to analyse the most efficient way to ensure urban water security storage is an important feature of those water networks that use it to mitigate variations in environmental flows for some regions storage is used predominantly to smooth flows from the seasonal variations however in other regions storage mitigates variations in flows over extended drought periods for instance the el niño southern oscillation atmospheric phenomenon causes variation in rainfall in countries around the pacific in australia for instance dams are constructed to smooth water supply to variations in the southern oscillation sydney for example has dam capacity of approximately 4 years worth of supply the three period model in this paper considers an urban water region that has these characteristics one or more large multi year storages which are used only for urban water the analysis does not formally incorporate groundwater sources or alternative uses for available water such as agriculture however the modelling approach can readily be extended to incorporate such features identifying the efficient balance of present consumption storage and capacity expansion in the face of such uncertainty is essential for effective economic regulation when such large storages are available there will necessarily be an interaction between storage and capacity expansion for instance when storages are full infrastructure decision may be deferred for a time such a deferral can achieve significant efficiencies however when lower environmental inflows result in storages being at a lower level capacity expansion will be more pressing in these circumstances either high volumetric rates or moral suasion could be used to delay capacity expansion the model developed in this paper assumes a water authority has access to a given storage capacity in the context of this paper that capacity is the volume of water in a storage that is available to supply customers the water authority is also capable of expanding the manufactured water capacity desalination and recycling in the initial formulation of the model we assume that the water authority chooses the volumetric rate for water to manage water demand in order to achieve the efficient balance of consumption storage and capacity in this configuration the model shows the efficient price smooths consumption consequently the efficient current price and expected future price are both dependent on the current state of water availability that the efficient amount of water stored is thus also state dependent that the efficient manufactured water capacity is also state dependent when stored water can substitute for capacity expansion that expected lrmc guides efficient investment decisions rather than efficient water allocation within a period some water authorities implement either single part constant volumetric tariffs or two part tariffs 3 3 the most common tariff structure implemented by water providers globally is increasing or inclining block tariffs 36 increasing block tariffs are not modelled in this paper however the approach developed here could be adapted to compare their impacts with those pricing structures that are modelled however these providers very rarely vary the volumetric rate of water to control demand during droughts 4 4 loaiciga and renehan 37 however report of the use of pricing to control demand in santa barbara california during the 1987 1992 drought note that the seasonal pricing of water is also used in some jurisdictions hoque and wichelns 38 report on the use of seasonal pricing in los angeles california the preferred mechanism to control demand is either moral suasion or restrictions or some combination of the two theoretical economic analyses of urban water regulation do not normally formally model moral suasion 5 5 the impact of moral suasion has sometimes been incorporated into numerical models via mechanism such as water saving incentives and reduction in water demand growth see independent competition and regulatory commission 34 however some cases in which moral suasion has reduced water demand during droughts has been documented it is reported by refs 23 24 that moral suasion involving social comparisons can have effects which persist over two years similarly moral suasion including a voluntary use target was used significantly in southeast queensland australia as a response to the millennium drought 2000 2008 the strategy adopted during this event resulted in significant and persistent reductions in urban water use 25 26 the model is extended to analyse the use of moral suasion rather than pricing to control demand during a drought moral suasion is modelled as causing a reduction in consumers marginal benefit of water consumption it is possible that moral suasion may not be sufficiently effective to control demand but if it is we show that the optimal policy after moral suasion is implemented involves lower current consumption higher levels of stored water and higher future consumption than would occur if price were efficiently used to control demand lower investment in manufactured water capacity than would be the case if pricing were used provided stored water can substitute for capacity expansion a lower total water bill charged to customers than under pricing in our analysis we do not consider the use of water restrictions rather than price or moral suasion to control demand during droughts while the model could be extended to study restrictions their negative impact on economic efficiency is relatively well understood thus for brevity restrictions are excluded from the analysis in this paper however note that restrictions are known to cause a misallocation across consumers and a dynamic inefficiency estimates of those economic costs of restrictions are relatively very high 27 28 when water supplies are highly variable as a consequence of climatic variation there is a concern that a drought of long duration will result in insufficient water being available for minimum requirements we use the model to consider the efficient method for water authorities to provide such water security firstly note that the efficient storage and capacity decision might be sufficient to provide water security however if this is not the case the efficient policies will need to be modified to ensure water security is achieved we show the imposition of a water security requirement increases both the efficient storage of water and manufactured water capacity in order to ensure water is never below a minimum level that consumption is no longer smoothed as described above as the expected future marginal benefit is lower because of the extra storage and capacity needed to provide water security 2 the model key assumptions the model has three periods denoted by the subscript t where t 0 1 2 period 0 is interpreted as the past period 1 the present period 2 the future 6 6 it is common practice in economic theory particularly industrial organisation to utilise a 2 or 3 period representation of a model rather than infinite time horizon representation of that model by identifying choices and behaviours in their penultimate period these finite period models are sufficient to qualitatively identify the key dynamic interactions that are present in each period of an infinite time horizon representation of the model importantly a finite period representation of a model is substantially more analytically tractable than its infinite time horizon version and it is thus more straightforward to identify key insights in the finite period representation in each period water supply comes from the previous period s storage s t 1 manufactured desalinated or recycled water m t and environmental inflows into the storage i t for simplicity it is assumed that each of these water sources has short run marginal cost exclusive of the cost of scarcity of supplying potable water to customers w t which is common across each source in practice the relative short run marginal cost srmc of inflows such as surface water and manufactured water will differ and the difference will vary with location indeed some estimates have the srmc of manufactured water between 1 and 3 times the srmc of environmentally sourced water 29 however as will be discussed below assuming common srmc across sources does not have a material impact on the qualitative interpretation of the results of the analysis 7 7 it is straightforward but mathematically dense to extend the analysis to the case where different sources have different srmc by assuming a common srmc it is not necessary to consider issues around the choice of production method in each period though clearly if production costs differ it will be the source with the lowest of those costs which is the first to be utilised this is discussed further in section 3 1 the manufactured water capacity in periods t 1 2 m t is determined in period t 1 there is an initial manufactured water capacity in period 0 m 0 for most of the paper we assume manufactured water capacity is infinitely divisible in some instances this will be a good approximation to reality in large cities such as sydney small scale recycling plants and incremental increases in desalination capacity are possible to show the applicability of the approach we also consider in section 6 the case in which the manufactured water capacity can be expanded by one large discrete amount water is stored in a dam which has a maximum capacity k in periods t 0 1 the water utility can store an amount s t where storage must be less than k and non negative stored water evaporates at a rate 1 ϖ it is further assumed for simplicity that there is no cost of storing water per se we do not investigate changes in dam size i e changes in k in the analysis in this paper many water authorities particularly in advanced economies find that they have already exhausted the possibilities of expanding storage capacity however extending the model to investigate the impact and benefit of increased storage is straightforward water inflows to the storage are obtained from the environment it is assumed that current water inflows are observed but future inflows are randomly determined from a known distribution 8 8 the assumed information structure that current inflows are known with certainty but future ones are not moulds the results presented in this paper however alternative information structures could be incorporated into the three period model for instance period 1 might alternatively be interpreted as the near future while period 2 the distant future in this event it might be assumed that inflows are known with more precision in period 1 than period 2 such an assumption is consistent with current forecasting technologies in many countries for example australia s bureau of meteorology currently offers seasonal forecasts the results of such an extension would be qualitatively similar to those presented in this paper however would require a more complex technical analysis thus environmental flows at time t are observed in time t but are seen as random in t 1 denote by i t the environmental flows in period t inflows at time t have the distribution function g t i t and pdf g t i t at time t 1 to keep the analysis as straightforward as possible it will be assumed there are no minimum flow requirements for surface water in practice a minimum flow constraint may be put in place by water authorities possibly for ecological reasons or downstream use requirements however assuming there is no minimum flow requirement does not materially affect the qualitative results of the analysis 9 9 loosely a minimum flow requirement could be added to the analysis by simply interpreting i t as the inflows above that requirement denote a total consumption in period t as c t total consumption must come from the available water so 1 c t s t 1 i t m t the total benefit derived from water consumption is denoted b t c t in each period t the regulator sets the volumetric rate p t in practice it is unlikely that revenue from this source would cover the authority s costs in order to cover these costs the authority could additionally impose a fixed charge on customers which is just sufficient to raise the revenue to cover its cost i e it could adopt a two part tariff the imposition of such a fixed charge would not influence the efficiency conclusions of this paper unless it caused some low benefit consumers to cease participating in the market i e disconnect from the network 10 10 the case in which some consumers may disconnect is an example of the utility pricing originally examined by goldman leland and sibley 39 and brown and sibley 40 analysis of this case is substantially more complex than that considered here under those circumstances in order to raise sufficient revenue to cover costs it is necessary to balance the loss of efficiency associated with the fixed charge due to the exit of customers and the loss of efficiency by setting price greater than marginal cost for ease of exposition the analysis in this paper abstracts from the authority s revenue raising requirement and assumes that there is a zero fixed charge 3 the efficient pricing policy in this section we consider the choices the water authority must take to enact the efficient policy that is the policy which maximises the total surplus from water consumption in a three period model the efficient policy is found using backward induction in this section we sequentially consider the efficient policy in period 2 then in period 1 then the efficient choice of period 1 manufactured water capacity which is decided in period 0 is discussed 3 1 efficient pricing in period 2 in period 2 m 2 and s 1 are inherited from past decisions i 2 is realised and observed consumption must be less than or equal to the available water as shown by 1 when t 2 as period 2 is the final period it is efficient to have zero storage and to not add to manufactured water capacity in that period 11 11 it may be of interest to consider the case in which there is a value or requirement to retain some water in the storage after consumption in period 2 there are two ways this might be accomplished first impose a requirement that dam levels be above some minimum level in period 2 second in period 2 consumption as modelled could be reinterpreted as the sum of storage and consumption benefit in period 2 could be reinterpreted as the sum of the benefit arising from consumption and the benefit arising from storage storage in period 2 would be endogenously generated these two modifications to the model are straightforward but add to the technical detail of the modelling and do not change the qualitative results thus for brevity it is assumed that there is no requirement to generate storage in period 2 thus to achieve efficiency in period 2 the water utility must choose period 2 consumption to maximise the surplus in period 2 b 2 c 2 w 2 c 2 subject to 1 where w 2 is the srmc of water in period 2 define the water consumption level in period 2 c 2 by b 2 c 2 w 2 the consumption level c 2 occurs when the marginal benefit of consumption equals srmc further i 2 c 2 s 1 m 2 the inflow i 2 is the minimum inflow level necessary to ensure that the consumption level c 2 can be realised thus result 1 efficiency in period 2 requires the following 1 if i 2 i 2 then c 2 c 2 and p 2 b 2 c 2 w 2 2 if i 2 i 2 c 2 s 1 i 2 m 2 and p 2 b 2 s 1 i 2 m 2 result 1 is more intuitively understood using fig 1 fig 1 shows the marginal benefit as a function of inflows in period 2 when i 2 i 2 the marginal benefit of the available water is above srmc w 2 and the efficient price is set equal to the marginal benefit at that inflow level however for i 2 i 2 marginal benefit of the available water is less than srmc and some available water is unused the precise statement of result 1 relies on the assumption that all water sources have the same srmc w 2 however as noted above it is straightforward to extend the analysis to incorporate cases in which the srmc of water sources differs to illustrate how this would be done suppose that in period 2 manufactured water had a higher srmc than environmentally sourced water in this case the water authority has an additional decision to make in each period namely which source to supply water from in period 2 specifically efficiency requires that the water authority utilise environmentally sourced water first and after that was exhausted turn to manufactured water rather than being the horizontal line in fig 1 the srmc curve would have a step at the level of environmental inflows the size of the step would equal the difference in srmc between environmental sources and manufactured water in this event the efficient price would occur where the marginal benefit curve b 2 s 1 i 2 m 2 cuts that new stepped srmc curve if given the realisation of inflows the efficient price is below that of the srmc of manufactured water then the authority would not utilise manufactured water otherwise the efficient price would equal the srmc of manufactured water and some manufactured water would be used further analysis and discussion of the case in which the srmc of water sources are different is provided in the appendix however it is apparent from the above discussion that allowing for this possibility does not affect the qualitative nature of results from the model but it does expand the analysis by including an additional decision to be made by the water authority namely which water source to use to keep the discussion as brief as possible it will be assumed below that there is a common srmc of all water sources the above approach can be readily adapted to extend the results presented below to incorporate differences in the srmc of water sources 3 2 efficient pricing in period 1 srmc pricing using result 1 in period 1 the expected price in period 2 e 1 p 2 is equal to the expected marginal benefit of consumption in period 2 that is 2 e 1 p 2 0 i 2 b 2 s 1 m 2 g 2 ξ d ξ 1 g 2 i 2 w 2 where e t is the expectation formed at time t 0 1 in period 1 the level of manufactured water m 1 and the storage s 0 are exogenous having been inherited from decisions in period 0 the expected discounted surplus in period 1 from water provision is given by 3 b 1 c 1 e 1 b 2 c 2 1 i w 1 c 1 w 2 e 1 c 2 1 i r m 2 m 1 1 i where i is the discount rate r m 2 m 1 is the cost of expanding period 2 manufactured water capacity and where using result 1 the expected benefit from consumption in period 2 e 1 b 2 c 2 is given by e 1 b 2 c 2 0 i 2 b 2 s 1 m 2 g 2 ξ d ξ 1 g 2 i 2 b c 2 it is assumed that r 0 and r 0 assuming increasing marginal cost of manufactured water capacity in period 2 i e r 0 allows the three period model to be interpreted in an analogous manner to an infinite time horizon analysis to see this analogy recall that urban water utilitys infrastructure is often lumpy in nature e g dams pipelines etc and thus textbook marginal analysis is not directly applicable turvey 1 4 suggests a reformulation of marginal cost for utilities that enables the use of marginal cost methodology when capital is lumpy turvey envisages utility s investment decisions as an ongoing process an incremental increase in the growth of demand can be accommodated by incrementally advancing the utility s efficient investment plans in turvey s framework a manufactured water capacity expansion can be interpreted as bring forward the capacity expansion program the assumption that there is an increasing marginal cost of capacity in period 2 of our model could be interpreted as the analogue of bringing capacity expansion forward in time in turvey s infinite time horizon setting water availability in period 1 satisfies 1 with t 1 the water utility is also constrained by available storage 4 0 s 1 k manufactured water capacity in period 2 is greater than period 1 if the capacity is expanded otherwise the capacities in both periods are equal that is 5 m 2 m 1 0 in period 1 the efficient policy requires the choice of s 1 m 2 and c 1 so as to maximise the surplus 3 subject to constraints 1 4 and 5 the water authority s efficient decisions depend on the observed inflows before identifying the efficient policy it is useful to define four critical inflow levels let i 1 be the inflow level where the water authority is indifferent between adding the first unit of water to the storage or not that is it is the inflow level in period 1 at which retaining the first unit of water in the storage or consuming it provides the same expected surplus this will be the inflow level where without storage the marginal surplus of water in period 1 is equal to the expected marginal surplus in period 2 if i 1 i 1 the marginal benefit of water available for consumption in period 1 is greater than the expected marginal benefit in period 2 in this event it is not efficient to store water however if i 1 i 1 then in the absence of storage the expected marginal benefit of water in period 2 would be greater than the marginal benefit in period 1 in this event it would be efficient for the water authority to transfer water from period 1 to period 2 via storage note also that i 1 could be zero that is the existing stock of stored water and manufactured water is sufficient to ensure that some water is stored irrespective of the inflow level the mathematical derivation of the inflow i 1 and also the mathematical derivation of the other three critical inflows defined below are given in the appendix water stored in period 1 can be used to supply water in period 2 and thus can be used to replace some expansion of manufactured water capacity in particular the higher the inflow level in period 1 the more water is available to be stored for use in period 2 reducing the need for capacity expansion let i 1 c be the level of inflow in period 1 which is sufficient to create enough storage for use in period 2 that the water authority is indifferent between incrementally increasing the existing period 1 capacity of manufactured water or not for i 1 i 1 c the authority will expand manufactured water capacity while for i 1 i 1 c the authority efficiently uses stored water as a substitute for capacity expansion the storage capacity places a limit on how much current water can be transferred to substituted for the future consumption let i 1 n be the minimum inflow for which the water authority is willing to completely fill the storage thus for i 1 i 1 n the storage is not filled while the storage is filled to capacity for i 1 i 1 n finally let i 1 be the inflow that yields the marginal benefit of consumption equal to srmc inflow i 1 is the minimum inflow for which water scarcity is not an issue thus for i 1 i 1 all available water is either consumed or stored in period 1 the price in period 1 p 1 is set greater than w 1 the srmc in period 1 for i 1 i 1 not all available water is consumed or stored and price in period 1 is set equal to srmc in period 1 in this case the excess volume of water i 1 i 1 passes through the surface water network before discussing the relative magnitude of these critical inflows consider the efficient allocation of water across periods if water is stored it is efficient to equate the expected marginal surplus from water consumption across the two periods 6 b 1 c 1 w 1 ϖ 1 i e 1 b 2 c 2 w 2 observe the surplus from future water consumption is discounted in the usual way and also discounted for evaporation water will not be stored in period 1 if the marginal surplus in period 1 is greater than the discounted marginal surplus in period 2 this will occur when water is relatively scarce in period 1 similarly if the storage is full the marginal surplus in period 1 is less than the discounted marginal surplus in period 2 now return to the relative magnitude of the critical inflows discussed above by assumption i 1 0 it is necessary that i 1 i 1 c when water is not stored future water demand can be only satisfied by infrastructure expansion in this case capital expansion would be that same as that which would occur in the absence of storage so could be zero adding saved water to the second period would lower the marginal benefit of water in the second period and thus marginal benefit would be lower than the marginal cost of infrastructure i e the last increment of infrastructure at the boundary the authority is indifferent between storing a unit of water or building the last unit of infrastructure consequently i 1 i 1 c as water inflows in period 1 increase the marginal benefit of water in both periods 1 and 2 decreases with the efficient balance of consumption across periods given by 6 because of falling marginal benefit in period 2 due to increased flows in period 1 the efficient level of capacity expansion declines it reduces to zero at inflow level i 1 c observe also that it is possible that the inflow where it is efficient to just fill the storage i 1 n is either greater or less than i 1 c this case in which i 1 n i 1 c corresponds with a relatively large storage specifically the inflow level i 1 c occurs at an inflow level where it is efficient to not fill the storage on the other hand if i 1 n i 1 c the storage will be filled at an inflow level for which it is still efficient to expand manufactured water capacity i e the storage is relatively small 12 12 note i 1 c i 1 0 corresponds with zero storage capacity it is assumed that marginal benefit is greater than srmc in period 1 at sufficiently low levels of consumption that is it is efficient to produce at least some water further the expected efficient price in period 2 is greater than srmc in period 1 as must for example be the case if w 1 w 2 in this case i 1 i 1 c i 1 the efficient pricing and capacity expansion policy will depend on the relative size of the thresholds defined above for the discussion assume that i 1 i 1 c i 1 n i 1 such an assumption corresponds with a relatively large storage 13 13 other relationships between the thresholds are also possible for example it is possible that the water storage is relatively small i e i 1 i 1 n i 1 c i 1 alternatively it is possible that the storage is larger than the volume which could be efficiently used i 1 i 1 c i 1 i 1 n such alternative relationships between the thresholds can be analysed in a similar way to result 2 in the appendix a modified statement of result 2 and fig 2 are provided for the case of small storage then result 2 assume that i 1 i 1 c i 1 n i 1 the efficient policy in period 1 requires 1 if i 1 i 1 s 1 0 c 1 s 0 i 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 p 1 b 1 c 1 2 if i 1 i 1 i 1 c 0 s 1 s 0 i 1 m 1 c 1 s k m 1 m 2 m 2

1 where 7 r m 2 m 1 0 i 2 b 2 m 2 g 2 ξ d ξ g 2 i 2 w 2 and 8 p 1 s w 1 ϖ 1 i e 1 p 2 w 2 the intuition behind result 2 is best summarised using fig 2 the curve b 1 i 1 in fig 2 shows the marginal benefit of water given the efficient policy is followed the efficient price is equated to marginal benefit in fig 2 inflows in period 1 determine the price and therefore the amount that is consumed and stored in that period first consider inflows less than i 1 at this low level of inflow water in period 1 is sufficiently scarce that it is not efficient to store water for period 2 this means that no stored water is available in period 2 and consumption in period 2 must be sourced from either environmental flows or manufactured water the efficient capacity of manufactured water in period 2 is m 2 which is given by 7 equation 7 states that the capacity in period 2 should be expanded to the point where the expected marginal benefit of increased capacity of manufactured water equals its marginal cost it is efficient to store water for environmental inflows greater than i 1 for inflows between i 1 and i 1 n the efficient price of water p 1 s is given by 8 the price p 1 s reflects the future opportunity cost of water 30 in particular the left hand side of 8 is the marginal surplus in period 1 and the right hand side is the discounted marginal surplus in period 2 thus pricing according to 8 ensures the efficient intertemporal allocation of water for inflows between i 1 and i 1 n for inflows i 1 i 1 c it is efficient to expand infrastructure more specifically for inflows in period 1 i 1 i 1 i 1 c the efficient value of capacity in period 2 m 2 equates the marginal benefit of capacity and its marginal cost that is 9 e 1 p 2 c w 0 i 2 b 2 s 1 m 2 g 2 ξ d ξ g 2 i 2 w 2 r m 2 m 1 from 8 price in period 1 satisfies 10 p 1 s w 1 ϖ 1 i r m 2 m 1 note that increased storage in period 1 reduces m 2 therefore inflows in period 1 determine how much manufactured water is produced in period 2 the more inflows the more storage the less manufactured water is required in particular the maximum capacity of manufactured water in period 2 will be installed when inflows are less than or equal to i 1 similarly no additional manufactured water capacity is installed when inflows are greater than or equal to i 1 c beyond this level of inflows increased inflows are shared between current and future consumption this continues until the storages are filled at inflow level i 1 n once flows have reached i 1 n the efficient amount of stored water has reached capacity and thus no additional water can be transferred to future use further inflows are consumed in the current period however once flows are greater than i 1 n it is not efficient to consume all available water as the marginal benefit of available water is less than srmc an increase in the quantity of water stored from the previous period will shift the curve b 1 i 1 in fig 2 to the left and thus will affect the efficient policy in this case it will be efficient to set a lower price in period 1 and thus lower expected price in period 2 increase the amount of stored water and reduce manufactured water capacity expenditure similarly having a higher level of manufactured water capacity in period 1 also shifts the curve b 1 i 1 to the left resulting in an analogous change to the efficient policy observe there are numerous possible special cases of result 2 for instance it is possible that i 1 i 1 c in this case it is not efficient to expand infrastructure irrespective of the inflow level in period 1 for example there may already be sufficient infrastructure in period 1 to satisfy the expected demand in period 2 alternatively relatively large inflows are predicted in period 2 and thus infrastructure expansion is not efficient in this special case water is only stored for all inflows above i 1 i 1 c another special case occurs when i 1 c i 1 n in this case for all inflows such that i 1 i 1 i 1 c i 1 n efficiency requires some water to be stored as well as some capacity expansion for all inflows greater than i 1 c i 1 n it is efficient to fill the dam but not to expand infrastructure 3 3 efficient pricing in period 0 long run marginal cost pricing in this section we consider the efficient level of infrastructure specifically manufactured water capacity in period 1 as the level of infrastructure available in period 1 is determined in period 0 we must analyse the decisions made in period 0 this analysis provides insight into the role of lrmc in the pricing and investment decision for simplicity assume that i 1 c i 1 n the period 1 price expected in period 0 e o p 1 is e o p 1 0 i 1 b 1 s 0 m 1 g 1 ξ d ξ i 1 i 1 n b 1 s 0 m 1 s 1 g 1 ξ d ξ i 1 n i 1 b 1 s 0

is assumed that r m 2 m 1 r 1 note that lrmc pricing holds in expectation in period 0 but once the state of the world is revealed in period 1 price is given by result 1 and will almost never equal the expected lrmc thus an approach of setting a price equal to lrmc irrespective of the level of environmental flows is unlikely to achieve efficiency 4 moral suasion the first of the three extensions to the fundamental model developed in the previous section is now presented in the above analysis it has been assumed as is the case in most markets that price in particular the volumetric rate is used to ration water one of the unusual features of the regulation of water utilities is that moral suasion is more commonly used during droughts to ration water than is price assume that moral suasion lowers the benefit of water consumption let z be the extent of moral suasion undertaken by the water authority in period 1 consumer benefit is given by b 1 c 1 z b 1 u c 1 where b 1 u c 1 is the underlying consumer demand and z is the responsiveness of demand to moral suasion with μ z 0 we wish to compare two policies designed to deal with a realisation of low inflows a moral suasion policy which keeps price fixed at some regulated level e g lrmc and a pricing policy where price and other decisions are as described in section 3 2 in practice there may be a cost associated with implementing the moral suasion policy for instance it may be necessary for the water authority to purchase advertising when implementing a moral suasion policy however it is worth noting that it is also not always costless for the water authority to change price though it is usual for economists to assume that this cost is negligible whittington and nauges 31 provide a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of using moral suasion versus pricing to ration water for simplicity this paper s analysis abstracts from both costs though allowance for either type of cost could be readily included for the discussion in this section assume again for simplicity that in period 1 it will always either be i efficient to expand manufactured water capacity to some extent i e i 1 i 1 i 1 c i 1 n or ii that it is never optimal to expand that capacity i e i 1 i 1 c i 1 i 1 n we will also assume moral suasion is only used in period 1 and not in period 2 result 4 suppose it is optimal to undertake storage in period 1 under efficient pricing as described in result 2 then 1 the moral suasion policy results in lower consumption and higher storage in period 1 than the efficient pricing policy 2 if it is efficient to construct infrastructure under the efficient pricing policy there will be less constructed under a moral suasion policy 3 price will be lower in period 2 under a moral suasion policy than under the efficient pricing policy assuming r 0 result 4 can be understood using fig 3 assume i 1 i 1 i 1 c i 1 n consider a realisation of inflows i 1 d that results in the efficient price with no moral suasion p 1 d to be higher than p 1 r the regulated price at the regulated price water inflows would need to be i 1 r for the price p 1 r to yield the optimal allocation of water between periods consequently at price p 1 r with inflows at i 1 d consumption is above its optimal level in period 1 and thus storage below its optimal level moral suasion can be used to reduce consumers marginal benefit if consumers are sufficiently sensitive to moral suasion marginal benefit can be reduced so that price p 1 r is optimal given the inflows i 1 d the new marginal benefit curve is shown as the curve z b 1 c 1 in fig 3 result 2 can then be applied using the new marginal benefit curve equation 6 shows that an efficient allocation of water across periods 1 and 2 occurs when the marginal surplus across both periods is equated thus when moral suasion reduces the marginal benefit in period 1 efficiency requires a concomitant reduction in marginal benefit in period 2 thus relative to the efficient pricing policy there will be relatively more consumption under the moral suasion policy in period 2 additionally the lower marginal benefit in period 2 means a lower expected price in period 2 which by 9 means less expansion of manufactured water capacity both the increased consumption and lower capacity means there will need to be additional storage in period 1 thus there needs to be less consumption in period 1 under a moral suasion policy than would be the case under an efficient pricing policy as it is assumed in our model that moral suasion lowers the benefit in period 1 a moral suasion policy necessarily yields a lower surplus than an efficient pricing policy however notice that under a moral suasion policy there is i a lower volumetric rate ii less infrastructure expenditure and iii less water consumed it should be noted that the extent to which these conclusions are possible is dependent on the sensitivity of consumer demand to moral suasion if customers do not respond strongly or only temporarily to a particular implementation of moral suasion it may not be possible to maintain a constant volumetric rate during a drought without some other instrument such as restrictions being used furthermore the reduction in infrastructure spending due to moral suasion would be correspondingly small however as yet there is insufficient empirical analyses available to assess the magnitude or even the existence of these effects in practice this would clearly be an area of research which would benefit from further investigation result 4 implies that customers in aggregate face a lower total water bill under the moral suasion policy than under the pricing policy thus our analysis suggests a reason why water authorities and regulatory agencies usually prefer moral suasion over pricing specifically such agencies will be reluctant to undertake a pricing policy if high water bills create a political backlash however note that such concerns are about transfers between the water authority and its customers rather than efficiency in the analysis of this section we assumed that moral suasion is not used in period 2 it would be natural to ask whether it could be used to reduce demand in period 2 thereby reallocating some consumption toward period 1 such a strategy would have the advantage of reducing the level of storage required in period 1 and further reducing the expansion of infrastructure however the success of such a strategy will depend on the durability of the impact of moral suasion moral suasion s effectiveness may reduce if it is repeatedly used to manage demand in our analysis it has been assumed that the water authority uses either pricing or moral suasion and not some combination of both this approach was taken because water authorities usually do not use pricing yet it might seem that some combination of a pricing and moral suasion might be preferable to the use of moral suasion alone however it may be possible that the use of pricing crowds out the impact of moral suasion so it is not effective to use both in concert see gneezy et al 32 for a review of the academic literature in a review aimed at policy advice lacetera 33 argues most of the current evidence shows that economic incentives when properly designed can enhance several types of prosocial behaviour and intrinsically motivated activities outcomes also appear to be influenced by differences in institutional details such as the way rewards are presented there would thus appear to be potential for combining moral suasion and pricing in response to drought condition though utilising the correct framing of the pricing response in relation to the use of moral suasion would be important in obtaining the correct outcome particularly given the highly emotional and politicised atmosphere around water use in a drought while previous experimental work is useful in suggesting that pricing and moral suasion could be successfully used concurrently further research is required into explicitly how moral suasion and pricing interact in determining urban water demand 5 water security in this section we return to the fundamental pricing model presented in section 3 however it is now supposed that there is a minimum acceptable level of consumption per person in period 2 c 2 water security requires that even with zero environmental inflow consumption can be at least c 2 thus the utility must satisfy the water security constraint c 2 s 1 m 2 it may be the case that the above constraint is satisfied by the efficient storage and capacity levels m 2 and s 1 found above in this case water security is guaranteed by enacting the efficient storage and investment decisions however result 5 suppose that c 2 s 1 m 2 and in the absence of this constraint there is sufficient storage capacity available and it is efficient to expand manufactured water capacity when r 0 increasing marginal cost of infrastructure water security is efficiently achieved by both storing additional water and installing additional manufactured water capacity such that 8 holds further the price in period 1 satisfies 10 while ϖ 1 i e 1 p 2 w 2 p 1 s w 1 a n d i 1 i 1 when the water security constraint is binding more future water is required than would be efficient in the absence of the constraint at the margin the value of water today is equal to the discounted marginal cost of manufactured water as given by 10 to expand future availability requires providing additional capacity which has a higher marginal cost than the unconstrained period 1 price thus it is efficient to increase the quantity of water stored which in the unconstrained case has a price below the discounted marginal cost of capacity the cost minimising way to provide future water is to expand both manufactured water capacity and storage note that if marginal cost of manufactured water capacity in period 2 is constant the requirement that price is smoothed across periods means that it is efficient to expand capacity alone to satisfy the water security constraint by similar reasoning the minimum inflow level at which it is efficient to store water is lower when the water security constraint is binding note that we have not considered a minimum current level of water consumption violating such a constraint would be apparent to regulators and in this event it would not be possible to store water in this case increased future manufactured water capacity would be the only way to meet the water security constraint in period 2 a number of cases are not considered in result 5 however these cases are straightforward to analyse for instance if the marginal cost of manufactured water capacity is sufficiently large i e it is not efficient to expand that capacity then it is necessary to satisfy the water security constraint by increasing storage similarly if there is not sufficient storage capacity available it is necessary to satisfy the water security constraint through building additional manufactured water capacity 6 efficient pricing with a single lumpy addition to capacity in this section it is shown how the fundamental model presented in section 3 can be augmented when there is only one large expansion of the manufactured water capacity possible in period 1 specifically it is assumed that in period 1 manufactured water capacity can only be increased by the discrete amount δ m m 2 m 1 let m 2 m 1 0 m 1 i f δ m 0 m 1 i f δ m 0 capacity augmentation δ m is efficient when it increases the discounted expected surplus in period 1 specifically capacity augmentation is efficient inefficient in period 1 if b 1 c 1 b 1 c 1 0 w 1 c 1 c 1 0 e 1 b 2 c 2 b 2 c 2 0 1 i w 2 e 1 c 2 c 2 0 1 i r m 2 m 1 0 1 i the left hand side of the above equation is decreasing in inflows let the critical inflow i 1 occur when the above equation holds with equality the critical inflow price in period 1 occurs when inflows in period 1 and 2 prices are sufficiently low and storage sufficiently high that augmentation is not efficient result 6 capacity is increased when current inflows are less than i 1 this case is shown in fig 4 fig 4 is adapted from fig 2 if no augmentation is undertaken δ m 0 price can be shown on a modified version of fig 2 where i 1 i 1 c the marginal benefit curve with no capacity expansion is shown as b 1 0 i 1 if augmentation is undertaken m 2 m 1 an analogous diagram can be constructed from fig 2 when augmentation is undertaken by taking i 1 c i 1 n the marginal benefit curve in this case is shown b 1 i 1 these two schedules b 1 0 i 1 and b 1 i 1 are overlain in fig 4 to show the efficient price for each level of inflow when period 1 inflows are less than i 1 then the marginal benefit of additional water is sufficiently great that the benefit of investment is greater than the cost the additional future capacity allows the utility to store less thereby increasing current and future consumption and lowering current and future price when period 1 inflows are more than i 1 then the benefit of investment is less than the cost as period 1 inflows increase from just below i 1 to just above i 1 there is an increase in price in both periods this is because the investment is not undertaken for inflows over i 1 and this reduces the availability of water in both periods nonetheless for all inflows between i 1 and i 1 n the prices in periods 1 and 2 are related as follows to reflect the opportunity cost of water as given by 8 the pricing rule 8 does not hold for i 1 i 1 as no water is stored and also does not hold for i 1 i 1 n as the storages are at capacity 7 discussion in this paper a three period model of an urban water network is developed the model identifies how the pricing storage and capacity decisions for the network are all interrelated and provides a clear illustration of how this occurs it thus allows for a number of important policy decisions to be analysed in a coherent manner firstly the model clarifies the role of lrmc pricing in the presence of uncertainty this rule requires future capacity levels to be chosen so that expected future marginal benefit of consumption is equal to the lrmc that is the expected future price is equal to lrmc lrmc pricing is thus best understood as a rule for the determination of network capacity the price storage and capacity expansion decisions in a current period will depend on the realisation of the state of nature specifically the level of inflows current storage and current manufacturing capacity when current water availability is very low current use has a high marginal benefit in this case it is not efficient to store water but rather to focus on building future capacity to satisfy future demand the efficient price will be sufficiently high that there is no excess demand for the available water when water availability is very high it is efficient to store the maximum amount of water and consume all water for which marginal benefit is greater than srmc when some water is stored it is efficient to equate the current marginal benefit of current water consumption to the expected discounted marginal benefit of future consumption consequently both the current and expected future price are related to the current and expected future inflows the current dam level the current and future manufactured water capacity it is almost never efficient to set the current price of water equal to the lrmc the model is used to analyse the impact of moral suasion as a demand management tool for urban water it is shown that the optimal use of moral suasion would yield a different consumption and investment pattern than the efficient use of pricing in particular a moral suasion policy of demand management suppresses current consumption and expands future consumption relative to a pricing policy a moral suasion policy also suppresses future capacity expansion but not the volume of stored water the model can also be used to identify the efficient manner to ensure water security i e to guarantee that water availability never falls below some minimum level it was shown that when manufactured water capacity expansion is viable it is efficient to ensure future water security through increasing both storage and initiating capacity expansion in the current period the additional future supply thus created means that the expected future price is lower than it would otherwise be consequently this method of ensuring future water security means that the marginal benefit for current consumption will be higher than the expected discounted marginal benefit of future consumption a moral suasion policy is more compatible with achieving water security than a pricing policy as it increases the expected future water availability additionally a moral suasion policy generates lower total household water bills than a pricing policy because it suppresses capacity expansion these two impacts may make moral suasion an attractive policy to regulators however we note that a moral suasion policy is effective only because it lowers marginal benefit thereby destroying surplus furthermore a moral suasion policy may lose its effectiveness with time if households become impervious to its message with repeated use further research into this issue would be needed to draw definitive conclusions regarding the use of moral suasion in controlling urban water demand appendix a supplementary data the following is are the

8696,an urban water network with storage and uncertain environmental water inflows is modelled this three period model is analytically tractable and allows for a straightforward study of the relative economic impact of different policy regimes the model is used to identify the water authority s first best pricing policy and its relation to long run marginal cost pricing the model is then used to identify the implications of adopting the most commonly used rationing method when environmental flows are uncertain setting a smoothed priced often lrmc exclusive of scarcity value and using moral suasion rather than pricing to control the demand for water the optimal manner to address water security is also addressed keywords efficient urban water pricing moral suasion environmental uncertainty storage levels 1 introduction being a public utility it is common for the price set by urban water networks to be regulated regulators have been advised that setting the volumetric rate of urban water equal to its long run marginal cost lrmc will achieve economic efficiency for example 1 2 3 this pricing methodology is devised to price efficiently when ongoing increases in demand necessitates lumpy capacity expansion 1 4 5 in recent years regulators in some jurisdictions have set a volumetric rate for urban water that takes into account their estimate of its lrmc 1 1 it is common for australian regulators to utilise estimates of lrmc in their pricing for example independent competition and regulatory commission 34 and independent pricing and regulatory tribunal 35 p 136 it should be noted that these jurisdictions are ones with large storages and uncertain environmental inflows into those storages nonetheless there are numerous examples of regulators who have deviated from lrmc pricing of urban water 6 11 due to reasons such as complications in determining the full cost of supplying water 12 or taking into account social considerations 13 this calculation of lrmc usually assumes steady demand growth and minimal uncertainty in the availability of supply when the water available to the water utility from the environment referred to as environmental flows below is uncertain regulators typically set a smoothed price and use water restrictions and moral suasion to reduce demand at times of water scarcity during droughts for instance it is common for the population to be called on to reduce their consumption of urban water for the common good however there has been a growing recognition that this methodology particularly that of maintaining a steady price may mis price water in environments in which there is supply uncertainly due to environmental fluctuations 14 15 in addition this methodology does not effectively consider the role of storage in managing uncertain environmental flows this paper develops a theoretical economic model of an urban water network with uncertain environmental flows and storage the aim of this analysis is to determine the impact of regulators pricing storage and capacity expansion decisions and thus to develop a coherent analytical framework that can be used to inform policy issues as they arise as such the model provides a qualitative insight into important water pricing issues e g refs 6 16 19 and also the optimal investment in water infrastructure e g refs 20 21 typically regulators face an economic environment which is complex to model and analyse both the academic literature and policy work rely on numerical simulations see for example 22 2 2 numerical models are often used to model the pricing and capacity options for particular urban water networks for example see refs 20 22 numerical models provide detailed insight into specific scenarios however by their nature numerical models are tailored to particular networks it is often not clear how to generalise results from numerical models therefore their conclusions are not readily adapted to analyse different scenarios in different networks the three period model developed in this paper is analytically tractable indeed it can be summarised on a single diagram however it incorporates some key characteristics of urban water supply networks thus has sufficient detail to reveal underlying principles at play when regulating urban water utilities specifically the model is applied to the analysis of moral suasion when used as a tool to reduce demand during droughts it is also used to analyse the most efficient way to ensure urban water security storage is an important feature of those water networks that use it to mitigate variations in environmental flows for some regions storage is used predominantly to smooth flows from the seasonal variations however in other regions storage mitigates variations in flows over extended drought periods for instance the el niño southern oscillation atmospheric phenomenon causes variation in rainfall in countries around the pacific in australia for instance dams are constructed to smooth water supply to variations in the southern oscillation sydney for example has dam capacity of approximately 4 years worth of supply the three period model in this paper considers an urban water region that has these characteristics one or more large multi year storages which are used only for urban water the analysis does not formally incorporate groundwater sources or alternative uses for available water such as agriculture however the modelling approach can readily be extended to incorporate such features identifying the efficient balance of present consumption storage and capacity expansion in the face of such uncertainty is essential for effective economic regulation when such large storages are available there will necessarily be an interaction between storage and capacity expansion for instance when storages are full infrastructure decision may be deferred for a time such a deferral can achieve significant efficiencies however when lower environmental inflows result in storages being at a lower level capacity expansion will be more pressing in these circumstances either high volumetric rates or moral suasion could be used to delay capacity expansion the model developed in this paper assumes a water authority has access to a given storage capacity in the context of this paper that capacity is the volume of water in a storage that is available to supply customers the water authority is also capable of expanding the manufactured water capacity desalination and recycling in the initial formulation of the model we assume that the water authority chooses the volumetric rate for water to manage water demand in order to achieve the efficient balance of consumption storage and capacity in this configuration the model shows the efficient price smooths consumption consequently the efficient current price and expected future price are both dependent on the current state of water availability that the efficient amount of water stored is thus also state dependent that the efficient manufactured water capacity is also state dependent when stored water can substitute for capacity expansion that expected lrmc guides efficient investment decisions rather than efficient water allocation within a period some water authorities implement either single part constant volumetric tariffs or two part tariffs 3 3 the most common tariff structure implemented by water providers globally is increasing or inclining block tariffs 36 increasing block tariffs are not modelled in this paper however the approach developed here could be adapted to compare their impacts with those pricing structures that are modelled however these providers very rarely vary the volumetric rate of water to control demand during droughts 4 4 loaiciga and renehan 37 however report of the use of pricing to control demand in santa barbara california during the 1987 1992 drought note that the seasonal pricing of water is also used in some jurisdictions hoque and wichelns 38 report on the use of seasonal pricing in los angeles california the preferred mechanism to control demand is either moral suasion or restrictions or some combination of the two theoretical economic analyses of urban water regulation do not normally formally model moral suasion 5 5 the impact of moral suasion has sometimes been incorporated into numerical models via mechanism such as water saving incentives and reduction in water demand growth see independent competition and regulatory commission 34 however some cases in which moral suasion has reduced water demand during droughts has been documented it is reported by refs 23 24 that moral suasion involving social comparisons can have effects which persist over two years similarly moral suasion including a voluntary use target was used significantly in southeast queensland australia as a response to the millennium drought 2000 2008 the strategy adopted during this event resulted in significant and persistent reductions in urban water use 25 26 the model is extended to analyse the use of moral suasion rather than pricing to control demand during a drought moral suasion is modelled as causing a reduction in consumers marginal benefit of water consumption it is possible that moral suasion may not be sufficiently effective to control demand but if it is we show that the optimal policy after moral suasion is implemented involves lower current consumption higher levels of stored water and higher future consumption than would occur if price were efficiently used to control demand lower investment in manufactured water capacity than would be the case if pricing were used provided stored water can substitute for capacity expansion a lower total water bill charged to customers than under pricing in our analysis we do not consider the use of water restrictions rather than price or moral suasion to control demand during droughts while the model could be extended to study restrictions their negative impact on economic efficiency is relatively well understood thus for brevity restrictions are excluded from the analysis in this paper however note that restrictions are known to cause a misallocation across consumers and a dynamic inefficiency estimates of those economic costs of restrictions are relatively very high 27 28 when water supplies are highly variable as a consequence of climatic variation there is a concern that a drought of long duration will result in insufficient water being available for minimum requirements we use the model to consider the efficient method for water authorities to provide such water security firstly note that the efficient storage and capacity decision might be sufficient to provide water security however if this is not the case the efficient policies will need to be modified to ensure water security is achieved we show the imposition of a water security requirement increases both the efficient storage of water and manufactured water capacity in order to ensure water is never below a minimum level that consumption is no longer smoothed as described above as the expected future marginal benefit is lower because of the extra storage and capacity needed to provide water security 2 the model key assumptions the model has three periods denoted by the subscript t where t 0 1 2 period 0 is interpreted as the past period 1 the present period 2 the future 6 6 it is common practice in economic theory particularly industrial organisation to utilise a 2 or 3 period representation of a model rather than infinite time horizon representation of that model by identifying choices and behaviours in their penultimate period these finite period models are sufficient to qualitatively identify the key dynamic interactions that are present in each period of an infinite time horizon representation of the model importantly a finite period representation of a model is substantially more analytically tractable than its infinite time horizon version and it is thus more straightforward to identify key insights in the finite period representation in each period water supply comes from the previous period s storage s t 1 manufactured desalinated or recycled water m t and environmental inflows into the storage i t for simplicity it is assumed that each of these water sources has short run marginal cost exclusive of the cost of scarcity of supplying potable water to customers w t which is common across each source in practice the relative short run marginal cost srmc of inflows such as surface water and manufactured water will differ and the difference will vary with location indeed some estimates have the srmc of manufactured water between 1 and 3 times the srmc of environmentally sourced water 29 however as will be discussed below assuming common srmc across sources does not have a material impact on the qualitative interpretation of the results of the analysis 7 7 it is straightforward but mathematically dense to extend the analysis to the case where different sources have different srmc by assuming a common srmc it is not necessary to consider issues around the choice of production method in each period though clearly if production costs differ it will be the source with the lowest of those costs which is the first to be utilised this is discussed further in section 3 1 the manufactured water capacity in periods t 1 2 m t is determined in period t 1 there is an initial manufactured water capacity in period 0 m 0 for most of the paper we assume manufactured water capacity is infinitely divisible in some instances this will be a good approximation to reality in large cities such as sydney small scale recycling plants and incremental increases in desalination capacity are possible to show the applicability of the approach we also consider in section 6 the case in which the manufactured water capacity can be expanded by one large discrete amount water is stored in a dam which has a maximum capacity k in periods t 0 1 the water utility can store an amount s t where storage must be less than k and non negative stored water evaporates at a rate 1 ϖ it is further assumed for simplicity that there is no cost of storing water per se we do not investigate changes in dam size i e changes in k in the analysis in this paper many water authorities particularly in advanced economies find that they have already exhausted the possibilities of expanding storage capacity however extending the model to investigate the impact and benefit of increased storage is straightforward water inflows to the storage are obtained from the environment it is assumed that current water inflows are observed but future inflows are randomly determined from a known distribution 8 8 the assumed information structure that current inflows are known with certainty but future ones are not moulds the results presented in this paper however alternative information structures could be incorporated into the three period model for instance period 1 might alternatively be interpreted as the near future while period 2 the distant future in this event it might be assumed that inflows are known with more precision in period 1 than period 2 such an assumption is consistent with current forecasting technologies in many countries for example australia s bureau of meteorology currently offers seasonal forecasts the results of such an extension would be qualitatively similar to those presented in this paper however would require a more complex technical analysis thus environmental flows at time t are observed in time t but are seen as random in t 1 denote by i t the environmental flows in period t inflows at time t have the distribution function g t i t and pdf g t i t at time t 1 to keep the analysis as straightforward as possible it will be assumed there are no minimum flow requirements for surface water in practice a minimum flow constraint may be put in place by water authorities possibly for ecological reasons or downstream use requirements however assuming there is no minimum flow requirement does not materially affect the qualitative results of the analysis 9 9 loosely a minimum flow requirement could be added to the analysis by simply interpreting i t as the inflows above that requirement denote a total consumption in period t as c t total consumption must come from the available water so 1 c t s t 1 i t m t the total benefit derived from water consumption is denoted b t c t in each period t the regulator sets the volumetric rate p t in practice it is unlikely that revenue from this source would cover the authority s costs in order to cover these costs the authority could additionally impose a fixed charge on customers which is just sufficient to raise the revenue to cover its cost i e it could adopt a two part tariff the imposition of such a fixed charge would not influence the efficiency conclusions of this paper unless it caused some low benefit consumers to cease participating in the market i e disconnect from the network 10 10 the case in which some consumers may disconnect is an example of the utility pricing originally examined by goldman leland and sibley 39 and brown and sibley 40 analysis of this case is substantially more complex than that considered here under those circumstances in order to raise sufficient revenue to cover costs it is necessary to balance the loss of efficiency associated with the fixed charge due to the exit of customers and the loss of efficiency by setting price greater than marginal cost for ease of exposition the analysis in this paper abstracts from the authority s revenue raising requirement and assumes that there is a zero fixed charge 3 the efficient pricing policy in this section we consider the choices the water authority must take to enact the efficient policy that is the policy which maximises the total surplus from water consumption in a three period model the efficient policy is found using backward induction in this section we sequentially consider the efficient policy in period 2 then in period 1 then the efficient choice of period 1 manufactured water capacity which is decided in period 0 is discussed 3 1 efficient pricing in period 2 in period 2 m 2 and s 1 are inherited from past decisions i 2 is realised and observed consumption must be less than or equal to the available water as shown by 1 when t 2 as period 2 is the final period it is efficient to have zero storage and to not add to manufactured water capacity in that period 11 11 it may be of interest to consider the case in which there is a value or requirement to retain some water in the storage after consumption in period 2 there are two ways this might be accomplished first impose a requirement that dam levels be above some minimum level in period 2 second in period 2 consumption as modelled could be reinterpreted as the sum of storage and consumption benefit in period 2 could be reinterpreted as the sum of the benefit arising from consumption and the benefit arising from storage storage in period 2 would be endogenously generated these two modifications to the model are straightforward but add to the technical detail of the modelling and do not change the qualitative results thus for brevity it is assumed that there is no requirement to generate storage in period 2 thus to achieve efficiency in period 2 the water utility must choose period 2 consumption to maximise the surplus in period 2 b 2 c 2 w 2 c 2 subject to 1 where w 2 is the srmc of water in period 2 define the water consumption level in period 2 c 2 by b 2 c 2 w 2 the consumption level c 2 occurs when the marginal benefit of consumption equals srmc further i 2 c 2 s 1 m 2 the inflow i 2 is the minimum inflow level necessary to ensure that the consumption level c 2 can be realised thus result 1 efficiency in period 2 requires the following 1 if i 2 i 2 then c 2 c 2 and p 2 b 2 c 2 w 2 2 if i 2 i 2 c 2 s 1 i 2 m 2 and p 2 b 2 s 1 i 2 m 2 result 1 is more intuitively understood using fig 1 fig 1 shows the marginal benefit as a function of inflows in period 2 when i 2 i 2 the marginal benefit of the available water is above srmc w 2 and the efficient price is set equal to the marginal benefit at that inflow level however for i 2 i 2 marginal benefit of the available water is less than srmc and some available water is unused the precise statement of result 1 relies on the assumption that all water sources have the same srmc w 2 however as noted above it is straightforward to extend the analysis to incorporate cases in which the srmc of water sources differs to illustrate how this would be done suppose that in period 2 manufactured water had a higher srmc than environmentally sourced water in this case the water authority has an additional decision to make in each period namely which source to supply water from in period 2 specifically efficiency requires that the water authority utilise environmentally sourced water first and after that was exhausted turn to manufactured water rather than being the horizontal line in fig 1 the srmc curve would have a step at the level of environmental inflows the size of the step would equal the difference in srmc between environmental sources and manufactured water in this event the efficient price would occur where the marginal benefit curve b 2 s 1 i 2 m 2 cuts that new stepped srmc curve if given the realisation of inflows the efficient price is below that of the srmc of manufactured water then the authority would not utilise manufactured water otherwise the efficient price would equal the srmc of manufactured water and some manufactured water would be used further analysis and discussion of the case in which the srmc of water sources are different is provided in the appendix however it is apparent from the above discussion that allowing for this possibility does not affect the qualitative nature of results from the model but it does expand the analysis by including an additional decision to be made by the water authority namely which water source to use to keep the discussion as brief as possible it will be assumed below that there is a common srmc of all water sources the above approach can be readily adapted to extend the results presented below to incorporate differences in the srmc of water sources 3 2 efficient pricing in period 1 srmc pricing using result 1 in period 1 the expected price in period 2 e 1 p 2 is equal to the

r 0 allows the three period model to be interpreted in an analogous manner to an infinite time horizon analysis to see this analogy recall that urban water utilitys infrastructure is often lumpy in nature e g dams pipelines etc and thus textbook marginal analysis is not directly applicable turvey 1 4 suggests a reformulation of marginal cost for utilities that enables the use of marginal cost methodology when capital is lumpy turvey envisages utility s investment decisions as an ongoing process an incremental increase in the growth of demand can be accommodated by incrementally advancing the utility s efficient investment plans in turvey s framework a manufactured water capacity expansion can be interpreted as bring forward the capacity expansion program the assumption that there is an increasing marginal cost of capacity in period 2 of our model could be interpreted as the analogue of bringing capacity expansion forward in time in turvey s infinite time horizon setting water availability in period 1 satisfies 1 with t 1 the water utility is also constrained by available storage 4 0 s 1 k manufactured water capacity in period 2 is greater than period 1 if the capacity is expanded otherwise the capacities in both periods are equal that is 5 m 2 m 1 0 in period 1 the efficient policy requires the choice of s 1 m 2 and c 1 so as to maximise the surplus 3 subject to constraints 1 4 and 5 the water authority s efficient decisions depend on the observed inflows before identifying the efficient policy it is useful to define four critical inflow levels let i 1 be the inflow level where the water authority is indifferent between adding the first unit of water to the storage or not that is it is the inflow level in period 1 at which retaining the first unit of water in the storage or consuming it provides the same expected surplus this will be the inflow level where without storage the marginal surplus of water in period 1 is equal to the expected marginal surplus in period 2 if i 1 i 1 the marginal benefit of water available for consumption in period 1 is greater than the expected marginal benefit in period 2 in this event it is not efficient to store water however if i 1 i 1 then in the absence of storage the expected marginal benefit of water in period 2 would be greater than the marginal benefit in period 1 in this event it would be efficient for the water authority to transfer water from period 1 to period 2 via storage note also that i 1 could be zero that is the existing stock of stored water and manufactured water is sufficient to ensure that some water is stored irrespective of the inflow level the mathematical derivation of the inflow i 1 and also the mathematical derivation of the other three critical inflows defined below are given in the appendix water stored in period 1 can be used to supply water in period 2 and thus can be used to replace some expansion of manufactured water capacity in particular the higher the inflow level in period 1 the more water is available to be stored for use in period 2 reducing the need for capacity expansion let i 1 c be the level of inflow in period 1 which is sufficient to create enough storage for use in period 2 that the water authority is indifferent between incrementally increasing the existing period 1 capacity of manufactured water or not for i 1 i 1 c the authority will expand manufactured water capacity while for i 1 i 1 c the authority efficiently uses stored water as a substitute for capacity expansion the storage capacity places a limit on how much current water can be transferred to substituted for the future consumption let i 1 n be the minimum inflow for which the water authority is willing to completely fill the storage thus for i 1 i 1 n the storage is not filled while the storage is filled to capacity for i 1 i 1 n finally let i 1 be the inflow that yields the marginal benefit of consumption equal to srmc inflow i 1 is the minimum inflow for which water scarcity is not an issue thus for i 1 i 1 all available water is either consumed or stored in period 1 the price in period 1 p 1 is set greater than w 1 the srmc in period 1 for i 1 i 1 not all available water is consumed or stored and price in period 1 is set equal to srmc in period 1 in this case the excess volume of water i 1 i 1 passes through the surface water network before discussing the relative magnitude of these critical inflows consider the efficient allocation of water across periods if water is stored it is efficient to equate the expected marginal surplus from water consumption across the two periods 6 b 1 c 1 w 1 ϖ 1 i e 1 b 2 c 2 w 2 observe the surplus from future water consumption is discounted in the usual way and also discounted for evaporation water will not be stored in period 1 if the marginal surplus in period 1 is greater than the discounted marginal surplus in period 2 this will occur when water is relatively scarce in period 1 similarly if the storage is full the marginal surplus in period 1 is less than the discounted marginal surplus in period 2 now return to the relative magnitude of the critical inflows discussed above by assumption i 1 0 it is necessary that i 1 i 1 c when water is not stored future water demand can be only satisfied by infrastructure expansion in this case capital expansion would be that same as that which would occur in the absence of storage so could be zero adding saved water to the second period would lower the marginal benefit of water in the second period and thus marginal benefit would be lower than the marginal cost of infrastructure i e the last increment of infrastructure at the boundary the authority is indifferent between storing a unit of water or building the last unit of infrastructure consequently i 1 i 1 c as water inflows in period 1 increase the marginal benefit of water in both periods 1 and 2 decreases with the efficient balance of consumption across periods given by 6 because of falling marginal benefit in period 2 due to increased flows in period 1 the efficient level of capacity expansion declines it reduces to zero at inflow level i 1 c observe also that it is possible that the inflow where it is efficient to just fill the storage i 1 n is either greater or less than i 1 c this case in which i 1 n i 1 c corresponds with a relatively large storage specifically the inflow level i 1 c occurs at an inflow level where it is efficient to not fill the storage on the other hand if i 1 n i 1 c the storage will be filled at an inflow level for which it is still efficient to expand manufactured water capacity i e the storage is relatively small 12 12 note i 1 c i 1 0 corresponds with zero storage capacity it is assumed that marginal benefit is greater than srmc in period 1 at sufficiently low levels of consumption that is it is efficient to produce at least some water further the expected efficient price in period 2 is greater than srmc in period 1 as must for example be the case if w 1 w 2 in this case i 1 i 1 c i 1 the efficient pricing and capacity expansion policy will depend on the relative size of the thresholds defined above for the discussion assume that i 1 i 1 c i 1 n i 1 such an assumption corresponds with a relatively large storage 13 13 other relationships between the thresholds are also possible for example it is possible that the water storage is relatively small i e i 1 i 1 n i 1 c i 1 alternatively it is possible that the storage is larger than the volume which could be efficiently used i 1 i 1 c i 1 i 1 n such alternative relationships between the thresholds can be analysed in a similar way to result 2 in the appendix a modified statement of result 2 and fig 2 are provided for the case of small storage then result 2 assume that i 1 i 1 c i 1 n i 1 the efficient policy in period 1 requires 1 if i 1 i 1 s 1 0 c 1 s 0 i 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 p 1 b 1 c 1 2 if i 1 i 1 i 1 c 0 s 1 s 0 i 1 m 1 c 1 s k m 1 m 2 m 2

1 where 7 r m 2 m 1 0 i 2 b 2 m 2 g 2 ξ d ξ g 2 i 2 w 2 and 8 p 1 s w 1 ϖ 1 i e 1 p 2 w 2 the intuition behind result 2 is best summarised using fig 2 the curve b 1 i 1 in fig 2 shows the marginal benefit of water given the efficient policy is followed the efficient price is equated to marginal benefit in fig 2 inflows in period 1 determine the price and therefore the amount that is consumed and stored in that period first consider inflows less than i 1 at this low level of inflow water in period 1 is sufficiently scarce that it is not efficient to store water for period 2 this means that no stored water is available in period 2 and consumption in period 2 must be sourced from either environmental flows or manufactured water the efficient capacity of manufactured water in period 2 is m 2 which is given by 7 equation 7 states that the capacity in period 2 should be expanded to the point where the expected marginal benefit of increased capacity of manufactured water equals its marginal cost it is efficient to store water for environmental inflows greater than i 1 for inflows between i 1 and i 1 n the efficient price of water p 1 s is given by 8 the price p 1 s reflects the future opportunity cost of water 30 in particular the left hand side of 8 is the marginal surplus in period 1 and the right hand side is the discounted marginal surplus in period 2 thus pricing according to 8 ensures the efficient intertemporal allocation of water for inflows between i 1 and i 1 n for inflows i 1 i 1 c it is efficient to expand infrastructure more specifically for inflows in period 1 i 1 i 1 i 1 c the efficient value of capacity in period 2 m 2 equates the marginal benefit of capacity and its marginal cost that is 9 e 1 p 2 c w 0 i 2 b 2 s 1 m 2 g 2 ξ d ξ g 2 i 2 w 2 r m 2 m 1 from 8 price in period 1 satisfies 10 p 1 s w 1 ϖ 1 i r m 2 m 1 note that increased storage in period 1 reduces m 2 therefore inflows in period 1 determine how much manufactured water is produced in period 2 the more inflows the more storage the less manufactured water is required in particular the maximum capacity of manufactured water in period 2 will be installed when inflows are less than or equal to i 1 similarly no additional manufactured water capacity is installed when inflows are greater than or equal to i 1 c beyond this level of inflows increased inflows are shared between current and future consumption this continues until the storages are filled at inflow level i 1 n once flows have reached i 1 n the efficient amount of stored water has reached capacity and thus no additional water can be transferred to future use further inflows are consumed in the current period however once flows are greater than i 1 n it is not efficient to consume all available water as the marginal benefit of available water is less than srmc an increase in the quantity of water stored from the previous period will shift the curve b 1 i 1 in fig 2 to the left and thus will affect the efficient policy in this case it will be efficient to set a lower price in period 1 and thus lower expected price in period 2 increase the amount of stored water and reduce manufactured water capacity expenditure similarly having a higher level of manufactured water capacity in period 1 also shifts the curve b 1 i 1 to the left resulting in an analogous change to the efficient policy observe there are numerous possible special cases of result 2 for instance it is possible that i 1 i 1 c in this case it is not efficient to expand infrastructure irrespective of the inflow level in period 1 for example there may already be sufficient infrastructure in period 1 to satisfy the expected demand in period 2 alternatively relatively large inflows are predicted in period 2 and thus infrastructure expansion is not efficient in this special case water is only stored for all inflows above i 1 i 1 c another special case occurs when i 1 c i 1 n in this case for all inflows such that i 1 i 1 i 1 c i 1 n efficiency requires some water to be stored as well as some capacity expansion for all inflows greater than i 1 c i 1 n it is efficient to fill the dam but not to expand infrastructure 3 3 efficient pricing in period 0 long run marginal cost pricing in this section we consider the efficient level of infrastructure specifically manufactured water capacity in period 1 as the level of infrastructure available in period 1 is determined in period 0 we must analyse the decisions made in period 0 this analysis provides insight into the role of lrmc in the pricing and investment decision for simplicity assume that i 1 c i 1 n the period 1 price expected in period 0 e o p 1 is e o p 1 0 i 1 b 1 s 0 m 1 g 1 ξ d ξ i 1 i 1 n b 1 s 0 m 1 s 1 g 1 ξ d ξ i 1 n i 1 b 1 s 0

c 2 the following result identifies the efficient choice of infrastructure and the role of lrmc pricing result 3 when it is efficient for the water utility to expand manufactured water capacity in periods 1 and 2 e 0 p 1 w 1 r 1 r m 2 m 1 1 i and 11 e 0 p 1 w 1 r 1 r m 2 m 1 i e 0 p 2 w 2 1 i equation 11 is lrmc pricing in the two period context with storage it takes on the familiar form if it is assumed that r m 2 m 1 r 1 note that lrmc pricing holds in expectation in period 0 but once the state of the world is revealed in period 1 price is given by result 1 and will almost never equal the expected lrmc thus an approach of setting a price equal to lrmc irrespective of the level of environmental flows is unlikely to achieve efficiency 4 moral suasion the first of the three extensions to the fundamental model developed in the previous section is now presented in the above analysis it has been assumed as is the case in most markets that price in particular the volumetric rate is used to ration water one of the unusual features of the regulation of water utilities is that moral suasion is more commonly used during droughts to ration water than is price assume that moral suasion lowers the benefit of water consumption let z be the extent of moral suasion undertaken by the water authority in period 1 consumer benefit is given by b 1 c 1 z b 1 u c 1 where b 1 u c 1 is the underlying consumer demand and z is the responsiveness of demand to moral suasion with μ z 0 we wish to compare two policies designed to deal with a realisation of low inflows a moral suasion policy which keeps price fixed at some regulated level e g lrmc and a pricing policy where price and other decisions are as described in section 3 2 in practice there may be a cost associated with implementing the moral suasion policy for instance it may be necessary for the water authority to purchase advertising when implementing a moral suasion policy however it is worth noting that it is also not always costless for the water authority to change price though it is usual for economists to assume that this cost is negligible whittington and nauges 31 provide a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of using moral suasion versus pricing to ration water for simplicity this paper s analysis abstracts from both costs though allowance for either type of cost could be readily included for the discussion in this section assume again for simplicity that in period 1 it will always either be i efficient to expand manufactured water capacity to some extent i e i 1 i 1 i 1 c i 1 n or ii that it is never optimal to expand that capacity i e i 1 i 1 c i 1 i 1 n we will also assume moral suasion is only used in period 1 and not in period 2 result 4 suppose it is optimal to undertake storage in period 1 under efficient pricing as described in result 2 then 1 the moral suasion policy results in lower consumption and higher storage in period 1 than the efficient pricing policy 2 if it is efficient to construct infrastructure under the efficient pricing policy there will be less constructed under a moral suasion policy 3 price will be lower in period 2 under a moral suasion policy than under the efficient pricing policy assuming r 0 result 4 can be understood using fig 3 assume i 1 i 1 i 1 c i 1 n consider a realisation of inflows i 1 d that results in the efficient price with no moral suasion p 1 d to be higher than p 1 r the regulated price at the regulated price water inflows would need to be i 1 r for the price p 1 r to yield the optimal allocation of water between periods consequently at price p 1 r with inflows at i 1 d consumption is above its optimal level in period 1 and thus storage below its optimal level moral suasion can be used to reduce consumers marginal benefit if consumers are sufficiently sensitive to moral suasion marginal benefit can be reduced so that price p 1 r is optimal given the inflows i 1 d the new marginal benefit curve is shown as the curve z b 1 c 1 in fig 3 result 2 can then be applied using the new marginal benefit curve equation 6 shows that an efficient allocation of water across periods 1 and 2 occurs when the marginal surplus across both periods is equated thus when moral suasion reduces the marginal benefit in period 1 efficiency requires a concomitant reduction in marginal benefit in period 2 thus relative to the efficient pricing policy there will be relatively more consumption under the moral suasion policy in period 2 additionally the lower marginal benefit in period 2 means a lower expected price in period 2 which by 9 means less expansion of manufactured water capacity both the increased consumption and lower capacity means there will need to be additional storage in period 1 thus there needs to be less consumption in period 1 under a moral suasion policy than would be the case under an efficient pricing policy as it is assumed in our model that moral suasion lowers the benefit in period 1 a moral suasion policy necessarily yields a lower surplus than an efficient pricing policy however notice that under a moral suasion policy there is i a lower volumetric rate ii less infrastructure expenditure and iii less water consumed it should be noted that the extent to which these conclusions are possible is dependent on the sensitivity of consumer demand to moral suasion if customers do not respond strongly or only temporarily to a particular implementation of moral suasion it may not be possible to maintain a constant volumetric rate during a drought without some other instrument such as restrictions being used furthermore the reduction in infrastructure spending due to moral suasion would be correspondingly small however as yet there is insufficient empirical analyses available to assess the magnitude or even the existence of these effects in practice this would clearly be an area of research which would benefit from further investigation result 4 implies that customers in aggregate face a lower total water bill under the moral suasion policy than under the pricing policy thus our analysis suggests a reason why water authorities and regulatory agencies usually prefer moral suasion over pricing specifically such agencies will be reluctant to undertake a pricing policy if high water bills create a political backlash however note that such concerns are about transfers between the water authority and its customers rather than efficiency in the analysis of this section we assumed that moral suasion is not used in period 2 it would be natural to ask whether it could be used to reduce demand in period 2 thereby reallocating some consumption toward period 1 such a strategy would have the advantage of reducing the level of storage required in period 1 and further reducing the expansion of infrastructure however the success of such a strategy will depend on the durability of the impact of moral suasion moral suasion s effectiveness may reduce if it is repeatedly used to manage demand in our analysis it has been assumed that the water authority uses either pricing or moral suasion and not some combination of both this approach was taken because water authorities usually do not use pricing yet it might seem that some combination of a pricing and moral suasion might be preferable to the use of moral suasion alone however it may be possible that the use of pricing crowds out the impact of moral suasion so it is not effective to use both in concert see gneezy et al 32 for a review of the academic literature in a review aimed at policy advice lacetera 33 argues most of the current evidence shows that economic incentives when properly designed can enhance several types of prosocial behaviour and intrinsically motivated activities outcomes also appear to be influenced by differences in institutional details such as the way rewards are presented there would thus appear to be potential for combining moral suasion and pricing in response to drought condition though utilising the correct framing of the pricing response in relation to the use of moral suasion would be important in obtaining the correct outcome particularly given the highly emotional and politicised atmosphere around water use in a drought while previous experimental work is useful in suggesting that pricing and moral suasion could be successfully used concurrently further research is required into explicitly how moral suasion and pricing interact in determining urban water demand 5 water security in this section we return to the fundamental pricing model presented in section 3 however it is now supposed that there is a minimum acceptable level of consumption per person in period 2 c 2 water security requires that even with zero environmental inflow consumption can be at least c 2 thus the utility must satisfy the water security constraint c 2 s 1 m 2 it may be the case that the above constraint is satisfied by the efficient storage and capacity levels m 2 and s 1 found above in this case water security is guaranteed by enacting the efficient storage and investment decisions however result 5 suppose that c 2 s 1 m 2 and in the absence of this constraint there is sufficient storage capacity available and it is efficient to expand manufactured water capacity when r 0 increasing marginal cost of infrastructure water security is efficiently achieved by both storing additional water and installing additional manufactured water capacity such that 8 holds further the price in period 1 satisfies 10 while ϖ 1 i e 1 p 2 w 2 p 1 s w 1 a n d i 1 i 1 when the water security constraint is binding more future water is required than would be efficient in the absence of the constraint at the margin the value of water today is equal to the discounted marginal cost of manufactured water as given by 10 to expand future availability requires providing additional capacity which has a higher marginal cost than the unconstrained period 1 price thus it is efficient to increase the quantity of water stored which in the unconstrained case has a price below the discounted marginal cost of capacity the cost minimising way to provide future water is to expand both manufactured water capacity and storage note that if marginal cost of manufactured water capacity in period 2 is constant the requirement that price is smoothed across periods means that it is efficient to expand capacity alone to satisfy the water security constraint by similar reasoning the minimum inflow level at which it is efficient to store water is lower when the water security constraint is binding note that we have not considered a minimum current level of water consumption violating such a constraint would be apparent to regulators and in this event it would not be possible to store water in this case increased future manufactured water capacity would be the only way to meet the water security constraint in period 2 a number of cases are not considered in result 5 however these cases are straightforward to analyse for instance if the marginal cost of manufactured water capacity is sufficiently large i e it is not efficient to expand that capacity then it is necessary to satisfy the water security constraint by increasing storage similarly if there is not sufficient storage capacity available it is necessary to satisfy the water security constraint through building additional manufactured water capacity 6 efficient pricing with a single lumpy addition to capacity in this section it is shown how the fundamental model presented in section 3 can be augmented when there is only one large expansion of the manufactured water capacity possible in period 1 specifically it is assumed that in period 1 manufactured water capacity can only be increased by the discrete amount δ m m 2 m 1 let m 2 m 1 0 m 1 i f δ m 0 m 1 i f δ m 0 capacity augmentation δ m is efficient when it increases the discounted expected surplus in period 1 specifically capacity augmentation is efficient inefficient in period 1 if b 1 c 1 b 1 c 1 0 w 1 c 1 c 1 0 e 1 b 2 c 2 b 2 c 2 0 1 i w 2 e 1 c 2 c 2 0 1 i r m 2 m 1 0 1 i the left hand side of the above equation is decreasing in inflows let the critical inflow i 1 occur when the above equation holds with equality the critical inflow price in period 1 occurs when inflows in period 1 and 2 prices are sufficiently low and storage sufficiently high that augmentation is not efficient result 6 capacity is increased when current inflows are less than i 1 this case is shown in fig 4 fig 4 is adapted from fig 2 if no augmentation is undertaken δ m 0 price can be shown on a modified version of fig 2 where i 1 i 1 c the marginal benefit curve with no capacity expansion is shown as b 1 0 i 1 if augmentation is undertaken m 2 m 1 an analogous diagram can be constructed from fig 2 when augmentation is undertaken by taking i 1 c i 1 n the marginal benefit curve in this case is shown b 1 i 1 these two schedules b 1 0 i 1 and b 1 i 1 are overlain in fig 4 to show the efficient price for each level of inflow when period 1 inflows are less than i 1 then the marginal benefit of additional water is sufficiently great that the benefit of investment is greater than the cost the additional future capacity allows the utility to store less thereby increasing current and future consumption and lowering current and future price when period 1 inflows are more than i 1 then the benefit of investment is less than the cost as period 1 inflows increase from just below i 1 to just above i 1 there is an increase in price in both periods this is because the investment is not undertaken for inflows over i 1 and this reduces the availability of water in both periods nonetheless for all inflows between i 1 and i 1 n the prices in periods 1 and 2 are related as follows to reflect the opportunity cost of water as given by 8 the pricing rule 8 does not hold for i 1 i 1 as no water is stored and also does not hold for i 1 i 1 n as the storages are at capacity 7 discussion in this paper a three period model of an urban water network is developed the model identifies how the pricing storage and capacity decisions for the network are all interrelated and provides a clear illustration of how this occurs it thus allows for a number of important policy decisions to be analysed in a coherent manner firstly the model clarifies the role of lrmc pricing in the presence of uncertainty this rule requires future capacity levels to be chosen so that expected future marginal benefit of consumption is equal to the lrmc that is the expected future price is equal to lrmc lrmc pricing is thus best understood as a rule for the determination of network capacity the price storage and capacity expansion decisions in a current period will depend on the realisation of the state of nature specifically the level of inflows current storage and current manufacturing capacity when current water availability is very low current use has a high marginal benefit in this case it is not efficient to store water but rather to focus on building future capacity to satisfy future demand the efficient price will be sufficiently high that there is no excess demand for the available water when water availability is very high it is efficient to store the maximum amount of water and consume all water for which marginal benefit is greater than srmc when some water is stored it is efficient to equate the current marginal benefit of current water consumption to the expected discounted marginal benefit of future consumption consequently both the current and expected future price are related to the current and expected future inflows the current dam level the current and future manufactured water capacity it is almost never efficient to set the current price of water equal to the lrmc the model is used to analyse the impact of moral suasion as a demand management tool for urban water it is shown that the optimal use of moral suasion would yield a different consumption and investment pattern than the efficient use of pricing in particular a moral suasion policy of demand management suppresses current consumption and expands future consumption relative to a pricing policy a moral suasion policy also suppresses future capacity expansion but not the volume of stored water the model can also be used to identify the efficient manner to ensure water security i e to guarantee that water availability never falls below some minimum level it was shown that when manufactured water capacity expansion is viable it is efficient to ensure future water security through increasing both storage and initiating capacity expansion in the current period the additional future supply thus created means that the expected future price is lower than it would otherwise be consequently this method of ensuring future water security means that the marginal benefit for current consumption will be higher than the expected discounted marginal benefit of future consumption a moral suasion policy is more compatible with achieving water security than a pricing policy as it increases the expected future water availability additionally a moral suasion policy generates lower total household water bills than a pricing policy because it suppresses capacity expansion these two impacts may make moral suasion an attractive policy to regulators however we note that a moral suasion policy is effective only because it lowers marginal benefit thereby destroying surplus furthermore a moral suasion policy may lose its effectiveness with time if households become impervious to its message with repeated use further research into this issue would be needed to draw definitive conclusions regarding the use of moral suasion in controlling urban water demand appendix a supplementary data the following is are the

insurance varies under monetary and non monetary insurance premiums i e labour working time and crop harvests the paper also assesses the reactions of farmers to insurance premiums under these three modes of paying insurance premiums the demand for weather insurance to reduce agricultural risk has generally been low in developing countries the coverage of agricultural risk is about 0 6 in asia 0 36 in latin america and 0 1 in africa 1 the consequences of the low coverage of agricultural risk for human welfare are high 2 underscore the relevance of insurance for the skewness of revenues that makes farmers less prone to downside risk in addition 2 present evidence to show that both crop diversification and financial insurance can be useful risk management tools the important insight is that both crop diversification and insurance reduce downside risk and constitute important climate adaptation strategies further evidence from randomized controlled trials on insurance designs indicate that innovative rainfall insurance induces farmers to shift production towards higher return cash crops in india 3 and higher agricultural investments in ghana 4 in a recent paper 5 review the costs of low coverage of agricultural risk and conclude that in the absence of effective risk transfer instruments smallholder farmers face poverty traps and subsistence consumption constraints this contributes to difficulties in savings mobilization to cope with adverse weather shocks also 6 list some of the consequences of lack of access to financial services e g insurance in developing countries to include risk avoidance risk diversification and adoption of informal risk sharing measures they find that all these measures offer inadequate risk protection and are also costly the expected increase in mean global temperature could expose farmers to further risks for which weather insurance is relevant for adaptation with the changing global climate farmers face new risks such as biophysical risks to production systems and higher uncertainties in farming production decisions the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change 65 underscores that climate induced hazards may exacerbate other stressors and that these are likely to have negative outcomes for livelihoods as a result disaster risk preparedness and response have remained an important part of national and international measures for climate change adaptation see e g ref 7 internationally the hyogo framework for action hfa stipulates five priority actions and outlines principles for achieving disaster resilience including disaster risk reduction in agriculture see ref 8 furthermore the hyogo framework for action identifies the development of financial risk transfer mechanisms for building resilience for post disaster recovery in 2012 the african union established african risk capacity to develop a pan african index based weather insurance and early warning systems the african risk capacity combines early warning with disaster risk management and risk finance several factors can cause the low demand for insurance 5 summarize the reasons for low purchase of insurance to include problems of moral hazard adverse selection and asymmetric information several innovations and designs have been developed to overcome the constraints on the purchase of insurance these include index based insurance schemes flexible and better targeting of insurance programmes and government subsidies under the index based insurance as compared to traditional indemnity insurance the payout is based on an objectively observable trigger this is expected to reduce the insurance premiums since the verification of occurrence of shock is cheaper 5 draw attention to the fact that most forms of moral hazard can be eliminated in index insurance this is because farmers are unable to take actions to significantly influence the trigger index in addition payments of damages are based on exogenously constructed index and this leads to more efficient and timely processing and payment of claims despite these 5 recommend further improvements innovations in product design and implementation of index insurance however in a recent review of index insurance 9 conclude that basis risk hampers the functioning of index based insurance products in several countries 9 define basis risk as a weak correlation between selected insurance index and individual loss outcomes an important conclusion from a review of the literature on the topic indicates that index insurance is a work in progress and it is possible that redesigning and repackaging of index insurance can increase demand for insurance 10 many studies have identified affordability of insurance services to be one of the main reasons for the low demand for insurance see e g refs 11 14 for which a number of innovations and designs have been developed see refs 15 16 affordability problems in the purchase of weather insurance can be addressed through subsidy programmes regarding the subsidy programmes for weather insurance a review of subsidized programmes in ethiopia ghana india and malawi have found that subsidies increase the demand for index insurance especially when the demand is elastic 17 however government subsidization of insurance against adverse climatic changes may lead to individual decisions that increase susceptibility of people property and economic activities to those risks 59 an example of redesign and innovative implementation of weather insurance which is showing a great promise is requiring the insurance premiums in both monetary and non monetary e g labour time and commodities payment modes 18 this measure has been implemented through the horn of africa risk transfer adaptation harita introduced in ethiopia through the collaboration among oxfam america swiss re international research institute for climate and society relief society of tigray and the rockefeller foundation 18 the harita is an integrated risk management framework which combines risk reduction risk transfer and micro credit an important innovation of the harita programme is the insurance for work model which allows farmers to exchange labour for insurance and the labour is geared towards activities that reduce risk such as irrigation and soil conservation management 18 5 argue that this approach relaxes income constraints by using seasonally abundant family labour resources to invest in risk transfer and contribute to increasing the insurance up take it has been found that 60 of households opted for this insurance for work programme see ref 5 the success of harita has led oxfam america to collaborate with other international programmes to expand harita to four countries 18 limited number of studies have evaluated the demand for insurance under monetary and non monetary insurance premiums see e g refs 14 19 21 for instance 20 combine monetary and labour time premiums in a choice experiment in ethiopia to estimate subsidies for insurance adoption specifically 20 find that whereas willingness to pay wtp is low relative to the yearly payout under monetary premium the same farmers are willing to participate in working for insurance schemes at rates that are lower than the prevailing wage rates the present study uses a split sample discrete choice experiment to estimate and compare the purchase of flood insurance and price elasticities of demand for flood insurance under three alternative payment modes for paying insurance premiums and wtp for flood risk reductions among mechanized smallholder farmers in ghana the split sample design is chosen to isolate the effects of the three modes of paying the insurance premium with the introduction of multiple prices in the preference elicitation there is a path dependency problem 22 23 this means that the order in which price changes are presented to the consumer will affect the preferences elicited although the present paper uses the same dataset as 21 the present paper differs in two important ways i whereas an integrated modelling framework is used in ref 21 in order to investigate relative choice uncertainties in monetary and non monetary payment modes the present paper presents separate model estimations for monetary labour and harvest payment modes and ii these results were further used to investigate the differences in elasticities of demand for flood insurance among these payment modes in this sense the present paper is an applied paper therefore the focus and estimation procedures of the present study are different from ref 21 the main findings are that the mode of paying insurance premiums appears to affect the demand for flood risk insurance in unexpected ways specifically although the three different payment modes are comparable in terms of insurance premiums when converted into the same payment modes farmers are more likely to purchase flood insurance under monetary and harvest insurance premiums than under labour payment mode this is contrary to common belief among insurance practitioners in developing countries we estimate the price elasticities of demand for flood insurance to be less than 0 1 under monetary labour and harvest payment modes this means that increases decreases in insurance premiums under these three payment modes lead to less than proportionate reduction increase in the demand for flood insurance furthermore we estimate that the marginal wtp for a one year reduction in frequency of flooding is 6 in labour hours 30 kg in rice and 144 ghs us 37 these high wtps indicate strong preferences for agro climatic risk reductions among smallholder farmers in this region the rest of the paper is structured as follows the theoretical and econometric framework for the estimation of welfare measures under different payment modes are discussed in the next section the third section describes the study area and the design of the discrete choice experiment ce the results of the study are presented in section four and the conclusions of the paper in the last section 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical and econometric framework the resource endowments of households differ and these differences could be one of the avenues through which the numeraire could have implications for private and public good provision see e g refs 24 25 the design of insurance schemes that seek to require insurance premiums in non monetary and monetary payment modes seek to utilize these differences in household endowments to increase the demand for weather index insurance the use of insurance scheme designs to increase demand for insurance can work through two mechanisms first designing insurance schemes can make it more flexible for households to purchase insurance secondly charging insurance premiums in both monetary and non monetary payment modes can increase the purchase of insurance through the differences in household resource valuations which result from the differences in household resource endowments in stated preferences the adoption of different numeraires can be a source of differences in economic decisions one possible explanation for this is that differences in resource endowments imply constraint heterogeneity constraint heterogeneity refers to the non trivial effects through which the choices of respondents depend on constraints e g the use of different numeraires for economic and environmental decisions 26 27 provide evidence that using monetary payment modes in stated preferences elicitation to estimate wtp values disproportionately excludes some community members 28 show that respondents with zero monetary bids can be reversed to become positive non monetary bids furthermore 29 provide evidence to show that respondents prefer non monetary payments in exchange for environmental services 30 argues further that the respondents with lexicographic preferences may find non monetary exchanges such as time for environmental goods and services to be more acceptable relative to the exchange of environmental goods and services for money a few stated preference studies investigate mechanisms that may explain the different effects of numeraires examples of these stated preference studies are 20 31 32 using choice experiments 31 attempt to disentangle the impact of the payment vehicle per se from the price effects in choice experiment while 32 assess the consistency and fungibility i e interchangeability of monetary valuations furthermore 20 examines the benefits of combining cash and labour as rainfall insurance payment modes in order to assess the extent to which subsidies may be required under both payment modes 21 compare the uncertainties induced in choices under monetary and non monetary payment modes in a choice experiment 33 investigate the processing of money and time in economic transactions according to ref 33 as money is the most common instrument of exchange the use of money in transactions requires value considerations and invokes greater analytical thinking whereas time considerations in transactions are experienced or affective in nature and this is argued to affect consistency of human preferences choices are constrained by multiple resources and this makes it possible to elicit human preferences in multiple resources 34 35 this implies that the preferences for flood risk insurance can be elicited in any economic resource provided the resource constrains the purchase of flood risk insurance 35 using money as numeraire the preferences for flood risk insurance can be derived as 1 v m y w t p m p m q 1 z v m y p m q 0 z where v m is the indirect utility function y is the income q 0 is the status quo of no flood risk insurance q 1 is the improved state of flood risk insurance w t p m is the willingness to pay for the flood risk insurance which is elicited in monetary units p m is the vector of prices and z denotes socioeconomic variables following 35 37 the wtp for flood risk insurance in labour units is derived as 2 v l l w t p l p l q 1 z v l l p l q 0 z where v l is the indirect utility function w t p l is the willingness to pay for the flood risk insurance which in this instance is elicited in labor units l is the full budget stated in labour units p l is the vector of full prices in labour units and other notations as stated earlier furthermore we can infer from refs 28 38 that wtp for flood risk insurance elicited in rice is given as 3 v r r w t p r p r q 1 z v r r p r q 0 z where v r is the indirect utility function w t p r is the willingness to pay for the flood risk insurance which is elicited in rice yield r is the full budget stated in rice yield p r is the vector of full prices in rice yield and other notations as stated earlier to elicit preferences for attributes of flood risk reduction we used choice experiment ce which is one of the stated preference methods the ce is based on a new consumer theory 60 which postulates that utility is derived from attributes rather than goods themselves in ces respondents face a number of choice tasks the choice set consists of at least two alternatives which are defined by attributes and attribute levels the respondents then choose their preferred alternative in each choice task the choices in ce are hypothetical in nature however 39 show that economic incentives are preserved in these hypothetical choices following analyses of demand for flood risk insurance in vietnam in ref 14 we adopt random parameter error component specification of the utility function for flood risk insurance the random parameter error components model allows for inter alternative correlation between alternatives according to ref 40 the random parameter model can theoretically approximate any random utility model rum the random parameter specification of error components model allows the utility function to combine both the random parameter and error component and this resolves independence of irrelevant alternative iia and addresses unobserved heterogeneity 41 the purchase of insurance provides changes in the utility that could be different from the status of not buying the insurance we specify the utility structure for the random parameter error component model by 4 u n j t α n x n j t ε n u n j t where u n j t refers to utility a farmer n derives from alternative j on choice occasion t α refers to the parameters i e means and standard deviations corresponding to different insurance attributes x u are the unobserved utility components which are assumed to be independently and identically type i extreme value distributed gumbel the error component ε is distributed n 0 σ 2 further we define α n μ σ η n where η n is the random idiosyncratic shock and μ and σ are the population mean and standard deviation respectively specifying the error components for all alternatives in the choice set leads to over identification of the model therefore we normalize the variance component of the status quo alternative to zero 42 43 the idea is that respondents are familiar with the status quo alternative of no flood insurance and are therefore prone to less error with a panel of t discrete choices for each respondent n we can follow 21 43 to specify the joint probability of sequence of these choices y 1 y 2 y 3 y t by an individual as 5 p y 1 y 2 y t α ε t 1 t exp α x n j t ε j i 1 2 3 exp α x n i t ε i ϕ ε σ 2 f α θ d ε d α note that the integral from equation 5 does not have a closed form however it can be simulated by averaging over a number of draws from an assumed distribution 61 in our case we approximate the simulated log likelihood function by numerical simulation using 1000 halton draws for monetary and labour payment modes and modified latin hypercube sampling mlhs approach see ref 44 for the harvest payment mode we assume normal distributions for all random attributes these draws and distributions were retained because they were found to provide better model fits in the preliminary model estimations 2 2 study area and the design of choice experiments irrigation is usually seen as a strategy for reducing poverty and improving food security in the developing countries 16 45 46 only 4 of total land in sub saharan africa is irrigated 16 and the existing irrigation infrastructure is poorly maintained as a result prolonged rainfalls can easily cause a flood and damage crops and property the present study was conducted at wheta afife irrigation scheme wis located within the volta river basin in ghana together with dawhenya irrigation scheme and asutsuare irrigation scheme wis is one of the main rice growing schemes in ghana 47 the initial dam was constructed in the 1960s and the capacity was expanded by the construction of the second dam in the 1980s to irrigate rice fields it has potential for about 950 ha but 880 ha was developed and irrigated see refs 48 49 currently the ghana irrigation development authority manages all irrigation schemes including wis devolution is a common mandate for managing common pool resources under devolution resource users are required to make monetary and non monetary sacrifices to support participatory resource management devolution has remained an integral part of agricultural policy in ghana since the structural adjustment programme implemented since the early 1980s 63 currently farmers at wis adopt different measures to mobilize resources for maintaining irrigation infrastructure including mobilization of monetary and non monetary resources in addition the canals have not been properly maintained as many of the canals are silted floods destroy crops regularly see the next section labour is a costly factor of production 50 as it takes a significant component of cost of production as a result the farming system at wis is highly mechanized in that farmers adopt labour saving technologies such as tractors and harvesters to reduce the production cost data is not readily available for the estimation of demand for flood risk insurance see ref 51 we therefore elicited preferences for reductions in flood risk using hypothetical choices of farmers in a choice experiment on the purchase of flood insurance preliminary surveys for the choice experiment were conducted in july 2015 during which focus group discussions were held among farmers additional discussions were held with the management of the wis on agro climatic shocks to irrigation farming in the case study area during the focus group discussions farmers perceived flood risk to be a greater threat than drought risk as the construction of dam for irrigation reduced the impact of drought on rice production in the area the scenario was changed from drought to flood and the pilot study and the main data collection were conducted from november 2015 to february 2016 the survey was conducted in face to face interviews since other survey administration modes e g phone internet and mail etc were not possible see ref 52 the respondents were recruited randomly from communities surrounding wis and during field visits for each of the main communities surrounding wis we divided the community into four and sampled identified respondents from these parts for interview some of the main communities covered include avalavi klenormadi kpeyiborkope wheta dekpor and laveh during the field visits we also identified farmers from randomly selected blocks from each of the eleven sections at wis in all we interviewed 398 irrigation farmers 132 133 and 133 respondents were interviewed with the labour rice and monetary payment modes respectively each respondent made 12 hypothetical choices and the respondents were assigned to each of the three payment modes efficient designs with zero priors were used for the pilot survey parameter estimates using the results from the pilot survey were used as priors to generate an efficient design for the multinomial logit model mnl model in the main survey and this is deemed enough for the estimation of panel mixed logit model see ref 53 the design was created using ngene 54 the attributes and the attributes levels are presented in table 1 five attributes were used for each of the modes for the payment of the insurance premium the selection of attributes was based on focus group discussions among the farmers and from the existing literature particularly 14 the attributes are a flood occurrence this refers to the number of years it will take for a flood incidence to recur this attribute measures different degrees of flood frequency in the choice experiment the attribute levels for flood occurrence are 6 8 and 10 years the selection of attribute levels for flood occurrence was informed by observations of 28 that the flood return period is between five to ten years in flood prone areas in bangladesh the descriptive statistic presented in section 3 1 below shows that the farmers suffer a flood approximately every two years at wheta irrigation scheme this shows clearly that the actual flood occurrence is more severe than what was presented in the choice experiment it must be noted that some of the flooding episodes that farmers perceive may not be severe enough to warrant insurance payout nevertheless the disparity between this attribute and perceptions of farmers may lead to hypothetical bias with the extensive pilot testing we believe this effect may be minimal b insurance coverage this is the number of 50 kg bags of rice that the insurance company will pay in compensation if a flood occurs contrary to refs 14 19 20 we framed this attribute as non monetary compensation the choice of output compensation instead of monetary compensation is informed by evaluations of payment for ecosystem schemes that in kind transactions are more preferable to farmers see e g 66 the implications of this for preferences for flood risk reductions may be negative given the reduced fungibility of in kind compensation the average output among the farmers were assessed to be about 20 bags of rice and additional attribute levels were selected around the average output the insurance coverage has three levels of 12 bags 21 bags and 30 bags c probability of damage this refers to the probability that the farmer is affected by the flood and this is presented as an approximate number of farmers affected by a flood out of every 6 farmers the three levels identified are two 2 in about every 6 farmers three 3 in about every 6 farmers and four 4 in about every 6 farmers these levels were informed by discussions with extension officers that reveal that 5 out of the 11 sections are flood prone we constructed attribute levels based on this information we deliberately opt for an objective measure for this attribute as compared to subjective probability measures see e g ref 55 to ensure that farmers are responding to comparable levels for this attribute d insurance premium this refers to the cost of purchasing the flood risk insurance per ha as noted above the insurance premium was stated in money i e ghana cedis ghs rice i e number of 50 kg bags and in labour time i e working hours prior to the main survey we conducted a quick survey among farmers to determine the price of rice and wage compensations paid to hired labour the results from this survey were used to determine exchange rates among the three modes for paying insurance premium secondly we decided on an average premium rate of 20 and this is deliberately chosen to be higher than subsidized index premium rates in developing countries see ref 6 additional attribute levels were constructed around this average premium rate each of these modes of insurance premium has three identical levels of 150 ghs 1 1 the exchange rate was 1 ghs 0 26 us dollars at the time we collected the data the price level ratio of ppp conversion factor gdp to market exchange rate in 2015 was 0 33 world bank http data worldbank org indicator pa nus pppc rf end 2015 start 2014 this means that one requires 0 33 us dollars to buy one us dollar worth of goods in ghana 15 h 2 50 kg bags of rice 300 ghs 30 h 4 50 kg bags of rice and 450 ghs 45 h 6 50 kg bags of rice per ha the market exchange rates were used in the conversion and the exchanges rates were pretested in the pilot surveys as well farmers are likely to have different plot sizes and this may affect the purchase of insurance in the ce as such we introduce plot size as an additional attribute to fix the context for the purchase of flood insurance the plot size also has three levels of 1 2 and 3 ha the choice cards presented in figs 1 3 below show how the plot size attribute was used to hold the context of the choice experiment constant an increase in risk exposure i e a fall in flood occurrence and an increase in the probability of incurring damage is expected to lead to an increase in the demand for insurance furthermore it is expected that higher coverages will increase the purchase of insurance whilst premium in all its forms will have negative effect on the demand for insurance finally we expect that for farmers that are more likely to be risk averse the coefficient for plot size should be negative a sample of the choice cards shown in each of the modes for paying insurance premium are presented in figs 1 3 3 results we present the analyses of the results from the survey in this section we begin the analyses of the results by first discussing the descriptive statistics of the sample this is followed by the presentation and discussion of the estimated results and the willingness to pay and elasticity estimates under the three modes of insurance premium 3 1 descriptive statistics the descriptive statistics of the three sub samples are presented in table 2 in this table we use kruskal wallis test to perform statistical test on whether the descriptive statistics are significantly different among the three sub samples the socio economic characteristics of the sample indicate that about 34 of the respondents are female and this does not differ among the three sub samples the average age of the sample is about 48 years on average farmers have been farming for about 25 years the means of age and years of farming experience do not differ among the three sub samples in addition low proportions of farmers about 17 indicate secondary school education and above and this remains the same across the three sub samples in total each farmer has on average about 4 ha in rice farming and the means of plot size differ statistically among the three sub samples for the whole sample the average output is about 1 metric ton mt per ha the incidence of a flood is perceived to be high among farmers on a 1 to 6 scale with 1 indicating not important all and 6 indicating very important the average likert score is 5 37 the means of likert score on perceptions of flood incidence differ among the three sub samples flooding appears more destructive to the farmers relative to other natural disasters this is because the mean score of incidences of other natural disasters is lower than that of flooding it must also be noted that perceptions on the incidence of flooding and other natural disasters differ among the three sub samples however the perceptions on the incidence of a flood damage over the past ten years do not differ among the three sub samples although the perceptions on the incidence of a flood damage remain high it is lower than the overall perceptions on flood incidence in general furthermore perceptions on increasing flood trends and durations are high that is more than 70 of the total sample perceive both a flood trend and duration to be increasing and these perceptions do not differ among the three sub samples on average farmers experience floods every other year this is because more than 75 of the farmers interviewed experience flood damage within the previous two years of the survey and this remains the same among the three sub samples the majority of farmers experience their most recent flood in the year 2015 however the highest number of farmers recorded the severest flood in the year 2006 furthermore the farmers think that a flood is likely to recur within the next five years in addition the chances of a flood affecting the farmers within the next five years is high credit constraints seem severe as can be seen from the high score reported for lack of credit opportunities in table 2 similarly poor infrastructure is a common problem in the communities in which the farmers live the perceptions on the availability of credit and infrastructure do not differ among the three sub samples these may be indications of severe market imperfections among the communities surrounding the wis apart from output per ha and plot size farmers interviewed under the three insurance payment options are identical the chosen alternatives appear to be distributed quite equally among the three alternatives three alternatives were presented to the farmers in the choice experiment and these are one status quo sq alternative of no insurance and two alternatives that indicate the purchase of insurance statistically the proportions of respondents who chose the sq alternative differ among the three sub samples this proportion is 33 for labour payment mode but 31 and 29 for harvest and monetary payment modes respectively clearly this percentage is higher under labour payment mode than under the remaining two payment modes this means that the decisions not to purchase insurance are more likely under labour payment mode similarly the percentage of respondents who purchased flood insurance is lower under labour payment mode than monetary and harvest payment modes in most cv studies that compare monetary versus non monetary payments the probability of accepting the scenario is higher under the non monetary payments than under the monetary payments see e g ref 36 one plausible explanation could be the avoidance of yea saying problem in choice experiments see e g ref 56 we also checked and found that the respondents respond to high insurance premiums by reducing the purchase of insurance i e choose the status quo of not buying the flood insurance under the three payment modes when the cost of the insurance premiums are high this was the case in the fourth and eighth choice occasions as shown in fig 4 below specifically the purchase of insurance decreases during the fourth and eighth choice occasions and these occasions correspond to an increase in the proportions of respondents who chose the sq alternative 3 2 main estimation results we estimate the random parameter error components models for the three insurance payments first given the objective nature of the probability attribute we interact this attribute with various subjective measures and especially those regarding the occurrence of floods that are significantly different among the three sub samples all these interactions terms are not statistically significant and were not included in the final estimations however two interactions with the alternative specific constants ascs were retained in the estimations all models were estimated in preference space the models were estimated using r based on 64 the results from the maximum likelihood random parameter error components models are presented in table 3 the actual parameter estimates from the three models cannot be compared because the parameter estimates are confounded by scale parameters using the same dataset in an integrated estimation framework 21 find the relative scale parameters for non monetary payment modes to be lower than the relative scale parameter for monetary payment mode this underscores that the parameter estimates presented in table 3 cannot directly be compared it is important to point out that the signs of the coefficients associated with the standard deviations are irrelevant and are mostly interpreted as positive irrespective of the signs the first column of results presented in table 3 are the results for the subsample for which the insurance premium was in monetary payment mode these results indicate that the means for flood occurrence coverage insurance premium and plot size are statistically significant if the flood occurrence increases i e it takes longer for floods to recur the purchase of flood insurance falls the higher the coverage compensation the higher the purchase of flood insurance when the premium increases the purchase of flood insurance falls furthermore when the plot size increases the purchase of flood insurance falls the standard deviations for plot size probability and flood occurrence are also statistically significant this means that there is heterogeneity in preferences for these attributes the asc is not statistically significant both error components are statistically insignificant only one of the two interaction terms with asc is statistically significant and this result indicates that when risk perceptions among farmers are high they are less likely to choose the status quo of not purchasing flood insurance the second column of table 3 presents the results for the sub sample of respondents who were interviewed with the version of the survey in which the insurance premium was required in labour time the means of flood occurrence insurance premium and plot size are statistically significant this means that as the number of years it takes flood incidence to recur the purchase of flood insurance falls similarly as the insurance premium increases the purchase of flood risk insurance falls also if the plot size increases the purchase of flood insurance decreases this means that farmers with bigger plot sizes are less likely to purchase flood insurance in addition the standard deviations of flood occurrence and plot size are statistically significant indicating heterogeneous preferences for flood occurrence and plot size under the labour payment option the asc and the two error components are not statistically significant only one of the two interaction terms with asc are statistically significant and this means that farmers who think that they are more likely to be affected by flooding are less likely to choose the status quo alternative the last column of table 3 presents the results for the sub sample of respondents who answered the survey in which the insurance premium was required in rice harvest from the results of this model the means of flood occurrence and the insurance premium are statistically significant it means that if the number of years it takes for a flood to recur increases the purchase of flood risk insurance is likely to decrease similarly when the insurance premium increases the demand for flood insurance is likely to decrease in addition to the statistical significance of these means the standard deviations of plot size and probability are statistically significant this means that there is heterogeneity in preferences for plot size and probability under the rice insurance premium the asc and its two interaction terms together with the error components are not statistically significant all the ascs are not statistically significant this implies that the respondents are not reluctant to choose the sq of not purchasing the flood risk insurance the probability of farmer being affected is not statistically significant under all the three modes of paying insurance premiums this could be attributed to problems in processing the probability attribute among the sample especially given the low percentage of the respondents receive above primary education the statistical insignificance of the probability attribute may also be due to the high attribute levels for the probability attribute therefore better risk communication devices need to be considered in future choice experiments it should be recalled that the plot size attribute was introduced to define the context for the choices being made the three model specifications perform quite well as indicated by the model characteristics presented in table 3 for instance the adjusted rho squared are between 0 41 and 0 45 for the three models given that the parameter estimates reported in table 3 cannot be compared we use the results to predict the probabilities of purchasing flood insurance for each choice occasion for all the respondents unlike the parameter estimates these probabilities can be compared across the three payment modes we plot the actual and predicted probabilities for purchasing flood insurance for each of the 12 choice occasions in fig 4 one can see from fig 4 that both the actual and predicted probabilities are close together for all the 12 choice occasions 3 3 willingness to pay and elasticities of demand for flood insurance the results from table 3 were further used to estimate welfare estimates in the form of marginal wtps and elasticities of demand for flood insurance which are presented and discussed in this sub section it is important to note that marginal wtps and elasticities can be compared during the derivations of marginal wtps the scale parameters cancel out and for this reason the marginal wtps can be compared especially when they are converted into the same currency units similarly since elasticities of demand for flood insurance indicate percentage changes in insurance purchase as a result of 1 changes in premiums the elasticities of demand can also be compared since the purpose of introducing plot size among the list of attributes is to hold the context for the decisions in the choice experiments fixed we did not derive the marginal willingness to pay for the plot size the marginal wtps for flood occurrence are computed using the procedure of 57 the marginal wtps were simulated with 10 000 draws using the means and standard deviations these marginal wtps are statistically significant at the 1 level for the three payment modes under the labour payment mode the marginal wtp per farmer for flood occurrence is 5 74 h in labour time per annum this means that on average the farmers are willing to contribute about 5 74 h for a one year decrease in flooding frequency based on the exchange rate used in the choice exchange the marginal wtp of 5 74 h is equivalent to 57 40 ghana cedis and 38 27 kg of rice under the harvest payment mode the marginal wtp is 29 93 kg of rice per annum this means that on average the farmers are willing to contribute about 30 kg of rice yield for a one year decrease in flooding frequency using the pre determined exchange rate used in designing the choice experiments we compute that the marginal wtp of 29 93 kg of rice is equivalent to 44 90 ghana cedis and 4 50 h in labour time finally under the monetary payment mode the marginal wtp is 144 07 ghs us 37 46 per annum this means that farmers are willing to pay on average us 37 46 for a one year reduction in flooding frequency if one uses the exchange adopted in designing the choice experiment the marginal wtp of 144 07 ghs is equivalent to 14 41 h in labour time and 96 kg of rice although the insurance premiums under the three payment modes are comparable we can see that the values of marginal wtps differ depending on the payment modes used in the computation of the welfare measures these high wtp values underscore the relevance of environmental risks among the smallholder farmers in addition to marginal wtps we use the results to estimate the price elasticities of demand for flood insurance the estimated price elasticities of flood insurance are 0 061 0 062 and 0 062 for the monetary labour and harvest payment modes respectively these results indicate an inelastic demand for flood insurance under all three payment modes specifically when the insurance premiums increase by 1 the demand for flood insurance falls by less than 0 1 for all the three payment modes the magnitudes of these elasticity estimates appear to be lower than the elasticity figures reviewed in ref 10 which were found to be in the range of 0 44 and 0 88 for china and india nevertheless these figures from china and india also indicate an inelastic demand for weather insurance the evidence presented in this study also suggests that economic transactions especially pertaining to the decisions on the purchase of flood insurance under monetary as well as in kind payment modes are largely determined by the same considerations this is because the parameter estimates have the same signs and statistical significance under three modes of paying for flood insurance 4 conclusions with a view to increasing the up take of insurance for agro climatic risk transfer an increasing number of insurance practitioners seek to relax the affordability restrictions on the purchase of weather insurance by redesigning insurance schemes and innovative implementation of these schemes one of these designs that show great promise is requesting insurance premiums in non monetary payments such as labour time in order to increase the purchase of insurance for agro climatic risks and human health risks in this paper we use a split sample discrete choice experiment to estimate the preferences of farmers for flood risk reductions in labour time rice harvest and money insurance premiums contrary to widespread belief among practitioners farmers are more likely to purchase flood insurance under monetary and harvest payment modes than under labour payment mode therefore we do not find support for claims that requesting insurance premiums in labour will substantially increase the purchase of insurance we find that on average farmers are willing to contribute about 5 74 h in labour time payments about 30 kg in rice harvest payments and 144 ghs approx us 37 per annum for a one year decrease in flood frequency these wtp estimates largely reflect the relevance of flood risk reduction measures among small scale farmers therefore flood risk management measures are required in order to reduce the vulnerability of farmers we estimate price elasticities of demand for flood insurance to be price inelastic under the three payment modes for the payment of insurance premiums the policy implications of this finding are that not only is the degree of sensitivity of the purchase of weather insurance similar under the three payment modes but also subsidies are a costly way of increasing the purchase of insurance as the magnitudes of subsidy required will be prohibitively high we also found that welfare estimates vary across payment modes thus there is a need for future choice experiments to investigate reasons for these differences in welfare measures in addition future studies may want to quantify welfare implications of adopting monetary and in kind insurance premiums in empirical studies declarations of interest none appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

8697,we use a split sample choice experiment to investigate the effects of alternative payment modes on the purchase of flood insurance among smallholder irrigation farmers in ghana results show that insurance up take is lower for insurance premium payments required in labour than comparable premiums required in harvest and money the marginal willingness to pay for a one year reduction in flood frequency is about 6 h in labour time 30 kg in rice and 144 ghana cedis us 37 per annum the price elasticities of demand for flood insurance indicate an inelastic demand for insurance premiums under these three payment modes in addition to revealing strong preferences for flood risk reduction among farmers in this region these results imply that subsidy policies may be inadequate in increasing the purchase of weather insurance under these three payment modes keywords flood insurance payment mode choice experiment and random parameter error components jel classification c25 g22 o13 q51 q54 1 introduction the main purpose of the present study is to use a split sample choice experiment to estimate and compare demand for flood insurance sensitivities of demand for insurance to insurance premiums and willingness to pay wtp for flood risk reductions when the insurance premiums are required in three different payment modes specifically the paper examines how the demand for flood risk insurance varies under monetary and non monetary insurance premiums i e labour working time and crop harvests the paper also assesses the reactions of farmers to insurance premiums under these three modes of paying insurance premiums the demand for weather insurance to reduce agricultural risk has generally been low in developing countries the coverage of agricultural risk is about 0 6 in asia 0 36 in latin america and 0 1 in africa 1 the consequences of the low coverage of agricultural risk for human welfare are high 2 underscore the relevance of insurance for the skewness of revenues that makes farmers less prone to downside risk in addition 2 present evidence to show that both crop diversification and financial insurance can be useful risk management tools the important insight is that both crop diversification and insurance reduce downside risk and constitute important climate adaptation strategies further evidence from randomized controlled trials on insurance designs indicate that innovative rainfall insurance induces farmers to shift production towards higher return cash crops in india 3 and higher agricultural investments in ghana 4 in a recent paper 5 review the costs of low coverage of agricultural risk and conclude that in the absence of effective risk transfer instruments smallholder farmers face poverty traps and subsistence consumption constraints this contributes to difficulties in savings mobilization to cope with adverse weather shocks also 6 list some of the consequences of lack of access to financial services e g insurance in developing countries to include risk avoidance risk diversification and adoption of informal risk sharing measures they find that all these measures offer inadequate risk protection and are also costly the expected increase in mean global temperature could expose farmers to further risks for which weather insurance is relevant for adaptation with the changing global climate farmers face new risks such as biophysical risks to production systems and higher uncertainties in farming production decisions the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change 65 underscores that climate induced hazards may exacerbate other stressors and that these are likely to have negative outcomes for livelihoods as a result disaster risk preparedness and response have remained an important part of national and international measures for climate change adaptation see e g ref 7 internationally the hyogo framework for action hfa stipulates five priority actions and outlines principles for achieving disaster resilience including disaster risk reduction in agriculture see ref 8 furthermore the hyogo framework for action identifies the development of financial risk transfer mechanisms for building resilience for post disaster recovery in 2012 the african union established african risk capacity to develop a pan african index based weather insurance and early warning systems the african risk capacity combines early warning with disaster risk management and risk finance several factors can cause the low demand for insurance 5 summarize the reasons for low purchase of insurance to include problems of moral hazard adverse selection and asymmetric information several innovations and designs have been developed to overcome the constraints on the purchase of insurance these include index based insurance schemes flexible and better targeting of insurance programmes and government subsidies under the index based insurance as compared to traditional indemnity insurance the payout is based on an objectively observable trigger this is expected to reduce the insurance premiums since the verification of occurrence of shock is cheaper 5 draw attention to the fact that most forms of moral hazard can be eliminated in index insurance this is because farmers are unable to take actions to significantly influence the trigger index in addition payments of damages are based on exogenously constructed index and this leads to more efficient and timely processing and payment of claims despite these 5 recommend further improvements innovations in product design and implementation of index insurance however in a recent review of index insurance 9 conclude that basis risk hampers the functioning of index based insurance products in several countries 9 define basis risk as a weak correlation between selected insurance index and individual loss outcomes an important conclusion from a review of the literature on the topic indicates that index insurance is a work in progress and it is possible that redesigning and repackaging of index insurance can increase demand for insurance 10 many studies have identified affordability of insurance services to be one of the main reasons for the low demand for insurance see e g refs 11 14 for which a number of innovations and designs have been developed see refs 15 16 affordability problems in the purchase of weather insurance can be addressed through subsidy programmes regarding the subsidy programmes for weather insurance a review of subsidized programmes in ethiopia ghana india and malawi have found that subsidies increase the demand for index insurance especially when the demand is elastic 17 however government subsidization of insurance against adverse climatic changes may lead to individual decisions that increase susceptibility of people property and economic activities to those risks 59 an example of redesign and innovative implementation of weather insurance which is showing a great promise is requiring the insurance premiums in both monetary and non monetary e g labour time and commodities payment modes 18 this measure has been implemented through the horn of africa risk transfer adaptation harita introduced in ethiopia through the collaboration among oxfam america swiss re international research institute for climate and society relief society of tigray and the rockefeller foundation 18 the harita is an integrated risk management framework which combines risk reduction risk transfer and micro credit an important innovation of the harita programme is the insurance for work model which allows farmers to exchange labour for insurance and the labour is geared towards activities that reduce risk such as irrigation and soil conservation management 18 5 argue that this approach relaxes income constraints by using seasonally abundant family labour resources to invest in risk transfer and contribute to increasing the insurance up take it has been found that 60 of households opted for this insurance for work programme see ref 5 the success of harita has led oxfam america to collaborate with other international programmes to expand harita to four countries 18 limited number of studies have evaluated the demand for insurance under monetary and non monetary insurance premiums see e g refs 14 19 21 for instance 20 combine monetary and labour time premiums in a choice experiment in ethiopia to estimate subsidies for insurance adoption specifically 20 find that whereas willingness to pay wtp is low relative to the yearly payout under monetary premium the same farmers are willing to participate in working for insurance schemes at rates that are lower than the prevailing wage rates the present study uses a split sample discrete choice experiment to estimate and compare the purchase of flood insurance and price elasticities of demand for flood insurance under three alternative payment modes for paying insurance premiums and wtp for flood risk reductions among mechanized smallholder farmers in ghana the split sample design is chosen to isolate the effects of the three modes of paying the insurance premium with the introduction of multiple prices in the preference elicitation there is a path dependency problem 22 23 this means that the order in which price changes are presented to the consumer will affect the preferences elicited although the present paper uses the same dataset as 21 the present paper differs in two important ways i whereas an integrated modelling framework is used in ref 21 in order to investigate relative choice uncertainties in monetary and non monetary payment modes the present paper presents separate model estimations for monetary labour and harvest payment modes and ii these results were further used to investigate the differences in elasticities of demand for flood insurance among these payment modes in this sense the present paper is an applied paper therefore the focus and estimation procedures of the present study are different from ref 21 the main findings are that the mode of paying insurance premiums appears to affect the demand for flood risk insurance in unexpected ways specifically although the three different payment modes are comparable in terms of insurance premiums when converted into the same payment modes farmers are more likely to purchase flood insurance under monetary and harvest insurance premiums than under labour payment mode this is contrary to common belief among insurance practitioners in developing countries we estimate the price elasticities of demand for flood insurance to be less than 0 1 under monetary labour and harvest payment modes this means that increases decreases in insurance premiums under these three payment modes lead to less than proportionate reduction increase in the demand for flood insurance furthermore we estimate that the marginal wtp for a one year reduction in frequency of flooding is 6 in labour hours 30 kg in rice and 144 ghs us 37 these high wtps indicate strong preferences for agro climatic risk reductions among smallholder farmers in this region the rest of the paper is structured as follows the theoretical and econometric framework for the estimation of welfare measures under different payment modes are discussed in the next section the third section describes the study area and the design of the discrete choice experiment ce the results of the study are presented in section four and the conclusions of the paper in the last section 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical and econometric framework the resource endowments of households differ and these differences could be one of the avenues through which the numeraire could have implications for private and public good provision see e g refs 24 25 the design of insurance schemes that seek to require insurance premiums in non monetary and monetary payment modes seek to utilize these differences in household endowments to increase the demand for weather index insurance the use of insurance scheme designs to increase demand for insurance can work through two mechanisms first designing insurance schemes can make it more flexible for households to purchase insurance secondly charging insurance premiums in both monetary and non monetary payment modes can increase the purchase of insurance through the differences in household resource valuations which result from the differences in household resource endowments in stated preferences the adoption of different numeraires can be a source of differences in economic decisions one possible explanation for this is that differences in resource endowments imply constraint heterogeneity constraint heterogeneity refers to the non trivial effects through which the choices of respondents depend on constraints e g the use of different numeraires for economic and environmental decisions 26 27 provide evidence that using monetary payment modes in stated preferences elicitation to estimate wtp values disproportionately excludes some community members 28 show that respondents with zero monetary bids can be reversed to become positive non monetary bids furthermore 29 provide evidence to show that respondents prefer non monetary payments in exchange for environmental services 30 argues further that the respondents with lexicographic preferences may find non monetary exchanges such as time for environmental goods and services to be more acceptable relative to the exchange of environmental goods and services for money a few stated preference studies investigate mechanisms that may explain the different effects of numeraires examples of these stated preference studies are 20 31 32 using choice experiments 31 attempt to disentangle the impact of the payment vehicle per se from the price effects in choice experiment while 32 assess the consistency and fungibility i e interchangeability of monetary valuations furthermore 20 examines the benefits of combining cash and labour as rainfall insurance payment modes in order to assess the extent to which subsidies may be required under both payment modes 21 compare the uncertainties induced in choices under monetary and non monetary payment modes in a choice experiment 33 investigate the processing of money and time in economic transactions according to ref 33 as money is the most common instrument of exchange the use of money in transactions requires value considerations and invokes greater analytical thinking whereas time considerations in transactions are experienced or affective in nature and this is argued to affect consistency of human preferences choices are constrained by multiple resources and this makes it possible to elicit human preferences in multiple resources 34 35 this implies that the preferences for flood risk insurance can be elicited in any economic resource provided the resource constrains the purchase of flood risk insurance 35 using money as numeraire the preferences for flood risk insurance can be derived as 1 v m y w t p m p m q 1 z v m y p m q 0 z where v m is the indirect utility function y is the income q 0 is the status quo of no flood risk insurance q 1 is the improved state of flood risk insurance w t p m is the willingness to pay for the flood risk insurance which is elicited in monetary units p m is the vector of prices and z denotes socioeconomic variables following 35 37 the wtp for flood risk insurance in labour units is derived as 2 v l l w t p l p l q 1 z v l l p l q 0 z where v l is the indirect utility function w t p l is the willingness to pay for the flood risk insurance which in this instance is elicited in labor units l is the full budget stated in labour units p l is the vector of full prices in labour units and other notations as stated earlier furthermore we can infer from refs 28 38 that wtp for flood risk insurance elicited in rice is given as 3 v r r w t p r p r q 1 z v r r p r q 0 z where v r is the indirect utility function w t p r is the willingness to pay for the flood risk insurance which is elicited in rice yield r is the full budget stated in rice yield p r is the vector of full prices in rice yield and other notations as stated earlier to elicit preferences for attributes of flood risk reduction we used choice experiment ce which is one of the stated preference methods the ce is based on a new consumer theory 60 which postulates that utility is derived from attributes rather than goods themselves in ces respondents face a number of choice tasks the choice set consists of at least two alternatives which are defined by attributes and attribute levels the respondents then choose their preferred alternative in each choice task the choices in ce are hypothetical in nature however 39 show that economic incentives are preserved in these hypothetical choices following analyses of demand for flood risk insurance in vietnam in ref 14 we adopt random parameter error component specification of the utility function for flood risk insurance the random parameter error components model allows for inter alternative correlation between alternatives according to ref 40 the random parameter model can theoretically approximate any random utility model rum the random parameter specification of error components model allows the utility function to combine both the random parameter and error component and this resolves independence of irrelevant alternative iia and addresses unobserved heterogeneity 41 the purchase of insurance provides changes in the utility that could be different from the status of not buying the insurance we specify the utility structure for the random parameter error component model by 4 u n j t α n x n j t ε n u n j t where u n j t refers to utility a farmer n derives from alternative j on choice occasion t α refers to the parameters i e means and standard deviations corresponding to different insurance attributes x u are the unobserved utility components which are assumed to be independently and identically type i extreme value distributed gumbel the error component ε is distributed n 0 σ 2 further we define α n μ σ η n where η n is the random idiosyncratic shock and μ and σ are the population mean and standard deviation respectively specifying the error components for all alternatives in the choice set leads to over identification of the model therefore we normalize the variance component of the status quo alternative to zero 42 43 the idea is that respondents are familiar with the status quo alternative of no flood insurance and are therefore prone to less error with a panel of t discrete choices for each respondent n we can follow 21 43 to specify the joint probability of sequence of these choices y 1 y 2 y 3 y t by an individual as 5 p y 1 y 2 y t α ε t 1 t exp α x n j t ε j i 1 2 3 exp α x n i t ε i ϕ ε σ 2 f α θ d ε d α note that the integral from equation 5 does not have a closed form however it can be simulated by averaging over a number of draws from an assumed distribution 61 in our case we approximate the simulated log likelihood function by numerical simulation using 1000 halton draws for monetary and labour payment modes and modified latin hypercube sampling mlhs approach see ref 44 for the harvest payment mode we assume normal distributions for all random attributes these draws and distributions were retained because they were found to provide better model fits in the preliminary model estimations 2 2 study area and the design of choice experiments irrigation is usually seen as a strategy for reducing poverty and improving food security in the developing countries 16 45 46 only 4 of total land in sub saharan africa is irrigated 16 and the existing irrigation infrastructure is poorly maintained as a result prolonged rainfalls can easily cause a flood and damage crops and property the present study was conducted at wheta afife irrigation scheme wis located within the volta river basin in ghana together with dawhenya irrigation scheme and asutsuare irrigation scheme wis is one of the main rice growing schemes in ghana 47 the initial dam was constructed in the 1960s and the capacity was expanded by the construction of the second dam in the 1980s to irrigate rice fields it has potential for about 950 ha but 880 ha was developed and irrigated see refs 48 49 currently the ghana irrigation development authority manages all irrigation schemes including wis devolution is a common mandate for managing common pool resources under devolution resource users are required to make monetary and non monetary sacrifices to support participatory resource management devolution has remained an integral part of agricultural policy in ghana since the structural adjustment programme implemented since the early 1980s 63 currently farmers at wis adopt different measures to mobilize resources for maintaining irrigation infrastructure including mobilization of monetary and non monetary resources in addition the canals have not been properly maintained as many of the canals are silted floods destroy crops regularly see the next section labour is a costly factor of production 50 as it takes a significant component of cost of production as a result the farming system at wis is highly mechanized in that farmers adopt labour saving technologies such as tractors and harvesters to reduce the production cost data is not readily available for the estimation of demand for flood risk insurance see ref 51 we therefore elicited preferences for reductions in flood risk using hypothetical choices of farmers in a choice experiment on the purchase of flood insurance preliminary surveys for the choice experiment were conducted in july 2015 during which focus group discussions were held among farmers additional discussions were held with the management of the wis on agro climatic shocks to irrigation farming in the case study area during the focus group discussions farmers perceived flood risk to be a greater threat than drought risk as the construction of dam for irrigation reduced the impact of drought on rice production in the area the scenario was changed from drought to flood and the pilot study and the main data collection were conducted from november 2015 to february 2016 the survey was conducted in face to face interviews since other survey administration modes e g phone internet and mail etc were not possible see ref 52 the respondents were recruited randomly from communities surrounding wis and during field visits for each of the main communities surrounding wis we divided the community into four and sampled identified respondents from these parts for interview some of the main communities covered include avalavi klenormadi kpeyiborkope wheta dekpor and laveh during the field visits we also identified farmers from randomly selected blocks from each of the eleven sections at wis in all we interviewed 398 irrigation farmers 132 133 and 133 respondents were interviewed with the labour rice and monetary payment modes respectively each respondent made 12 hypothetical choices and the respondents were assigned to each of the three payment modes efficient designs with zero priors were used for the pilot survey parameter estimates using the results from the pilot survey were used as priors to generate an efficient design for the multinomial logit model mnl model in the main survey and this is deemed enough for the estimation of panel mixed logit model see ref 53 the design was created using ngene 54 the attributes and the attributes levels are presented in table 1 five attributes were used for each of the modes for the payment of the insurance premium the selection of attributes was based on focus group discussions among the farmers and from the existing literature particularly 14 the attributes are a flood occurrence this refers to the number of years it will take for a flood incidence to recur this attribute measures different degrees of flood frequency in the choice experiment the attribute levels for flood occurrence are 6 8 and 10 years the selection of attribute levels for flood occurrence was informed by observations of 28 that the flood return period is between five to ten years in flood prone areas in bangladesh the descriptive statistic presented in section 3 1 below shows that the farmers suffer a flood approximately every two years at wheta irrigation scheme this shows clearly that the actual flood occurrence is more severe than what was presented in the choice experiment it must be noted that some of the flooding episodes that farmers perceive may not be severe enough to warrant insurance payout nevertheless the disparity between this attribute and perceptions of farmers may lead to hypothetical bias with the extensive pilot testing we believe this effect may be minimal b insurance coverage this is the number of 50 kg bags of rice that the insurance company will pay in compensation if a flood occurs contrary to refs 14 19 20 we framed this attribute as non monetary compensation the choice of output compensation instead of monetary compensation is informed by evaluations of payment for ecosystem schemes that in kind transactions are more preferable to farmers see e g 66 the implications of this for preferences for flood risk reductions may be negative given the reduced fungibility of in kind compensation the average output among the farmers were assessed to be about 20 bags of rice and additional attribute levels were selected around the average output the insurance coverage has three levels of 12 bags 21 bags and 30 bags c probability of damage this refers to the probability that the farmer is affected by the flood and this is presented as an approximate number of farmers affected by a flood out of every 6 farmers the three levels identified are two 2 in about every 6 farmers three 3 in about every 6 farmers and four 4 in about every 6 farmers these levels were informed by discussions with extension officers that reveal that 5 out of the 11 sections are flood prone we constructed attribute levels based on this information we deliberately opt for an objective measure for this attribute as compared to subjective probability measures see e g ref 55 to ensure that farmers are responding to comparable levels for this attribute d insurance premium this refers to the cost of purchasing the flood risk insurance per ha as noted above the insurance premium was stated in money i e ghana cedis ghs rice i e number of 50 kg bags and in labour time i e working hours prior to the main survey we conducted a quick survey among farmers to determine the price of rice and wage compensations paid to hired labour the results from this survey were used to determine exchange rates among the three modes for paying insurance premium secondly we decided on an average premium rate of 20 and this is deliberately chosen to be higher than subsidized index premium rates in developing countries see ref 6 additional attribute levels were constructed around this average premium rate each of these modes of insurance premium has three identical levels of 150 ghs 1 1 the exchange rate was 1 ghs 0 26 us dollars at the time we collected the data the price level ratio of ppp conversion factor gdp to market exchange rate in 2015 was 0 33 world bank http data worldbank org indicator pa nus pppc rf end 2015 start 2014 this means that one requires 0 33 us dollars to buy one us dollar worth of goods in ghana 15 h 2 50 kg bags of rice 300 ghs 30 h 4 50 kg bags of rice and 450 ghs 45 h 6 50 kg bags of rice per ha the market exchange rates were used in the conversion and the exchanges rates were pretested in the pilot surveys as well farmers are likely to have different plot sizes and this may affect the purchase of insurance in the ce as such we introduce plot size as an additional attribute to fix the context for the purchase of flood insurance the plot size also has three levels of 1 2 and 3 ha the choice cards presented in figs 1 3 below show how the plot size attribute was used to hold the context of the choice experiment constant an increase in risk exposure i e a fall in flood occurrence and an increase in the probability of incurring damage is expected to lead to an increase in the demand for insurance furthermore it is expected that higher coverages will increase the purchase of insurance whilst premium in all its forms will have negative effect on the demand for insurance finally we expect that for farmers that are more likely to be risk averse the coefficient for plot size should be negative a sample of the choice cards shown in each of the modes for paying insurance premium are presented in figs 1 3 3 results we present the analyses of the results from the survey in this section we begin the analyses of the results by first discussing the descriptive statistics of the sample this is followed by the presentation and discussion of the estimated results and the willingness to pay and elasticity estimates under the three modes of insurance premium 3 1 descriptive statistics the descriptive statistics of the three sub samples are presented in table 2 in this table we use kruskal wallis test to perform statistical test on whether the descriptive statistics are significantly different among the three sub samples the socio economic characteristics of the sample indicate that about 34 of the respondents are female and this does not differ among the three sub samples the average age of the sample is about 48 years on average farmers have been farming for about 25 years the means of age and years of farming experience do not differ among the three sub samples in addition low proportions of farmers about 17 indicate secondary school education and above and this remains the same across the three sub samples in total each farmer has on average about 4 ha in rice farming and the means of plot size differ statistically among the three sub samples for the whole sample the average output is about 1 metric ton mt per ha the incidence of a flood is perceived to be high among farmers on a 1 to 6 scale with 1 indicating not important all and 6 indicating very important the average likert score is 5 37 the means of likert score on perceptions of flood incidence differ among the three sub samples flooding appears more destructive to the farmers relative to other natural disasters this is because the mean score of incidences of other natural disasters is lower than that of flooding it must also be noted that perceptions on the incidence of flooding and other natural disasters differ among the three sub samples however the perceptions on the incidence of a flood damage over the past ten years do not differ among the three sub samples although the perceptions on the incidence of a flood damage remain high it is lower than the overall perceptions on flood incidence in general furthermore perceptions on increasing flood trends and durations are high that is more than 70 of the total sample perceive both a flood trend and duration to be increasing and these perceptions do not differ among the three sub samples on average farmers experience floods every other year this is because more than 75 of the farmers interviewed experience flood damage within the previous two years of the survey and this remains the same among the three sub samples the majority of farmers experience their most recent flood in the year 2015 however the highest number of farmers recorded the severest flood in the year 2006 furthermore the farmers think that a flood is likely to recur within the next five years in addition the chances of a flood affecting the farmers within the next five years is high credit constraints seem severe as can be seen from the high score reported for lack of credit opportunities in table 2 similarly poor infrastructure is a common problem in the communities in which the farmers live the perceptions on the availability of credit and infrastructure do not differ among the three sub samples these may be indications of severe market imperfections among the communities surrounding the wis apart from output per ha and plot size farmers interviewed under the three insurance payment options are identical the chosen alternatives appear to be distributed quite equally among the three alternatives three alternatives were presented to the farmers in the choice experiment and these are one status quo sq alternative of no insurance and two alternatives that indicate the purchase of insurance statistically the proportions of respondents who chose the sq alternative differ among the three sub samples this proportion is 33 for labour payment mode but 31 and 29 for harvest and monetary payment modes respectively clearly this percentage is higher under labour payment mode than under the remaining two payment modes this means that the decisions not to purchase insurance are more likely under labour payment mode similarly the percentage of respondents who purchased flood insurance is lower under labour payment mode than monetary and harvest payment modes in most cv studies that compare monetary versus non monetary payments the probability of accepting the scenario is higher under the non monetary payments than under the monetary payments see e g ref 36 one plausible explanation could be the avoidance of yea saying problem in choice experiments see e g ref 56 we also checked and found that the respondents respond to high insurance premiums by reducing the purchase of insurance i e choose the status quo of not buying the flood insurance under the three payment modes when the cost of the insurance premiums are high this was the case in the fourth and eighth choice occasions as shown in fig 4 below specifically the purchase of insurance decreases during the fourth and eighth choice occasions and these occasions correspond to an increase in the proportions of respondents who chose the sq alternative 3 2 main estimation results we estimate the random parameter error components models for the three insurance payments first given the objective nature of the probability attribute we interact this attribute with various subjective measures and especially those regarding the occurrence of floods that are significantly different among the three sub samples all these interactions terms are not statistically significant and were not included in the final estimations however two interactions with the alternative specific constants ascs were retained in the estimations all models were estimated in preference space the models were estimated using r based on 64 the results from the maximum likelihood random parameter error components models are presented in table 3 the actual parameter estimates from the three models cannot be compared because the parameter estimates are confounded by scale parameters using the same dataset in an integrated estimation framework 21 find the relative scale parameters for non monetary payment modes to be lower than the relative scale parameter for monetary payment mode this underscores that the parameter estimates presented in table 3 cannot directly be compared it is important to point out that the signs of the coefficients associated with the standard deviations are irrelevant and are mostly interpreted as positive irrespective of the signs the first column of results presented in table 3 are the results for the subsample for which the insurance premium was in monetary payment mode these results indicate that the means for flood occurrence coverage insurance premium and plot size are statistically significant if the flood occurrence increases i e it takes longer for floods to recur the purchase of flood insurance falls the higher the coverage compensation the higher the purchase of flood insurance when the premium increases the purchase of flood insurance falls furthermore when the plot size increases the purchase of flood insurance falls the standard deviations for plot size probability and flood occurrence are also statistically significant this means that there is heterogeneity in preferences for these attributes the asc is not statistically significant both error components are statistically insignificant only one of the two interaction terms with asc is statistically significant and this result indicates that when risk perceptions among farmers are high they are less likely to choose the status quo of not purchasing flood insurance the second column of table 3 presents the results for the sub sample of respondents who were interviewed with the version of the survey in which the insurance premium was required in labour time the means of flood occurrence insurance premium and plot size are statistically significant this means that as the number of years it takes flood incidence to recur the purchase of flood insurance falls similarly as the insurance premium increases the purchase of flood risk insurance falls also if the plot size increases the purchase of flood insurance decreases this means that farmers with bigger plot sizes are less likely to purchase flood insurance in addition the standard deviations of flood occurrence and plot size are statistically significant indicating heterogeneous preferences for flood occurrence and plot size under the labour payment option the asc and the two error components are not statistically significant only one of the two interaction terms with asc are statistically significant and this means that farmers who think that they are more likely to be affected by flooding are less likely to choose the status quo alternative the last column of table 3 presents the results for the sub sample of respondents who answered the survey in which the insurance premium was required in rice harvest from the results of this model the means of flood occurrence and the insurance premium are statistically significant it means that if the number of years it takes for a flood to recur increases the purchase of flood risk insurance is likely to decrease similarly when the insurance premium increases the demand for flood insurance is likely to decrease in addition to the statistical significance of these means the standard deviations of plot size and probability are statistically significant this means that there is heterogeneity in preferences for plot size and probability under the rice insurance premium the asc and its two interaction terms together with the error components are not statistically significant all the ascs are not statistically significant this implies that the respondents are not reluctant to choose the sq of not purchasing the flood risk insurance the probability of farmer being affected is not statistically significant under all the three modes of paying insurance premiums this could be attributed to problems in processing the probability attribute among the sample especially given the low percentage of the respondents receive above primary education the statistical insignificance of the probability attribute may also be due to the high attribute levels for the probability attribute therefore better risk communication devices need to be considered in future choice experiments it should be recalled that the plot size attribute was introduced to define the context for the choices being made the three model specifications perform quite well as indicated by the model characteristics presented in table 3 for instance the adjusted rho squared are between 0 41 and 0 45 for the three models given that the parameter estimates reported in table 3 cannot be compared we use the results to predict the probabilities of purchasing flood insurance for each choice occasion for all the respondents unlike the parameter estimates these probabilities can be compared across the three payment modes we plot the actual and predicted probabilities for purchasing flood insurance for each of the 12 choice occasions in fig 4 one can see from fig 4 that both the actual and predicted probabilities are close together for all the 12 choice occasions 3 3 willingness to pay and elasticities of demand for flood insurance the results from table 3 were further used to estimate welfare estimates in the form of marginal wtps and elasticities of demand for flood insurance which are presented and discussed in this sub section it is important to note that marginal wtps and elasticities can be compared during the derivations of marginal wtps the scale parameters cancel out and for this reason the marginal wtps can be compared especially when they are converted into the same currency units similarly since elasticities of demand for flood insurance indicate percentage changes in insurance purchase as a result of 1 changes in premiums the elasticities of demand can also be compared since the purpose of introducing plot size among the list of attributes is to hold the context for the decisions in the choice experiments fixed we did not derive the marginal willingness to pay for the plot size the marginal wtps for flood occurrence are computed using the procedure of 57 the marginal wtps were simulated with 10 000 draws using the means and standard deviations these marginal wtps are statistically significant at the 1 level for the three payment modes under the labour payment mode the marginal wtp per farmer for flood occurrence is 5 74 h in labour time per annum this means that on average the farmers are willing to contribute about 5 74 h for a one year decrease in flooding frequency based on the exchange rate used in the choice exchange the marginal wtp of 5 74 h is equivalent to 57 40 ghana cedis and 38 27 kg of rice under the harvest payment mode the marginal wtp is 29 93 kg of rice per annum this means that on average the farmers are willing to contribute about 30 kg of rice yield for a one year decrease in flooding frequency using the pre determined exchange rate used in designing the choice experiments we compute that the marginal wtp of 29 93 kg of rice is equivalent to 44 90 ghana cedis and 4 50 h in labour time finally under the monetary payment mode the marginal wtp is 144 07 ghs us 37 46 per annum this means that farmers are willing to pay on average us 37 46 for a one year reduction in flooding frequency if one uses the exchange adopted in designing the choice experiment the marginal wtp of 144 07 ghs is equivalent to 14 41 h in labour time and 96 kg of rice although the insurance premiums under the three payment modes are comparable we can see that the values of marginal wtps differ depending on the payment modes used in the computation of the welfare measures these high wtp values underscore the relevance of environmental risks among the smallholder farmers in addition to marginal wtps we use the results to estimate the price elasticities of demand for flood insurance the estimated price elasticities of flood insurance are 0 061 0 062 and 0 062 for the monetary labour and harvest payment modes respectively these results indicate an inelastic demand for flood insurance under all three payment modes specifically when the insurance premiums increase by 1 the demand for flood insurance falls by less than 0 1 for all the three payment modes the magnitudes of these elasticity estimates appear to be lower than the elasticity figures reviewed in ref 10 which were found to be in the range of 0 44 and 0 88 for china and india nevertheless these figures from china and india also indicate an inelastic demand for weather insurance the evidence presented in this study also suggests that economic transactions especially pertaining to the decisions on the purchase of flood insurance under monetary as well as in kind payment modes are largely determined by the same considerations this is because the parameter estimates have the same signs and statistical significance under three modes of paying for flood insurance 4 conclusions with a view to increasing the up take of insurance for agro climatic risk transfer an increasing number of insurance practitioners seek to relax the affordability restrictions on the purchase of weather insurance by redesigning insurance schemes and innovative implementation of these schemes one of these designs that show great promise is requesting insurance premiums in non monetary payments such as labour time in order to increase the purchase of insurance for agro climatic risks and human health risks in this paper we use a split sample discrete choice experiment to estimate the preferences of farmers for flood risk reductions in labour time rice harvest and money insurance premiums contrary to widespread belief among practitioners farmers are more likely to purchase flood insurance under monetary and harvest payment modes than under labour payment mode therefore we do not find support for claims that requesting insurance premiums in labour will substantially increase the purchase of insurance we find that on average farmers are willing to contribute about 5 74 h in labour time payments about 30 kg in rice harvest payments and 144 ghs approx us 37 per annum for a one year decrease in flood frequency these wtp estimates largely reflect the relevance of flood risk reduction measures among small scale farmers therefore flood risk management measures are required in order to reduce the vulnerability of farmers we estimate price elasticities of demand for flood insurance to be price inelastic under the three payment modes for the payment of insurance premiums the policy implications of this finding are that not only is the degree of sensitivity of the purchase of weather insurance similar under the three payment modes but also subsidies are a costly way of increasing the purchase of insurance as the magnitudes of subsidy required will be prohibitively high we also found that welfare estimates vary across payment modes thus there is a need for future choice experiments to investigate reasons for these differences in welfare measures in addition future studies may want to quantify welfare implications of adopting monetary and in kind insurance premiums in empirical studies declarations of interest none appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

8698,reservoirs are increasingly deemed to be important given their potential control of water availability across seasons from wet to dry seasons especially given the concerns on the effect of climate change in this paper we assess the potential scope for policy intervention on the construction of irrigation reservoirs and its design focusing on the collective action aspect we formulate a theoretical model in which farmers pool resources to construct a collective reservoir we conceptualized the reservoir as a blue club that increases the potential water availability in dry season thus improving water safety for the whole society we determine the societal potential inefficiency in club size and the policy measures to correct it focusing on two different club access rules open vs closed membership results show that linear subsidy are ineffective in case of closed membership and minimum participation rules are required to increase the club size 1 introduction climate change environmental concerns and increasing water consumption from manufacturing and urban growth are expected to severely limit the future expansion of irrigation 1 thus potentially putting food security at risk to increase irrigation water sources reservoirs are gaining more and more attention reservoirs store water during wet seasons when there is no competition among water uses so that it is artificially available in the dry season when irrigation demand is high and natural supply is limited by smoothing the variability of rainfall and by increasing the availability of the resources in times of scarcity reservoirs address some of the key challenges of climate change 2 such as increasing temperature and rainfall variability 3 reservoirs can vary in scale ranging from regional 4 to individual farm 5 and in ownership private public or collectively owned 6 water storage is also addressed by specific measures in the framework of the eu common agricultural policy cap more specifically the 2007 2013 and 2014 2020 rural development plans rdp of several regions envision partial financial support co financing for the construction of reservoirs that are collectively managed by and provide water to a number of farmers the rationale for the rdp is the reduction of the pressure on groundwater resources during the irrigation season when water security is a major societal issue paradigmatic examples of this kind of measures are available in italy and france e g emilia romagna haute normandie and languedoc roussillon where rdp subsidizes the construction of small to medium sized reservoirs 250 k 500 k m3 these subsidies e g in the 2007 2013 rdp of emilia romagna are often linked to minimum participation rules mpr so that eligible projects must provide irrigation water for a minimum number of farmers in this prospect we interpret the rdp policy as a subsidy aimed at incentivizing the emergence of a blue club and the problem can be conceptualized within the framework of the green club analysed by van t veld and kotchen 7 a number of farms decide to coordinate themselves to build a club the reservoir that delivers positive externalities higher water security in times of scarcity to the whole society and policy mechanisms are put into place to reach the societal optimal size of the club two are the likely differences between blue and green clubs first blue clubs not only produce positive externalities water security but potentially even negative ones 8 9 and thus the two must be balanced second it is plausible that the emergence of the blue club results in positive spillovers even on non member farms if the alternative source is groundwater 1 1 for the sake of clarity in the exposition we use the term spillovers to indicate the reservoir externalities for the non member farms to distinguish them from the reservoir externalities for society as a whole indeed groundwater management is a common pool resource plagued by the problem of pumping cost externalities 10 which are in turn alleviated by a reduction in the number of its users however this perspective has not been addressed by the literature since their main objective is to smooth the variability of water supply many economic studies on reservoirs have focused on the effect of uncertainty on the investment decisions 4 and the relationship between water storage and the efficiency of irrigation technology 5 8 a number of papers focus on reservoir management explicitly addressing the presence of multiple users dudley 11 observes that the distinction between reservoir management and the irrigation managers leads to inefficient outcomes with respect to the water releases these inefficiencies can be potentially reduced when a system of property rights on the capacity share is developed 12 maas et al 13 focus on how the value of water storage infrastructure also depends on the institutions that allocate the resource across the users the economic literature on the topic has neglected the collective action aspect of the construction of the reservoir and the role of public policies even though these two dimensions seem to be relevant in real world policies at least in europe the objective of this paper is to assess the potential scope and the design of policy interventions for the construction of irrigation reservoirs focusing on the way policy interacts with collective actions we formulate a model in which farmers decide between using groundwater and pooling resources to construct a collective reservoir an external regulator conveying societal preferences on the availability of groundwater can subsidize its construction the analysis is inspired by rdp measures previously described which subsidize the construction of collective reservoirs we explicitly model the reservoir as a blue club that increases the potential water availability in the dry season thus improving water safety for society as a whole more specifically we theoretically analyse the incentives aimed at affecting the size of the reservoir when farmers have two different water sources groundwater and the reservoir and face coordination costs with respect to the equilibrium concept related to the size of the reservoir we focus on two different club membership rules open vs closed memberships to address different social environmental or policy arrangements while the notion of a closed membership implies the possibility that club members are able to internally define the club size an open membership can be interpreted as a sort of open list in which users can enrol as long as they find it profitable the main novelties of the paper are first that we modify the model described in ref 7 to include the positive spillovers on non members second we define a policy measure that under certain conditions can affect club size in the case of closed access the results of the theoretical analysis show that including a mpr associated with the subsidies could serve that purpose mprs have been investigated in the literature in the context of collective reservoirs focusing only on their distributional impact 14 the analysis is also based on the non cooperative coalition formation games that are often used to model international environmental agreements 15 16 using such a framework ansink and bouma 17 and zavalloni et al 18 analyse the effectiveness of subsidies aimed at increasing the size of a cooperating group however they do so in a public good context with no coordination costs or comparison between open and closed access moreover the collective dimension in the investment and maintenance of irrigation infrastructures has been extensively analysed by the socio ecological system literature e g ref 19 which however has seldom investigated the interaction with the policy environment 20 21 to focus on the collective action issue however we neglect the hydrological aspects of the functioning of the reservoir and the potential elements of risk and uncertainty this also applies to the modelling of groundwater extraction the sustainability of groundwater management is a complex issue 22 24 in the following analysis we disregard the time dimension and the dynamics in groundwater management this is a major simplification that purposefully provides tractable analytical solutions related to the collective aspect of the reservoir investment the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we theoretically analyse a basic model first we assess the natural size of the reservoir i e when there is no policy and in case of open and closed access second we determine the mechanisms that are required to reach an exogenously given level of groundwater availability when the regulator cannot dictate club size but must rather use subsidies the basic model relies on three main assumptions a an exogenously given desired level of the reservoir size b linear costs leading to a corner solution in which farmers either use the reservoir or groundwater and c the delivery of positive spillovers on non members to address the pumping cost externalities in groundwater management in section 3 we address the main limitations of the basic model by relaxing these three assumptions in section 3 1 we endogenize the optimal groundwater availability and thus the reservoir size in 3 2 we relax the exclusive nature of the source of water by introducing a non linear water cost function in section 3 3 we investigate how the management of groundwater taking into account its common pool characteristic affects the size of the reservoir section 4 discusses the results and provides conclusions and policy recommendations 2 basic model 2 1 setting imagine that there is a population of n homogenous farmers m 1 n a subset of the farmers forms a club i e they build and are connected to the reservoir denote by s the extensive margin of the club the n size hereinafter we use the subscripts s and f respectively to indicate whether a farm is part of the club or not the revenue of each farm is a function of water use π w where water can come from two sources groundwater g or a reservoir r w g r as a functional form we use the classic quadratic function with a and b being respectively the parameters of the linear and the negative quadratic term π w a w 1 2 b w 2 we assume that the costs related to water management are linear in the water use with k and c respectively being the cost parameters related to the reservoir and groundwater and with k c this assumption entails a corner solution where a club member will only use the reservoirs while this condition eases the interpretation of the results it is clearly a major simplification that does not cover the range of the potential existing circumstances we however relax this assumption in section 3 2 the available groundwater before the irrigation season is g assume that there is a societal minimum desired level of groundwater availability g d similar to a safety minimum standard in section 3 1 we endogenize g d taking into account both the positive and negative externalities that reservoirs deliver the management of the reservoir involves the costly coordination of the users we model this element by introducing a cost function dependent on s t s this cost is equally shared among club members so that a farmer connected to the reservoir faces t s t s s the average coordination cost following the usual specification in the literature 7 25 the cost function t s is increasing in the number of club members and the average cost function is u shaped in s i e it is characterised by a minimum the solution of t s 0 at s in other words as s increases there are first economies and then diseconomies of scale as a functional form we can assume that t s is a positive cubic function with t 0 0 and t 0 0 turning to non members it is often suggested that common pool characteristics often lead to pumping cost externalities and ultimately to inefficient outcomes the consumption of the resource by one user lowers the water table imposing in turn higher pumping costs on the other users 10 26 to address this notion while maintaining the focus on the emergence of the club we simply assume that the reservoir delivers positive spillovers on non members more specifically we assume that non members face a fixed cost for a given farm a that is proportionally reduced parameter α with the reduction in the number of non members i e a 1 α s n such a basic modelling strategy lacks the dynamic nature of groundwater management but still depicts the potential relationship between the use of the reservoir and the use of groundwater a decrease in the number of groundwater users increases the potential water availability and makes groundwater extraction easier and cheaper we explore these elements in greater detail in section 3 3 putting together these elements the utility of a single member of the club is described by 1 u s s r π r k r t s whereas for a non member it is given by 2 u f s g π g c g a 1 α s n 2 2 equilibria we introduce the model described by equations 1 and 2 into a two stage game that is solved by backward induction to find the subgame perfect nash equilibrium in terms of optimal water consumption and club n size in the second stage we determine the optimal water consumption for both club members and non members in the first stage we apply the two most widely used equilibrium concepts open and closed memberships to find the n size of the reservoir the amount of water that is consumed by each club member is the solution of the maximization of 1 with respect to r max r u s s r the foc u s s r r 0 yields the usual result that the optimal water extracted from the reservoir r is defined by the point where marginal revenues are equal to marginal costs π r k 0 similarly the solution of max g u s s g leads to the optimal water consumption of non members g defined by the foc π g c 0 in the second step we determine the n size of the reservoir by substituting r and g into respectively 1 and 2 we obtain the utility for both coalition members and non members as a function of the n size of the reservoir u s s r and u f s g depicted in fig 1 in our simple example the coordination costs fully determine the shape of the utility function for a club member as the number of users vary u f s g is a linear function of s with slope a α n so that at maximum there are two points of intersection between u s s r and u f s g points i and ii in fig 1 for a club to be formed first the utility for a club member must be greater than the utility from groundwater use at least within a certain n size range u s s r u f s g calling the maximum utility for a member u s s r given the presence of positive spillovers a necessary condition for a club to emerge is that u s s r u f 0 g there are two sufficient conditions the first is that when u s 0 r u f 0 g the rate of increase in the utility for a non member as s increases must be lower than the slope of the line with intercept u f 0 g and tangent to u s s r the second is that u s 0 r u f 0 g once having ascertained this condition the first point of intersection point i in fig 1 between u s s r and u f s g indicates the minimum club size s min below which no club is formed this is important in case the potential farmers interested in the reservoir construction are lower than s min points ii and iii represent the equilibrium club size in open and closed membership respectively intuitively the open membership case is characterised by the equalization of utility for members and non members whereas the closed membership maximizes utility for members only the feasibility of the closed membership n size imposes a further restriction on the size of the spillovers and on the rate of increase of the non member s utility spillovers must be such that α a s c n u s s c r u f 0 g the analysis of the two cases follows in the open membership case club members cannot exclude non members from being part of the cooperating group and non members will enter the club as long as the utility from using the reservoir are greater than using groundwater 17 in this case the equilibrium size s o the number of farmers that will pool resources to build the reservoir is thus the solution point ii in fig 1 to 3a u s s r u f s g substituting equations 1 and 2 into 3a we obtain 2 2 if we had heterogeneous players the equilibrium conditions defined by equation 3 would become a system of equations however it might be the case that numerous club compositions could emerge 3b π r k r t s π g c g a α a n s 0 the number of club members in open membership s o is the solution to 3b several hints can be obtained by analysing 3b implicitly deriving s o with respect to k yields s o k r t s o α a n note that r 0 and α a n 0 so s o k 0 if t s o 0 which is certain if s o i e in the range of s where the average cost function is characterised by diseconomies of scale this in turn implies that an increase in the utility for club members due for example to a lower k costs leads to an increase in the open membership equilibrium club size the solution to 3b that is lower than s defines the minimum size s min below which the club does not emerge this is the parameter area of economies of scale where t s 0 and hence given the previously declared assumptions an increase in the reservoir costs not surprisingly implies an increase in the minimum club size furthermore imagine that an impact of climate change is the increase in the marginal revenue function of water i e an increase in the linear term of π w such an impact would cause an increase in n size club equilibrium s o a r g t s o a α n since k c the numerator is positive closed membership implies that club members can effectively exclude non members from entering the club this equilibrium concept represents the within club point of view that was first conceptualized by buchanan 27 in this prospect the emerging club is the one that maximizes the average utility for club members if an additional club member was to decrease the utility of the club members he or she would not be accepted thus in closed access the n size of the club point iii in fig 1 is given by the solution to 4 max s u s s r the foc of 4 is u s s r s 0 that yields t s 0 the number of reservoir users n size is determined by the point that minimizes the average costs for club member s c s and the q size of the reservoir s c r the total size of the population of farmers n can constrain and affect both equilibria if the population of farmers is in the range of s min n s c all of the farmers would join the club irrespectively of the type of membership thus the simple permit for the construction of the reservoir would reduce the pressure on groundwater resources since the equilibrium size of the club is n if the population of farmers is in the range of s c n s o in the case of closed membership the equilibrium would still be s c while in the open membership case the equilibrium size is again n 2 3 subsidy design and efficacy recall from section 2 1 that we assume that there is a desired level of groundwater availability the available groundwater after irrigation use is given by 5 g a g n s g from 5 it is obvious that g d can either be reached by designing policies that affect g either by using taxes or a quotas on groundwater use g g or by subsidizing the club in this paper we focus on the latter option namely we design a subsidy for club members in its the simplest form in this latter option the desired level of groundwater is translated into the desired number of club members s d by subsidizing club members through a payment p equation 1 becomes 6 u s p s r π r k r t s p the payment does not affect the water consumed and thus the foc and the results are the same as the one described in section 2 2 however in the case of open membership given equation 6 the equilibrium condition defined by equation 3a becomes 7 π r k r t s p π g c g a α a n s 0 calling p o the payment level in the case of open membership we derive the subsidy required to reach a level s d by substituting s d into 7 and comparing it with equation 3b 8 p o t s d t s o s d s o a α n the payment needs to cover the higher transaction costs that are faced by club members when they move from the natural n size s o prior to the payment to the desired n size s d plus the additional opportunity costs that are due to the spillover effect note that the higher the spillovers of the club onto the non club members α the higher the payment level required to reach the desired club size the same result can be achieved by imposing a per capita tax τ e g the price of the concession to use groundwater the level of which is also set by equation 8 on the groundwater users thus the relative efficiency of the two instruments subsidy on the reservoir tax on groundwater use rights depends only on the relative size of the desired level of the n size of the club and the number of the groundwater users indeed the costs of the interventions are p o s d and τ n s d since p o τ the groundwater tax entails a lower social cost only when s d is greater than half of the farm population the logic of the subsidy intervention is depicted in fig 2 contrary to the open access case the simple payment does not affect the equilibrium size in a closed membership the foc u s p s r s 0 are unchanged by the introduction of the policy parameters consider instead a policy that subsidizes water consumption from a reservoir in that case the closed membership reservoir size is the solution to the maximization of 9 max u s p s r π r k r t s p c r setting the foc equal to zero u s p s r r 0 yields π r k p c 0 hence in this case the intensive margin of the reservoir increases however not even this type of policy scheme affects the n size of the club and hence it is ineffective in reaching the societal desired level of groundwater availability one possibility to affect the size of the emerging club in the case of closed membership is to formulate a policy scheme whereby the subsidy is attached to a minimum participation rule s mpr set at s d in other words given s d the subsidy level is set so that for a club member the utility at s c is equal to the utility at s d s mpr the payment is thus the solution to u s s c r u s p s d r which entails 10 p c t s d t s c the policy scheme needs to cover the higher costs that an increase in the club above the optimal one entails as depicted in fig 3 note that spillovers do not affect this payment level but do affect the applicability range of the scheme indeed 10 is valid only as long as u s s c r u f s d g comparing p c with p o shows that the relative level of the payment in the two club membership rules depends on the difference between the coordination costs of the two club size equilibria and on the spillovers p c p o t s o t s c s d s o a α n note that in case there are no spillovers α 0 p c is undoubtedly greater than p o since t s o t s c by definition moreover observe that the agricultural sector as a whole would be better off in the closed access case if considerations of welfare distribution are not involved indeed in the closed access case the payment ensures that a greater number of players enjoy the highest club payoffs so that the total welfare w is w c s d u s s c r n s d u f s d g in the open access case the entire farmer population welfare is w o n u f s d g being u s s c r u f s d g w c w o 3 extensions to the basic model 3 1 optimal reservoir size 3 1 1 societal point of view in the previous section we found the equilibrium taking for given the desired level of groundwater availability here we endogenize such a level imagining that the reservoir entails both positive the increase in the availability of irrigation water and negative changes in the landscape and in its hydrological characteristics externalities the utility for society generated by the reservoir in that case would be given by 11 u v g a e r s s u s s r n s u f s g where g a is defined by equation 5 v is the positive externality linked to the available groundwater e r s is the negative externality dependent on the size of the reservoir with e 0 and e 0 and the other two terms are the total welfare of club members and non members respectively assuming that only the number of club members can be chosen 3 3 in the case that both the intensive and extensive margins were or could be chosen the optimal reservoir size would be determined by a system of equations comprising equation 12 and if the negative externalities were linear in the total reservoir size e g e r s e then we would have u r e u s s r r entailing a tax or a quota on the intensive margin of the reservoir the tax or a quota could still possibly be coupled with a subsidy determined by equation 13 while this seems paradoxical the actual rdp 2007 2013 measure in emilia romagna did include such a constraint based on the existing irrigable area and on the maximum amount of water to be stored for a project to be eligible for financial support taking the first derivative of 11 with respect to s and set it to 0 leads to the optimal club n size s d 12 v g n s u f s g s u s s r s u s s r s r e r s u f s g equation 12 shows that the optimal reservoir size equalizes the sum of the positive externality and the positive spillovers on non members first and second term on lhs and the benefits associated with the club members with its marginal costs that are the negative externalities and the opportunity costs for a farmer to join the utility for non users comparing equation 12 with equation 7 leads to the payment that is necessary to reach the optimal reservoir size in the open membership case 13 p o v g n s d a α n s d t s d r e r s d note that p o can actually be negative and thus it can become a tax on the reservoir size when its negative effects overcome the positive side as we have seen in the previous section in the closed membership case a simple payment is not sufficient to increase the reservoir size and a two element mechanism needs to be implemented more specifically a mpr is set at the level found by solving equation 12 and a payment is set by equation 10 3 1 2 water utility company incentive scheme imagine now an external actor say a water utility company which is interested in the availability of groundwater and willing to provide a payment to farmers so that they reduce groundwater extraction assume that the utility of the company is described by 14 u v g a s p s in this case the transfer to the farmers becomes an element in the objective function and as a result the type of membership as well therefore the company maximizes 14 where the relationship between the payment and the club size is determined by equation 8 in the open membership case and equation 10 in the closed membership case the foc of the maximization problem u s 0 leads to 15 s p s s p s v g substituting the open membership payment found in equation 8 and 15 becomes after rearranging 16 s t s 2 a α n t s v g t s o s o a α n in the closed membership case equation 15 becomes 17 s t s t s v g t s c in the absence of spillovers the closed membership case undoubtedly leads to a lower coalition size since the right hand side is greater in the open membership case 3 2 joint use of groundwater and reservoir in the basic model described in section 2 the use of groundwater is an alternative to the use of the reservoir we now relax this assumption by changing the cost function from linear to quadratic and for simplicity we remove the spillover effects on the non members in this situation the utility for a club member is given by 18 u s s r g s π r g s 1 2 k r 2 1 2 c g s 2 t s and the utility for a non member is given by 19 u f s g f π g f 1 2 c g f 2 the water consumed by each club member is given by the usual focs respectively π r g s r k r and π r g s g s c g s with the quadratic revenue function previously defined the optimal water individually consumed from the reservoir and the use of groundwater are respectively r a c c b k c b and g s a k c b k c b note that the use of groundwater reservoir increases with the cost of the reservoir groundwater further it is worth noting that unless k 0 a club member will use both the reservoir and groundwater similarly the foc for non members leads to the optimal groundwater consumption for a non member g f a c b note that g f g s so that the emergence of the club would decrease the pressure on groundwater resources the open membership n size equilibrium is given similarly to 3 by 20 π r g s 1 2 k r 2 1 2 c g s 2 t s f g f 1 2 c g f 2 0 an increase in the cost of groundwater affects the utility of both members and non members but the impact on the equilibrium size is positive implicitly deriving 19 with respect to c yields s o c 1 2 g f 2 g s 2 t s o which is greater than 0 in case s o s the closed membership is not affected by the change in the utility function being still determined by the point that minimizes the average cost function we now focus on the role of policy but unlike in section 2 we investigate the impact of a subsidy that is linearly related to the water quantity consumed from the reservoir by introducing the payment equation 16 becomes 21 u s p s r g s p r π r g s 1 2 k r 2 1 2 c g s 2 t s the foc leads to g s p a k b p c b k b c and r p c b p a c c b k b c it is easy to see that the payment not surprisingly increases the intensive margin of the reservoir and decreases the use of groundwater in the open membership case the subsidy by positively affecting the utility for club members increases the n size equilibrium of the reservoir s o p r t s o still in the case s o s as in the previous section however the subsidy does not have any impact on the closed membership case note that the available groundwater after irrigation use is now given by g a g n s g f s g s the impact of a payment on the availability of groundwater is differentiated across the membership types in the case of open membership the derivative of g a is positive g a p s o p g f g s s o g s p the effect of the payment on the available groundwater is twofold it simultaneously increases the number of club members and their extraction of groundwater on the contrary in the closed membership case it is simply given by g a p s c g s p suggesting that from a policy point of view in this simple setup the open membership case seems to be the most effective 3 3 groundwater as a common pool resource and relation to the club formation now we further investigate the positive spillovers that the reservoir can deliver to non members in the basic model spillovers are given by a simple increase in the revenues for a non member we now investigate how spillovers can positively affect the groundwater users explicitly conceptualizing the use of groundwater as a common pool resource to do so we assume that the parameter c in equation 2 is instead a function of groundwater availability c c χ g a so that an increase in the available groundwater causes a decrease in the unitary costs as it is clear by substituting equation 5 and rearranging it the utility for non members depends on both the number of club members and on the total consumption of groundwater for simplicity we further assume that a club member will only use the reservoir utility for a non member is now given by 22 u f s g f π g f c χ g g f χ g f f g f if groundwater consumption is not coordinated each farmer will maximize her own utility taking for given the water consumption of the other non members 23 u f s g f π g f c χ g g f χ g f 2 χ g f f g f the foc u f s g f g f 0 reads 24 π g f c χ g 2 χ g f χ f g f 0 since in equilibrium all of the non members

reservoir size increases the utility both in the ne and in the cooperative equilibrium since it positively affects holding everything else equal the availability of groundwater accordingly in this case the reservoir n size creates positive spillovers on the non members how does a per capita payment for reservoir users aimed at increasing the size of the reservoir affect the total available groundwater in this situation rewriting the available groundwater after irrigation use results in the following 28 g a g n g f s p s p g f s p where g is a function of the equilibrium size which in turn is a function of the payment deriving g a with respect to p yields 29 g a p s p p s p n g f s p s g s p which is positive in case g f s p n s p g f s p s u r 0 in this case a subsidy increases the availability of water only if its effects on the number of people that join the club are greater than the positive effect on the use of groundwater from those that continues to use it 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we theoretically analyse the role of policy in the emergence of collective irrigation reservoirs conceptualizing the reservoir construction as the contribution to a blue club we focus on the coordination among farmers in such an investment based on this framework we are able to show in which circumstances policy measures are necessary to reach the desired reservoir size so that the pressure on groundwater resource is reduced we also identify optimal policy parameters under different open vs closed membership types of the club the theoretical analysis shows that payment levels and design must be differentiated according to the type of membership in the club a simple linear subsidy is sufficient to affect the reservoir size in the case of an open membership even though the potential positive spillovers from the reservoir to the non user increase the payment level required however this type of payment is ineffective in the case of closed memberships in case of a closed membership minimum participation rules that explicitly link the subsidy to a desired n size of the club are required a real life example is provided by emilia romagna where there is a policy scheme that incentivizes the construction of collective reservoirs and that includes such a collective conditionality constraint the extensions to the basic model show the importance of a hydrological management policy that explicitly and not surprisingly takes into account jointly the reservoir and the alternative water sources while cooperative social planner management decreases the exploitation of groundwater it might also negatively impact the use of alternative water sources the net effect remains an empirical question the model and results can also be interpreted within a social ecological system framework the model shows that even admitting a partial cooperative behaviour large spillovers from the club can prevent the formation of the club to be formed or to limit its size however the model further hints at the potential role that policies can have in positively impacting the contribution to collective infrastructures that are usually considered key elements in socio ecological systems several limitations apply each actually hinting at potential topics for further research in this field a series of weaknesses are related to the conceptual side of the model first the separation between coordination costs and extraction costs simplifies the interpretation of the results but yields the result that individual water consumption does not depend on the n size of the reservoir the inclusion of a combined non linear cost function of the type t s r would solve this problem second the model does not address the problem of the heterogeneity of farmers while a detailed analysis is required for the open membership case the inclusion of heterogeneous players would not affect the equilibrium in the case of closed membership if the coordination costs only depend on the n size of the club however different club compositions could emerge similar reasoning could apply to the introduction of a spatially explicit analysis of farm distribution and its effect on the club s emergence finally here we assume that the membership type is exogenously given and the analysis suggests that if the access type were designable an open membership would be preferable to a closed one since the efficacy of the payment is greater in the former than in the latter such a conclusion should be further explored along several dimensions first distributional considerations between the agricultural sector and the rest of society would impact the choice and the evaluation of the scheme second in practice the choice between open and closed memberships might be negatively related to the spatial target of the policy schemes given the spatial dimension of the potential reservoir users an open list should most likely be restricted a priori to specific areas that segment potential users in turn resulting in very local specific policy scheme that would then possibly be affected by high administrative costs on the other hand a more general non spatially restricted policy scheme could result in lower administrative costs but ultimately a closed access membership type this further hints at the cautious evaluation of the theoretical analysis presented here altogether while the expectation that a collective approach will improve the ability to deal with water management issues is well justified this paper contributes to show that the complexity of the interplay between collective behaviour and policy requires a careful policy design to achieve such objectives in an effective and efficient manner funding this paper was supported by the horizon 2020

8698,reservoirs are increasingly deemed to be important given their potential control of water availability across seasons from wet to dry seasons especially given the concerns on the effect of climate change in this paper we assess the potential scope for policy intervention on the construction of irrigation reservoirs and its design focusing on the collective action aspect we formulate a theoretical model in which farmers pool resources to construct a collective reservoir we conceptualized the reservoir as a blue club that increases the potential water availability in dry season thus improving water safety for the whole society we determine the societal potential inefficiency in club size and the policy measures to correct it focusing on two different club access rules open vs closed membership results show that linear subsidy are ineffective in case of closed membership and minimum participation rules are required to increase the club size 1 introduction climate change environmental concerns and increasing water consumption from manufacturing and urban growth are expected to severely limit the future expansion of irrigation 1 thus potentially putting food security at risk to increase irrigation water sources reservoirs are gaining more and more attention reservoirs store water during wet seasons when there is no competition among water uses so that it is artificially available in the dry season when irrigation demand is high and natural supply is limited by smoothing the variability of rainfall and by increasing the availability of the resources in times of scarcity reservoirs address some of the key challenges of climate change 2 such as increasing temperature and rainfall variability 3 reservoirs can vary in scale ranging from regional 4 to individual farm 5 and in ownership private public or collectively owned 6 water storage is also addressed by specific measures in the framework of the eu common agricultural policy cap more specifically the 2007 2013 and 2014 2020 rural development plans rdp of several regions envision partial financial support co financing for the construction of reservoirs that are collectively managed by and provide water to a number of farmers the rationale for the rdp is the reduction of the pressure on groundwater resources during the irrigation season when water security is a major societal issue paradigmatic examples of this kind of measures are available in italy and france e g emilia romagna haute normandie and languedoc roussillon where rdp subsidizes the construction of small to medium sized reservoirs 250 k 500 k m3 these subsidies e g in the 2007 2013 rdp of emilia romagna are often linked to minimum participation rules mpr so that eligible projects must provide irrigation water for a minimum number of farmers in this prospect we interpret the rdp policy as a subsidy aimed at incentivizing the emergence of a blue club and the problem can be conceptualized within the framework of the green club analysed by van t veld and kotchen 7 a number of farms decide to coordinate themselves to build a club the reservoir that delivers positive externalities higher water security in times of scarcity to the whole society and policy mechanisms are put into place to reach the societal optimal size of the club two are the likely differences between blue and green clubs first blue clubs not only produce positive externalities water security but potentially even negative ones 8 9 and thus the two must be balanced second it is plausible that the emergence of the blue club results in positive spillovers even on non member farms if the alternative source is groundwater 1 1 for the sake of clarity in the exposition we use the term spillovers to indicate the reservoir externalities for the non member farms to distinguish them from the reservoir externalities for society as a whole indeed groundwater management is a common pool resource plagued by the problem of pumping cost externalities 10 which are in turn alleviated by a reduction in the number of its users however this perspective has not been addressed by the literature since their main objective is to smooth the variability of water supply many economic studies on reservoirs have focused on the effect of uncertainty on the investment decisions 4 and the relationship between water storage and the efficiency of irrigation technology 5 8 a number of papers focus on reservoir management explicitly addressing the presence of multiple users dudley 11 observes that the distinction between reservoir management and the irrigation managers leads to inefficient outcomes with respect to the water releases these inefficiencies can be potentially reduced when a system of property rights on the capacity share is developed 12 maas et al 13 focus on how the value of water storage infrastructure also depends on the institutions that allocate the resource across the users the economic literature on the topic has neglected the collective action aspect of the construction of the reservoir and the role of public policies even though these two dimensions seem to be relevant in real world policies at least in europe the objective of this paper is to assess the potential scope and the design of policy interventions for the construction of irrigation reservoirs focusing on the way policy interacts with collective actions we formulate a model in which farmers decide between using groundwater and pooling resources to construct a collective reservoir an external regulator conveying societal preferences on the availability of groundwater can subsidize its construction the analysis is inspired by rdp measures previously described which subsidize the construction of collective reservoirs we explicitly model the reservoir as a blue club that increases the potential water availability in the dry season thus improving water safety for society as a whole more specifically we theoretically analyse the incentives aimed at affecting the size of the reservoir when farmers have two different water sources groundwater and the reservoir and face coordination costs with respect to the equilibrium concept related to the size of the reservoir we focus on two different club membership rules open vs closed memberships to address different social environmental or policy arrangements while the notion of a closed membership implies the possibility that club members are able to internally define the club size an open membership can be interpreted as a sort of open list in which users can enrol as long as they find it profitable the main novelties of the paper are first that we modify the model described in ref 7 to include the positive spillovers on non members second we define a policy measure that under certain conditions can affect club size in the case of closed access the results of the theoretical analysis show that including a mpr associated with the subsidies could serve that purpose mprs have been investigated in the literature in the context of collective reservoirs focusing only on their distributional impact 14 the analysis is also based on the non cooperative coalition formation games that are often used to model international environmental agreements 15 16 using such a framework ansink and bouma 17 and zavalloni et al 18 analyse the effectiveness of subsidies aimed at increasing the size of a cooperating group however they do so in a public good context with no coordination costs or comparison between open and closed access moreover the collective dimension in the investment and maintenance of irrigation infrastructures has been extensively analysed by the socio ecological system literature e g ref 19 which however has seldom investigated the interaction with the policy environment 20 21 to focus on the collective action issue however we neglect the hydrological aspects of the functioning of the reservoir and the potential elements of risk and uncertainty this also applies to the modelling of groundwater extraction the sustainability of groundwater management is a complex issue 22 24 in the following analysis we disregard the time dimension and the dynamics in groundwater management this is a major simplification that purposefully provides tractable analytical solutions related to the collective aspect of the reservoir investment the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we theoretically analyse a basic model first we assess the natural size of the reservoir i e when there is no policy and in case of open and closed access second we determine the mechanisms that are required to reach an exogenously given level of groundwater availability when the regulator cannot dictate club size but must rather use subsidies the basic model relies on three main assumptions a an exogenously given desired level of the reservoir size b linear costs leading to a corner solution in which farmers either use the reservoir or groundwater and c the delivery of positive spillovers on non members to address the pumping cost externalities in groundwater management in section 3 we address the main limitations of the basic model by relaxing these three assumptions in section 3 1 we endogenize the optimal groundwater availability and thus the reservoir size in 3 2 we relax the exclusive nature of the source of water by introducing a non linear water cost function in section 3 3 we investigate how the management of groundwater taking into account its common pool characteristic affects the size of the reservoir section 4 discusses the results and provides conclusions and policy recommendations 2 basic model 2 1 setting imagine that there is a population of n homogenous farmers m 1 n a subset of the farmers forms a club i e they build and are connected to the reservoir denote by s the extensive margin of the club the n size hereinafter we use the subscripts s and f respectively to indicate whether a farm is part of the club or not the revenue of each farm is a function of water use π w where water can come from two sources groundwater g or a reservoir r w g r as a functional form we use the classic quadratic function with a and b being respectively the parameters of the linear and the negative quadratic term π w a w 1 2 b w 2 we assume that the costs related to water management are linear in the water use with k and c respectively being the cost parameters related to the reservoir and groundwater and with k c this assumption entails a corner solution where a club member will only use the reservoirs while this condition eases the interpretation of the results it is clearly a major simplification that does not cover the range of the potential existing circumstances we however relax this assumption in section 3 2 the available groundwater before the irrigation season is g assume that there is a societal minimum desired level of groundwater availability g d similar to a safety minimum standard in section 3 1 we endogenize g d taking into account both the positive and negative externalities that reservoirs deliver the management of the reservoir involves the costly coordination of the users we model this element by introducing a cost function dependent on s t s this cost is equally shared among club members so that a farmer connected to the reservoir faces t s t s s the average coordination cost following the usual specification in the literature 7 25 the cost function t s is increasing in the number of club members and the average cost function is u shaped in s i e it is characterised by a minimum the solution of t s 0 at s in other words as s increases there are first economies and then diseconomies of scale as a functional form we can assume that t s is a positive cubic function with t 0 0 and t 0 0 turning to non members it is often suggested that common pool characteristics often lead to pumping cost externalities and ultimately to inefficient outcomes the consumption of the resource by one user lowers the water table imposing in turn higher pumping costs on the other users 10 26 to address this notion while maintaining the focus on the emergence of the club we simply assume that the reservoir delivers positive spillovers on non members more specifically we assume that non members face a fixed cost for a given farm a that is proportionally reduced parameter α with the reduction in the number of non members i e a 1 α s n such a basic modelling strategy lacks the dynamic nature of groundwater management but still depicts the potential relationship between the use of the reservoir and the use of groundwater a decrease in the number of groundwater users increases the potential water availability and makes groundwater extraction easier and cheaper we explore these elements in greater detail in section 3 3 putting together these elements the utility of a single member of the club is described by 1 u s s r π r k r t s whereas for a non member it is given by 2 u f s g π g c g a 1 α s n 2 2 equilibria we introduce the model described by equations 1 and 2 into a two stage game that is solved by backward induction to find the subgame perfect nash equilibrium in terms of optimal water consumption and club n size in the second stage we determine the optimal water consumption for both club members and non members in the first stage we apply the two most widely used equilibrium concepts open and closed memberships to find the n size of the reservoir the amount of water that is consumed by each club member is the solution of the maximization of 1 with respect to r max r u s s r the foc u s s r r 0 yields the usual result that the optimal water extracted from the reservoir r is defined by the point where marginal revenues are equal to marginal costs π r k 0 similarly the solution of max g u s s g leads to the optimal water consumption of non members g defined by the foc π g c 0 in the second step we determine the n size of the reservoir by substituting r and g into respectively 1 and 2 we obtain the utility for both coalition members and non members as a function of the n size of the reservoir u s s r and u f s g depicted in fig 1 in our simple example the coordination costs fully determine the shape of the utility function for a club member as the number of users vary u f s g is a linear function of s with slope a α n so that at maximum there are two points of intersection between u s s r and u f s g points i and ii in fig 1 for a club to be formed first the utility for a club member must be greater than the utility from groundwater use at least within a certain n size range u s s r u f s g calling the maximum utility for a member u s s r given the presence of positive spillovers a necessary condition for a club to emerge is that u s s r u f 0 g there are two sufficient conditions the first is that when u s 0 r u f 0 g the rate of increase in the utility for a non member as s increases must be lower than the slope of the line with intercept u f 0 g and tangent to u s s r the second is that u s 0 r u f 0 g once having ascertained this condition the first point of intersection point i in fig 1 between u s s r and u f s g indicates the minimum club size s min below which no club is formed this is important in case the potential farmers interested in the reservoir construction are lower than s min points ii and iii represent the equilibrium club size in open and closed membership respectively intuitively the open membership case is characterised by the equalization of utility for members and non members whereas the closed membership maximizes utility for members only the feasibility of the closed membership n size imposes a further restriction on the size of the spillovers and on the rate of increase of the non member s utility spillovers must be such that α a s c n u s s c r u f 0 g the analysis of the two cases follows in the open membership case club members cannot exclude non members from being part of the cooperating group and non members will enter the club as long as the utility from using the reservoir are greater than using groundwater 17 in this case the equilibrium size s o the number of farmers that will pool resources to build the reservoir is thus the solution point ii in fig 1 to 3a u s s r u f s g substituting equations 1 and 2 into 3a we obtain 2 2 if we had heterogeneous players the equilibrium conditions defined by equation 3 would become a system of equations however it might be the case that numerous club compositions could emerge 3b π r k r t s π g c g a α a n s 0 the number of club members in open membership s o is the solution to 3b several hints can be obtained by analysing 3b implicitly deriving s o with respect to k yields s o k r t s o α a n note that r 0 and α a n 0 so s o k 0 if t s o 0 which is certain if s o i e in the range of s where the average cost function is characterised by diseconomies of scale this in turn implies that an increase in the utility for club members due for example to a lower k costs leads to an increase in the open membership equilibrium club size the solution to 3b that is lower than s defines the minimum size s min below which the club does not emerge this is the parameter area of economies of scale where t s 0 and hence given the previously declared assumptions an increase in the reservoir costs not surprisingly implies an increase in the minimum club size furthermore imagine that an impact of climate change is the increase in the marginal revenue function of water i e an increase in the linear term of π w such an impact would cause an increase in n size club equilibrium s o a r g t s o a α n since k c the numerator is positive closed membership implies that club members can effectively exclude non members from entering the club this equilibrium concept represents the within club point of view that was first conceptualized by buchanan 27 in this prospect the emerging club is the one that maximizes the average utility for club members if an additional club member was to decrease the utility of the club members he or she would not be accepted thus in closed access the n size of the club point iii in fig 1 is given by the solution to 4 max s u s s r the foc of 4 is u s s r s 0 that yields t s 0 the number of reservoir users n size is determined by the point that minimizes the average costs for club member s c s and the q size of the reservoir s c r the total size of the population of farmers n can constrain and affect both equilibria if the population of farmers is in the range of s min n s c all of the farmers would join the club irrespectively of the type of membership thus the simple permit for the construction of the reservoir would reduce the pressure on groundwater resources since the equilibrium size of the club is n if the population of farmers is in the range of s c n s o in the case of closed membership the equilibrium would still be s c while in the open membership case the equilibrium size is again n 2 3 subsidy design and efficacy recall from section 2 1 that we assume that there is a desired level of groundwater availability the available groundwater after irrigation use is given by 5 g a g n s g from 5 it is obvious that g d can either be reached by designing policies that affect g either by using taxes or a quotas on groundwater use g g or by subsidizing the club in this paper we focus on the latter option namely we design a subsidy for club members in its the simplest form in this latter option the desired level of groundwater is translated into the desired number of club members s d by subsidizing club members through a payment p equation 1 becomes 6 u s p s r π r k r t s p the payment does not affect the water consumed and thus the foc and the results are the same as the one described in section 2 2 however in the case of open membership given equation 6 the equilibrium condition defined by equation 3a becomes 7 π r k r t s p π g c g a α a n s 0 calling p o the payment level in the case of open membership we derive the subsidy required to reach a level s d by substituting s d into 7 and comparing it with equation 3b 8 p o t s d t s o s d s o a α n the payment needs to cover the higher transaction costs that are faced by club members when they move from the natural n size s o prior to the payment to the desired n size s d plus the additional opportunity costs that are due to the spillover effect note that the higher the spillovers of the club onto the non club members α the higher the payment level required to reach the desired club size the same result can be achieved by imposing a per capita tax τ e g the price of the concession to use groundwater the level of which is also set by equation 8 on the groundwater users thus the relative efficiency of the two instruments subsidy on the reservoir tax on groundwater use rights depends only on the relative size of the desired level of the n size of the club and the number of the groundwater users indeed the costs of the interventions are p o s d and τ n s d since p o τ the groundwater tax entails a lower social cost only when s d is greater than half of the farm population the logic of the subsidy intervention is depicted in fig 2 contrary to the open access case the simple payment does not affect the equilibrium size in a closed membership the foc u s p s r s 0 are unchanged by the introduction of the policy parameters consider instead a policy that subsidizes water consumption from a reservoir in that case the closed membership reservoir size is the solution to the maximization of 9 max u s p s r π r k r t s p c r setting the foc equal to zero u s p s r r 0 yields π r k p c 0 hence in this case the intensive margin of the reservoir increases however not even this type of policy scheme affects the n size of the club and hence it is ineffective in reaching the societal desired level of groundwater availability one possibility to affect the size of the emerging club in the case of closed membership is to formulate a policy scheme whereby the subsidy is attached to a minimum participation rule s mpr set at s d in other words given s d the subsidy level is set so that for a club member the utility at s c is equal to the utility at s d s mpr the payment is thus the solution to u s s c r u s p s d r which entails 10 p c t s d t s c the policy scheme needs to cover the higher costs that an increase in the club above the optimal one entails as depicted in fig 3 note that spillovers do not affect this payment level but do affect the applicability range of the scheme indeed 10 is valid only as long as u s s c r u f s d g comparing p c with p o shows that the relative level of the payment in the two club membership rules depends on the difference between the coordination costs of the two club size equilibria and on the spillovers p c p o t s o t s c s d s o a α n note that in case there are no spillovers α 0 p c is undoubtedly greater than p o since t s o t s c by definition moreover observe that the agricultural sector as a whole would be better off in the closed access case if considerations of welfare distribution are not involved indeed in the closed access case the payment ensures that a greater number of players enjoy the highest club payoffs so that the total welfare w is w c s d u s s c r n s d u f s d g in the open access case the entire farmer population welfare is w o n u f s d g being u s s c r u f s d g w c w o 3 extensions to the basic model 3 1 optimal reservoir size 3 1 1 societal point of view in the previous section we found the equilibrium taking for given the desired level of groundwater availability here we endogenize such a level imagining that the reservoir entails both positive the increase in the availability of irrigation water and negative changes in the landscape and in its hydrological characteristics externalities the utility for society generated by the reservoir in that case would be given by 11 u v g a e r s s u s s r n s u f s g where g a is defined by equation 5 v is the positive externality linked to the available groundwater e r s is the negative externality dependent on the size of the reservoir with e 0 and e 0 and the other two terms are the total welfare of club members and non members respectively assuming that only the number of club members can be chosen 3 3 in the case that both the intensive and extensive margins were or could be chosen the optimal reservoir size would be determined by a system of equations comprising equation 12 and if the negative externalities were linear in the total reservoir size e g e r s e then we would have u r e u s s r r entailing a tax or a quota on the intensive margin of the reservoir the tax or a quota could still possibly be coupled with a subsidy determined by equation 13 while this seems paradoxical the actual rdp 2007 2013 measure in emilia romagna did include such a constraint based on the existing irrigable area and on the maximum amount of water to be stored for a project to be eligible for financial support taking the first derivative of 11 with respect to s and set it to 0 leads to the optimal club n size s d 12 v g n s u f s g s u s s r s u s s r s r e r s u f s g equation 12 shows that the optimal reservoir size equalizes the sum of the positive externality and the positive spillovers on non members first and second term on lhs and the benefits associated with the club members with its marginal costs that are the negative externalities and the opportunity costs for a farmer to join the utility for non users comparing equation 12 with equation 7 leads to the payment that is necessary to reach the optimal reservoir size in the open membership case 13 p o v g n s d a α n s d t s d r e r s d note that p o can actually be negative and thus it can become a tax on the reservoir size when its negative effects overcome the positive side as we have seen in the previous section in the closed membership case a simple payment is not sufficient to increase the reservoir size and a two element mechanism needs to be implemented more specifically a mpr is set at the level found by solving equation 12 and a payment is set by equation 10 3 1 2 water utility company incentive scheme imagine now an external actor say a water utility company which is interested in the availability of groundwater and willing to provide a payment to farmers so that they reduce groundwater extraction assume that the utility of the company is described by 14 u v g a s p s in this case the transfer to the farmers becomes an element in the objective function and as a result the type of membership as well therefore the company maximizes 14 where the relationship between the payment and the club size is determined by equation 8 in the open membership case and equation 10 in the closed membership case the foc of the maximization problem u s 0 leads to 15 s p s s p s v g substituting the open membership payment found in equation 8 and 15 becomes after rearranging 16 s t s 2 a α n t s v g t s o s o a α n in the closed membership case equation 15 becomes 17 s t s t s v g t s c in the absence of spillovers the closed membership case undoubtedly leads to a lower coalition size since the right hand side is greater in the open membership case 3 2 joint use of groundwater and reservoir in the basic model described in section 2 the use of groundwater is an alternative to the use of the reservoir we now relax this assumption by changing the cost function from linear to quadratic and for simplicity we remove the spillover effects on the non members in this situation the utility for a club member is given by 18 u s s r g s π r g s 1 2 k r 2 1 2 c g s 2 t s and the utility for a non member is given by 19 u f s g f π g f 1 2 c g f 2 the water consumed by each club member is given by the usual focs respectively π r g s r k r and π r g s g s c g s with the quadratic revenue function previously defined the optimal water individually consumed from the reservoir and the use of groundwater are respectively r a c c b k c b and g s a k c b k c b note that the use of groundwater reservoir increases with the cost of the reservoir groundwater further it is worth noting that unless k 0 a club member will use both the reservoir and groundwater similarly the foc for non members leads to the optimal groundwater consumption for a non member g f a c b note that g f g s so that the emergence of the club would decrease the pressure on groundwater resources the open membership n size equilibrium is given similarly to 3 by 20 π r g s 1 2 k r 2 1 2 c g s 2 t s f g f 1 2 c g f 2 0 an increase in the cost of groundwater affects the utility of both members and non members but the impact on the equilibrium size is positive implicitly deriving 19 with respect to c yields s o c 1 2 g f 2 g s 2 t s o which is greater than 0 in case s o s the closed membership is not affected by the change in the utility function being still determined by the point that minimizes the average cost function we now focus on the role of policy but unlike in section 2 we investigate the impact of a subsidy that is linearly related to the water quantity consumed from the reservoir by introducing the payment equation 16 becomes 21 u s p s r g s p r π r g s 1 2 k r 2 1 2 c g s 2 t s the foc leads to g s p a k b p c b k b c and r p c b p a c c b k b c it is easy to see that the payment not surprisingly increases the intensive margin of the reservoir and decreases the use of groundwater in the open membership case the subsidy by positively affecting the utility for club members increases the n size equilibrium of the reservoir s o p r t s o still in the case s o s as in the previous section however the subsidy does not have any impact on the closed membership case note that the available groundwater after irrigation use is now given by g a g n s g f s g s the impact of a payment on the availability of groundwater is differentiated across the membership types in the case of open membership the derivative of g a is positive g a p s o p g f g s s o g s p the effect of the payment on the available groundwater is twofold it simultaneously increases the number of club members and their extraction of groundwater on the contrary in the closed membership case it is simply given by g a p s c g s p suggesting that from a policy point of view in this simple setup the open membership case seems to be the most effective 3 3 groundwater as a common pool resource and relation to the club formation now we further investigate the positive spillovers that the reservoir can deliver to non members in the basic model spillovers are given by a simple increase in the revenues for a non member we now investigate how spillovers can positively affect the groundwater users explicitly conceptualizing the use of groundwater as a common pool resource to do so we assume that the parameter c in equation 2 is instead a function of groundwater availability c c χ g a so that an increase in the available groundwater causes a decrease in the unitary costs as it is clear by substituting equation 5 and rearranging it the utility for non members depends on both the number of club members and on the total consumption of groundwater for simplicity we further assume that a club member will only use the reservoir utility for a non member is now given by 22 u f s g f π g f c χ g g f χ g f f g f if groundwater consumption is not coordinated each farmer will maximize her own utility taking for given the

previously described the optimal groundwater is given by g f o g a c χ g b 2 χ n s the classic result holds the optimal groundwater is lower than in the ne the incoordination in groundwater use leads to a non pareto optimum equilibrium g f og g f ne and thus u f o g s g f o g u f n e s g f n e this also implies that moving from uncoordinated to coordinated groundwater management holding utility for a reservoir member constant causes a decrease in the open membership reservoir n size what is the relationship with the reservoir size first with respect to individual groundwater consumption in both the ne and og management the n size of the club positively affects groundwater consumption since g f n e s 0 and g f o g s 0 with respect to utility of groundwater users an increase in the reservoir size increases the utility both in the ne and in the cooperative equilibrium since it positively affects holding everything else equal the availability of groundwater accordingly in this case the reservoir n size creates positive spillovers on the non members how does a per capita payment for reservoir users aimed at increasing the size of the reservoir affect the total available groundwater in this situation rewriting the available groundwater after irrigation use results in the following 28 g a g n g f s p s p g f s p where g is a function of the equilibrium size which in turn is a function of the payment deriving g a with respect to p yields 29 g a p s p p s p n g f s p s g s p which is positive in case g f s p n s p g f s p s u r 0 in this case a subsidy increases the availability of water only if its effects on the number of people that join the club are greater than the positive effect on the use of groundwater from those that continues to use it 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we theoretically analyse the role of policy in the emergence of collective irrigation reservoirs conceptualizing the reservoir construction as the contribution to a blue club we focus on the coordination among farmers in such an investment based on this framework we are able to show in which circumstances policy measures are necessary to reach the desired reservoir size so that the pressure on groundwater resource is reduced we also identify optimal policy parameters under different open vs closed membership types of the club the theoretical analysis shows that payment levels and design must be differentiated according to the type of membership in the club a simple linear subsidy is sufficient to affect the reservoir size in the case of an open membership even though the potential positive spillovers from the reservoir to the non user increase the payment level required however this type of payment is ineffective in the case of closed memberships in case of a closed membership minimum participation rules that explicitly link the subsidy to a desired n size of the club are required a real life example is provided by emilia romagna where there is a policy scheme that incentivizes the construction of collective reservoirs and that includes such a collective conditionality constraint the extensions to the basic model show the importance of a hydrological management policy that explicitly and not surprisingly takes into account jointly the reservoir and the alternative water sources while cooperative social planner management decreases the exploitation of groundwater it might also negatively impact the use of alternative water sources the net effect remains an empirical question the model and results can also be interpreted within a social ecological system framework the model shows that even admitting a partial cooperative behaviour large spillovers from the club can prevent the formation of the club to be formed or to limit its size however the model further hints at the potential role that policies can have in positively impacting the contribution to collective infrastructures that are usually considered key elements in socio ecological systems several limitations apply each actually hinting at potential topics for further research in this field a series of weaknesses are related to the conceptual side of the model first the separation between coordination costs and extraction costs simplifies the interpretation of the results but yields the result that individual water consumption does not depend on the n size of the reservoir the inclusion of a combined non linear cost function of the type t s r would solve this problem second the model does not address the problem of the heterogeneity of farmers while a detailed analysis is required for the open membership case the inclusion of heterogeneous players would not affect the equilibrium in the case of closed membership if the coordination costs only depend on the n size of the club however different club compositions could emerge similar reasoning could apply to the introduction of a spatially explicit analysis of farm distribution and its effect on the club s emergence finally here we assume that the membership type is exogenously given and the analysis suggests that if the access type were designable an open membership would be preferable to a closed one since the efficacy of the payment is greater in the former than in the latter such a conclusion should be further explored along several dimensions first distributional considerations between the agricultural sector and the rest of society would impact the choice and the evaluation of the scheme second in practice the choice between open and closed memberships might be negatively related to the spatial target of the policy schemes given the spatial dimension of the potential reservoir users an open list should most likely be restricted a priori to specific areas that segment potential users in turn resulting in very local specific policy scheme that would then possibly be affected by high administrative costs on the other hand a more general non spatially restricted policy scheme could result in lower administrative costs but ultimately a closed access membership type this further hints at the cautious evaluation of the theoretical analysis presented here altogether while the expectation that a collective approach will improve the ability to deal with water management issues is well justified this paper contributes to show that the complexity of the interplay between collective behaviour and policy requires a careful policy design to achieve such objectives in an effective and efficient manner funding this paper was supported by the horizon 2020

8699,agricultural water management is becoming a critical issue in many parts of the world and cost effective water policies are required to control water use we examine the case study of irrigated agriculture in beauce france 9750 km2 europe s largest cereal producing region we explore the mechanisms for water abstraction control involving a combination of regulatory and economic instruments the analysis is conducted with a hydro economic model that includes a calibrated economic model and a semi distributed calibrated hydrogeological model first we analyse the system currently used to manage groundwater abstraction it includes a flexible quota system revised annually as a function of the state of the groundwater combined with a tax this dual system performs better than a single instrument because of regional hydrogeological and economic specificities as well as the fact that it limits costs for farming we then investigate the impact of alternative combinations of instruments our findings show that the most cost effective and robust way to improve the groundwater state is to increase the economic component a flexible tax in association with a flexible quota system keywords beauce irrigation water scarcity robustness hydro economic modelling climate change 1 introduction with increasing environmental constraints and rising water demands managing water allocation has become a critical issue in many parts of the world in the farming sector demand for irrigation is significant and growing 1 the sector is also affected by greater regulatory and climatic constraints related problems include the over allocation of water for agricultural purposes with respect to resource capacity 2 in this context both institutions and individuals are developing coping strategies thus there is clearly a need for instruments that are capable of meeting environmental performance targets and limiting the cost of diminishing water availability these instruments should take into account adaptation of farmers as well as variability and uncertainty of water resources supply capacity and demand the policy debate about the best combination of instruments is central to the majority of environmental problems and is characterised by the control of negative externalities or the provision of public goods essentially two types of instruments can be adopted by policy makers the first type is geared to quantitative control such as norms or quotas which limit input use or output emissions the second type includes price based or economic instruments such as taxes on inputs or outputs as well as subsidies intended to encourage the adoption of good practices and technologies economic instruments are expected to affect input use by increasing or decreasing the cost for the producer or consumer thus they provide an incentive in terms of the cost effective allocation of scarce resources however this may fail to change farmer behaviour if the cost of change which is not only monetary exceeds the benefit of change because ultimately the economic and technical choice of adaptation depends on the farmer 3 chap 1 rey et al 4 review the implementation of economic instruments throughout europe a variety of economic instruments can be considered as discussed by koundouri 5 for example trading quotas markets revising cap or tax levels buybacks 6 or combining instruments other type of instruments such as voluntary based mechanisms also exist from a purely theoretical point of view these two main types of instruments are equivalent weitzman 1974 however information asymmetries uncertainties about processes water demand and rationality are just some of the factors that undermine this equivalency 1 1 weitzman 1974 discusses this economic issue in detail economic instruments such as taxes also have the so called double dividend advantage they generate public revenues that can be used to improve water management 2 2 this not the case with a market where the value is captured by private agents in addition to incentivising behaviour however often they also imply high transaction costs although economic and regulatory instruments are often opposed they can be more effective and cost effective when used in combination in this study we explore how such a combination can cope with variability and uncertainty in terms of water supply and demand the tinbergen rule 3 3 tinbergen 44 was awarded the first nobel prize in economics for his work on economic policy his work dealt with policy arrangements that are dynamically efficient states that each policy objective requires a specific instrument to have an effective policy mix young 7 develops this rule for agricultural water management and for the design of efficient administrative settings of water use and allocation he suggests among other rules to unbundle policy objectives e g to distinguish historic permanent entitlements and yearly daily allocations of water this paper examines water abstraction control mechanisms and the robustness of original combinations of instruments in beauce in a reference scenario and for future scenarios of climate change and price uncertainty beauce is located in the central region of france it is the main cereal producing region in europe 8 farmers irrigate a significant share of the cropping area given the sensitivity of the water resource water policies have been adopted to control withdrawals for more than 20 years in order to avoid drought in connected surface watercourses 9 a flexible quota is revised annually depending on the groundwater level in four regions in beauce thus farmers face varying constraints from year to year this quota is combined with a tax on water abstraction from the wfd the quota has been designed locally to safeguard piezometric levels the tax has not been designed locally as it has been introduced with the wfd and the french water law the rationale is both to have farmers contributing financially for their potential harm on the environment and to act as an incentive to save water as mentioned above with the double dividend advantage the analysis of the control mechanisms for water withdrawal is supported by a theoretical analysis and a calibrated hydro economic model hem that represents farming behaviour and connected groundwater resources this original contribution to the literature showcases beauce s unique control mechanism for groundwater abstraction it provides an economic analysis and explores the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative combinations of instruments to increase environmental compliance and limit social cost several alternatives are considered i economic instruments such as flexible taxes that depend on the yearly state of groundwater resources and higher taxes and subsidies to reduce water use buy backs and premiums to reduce irrigation ii alternative regulatory measures such as increased restrictions and spatial disaggregation in terms of piezometric head monitoring and restriction and iii a supply side option involving groundwater substitution we also test the robustness of alternative combinations of instruments in relation to their capacity to cope with uncertainty and avoid undesirable outcomes a pragmatic approach is required to explore the cost and effect of policies for improving the management of water resources and to analyse the observed water allocation and behaviour hydro economic models are a vast ensemble of models characterised by at least one representation of economic processes production and or consumption and hydro geo logical processes see e g harou et al 10 the principle of hydro economic models is to connect these different compartments the models represent the real world rules and processes of case studies which link the parameters within the hydro economic system under study the economics and biophysics of water resource dynamics can be considered together when the cost of the resource and the regulation i e water rights or water restrictions are dependent on the state of water resources and when water uptake by economic agents impacts the water resources it is important to consider specific economic processes such as farming s adaptation to changing constraints and institutional adaptation to regulate access to water in response to the impact of climate change or global change in order to ensure that the resulting economic and hydrologic balances are not distorted assessing the impact of climate change on water resources already presents a scientific challenge even when economic factors are not considered 11 12 however the impact may be over or underestimated if we fail to account of the increase in crop water requirements that are not satisfied because of regulations or the farming sector s capacity to adapt 4 4 e g ducharne et al 45 do not consider these adaptations and might overestimate the increase in withdrawals from farming the rest of this paper is organised as follows after this introduction the second section presents groundwater management and policies in beauce the third explains the background to hydro economic modelling and robustness the fourth describes the hydro economic model the fifth presents the simulation results of the reference situation and alternative instruments with climate change scenarios 2 groundwater management and policies in beauce france 2 1 farming and irrigation in beauce beauce is europe s main cereal producer it is one of the most irrigated farming regions in france and covers about 650 000 ha fig 1 shows its location as well as the irrigated and non irrigated areas since the 1970s irrigation has developed substantially to cope with dry years secure high yields and enable the diversification of crop production particularly crops grown under contract for the agro food industry depending on the year between 120 000 and 240 000 ha are now irrigated using pivot and hose reel irrigation systems between 150 and 450 million m3 per year farmers have access to the water resource with individual wells irrigation essentially relies on a large groundwater resource namely the beauce aquifer which is located under the seine and loire surface water basins it is a multi layered aquifer with sands chalk and limestone that covers 9 700 km2 the beauce aquifer once called the château d eau water tower of france is used for irrigation drinking water and industry industrial abstrations are around 40 millions m3 and drinking water uses some 70 millions m3 per year it also feeds natural surface water systems thereby providing important ecosystem services wetlands biodiversity this aquifer system is subject to quantitative problems as evidenced by the lowering of the water table since the beginning of the 1990s and the reduced flows drought on connected surface rivers 2 2 water policy in beauce since the 1990s the government has implemented local water policy measures and instruments in consultation with agricultural representatives to deal with surface and groundwater issues relating to drought in 1994 the volumetric management of withdrawals started with the obligation to install meters at individual wells in 1997 and 1998 a stakeholder group was set up and a series of studies including modelling approaches was launched to support the policy process the overarching framework is now the french water law which is the translation of the european water framework directive wfd the beauce aquifer has been classified as a zone de répartition des eaux a water distribution zone this is an important instrument applied by the french water law in order to comply with the wfd and ensure that bodies of water achieve a good status this classification states that all withdrawals must be submitted for prior governmental authorisation the perimeter of the local water management plan sage 5 5 in france the sage schema d amenagement de gestion des eaux water management plan is the local basin scale governance instrument developed in territories with water management problems was determined in 1999 and adopted in consultation with stakeholders in 2013 the objectives of the sage are to determine the principles means and goals required to reach a balance for water use which guarantees water security for all and safeguards or restores the good state of natural ecosystems since 2017 the control of water withdrawals has been delegated to a single collective management body which ensures that the total volume of water withdrawal does not exceed the yearly authorisation level this replaces the system where farmers were individually required to declare and respect their volumes to the authorities the question of the global quota allocation is central to this new governance framework in beauce two types of water policy instruments are used in quantitative water management i planning instruments which aim to balance uses with the capacity of the resource to avoid crisis management details are given in the following paragraph and ii crisis instruments which aim to limit the impact of a drought surface river flow below threshold levels details of crisis management in beauce are provided in appendix 1 while this issue is beyond the scope of this paper it is interesting to complement our understanding of beauce s water governance 2 2 1 water demand control and planning in beauce the existing planning policy is a combination of regulatory and economic instruments the regulatory instrument is a flexible quota and the economic instrument is a water tax a technical measure was also implemented involving the removal of a series of wells 6 6 new wells have been constructed to replace the old ones because pumping in wells located near the stream directly affected the flow rate of a few small and highly sensitive watercourses the following two paragraphs provide details of the flexible quota and the water tax in 1997 a volume based quota system was introduced each year a coefficient reflecting the state of the groundwater at the beginning of the cropping season is defined by the administration the quota is updated every year at the beginning of the season by multiplying the reference quota by the yearly coefficient to determine the volume that can be withdrawn each year since 2009 individual coefficients have also been calculated for four hydrogeological units sub sectors of the beauce aquifer that display differing hydrodynamic properties the reference quota i e when coefficients are 1 is 420 million m3 two thresholds h1 and h2 determine the coefficient appendix 4 shows the yearly coefficient according to the piezometric level for the beauce centrale region h3 is the highest alert threshold so far the values for the coefficient vary between 0 4 and 1 depending on the year and the region the government publishes the yearly water availability coefficient around the 1the government publishes the yearly water of april during the year a website informs farmers about changes in groundwater levels which means they can anticipate the level of the coefficient before the official statement is released another characteristic of the quota system is that there are no restrictions on the dynamics of water use in other words water may be used partially or totally on spring or summer crops thus farmers must plan cropping and irrigation patterns jointly at the beginning of the growing season despite the uncertainty regarding spring and summer weather conditions to comply with the wfd water pays water principle a water tax is collected in france from all farmers that abstract more than 1000 m3 the amount is fixed in relation to the basin and the user type the reference tax level is t a x r e f 0 014 m3 for farmers in beauce although the effect of this instrument will be analysed in this paper one should keep in mind that it has not been locally adapted to act on behaviour as an incentive the tax is designed in its principles at national level with a policy objective of preventing or reparing damages caused to the environment by collecting public revenue and acting as an incentive for water use to avoid misuse the amount can be adapted if the water body is in a zone de répartition des eaux i e if the water body is with quantitative problems but it has not been and is never to the extend of our knowledge adapted to local economic conditions to ensure it acts as an incentive 7 7 see https programme eau climat eau seine normandie fr les redevances taux et modes de calcul and https aides redevances eau loire bretagne fr home redevances agriculture html 2 2 2 analysis of the interest of the actual instruments in beauce the originality of the beauce quota system is that it varies depending on the state of the groundwater this is useful because it significantly reduces the cost for farming compared to a fixed quota system a fixed quota based on dry years would limit water use above the necessary level and induce significant costs in relatively wet years a fixed quota based on average or wet years would not provide the same environmental benefits and would not comply with the wfd the flexible quota and the tax on water withdrawals are both active instruments that must be respected however only one of the two actually restricts the water demand in a given situation depending on the circumstances either the quota system or the tax may determine farmer s behaviour and affect total water demand this is illustrated in fig 2 which shows water demand curves and the variability of the quota constraint for two different situations i the first corresponds to a case where the quota is a limiting factor and the shadow value of water λ w a t e r is positive ii in the second case the tax and total cost of water are limiting factors the shadow value of water is 0 and the quota does not limit behaviour in beauce both situations occur they can be observed in different regions within the same year in the case of a specific region their occurrence depends on the year and the water demand parameters input and output prices as well as the biophysical parameters of water production therefore the variability depends on i water demand and ii quota level consequently given the regional hydrogeological and economic characteristics the use of both instruments improves environmental performance more than in the case with a single instrument it is also worth mentioning that even when the tax is not constraining water use and quota is which is often the case in beauce the revenue collected by the government is allocated to implement other water management measures the quota system relies on individual historical quotas the sum of which should correspond to the total volume of water that can be abstracted per year in a given situation based on a reference or normal situation however this is not the case because so called dead volumes corresponding to a share of the volumes of some quotas are never authorised this is a problem of over allocation the flexible quota system makes it possible to impose a reduction coefficient every year and thus manage over allocation however individual discrepancies cannot be managed with this instrument indeed this would require resetting initial entitlements to align them with the total sustainable abstraction volume and not historical practices 2 2 3 developing innovative instruments although the current management scheme has been recognised as a step towards sustainable management it has failed to overcome drought related problems during the summer alert levels are reached for surface water this might be accentuated by climate change as suggested by our modelling results see results section we developed and tested alternative instruments to examine effectiveness and cost effectiveness for climate change scenarios they are described below an overview of the combination of instruments is given in table 1 baseline with 6 different regions 6 reg 6 reg on the basis of the zoning of the hydrogeological model which relies on hydrodynamic properties we tested the baseline scenario by dividing the beauce centrale into three sub areas to see whether deciphering the coefficient and corresponding water withdrawal rights would improve the level of piezometric heads and at what cost for farmers the advantage of breaking down the spatial policy level is to get closer to a tailored or first best policy after a preliminary evaluation the instrument seemed unsatisfactory in terms of environmental performance we then introduced an alternative option for the instrument 6 reg by reinforcing the quota calculation function this involved associating a new coefficient to threshold levels 0 2 and 0 05 to s2 and s3 respectively appendix 4 gives the relation between coefficient and piezometric level water fee based on the piezometric level flxtax to increase the environmental efficiency of the tax mechanism we indexed the tax rate to the piezometric level the aim is to indicate the relative scarcity of the resource through a price signal to reduce water demand in critical years the tax is calculated as follows t a x f l x 2 t a x r e f 1 h h i g h r e f h n with h n h n h n 1 h n 2 3 this means that the current tax rate would be doubled and multiplied by the difference between a mean observed piezometric level and a high water reference piezometer level 2001 is taken as a high water reference if the water level is x meter below the reference level the tax would be increased of respectively x 100 this tax can be charaterized as an ambiant tax 13 given that the same tax is levied on all farmers in the same aquifer area regardless of their individual water use the tax is combined with a fixed quota system coefficient 1 which is less restrictive than the reference water tax based on the piezometric level combined with the quota system flxtxq this instrument combines the previous flexible tax system flxtax and the reference flexible quota system groundwater resource substitution substi one option discussed by the administration is to develop substitute water resources to compensate for the reduction in groundwater availability in the eastern part of the region montargois and fusain the substitute water resource would be derived from water collected from the farm drainage system and additional surface water is pumped into artificial ponds in the wet season this solution has a further benefit because it limits the nitrate contamination of water drainage water is collected in reservoirs and reused for irrigation instead of flowing into the ecosystem this does not negatively affect the infiltration in the aquifer because the pond recharge occurs in the wet season when the groundwater flows into surface river systems the investment costs are estimated to be around 5 m3 with a 30 year depreciation period and a discount rate of 2 5 the cost amounts to 0 24 m3 quota buybacks buybck similarly to the premium to reduce irrigation the idea of buy back is to pay farmers for all the cubic metres they give up compared to a reference situation ideally without buy backs in return for a uniform payment in france this system does not exist as far as we know however it has been applied in spain 14 it is a more effective policy than the premium to reduce irrigation the latter does not take into account water application rates per hectare which are a determining factor when it comes to reducing irrigation the farmer may choose to sell their water right by comparing the subsidy payment and the estimated marginal value of water a buy back scheme is effective if the level of payment equals the shadow value of water in our experiment the buy back premium was set at 0 20 m3 for the experiment this incentive should affect the intensive margin adjustment and bring about a shift from highly irrigated crops to less irrigated crops desirrigation premium desirri paying farmers to abandon irrigation is already envisaged in france through the desirrigation premium as part of the agro environmental measures cap 8 8 the european common agricultural policy pillar ii the premium was fixed to 250 ha and is payed to farmers who prove that they have reduced their irrigated area compared to a reference situation this incentive should affect the extensive margin bringing about a shift from irrigated areas to non irrigated areas 3 hydro economic model and robustness analysis 3 1 current approaches in hydro economic modelling the growing concern about the need to coordinate economic and environmental policies calls for a global understanding of the interaction between socio economics and the biophysical functionning of water resources and related ecosystems hydro economic modelling is a pragmatic response to the need to represent the biophysical and economic system as a whole the aim of developing this type of model is to understand the impact of climate change or other global change scenarios and to simulate alternative management schemes in areas where there is conflict over water or when water causes damage such as floods 15 hydro economic models are often developed at the scale of water resources to account for local economic institutional and biophysical characteristics however some hem exist at larger global scales such as alcamo floerke and maerker 16 hydro economic models have developed over the last 10 20 years examples can be found all over the world as quoted by varela ortega et al 17 several authors have reviewed empirical hydro economic models harou et al 10 brouwer and hofkes 18 the first type can be qualified as analytical models typically they are non calibrated and adopt a social planner perspective they are rarely defined as hydro economic models sometimes they are called dynamic or optimal control models here the central question is the optimal control of temporal groundwater allocation of water from a social point of view even if this optimum is far from the private optimum that might be closer to the real observed allocation which might be closer to the genuine allocation observed some examples are provided by burt 19 rubio and casino 20 koundouri 21 koundouri and christou 22 a second type includes models with a more empirical approach to hydro economic modelling they are designed to represent real world processes without considering whether long term water use is optimal from a social planners perspective this is the approach used in the present study these models can be used to test the effect of agricultural water pricing 23 the selection of climate change adaptation measures 24 or to calculate the economic value of water or the costs of water scarcity 25 another distinction can be made between models that are spatially explicit e g farm scale grid model covering several km and those that model regions semi distributed models the first requires important computational means because data flow has to be managed between different models through coupling e g bulatewicz et al 26 mulligan et al 27 however they provide spatially explicit information that can be useful to analyse policies and distributional effects on both resources and economics good quality economic or hydrological data is rarely available at a spatially explicit level alternatively in the case of regional modelling good quality data is usually available standard or historical databases but at a reduced spatially explicit level in addition regional modelling allows for the development of holistic models which integrate both the economic and hydrological representations of processes on the same platform this is helpful for supporting large simulation sets to explore uncertainties such as those related to climate change 3 2 robust decision making rdm rdm is an analytical framework that takes account of the profound uncertainties affecting decision making 28 it was initially developed by the rand corporation to focus on the question of long term planning and sustainability it relies on an iterative framework which connects decision makers with a modelling capacity capable of simulating the effect of uncertainty on performance indicators unlike research for optimality it internalises the uncertainty of some unknown parameters in the selection criteria this is a different approach to classical optimality criteria which produces a single outcome for a defined set of input parameters these approaches are useful for identifying decisions that hedge against uncertainty lempert et al 29 and hallegatte 30 are central references that develop the rdm analytical framework the optimality approach explores uncertainty effects with a sensitivity analysis and thus may provide different results in relation to the central problem it differs from rdm criteria which provide a single outcome for several uncertainty scenarios with rdm a rdm algorithm has to be described to express the selection criteria indicators must be calculated for individual results scenario x instrument to facilitate the interpretation of a matrix of results this differs from a one dimensional comparison used in a deterministic approach which is easy to interpret selection of the option that yields the maximum or minimum as a function of the selection criteria the matrix becomes multi dimensional if several criteria are considered multiple criteria the challenge for rdm is to combine the information provided by multiple scenarios of uncertainty for each of the programmes indeed the results ranking of instruments from the best to the worst according to a given indicator may vary depending on the scenario as we have seen previously a robust instrument is one that avoids critical cases and secures minimum satisfaction in all cases several robust decision making criteria could be envisaged the minimum maximum regret is a good candidate as it minimises the risk of significant regret and is in line with the concept of robustness other criteria such as the minmax selection of the best worst case option which is more conservative could have been considered the advantage of the minmaxregret criteria is that they do not require any extra information and can be considered as a starting point in robustness analysis 31 the regret is the distance between the indicator for an instrument and the best indicator in a given scenario i e there are as many regrets as there are scenarios x instruments for each instrument the maximum regret can be calculated for all scenarios the instrument that provides the minimum maximum regret for all scenarios is chosen with these criteria thus the options can be ranked from least robust to most robust 4 the beauce hydro economic model we develop a hydro economic model of agriculture and groundwater in beauce it is composed of six independent regional models the main advantage which justifies the choice of a holistic hydro economic model instead of a compartment model is that it facilitates the exchange of input and output parameters between models in our case this means we can conduct a multiple year simulation as well as numerous policy or scenario simulations three main dynamic connections between the economic and hydrogeological models are represented in our model i irrigation water withdrawal influences the piezometric head of the aquifer ii the yearly regulatory withdrawal constraints depend on the piezometric head level iii the cost of water for farmers is a function of the depth of the aquifer the latter can be considered a partially internalized externality the more water farmers pump the deeper the piezometer level and the higher the cost of supplying water the model has a yearly time scale a hydrological year starts on the 1st of april of each year this is assumed to be the date when piezometric levels are observed in order to determine the yearly coefficient 9 9 in reality this date is variable but it is always in march or april the sustainability of the hydrogeological system is ensured when the hydrogeological balance keeps the piezometric levels above a specific threshold we build a dynamic recursive model the optimization of the economic maximisation function is conducted on a yearly basis n but it includes constraints based on the piezometric head level in year n 1 it corresponds to a multi period simulation without inter temporal optimization 10 10 inter temporal optimization is a multi time period optimization this can be useful for two main settings the first is the farmers decision with regard to growing perennial crops e g balali et al 23 connor et al 46 the second is the social planner s perspective which maximises over a long time period here we assume that farmers are myopic and do not account for the input allocation in years to come because they grow annual field crops in the simulation the yearly withdrawal coefficients are first calculated according to the piecewise linear functions determined for the region which give the coefficient as a function of the piezometric level h n see appendix 4 then the economic model represents farmers behaviour in terms of choice of cropping patterns and water allocation at the beginning of the agricultural season in relation to the yearly water availability it is important to note that some crops have to be sown before the farmers know exactly what the yearly coefficient will be on the basis of expert advice we assume that the cropping pattern will not be changed re optimised after the 1st of april 11 11 the farmer already has an idea of the order of magnitude of the yearly coefficient before the official announcement because information is available on an internet site then the weather conditions that occur in late spring and summer are randomly and independently drawn from past records and classified as dry medium and wet these determine the aquifer recharge the real water application on crops and the resulting withdrawals we assume that there is no difference between the abstracted volume and applied volume of water because of individual access and equipment the hydrogeological model simulates the piezometric head level h n 1 for the following year n 1 and natural drainage 4 1 the economic model the economic model represents the farming sector s behaviour in terms of yearly cropping and input land and water allocation at regional level six regions are considered 12 12 the beauce regions are sufficiently homogenous to consider that modelling a whole region as a unique farmer is acceptable detailed arguments are given in graveline and mérel 34 it is a programming model of agricultural supply based on the principles of positive mathematical programming pmp 32 with decreasing marginal yields at the crop level and constant elasticity of substitution ces between land and water for irrigated crops as refined by mérel simon and yi 33 it is calibrated in order to perfectly replicate the observed reference and the accounting profits the model is taken from graveline and mérel 34 13 13 this calibration is referred to as the profit rule in graveline and mérel 34 we choose this calibration because we believe the profit calibration rule to be more likely to be accepted by decision makers as they might be interested in the evolution and replication of profits our economic model has the advantage of representing three potential adaptation margins of farming as broken down by mérel et al 35 and described in graveline and mérel 34 these are the super extensive margin the extensive and the intensive which are respectively the shift from irrigated crop to rain fed crop the shift from an intensive to a less water intensive crop and the reduction of the applied water quantity for a given crop and land unit agronomic data from morardet and hanot 36 on yield response to water is used to calibrate the model see graveline and mérel 34 for more information on the calibration of the yield response elasticity in the short term intensive adjustments often called deficit irrigation 14 14 we do not refer to the distribution strategy of water application along the cropping season as we do not have these variables in our model we only refer to the reduction of water application per hectare and per crop are very likely to occur because they do not involve

depending on piezometric level here it is calculated for h 110 m 59 1000 m3 or 0 001 compared to a total 0 059 m3 cost the calibration parameter and data cropping patterns yields prices are given in

multiplied by the yearly coefficient and water costs c w calculated according the piezometric head h n of the given year we assume that farmers make their cropping pattern and water application decisions for a relative dry year according bouarfa et al 37 who realize a field experimental study on impact of water reduction on farms this is justified by a risk averse behaviour assumption the optimised cropping pattern is supposed to be adopted but the real water application is actualized according to the weather conditions that occur in late spring and summer 4 2 hydrogeologic model the hydrogeological model is a regional semi distributed model it follows the principles of groundwater balance inflow minus outflow in relation to induced water table changes using the aquifer storage coefficient it was set up following three main steps the first step was to define homogenous hydrogeological zones the second focused on gathering data and calculating model parameters while the third concentrated on refining and calibrating the model the beauce agricultural region is divided into four regulatory zones to provide a satisfactory representation of the hydrogeological processes we broke the beauce down into six homogeneous hydrogeological zones this zoning is based on geological characteristics and on relatively homogenous infiltrations it is coherent with the regulatory zoning the beauce centrale is further divided into three zones and the three remaining zones are the same as in the regulatory zoning see fig 1 the hydrogeological model has been refined from the simple groundwater mass balance equation that states that the piezometric level at the beginning of the growing year h n 1 is a function of effective natural recharge r n natural drainage d n withdrawal per year w t n and per sector t agriculture drinking water industry storage coefficient c e n and area s the natural drainage is understood as the natural flows to other systems other aquifer or surface flows in the case of beauce the drainage towards surface river systems is significant we characterise the drainage in year n as the sum of the drainage of year n 1 plus a term that is proportionate to the head difference between two years h n h n 1 the effective recharge r n is the volume of water from the surface rain surface waters which reaches the aquifer in year n the beauce aquifer is characterised by a high level of inertia as shown by the lag effects of rainfall on groundwater levels and the aquifer s substantial depth its size and thickness also explain the system s inertia and long reaction time 17 17 see details at http sigescen brgm fr fiche d identite nappe de beauce html therefore to improve the model s specification the recharge should be composed of the infiltration i n directly dependent from the yearly precipitations and from the previous year s infiltration periods of drought for example do not reduce groundwater levels suddenly since the effect is buffered over several years we assume that the conductivity within each zone is such that the level of the aquifer on the 1st of april of year n is homogeneous over each zone and represents the sum of extractions of year n 1 18 18 see pfeiffer and lin 47 for a critical discussion on this assumption our model is as follows aquifer regional index is omitted for clarity h n 1 h n r n t 1 β t w t n d n s c e n with d n d n 1 c d s h n h n 1 r n i n c r i n 1 1 c r β t is the return flow from the extraction back to the aquifer note the drainage coefficient c d represents the share of the drainage that is due to the head pressure implied by the difference of the head in year n and year n 1 c r is an inertia term that applies to the recharge of year n 1 the model is calibrated by calibrating the parameters c e n c d c r with observed piezometric and pluviometric data the calibration of the model is further developed in appendix 2 4 3 characterizing uncertainty design of scenarios the future uncertainty is represented by three climatic change and three product price scenarios constructed all nine combinations of climate change and product price scenarios are performed for the simulations 4 3 1 simulation of future climate scenarios to characterise uncertainty relative to climatic change we developed a simplified approach to produce scenarios because the application of downscaling methods was beyond the scope of this research 19 19 boé et al 48 details the various methods available to produce climatic scenarios and propose an application to french river basins a series of climatic years are randomly picked from previous years i e 1970 2007 to build a reference climate scenario for the period 2013 2040 20 20 a first test was realized to see if the distribution of previous years was statistically similar to a normal law or other common probability laws but this was not the case this would have enabled to produce more consistent future climate scenarios that would not replicate exactly the distribution of previous years and that could have been modified on their standard deviation also a longer time period would have probably enabled to fit a probability law a climatic year is characterised by regional infiltration and efficient precipitation these climatic scenarios are used for the runs and transformed as described in the next paragraph for climate change scenarios to build climate change into the climatic scenarios and account for uncertainty three climate change coefficients are determined 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 21 21 boé et al 48 give a decrease of about 3 for spring and 10 for summer precipitation in the loire river basin and 19 evapotranspiration in spring and 13 in summer for the period 2046 2065 both parameter intervene in the infiltration determination similar patterns are provided for the seine river basin ducharne et al 45 estimate for a pessimistic a2 sres scenario a 23 reduction in precipitation of the seine river basin and 37 in the groundwater recharge at the 2100 horizon we do not account for changes in the distribution of precipitations within the year that could affect some crops more than others the climate change coefficient is multiplied by the infiltration from 2020 and above the same coefficient is used to increase the water need per crop x i w due to increased evapotranspiration to represent the effect of the rise in temperature the yield water elasticity i e the impact of water application on yields see economic model remains the same because we lacked information on the potential evolution for this parameter a simple translation of the dose response function is conducted these assumptions imply that the yield might be modified as a function of the constraints on water more water is needed to grow one unit in quantity this set of assumptions simplifies the climate change adaptation of the model particularly in terms of crop growth with implications for quantities costs and revenues however it enables that we can explore effects on the water balance without resorting to a crop growth model the economic impact must be interpreted with care thus these scenarios account for a reduction in infiltration which affects the groundwater balances simulated using the hydrogeological model and crop water requirements we assume that the demands for industrial water use and drinking water remain constant on the basis of past and recent trends the yield data do not account for other climate change effects such as crop growth which may be affected by changes in temperature or carbon dioxide concentration 4 3 2 uncertainty in product prices and expected product prices we determined product price scenarios to account for the uncertainty associated with product prices and expected prices farm product sale prices the reference scenario is constructed by randomly drawing prices from 1980 to 2014 price deviations are set at 0 15 and 0 15 for cereal prices to characterise relative price uncertainty other crop prices are constant this coefficient will be applied to product prices in the reference scenario 5 results the different simulations performed are presented in table 2 two main types of indicators are considered for the analysis i effectiveness indicators which are for instance the piezometric level or the frequency with the piezometric level respect thresholds and ii cost indicators of the policy the model produces a lot of other output values that could have been analysed water use cropping patterns quantities produced but for sake of clarity and to keep the focus on instrument s assessment we stick with these two types of indicators 5 1 analysis of the reference instruments the hydro economic model was used to simulate the dynamic combined evolution of farming and the aquifer state from 2010 to 2040 to analyse the respective role of both instruments i quota and ii taxes shadow values or marginal benefit of water were used to indicate the value of 1 or 1 m3 of water the shadow value indicates if the quota or the tax is constraining as demonstrated in section 2 2 2 according to our results the quota is constraining most of the time in most of the regions this is coherent with the fact that the quota system is a local policy that was designed and adapted for the region unlike the tax which is national and not specifically geared to incentivising beauce farmers this also illustrates that the two instruments complement each other because they are both active the shadow values indicate that the areas where water is valued most i e with high shadow values are montargois and fusain in the east of the region here substitution resources are being considered by the administration and farmers to compensate for water restrictions with a low coefficient often around 0 5 reducing the quota to only 50 of its base level 5 2 impact of climatic change with the reference instrument we then explore the impact of increasing water scarcity due to climate change on the current hydro economic system using the reference instrument and considering price uncertainty current management fails to compensate for climate change as shown by the distribution of the frequency of threshold compliance the frequency of years when the piezometric level is above the 3 different thresholds considering all simulations of climate prices and years between 2014 and 2040 this is lower for the simulations with climate change than for the reference for all the regions see fig 3 the instruments autoregulation capacity seems insufficient to maintain piezometric levels and threshold levels are reached more often with climate change however the effect of climate change does not dramatically change the patterns of threshold level frequencies the results suggest two different patterns of regional sensitivity in terms of the agriculture aquifer system s response to climate change b blesoise b c calc b c sable and b c ss couv are significantly affected by climate change because the water levels reach the highest threshold with about 20 less frequency in contrast montargois and fusain are little affected by climate change as shown here however their threshold levels are not fully respected even without climate change when it comes to conserving the piezometric levels with climate change in all regions the effectiveness of the reference instrument seems limited in montargois and fusain the instrument is already ineffective in the reference situation without climatic change the average cost for farming due to reduced water availability resulting from climate change is limited to 3 of annual net revenues after 2020 years with effect of climate change even though the effects on individual farms should be investigated and would reveal differences the cost induced by climate change on farming seems limited in beauce this can be explained by the fact that irrigated agriculture adapts and the effect on water resources is limited more specifically i the total cultivated area remains stable ii the greater water requirements for growing crops are satisfied by increasing water use per unit of land and decreasing the area with irrigated crops extensive margin adjustment our model does not account for the specific effects of temperature on crop growth therefore these conclusions must be interpreted with care these results both the deterioration of piezometric heads and the low cost for farming may be an incentive to revise the actual policy in the light of climate change 5 3 cost effectiveness of alternative instruments under climate change scenario this paragraph presents and discusses the simulation results of different economic and regulatory instruments presented in section 2 2 3 they are tested for the climatic change scenarios and price uncertainty scenarios results for both types of indicators are presented in table 4 cost for farming is the profit difference between the policy and an open access scenario no regulation social cost is the cost for farming net of water tax revenues or water subsidy expenses the effectiveness is an indicator on a scale of 1 regarding the relative closeness of the piezometric level h n compared to the worst case open access and the best base scenario no irrigation effectiveness is calculated as e h h n o r e g h n o i r r h n o r e g an effectiveness of 1 or 100 means piezometric level are not affected by farming an effectiveness of 0 means there are as affected as in the open access case cost effectiveness is the ratio of the social cost by the effectiveness in ha eff unit the lower the better it could also be called the efficiency the shadow value of water is given to indicate the level of constraint provided by the quota system the different instruments do not provide very contrasted results in terms of piezometric level or effectiveness more differences are observed in terms of cost for farming as well as for social costs as expected there is a relative trade off between piezometric head and agricultural profits when costs for farming increase the piezometric level increase the challenge is to identify and design an instrument with the best trade off e g the lowest cost effectiveness ratio for a given level of environmental performance in theory economic instruments provide better cost effectiveness because they encourage those water savings with the least costs however the overall water savings e g the environmental performance of the instrument are not guaranteed or fixed ex ante 6 reg and flxtxq are most effective resp e 0 62 and e 0 61 but flxtxq is more cost effective than 6 reg 62 2 78 1 right after are flxtax buybck and desirr instruments e 0 58 and 0 59 and flxtax is more cost effective than buybck and desirr instrument 53 8 68 1 73 7 buybck is more cost effective than desirr which is explained because buybck allows farmer to adapt the water application rate per hectare intensive margin rather than suppress irrigation altogether extensive margin both instruments are appealing in comparison to the reference instrument they generate lower costs for farming and improve environmental performance provided public money is spent social cost is higher on average desirr reduces water use by 5 and buybck by 4 compared to the reference instrument the tax instrument no quota is less effective at maintaining piezometric levels 0 45 versus 0 55 than the reference therefore it is not a candidate for improving water management the substi instrument allows farmers to substitute some of their groundwater withdrawals for irrigation with water collected in ponds in the autumn and winter the simulation suggests that water is collected and used for irrigation to substitute groundwater in all regions except in b c sable depending on the year the pond water substitutes or supplements groundwater use to increase overall water use on average this option increases use supplementary use by 5 however from an environmental point of view the substi instrument is of little interest because it is less effective than the reference instrument nonetheless it is slightly cheaper for farming and society 2 ha which explains why farmers are willing to implement this type of solution the 6 reg instrument which consists of introducing a differentiation in the calculation for the coefficient between the three regions b c calc b c sable and b c ss couv only seems effective at maintaining better piezometric levels for b c ss couv it has no impact on the largest region b c calc and has a negative impact reduction of water availability constraints on b c sable thus it seems irrelevant given that it has negligible aggregated impact on effectiveness and shows a positive cost compared to the reference instrument the results of the mean and standard deviation of the shadow value of water for each of the policies indicate the most active mechanisms quota or tax as discussed previously this can be interpreted as the cost of the water resource constraint quota constraint all alternative instruments except the 6reg show a reduced shadow value of water this indicates a lower constraint in terms of the quota system and a relatively high price based incentive notably the flxtxq instrument presents a shadow value of water of 0 033 m3 which is far below the reference cost of the water use constraint 0 117 m3 5 4 regional results table 5 gives the effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of instruments for each region two types of regions can be distinguished in relative terms the three first regions b blesoise b c calc b c sable have a higher potential for improvement and a lower cost effectiveness than the three other regions b c ss couv fusain montargois these patterns are similar accross instruments a positive relationship between cost effectiveness and effectiveness is consistent with intuition and corresponds to increasing marginal cost of environmental efforts however it is interesting to note that in some cases for instance flxtax good effectiveness can also be characterised by relatively low cost effectiveness which is particularly interesting when comparing the effectiveness of alternative instruments with the reference instrument the evolution is similar for all regions positive or negative except for the flxtax instrument the latter improves the piezometric levels for the first four regions and reduces it for fusain and montargois this shows that in fusain and montargois the quota system is necessary to maintain the same effectiveness as in the reference in the other regions a nearly pure price based instrument the flxtax improves both the effectiveness and the cost effectiveness compared to the reference instrument the flxtxq seems a better choice because it improves the effectiveness in all regions albeit at a higher cost the substitution instrument shows that the agricultural response differs according to the region although water use increases by only 5 globally it increases by more than 80 in fusain where the option is also the most controversial in the b c sable this option is not adopted because substitution does not cost less than groundwater or the shadow value of water for irrigation i e the opportunity cost of extra water use 5 5 robustness the concept of robustness offers a different perspective that considers the dimension of uncertainty or any source of variability i e space time years price and climate scenarios which integrate climate change assumptions these aspects are ignored in a deterministic setting which aggregates different results into a mean as presented in previous sections robustness is particularly relevant for the environmental indicator piezometric level because groundwater flows into surface watercourses the cause and effect is discontinuous for example below a certain groundwater level there is a very strong impact with regard to the impacts on farming costs robustness could also be useful in terms of agricultural sustainability one dry season can put a farmer out of business although this is not the case in beauce table 6 presents the selected instruments with the robustness minmaxregret algorithm according effectiveness and cost effectiveness optimality results from the previous section are reported for comparision to produce unique combined criteria we combine the ranking for both indicators for effectiveness the results show that the flxtxq is more robust than the 6 reg instrument while 6 reg is more optimal than flxtxq e 0 62 vs 0 61 this result indicates that 6 reg generates lower piezometric levels than flxtxq although it produces slightly better outcomes on average the reg 6 seems not to be robust in terms of effectiveness therefore we can discard this option despite the fact that it appeared optimal the tax instrument is the most cost effective considering both optimality and robustness the combination of both indicators provides similar results for the first best the flxtxq is preferred with both criteria considering robustness has little effect on the results of cost effectiveness however robustness might be achieved at a higher cost than optimality here adopting the flxtxq instrument versus the 6 reg instrument induces benefits in terms of social costs tax revenues mask the extra farming costs 10 ha while farming cost increase by 33 ha see table 3 when spatial variability differences between regions 22 22 the spatial robustness enables to select instruments that do not induce extreme negative outcomes in one region compared to the best region and thus induce relative homogeneous outcomes among regions is considered in the robustness analysis the results remain the same 6 conclusion the main local instrument in beauce which is a flexible quota system is highly original as far as we know it is unique it has the advantage of introducing flexibility in an instrument with a rigid design it is coupled with an economic instrument a low tax on water use which is not a local policy instrument but a european water policy instrument although the incentive is very modest it is sometimes acting on behaviour the flexibility limits the cost for farming while ensuring that certain environmental objectives are achieved interestingly the flexible quota system addresses the problem of the over allocation of water entitlements instead of reducing water rights definitively the rights are revised each year depending on the level of the aquifer under french law water entitlements are not rights but annual authorisations that are systematically renewed each year however the difficulty of reducing historical reference authorizations is particularly critical the recent change to a single collective management body which will be in charge of controlling the total annual volumes for abstraction in a region illustrates another strategy the aim is to avoid a top down decision imposed by the administration on the farmer to reduce individual water abstraction volumes in this system the single management body which is not governmental will monitor compliance with the total water allocation by managing individual water allocation however this reference instrument does not seem to be sufficiently effective to achieve good environmental performance this statement is particularly pertinent in the light of climate change forecasts given the likely reduction in rainfall and recharge as well as the increase in evapotranspiration the simulations described in this paper show that increasing the economic incentives with a flexible tax on water use that varies with the state of the groundwater seems both effective and cost effective it also appears to be robust in a context of climate and price uncertainties flxtxq which maintains the reference flexible quota system the combination of both quantitative based and price based instruments seems particularly pertinent in beauce where the state of the aquifer allows for the withdrawal of different volumes of water depending on the years the quota ensures a minimum fixed constraint that is independent from the water demand variation linked to price variations the tax introduces flexibility by cutting the demand for farms where the marginal net benefit of water use is less than the tax this varies with price acceptability may also be higher than with a single instrument that would imply a more constraining quota or tax in addition the robust flexible quota and tax policy could easily be implemented because of the existing sophisticated administrative framework for adapting and enforcing annual quotas and tax levies tax payment procedures information on annual coefficient etc with the shift towards a regional quota rather than an individual quota the increase in use of price based instruments such as the flexible tax could help identify and allocate cheaper water savings it is an alternative to negotiations that aim to reallocate the regional quota to individuals with very high transaction costs introducing flexibility in terms of the volume of water allocated quantitative or the tax level is a cost effective feature in basins where the intra annual variability of available resources is significant it is a way to reduce the cost that differs from a fixed tax or quota it should also satisfy water resource constraints in dry years this new system based on two instrument could be justified in the tinbergen rule logic of one instrument per policy objective by i authorizing total yearly water use according the amount that can be sustainably handled by water resources quota constraint and ii reallocating water use where water is most valued to maximize social benefits in time in terms of sequencing the introduction of instruments in time it might be smarter to first reinforce the quota which is by far more constraining today than the tax and then to introduce the flexible tax to reallocate extra water savings although our modelling results are obviously case specific the analysis of the mechanisms discussed in this paper has broader application that we develop in the two following paragraphs the two instruments we analyse for the reference policy have been designed for i safeguarding piezometric levels quota instrument and ii contributing financially for a potential harm to the environment tax while acting as an incentive to limit water use we show that the tax is rarely active as an incentive table 3 no change in behaviour is observed and can question the interest of the current european wfd withdrawal water tax because it is not locally adapted and have little chance to act as an incentive as such it could be smarter to present it only as an individual contribution to a collective financial effort to manage water bodies rather than arguing that it acts as an incentive without having tested the efficiency depending on marginal water value which is very variable throughout europe s farming systems or to upgrade it s design in order to guarantee its incentive characteristic even though our results show little effect of the reference tax on the water use and environmental performance they show that the most robust policy among the options considered is a combination of a flexible tax and a flexible quota the flexible tax has been redesigned from the initial tax to be constraining and reflect the need for water savings according the state of the water bodies this result encourages the adaptation of economic instruments to the regional hydrological and economic specificities in europe if the tax should have an incentive role of reallocation induce less use where water is less valuable and reallocate it when or where it s more valuable the tax should be properly and locally adapted according economic specificities to be effective from a methodological point of view the hydro economic model we developed is an interesting approach for exploring a variety of management alternatives and policies relating to the hydrogeological and agricultural economic system the proposed approach is particularly relevant because it suits all types of policy exercises and provides detailed insights into agricultural economics shadow values of water make it possible to interpret the agricultural response in terms of alternative water resources our model is a good trade off between detailed modelling and calibration on the one hand and implementation and data requirements on the other hand the perfectly calibrated econom ic model produces detailed adaptation margins including deficit irrigation adjusting the water application rate however modelling on a regional scale does not take account of individual specificities or analysis for instance the problem of dead volumes over allocation cannot be analysed at farm scale with our model the simplified hydrogeological approach is satisfactory from a calibration point of view because it replicates the observed years correctly the main advantage is that it provides a unique platform to accommodate a variety of simulations in addition it is calibrated accurately to represent realistic hydrogeological and economic processes a robustness criterion is used to account for and avoid unsatisfactory outcomes in the face of uncertainty the criterion is developed for three dimensions time and space variability regional and climate uncertainty robustness affects the results which suggests that it should be taken into account in future modelling the perspective of this work includes an improved representation of other non agricultural water requirements including ecological water demands and their benefits further analysis could focus on integrating uncertainty with regard to the evolution of agricultural policy and input prices this would be helpful for the development of adapted and robust or flexible policy changes

scenario modelling i would also like to thank the two reviewers and the editors as well as i olivier who proofread the english language of the manuscript appendix 1 crisis management in beauce since 1995 the first quantitative groundwater management instrument to be applied in beauce involved temporary water use restrictions in summer when surface river flows were below threshold levels when the first aquifer threshold level is reached alert farmers must stop irrigating for 24 h or 48 h per week when a second threshold is reached crisis all non essential water uses including agricultural irrigation must stop these constraints apply to all farmers in beauce the crisis management measures act as a safety net if the planning policy has failed to avoid a crisis situation extra measures are taken to reduce the impact of the drought on ecosystems and priority uses the more restrictive the planning policy is the more costly it is for farming and the more efficient from an environmental protection point of view the restriction is imposed with no warning per se when there is no rain and when crops and rivers need water the economic impacts of restrictions can be seen as the damage cost of drought they necessarily cost more for the farmers than adapting cropping and irrigation in advance the farmer s capacity to adapt is limited once crops have been sown sunk costs on the other hand greater caution and stronger restrictions reducing the quota or increasing tax represent a high cost for farmers and the environmental benefits are limited greater restrictions involve negotiations with the farming sector and high transaction costs which should also be considered according to experts a 24 or 48 h irrigation ban on abstraction has a limited impact on the aquifer most farmers find ways to organise irrigation and labour at least cost to continue supplying the same quantity of water to their crops however discrepancies emerged with regard to the impact of the restriction which call for a detailed field analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper the temporary restriction measures in beauce are less restrictive than elsewhere the alert level imposes a 50 reduction on abstraction for non essential uses the temporary restriction also imposes restrictions on other users restrictions are imposed on citizens for non essential water uses such as watering gardens filling pools or cleaning cars the alert level simply bans water use for several hours per day therefore the impacts are negligible because it is easy to postpone water use until later the same day e g watering the garden etc even if it causes some inconvenience appendix 2 data and calibration the economic and hydrogeological models were calibrated for the six regions hydrogeological model calibration the calibration phase aims to calibrate the following model parameters storage coefficient c e n the drainage coefficient c d and the recharge coefficient c r it also serves to initialize the drainage value d 0 the hydrogeological calibration programme consists in minimizing the distance between each year and each zones estimated piezometric level h n as specified in our model and the observed piezometric level using non linear least squares the program is solved in gams with a non linear solver the calibration performs well as the observed and modeled piezometric levels for all regions are close except for region montargois see appendix 3 for the graphs that compares observed and modeled years the nash sutcliff index 38 is 0 931 0 977 0 981 0 965 0 939 0 675 respectively for the 6 regions and 0 951 for the whole model a perfect fitted calibration would give an index of 1 data for hydrogeological model calibration piezometric heads withdrawals and recharge are observed for the calibration period 1997 to 2009 at a yearly time step piezometric heads piezometric heads groundwater monitoring data for the reference piezometers of each of the hydrogeological sectors are collected from the national database for groundwater ades www ades eaufrance fr we assume that the piezometric heads of the reference piezometers are representative of each zone they have been chosen as reference piezometers by the administration to monitor the state of the groundwater and impose groundwater abstraction restrictions to the corresponding areas as a function of the piezometric head 39 withdrawals a water withdrawal database has been set up from data produced by water agencies on the basis of the taxes recovered for water uses for the years 1998 2009 thus we were able to compile water withdrawal per type of user water utilities for drinking water distribution industries and farming per area per type of resource and per year it should be possible to generate a good approximation of the total volume of water abstracted from the aquifer since farmers have to declare their withdrawals and pay the corresponding tax however there is a minimum volume 7000 m3 below which farmers do not have to declare their water use 23 23 note that this volume correspond to less than about 4 ha of irrigated corn or about 10 ha of irrigated wheat we assume that most withdrawals are declared for the tax and recorded in the database in order to correct the data we added 10 of the volume of the observed agricultural use to account for missing data for water utilities and industry we assume that all volumes are declared infiltration infiltration is calculated for each year and aquifer zone the limestone aquifer is characterised by high infiltration rates while sandstones and clays show more surface runoff the infiltration or recharge is calculated from two values the effective rainfall and a geomorphological index idpr effective rainfall is the rainfall that is available for runoff or infiltration it is calculated from meteorological data météofrance available at a grid size of 8 km 8 km the index idpr represents the characteristic of a soil with respect to infiltration and runoff the estimation of this index is detailed in schomburgk et al 40 the return flow b e t a t are set to zero in the case of the beauce aquifer because no return flows to groundwater from irrigation or sewage are considered significant the fact that irrigation water is largely used by crops sprinkler technology has a good water use effectiveness close to 80 and the geological formation of the aquifer support this assumption economic model calibration the model is calibrated on observed cropping patterns for 2009 taken as the reference situation see tables below sources of data are the french farm payment agency for cropping patterns and ministère de l agriculture et de l agroalimentaire 41 for crop yields and land rents we use reference irrigation levels conditional on soil type from morardet and hanot 36 and update them using more recent information by bouarfa et al 37 expected prices of outputs for the year 2009 are calculated

coefficient was 0 59 in 2009 the climate of 2009 had a wet spring but a dry summer however likely evolution might strengthen these constraints with a coefficient up to 0 2 37 the interest of having an already constraining reference but not an extreme one is that the simulations keep the model within a reasonable range that guaranty model validity the total agricultural area modeled is 593 000 ha

8699,agricultural water management is becoming a critical issue in many parts of the world and cost effective water policies are required to control water use we examine the case study of irrigated agriculture in beauce france 9750 km2 europe s largest cereal producing region we explore the mechanisms for water abstraction control involving a combination of regulatory and economic instruments the analysis is conducted with a hydro economic model that includes a calibrated economic model and a semi distributed calibrated hydrogeological model first we analyse the system currently used to manage groundwater abstraction it includes a flexible quota system revised annually as a function of the state of the groundwater combined with a tax this dual system performs better than a single instrument because of regional hydrogeological and economic specificities as well as the fact that it limits costs for farming we then investigate the impact of alternative combinations of instruments our findings show that the most cost effective and robust way to improve the groundwater state is to increase the economic component a flexible tax in association with a flexible quota system keywords beauce irrigation water scarcity robustness hydro economic modelling climate change 1 introduction with increasing environmental constraints and rising water demands managing water allocation has become a critical issue in many parts of the world in the farming sector demand for irrigation is significant and growing 1 the sector is also affected by greater regulatory and climatic constraints related problems include the over allocation of water for agricultural purposes with respect to resource capacity 2 in this context both institutions and individuals are developing coping strategies thus there is clearly a need for instruments that are capable of meeting environmental performance targets and limiting the cost of diminishing water availability these instruments should take into account adaptation of farmers as well as variability and uncertainty of water resources supply capacity and demand the policy debate about the best combination of instruments is central to the majority of environmental problems and is characterised by the control of negative externalities or the provision of public goods essentially two types of instruments can be adopted by policy makers the first type is geared to quantitative control such as norms or quotas which limit input use or output emissions the second type includes price based or economic instruments such as taxes on inputs or outputs as well as subsidies intended to encourage the adoption of good practices and technologies economic instruments are expected to affect input use by increasing or decreasing the cost for the producer or consumer thus they provide an incentive in terms of the cost effective allocation of scarce resources however this may fail to change farmer behaviour if the cost of change which is not only monetary exceeds the benefit of change because ultimately the economic and technical choice of adaptation depends on the farmer 3 chap 1 rey et al 4 review the implementation of economic instruments throughout europe a variety of economic instruments can be considered as discussed by koundouri 5 for example trading quotas markets revising cap or tax levels buybacks 6 or combining instruments other type of instruments such as voluntary based mechanisms also exist from a purely theoretical point of view these two main types of instruments are equivalent weitzman 1974 however information asymmetries uncertainties about processes water demand and rationality are just some of the factors that undermine this equivalency 1 1 weitzman 1974 discusses this economic issue in detail economic instruments such as taxes also have the so called double dividend advantage they generate public revenues that can be used to improve water management 2 2 this not the case with a market where the value is captured by private agents in addition to incentivising behaviour however often they also imply high transaction costs although economic and regulatory instruments are often opposed they can be more effective and cost effective when used in combination in this study we explore how such a combination can cope with variability and uncertainty in terms of water supply and demand the tinbergen rule 3 3 tinbergen 44 was awarded the first nobel prize in economics for his work on economic policy his work dealt with policy arrangements that are dynamically efficient states that each policy objective requires a specific instrument to have an effective policy mix young 7 develops this rule for agricultural water management and for the design of efficient administrative settings of water use and allocation he suggests among other rules to unbundle policy objectives e g to distinguish historic permanent entitlements and yearly daily allocations of water this paper examines water abstraction control mechanisms and the robustness of original combinations of instruments in beauce in a reference scenario and for future scenarios of climate change and price uncertainty beauce is located in the central region of france it is the main cereal producing region in europe 8 farmers irrigate a significant share of the cropping area given the sensitivity of the water resource water policies have been adopted to control withdrawals for more than 20 years in order to avoid drought in connected surface watercourses 9 a flexible quota is revised annually depending on the groundwater level in four regions in beauce thus farmers face varying constraints from year to year this quota is combined with a tax on water abstraction from the wfd the quota has been designed locally to safeguard piezometric levels the tax has not been designed locally as it has been introduced with the wfd and the french water law the rationale is both to have farmers contributing financially for their potential harm on the environment and to act as an incentive to save water as mentioned above with the double dividend advantage the analysis of the control mechanisms for water withdrawal is supported by a theoretical analysis and a calibrated hydro economic model hem that represents farming behaviour and connected groundwater resources this original contribution to the literature showcases beauce s unique control mechanism for groundwater abstraction it provides an economic analysis and explores the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative combinations of instruments to increase environmental compliance and limit social cost several alternatives are considered i economic instruments such as flexible taxes that depend on the yearly state of groundwater resources and higher taxes and subsidies to reduce water use buy backs and premiums to reduce irrigation ii alternative regulatory measures such as increased restrictions and spatial disaggregation in terms of piezometric head monitoring and restriction and iii a supply side option involving groundwater substitution we also test the robustness of alternative combinations of instruments in relation to their capacity to cope with uncertainty and avoid undesirable outcomes a pragmatic approach is required to explore the cost and effect of policies for improving the management of water resources and to analyse the observed water allocation and behaviour hydro economic models are a vast ensemble of models characterised by at least one representation of economic processes production and or consumption and hydro geo logical processes see e g harou et al 10 the principle of hydro economic models is to connect these different compartments the models represent the real world rules and processes of case studies which link the parameters within the hydro economic system under study the economics and biophysics of water resource dynamics can be considered together when the cost of the resource and the regulation i e water rights or water restrictions are dependent on the state of water resources and when water uptake by economic agents impacts the water resources it is important to consider specific economic processes such as farming s adaptation to changing constraints and institutional adaptation to regulate access to water in response to the impact of climate change or global change in order to ensure that the resulting economic and hydrologic balances are not distorted assessing the impact of climate change on water resources already presents a scientific challenge even when economic factors are not considered 11 12 however the impact may be over or underestimated if we fail to account of the increase in crop water requirements that are not satisfied because of regulations or the farming sector s capacity to adapt 4 4 e g ducharne et al 45 do not consider these adaptations and might overestimate the increase in withdrawals from farming the rest of this paper is organised as follows after this introduction the second section presents groundwater management and policies in beauce the third explains the background to hydro economic modelling and robustness the fourth describes the hydro economic model the fifth presents the simulation results of the reference situation and alternative instruments with climate change scenarios 2 groundwater management and policies in beauce france 2 1 farming and irrigation in beauce beauce is europe s main cereal producer it is one of the most irrigated farming regions in france and covers about 650 000 ha fig 1 shows its location as well as the irrigated and non irrigated areas since the 1970s irrigation has developed substantially to cope with dry years secure high yields and enable the diversification of crop production particularly crops grown under contract for the agro food industry depending on the year between 120 000 and 240 000 ha are now irrigated using pivot and hose reel irrigation systems between 150 and 450 million m3 per year farmers have access to the water resource with individual wells irrigation essentially relies on a large groundwater resource namely the beauce aquifer which is located under the seine and loire surface water basins it is a multi layered aquifer with sands chalk and limestone that covers 9 700 km2 the beauce aquifer once called the château d eau water tower of france is used for irrigation drinking water and industry industrial abstrations are around 40 millions m3 and drinking water uses some 70 millions m3 per year it also feeds natural surface water systems thereby providing important ecosystem services wetlands biodiversity this aquifer system is subject to quantitative problems as evidenced by the lowering of the water table since the beginning of the 1990s and the reduced flows drought on connected surface rivers 2 2 water policy in beauce since the 1990s the government has implemented local water policy measures and instruments in consultation with agricultural representatives to deal with surface and groundwater issues relating to drought in 1994 the volumetric management of withdrawals started with the obligation to install meters at individual wells in 1997 and 1998 a stakeholder group was set up and a series of studies including modelling approaches was launched to support the policy process the overarching framework is now the french water law which is the translation of the european water framework directive wfd the beauce aquifer has been classified as a zone de répartition des eaux a water distribution zone this is an important instrument applied by the french water law in order to comply with the wfd and ensure that bodies of water achieve a good status this classification states that all withdrawals must be submitted for prior governmental authorisation the perimeter of the local water management plan sage 5 5 in france the sage schema d amenagement de gestion des eaux water management plan is the local basin scale governance instrument developed in territories with water management problems was determined in 1999 and adopted in consultation with stakeholders in 2013 the objectives of the sage are to determine the principles means and goals required to reach a balance for water use which guarantees water security for all and safeguards or restores the good state of natural ecosystems since 2017 the control of water withdrawals has been delegated to a single collective management body which ensures that the total volume of water withdrawal does not exceed the yearly authorisation level this replaces the system where farmers were individually required to declare and respect their volumes to the authorities the question of the global quota allocation is central to this new governance framework in beauce two types of water policy instruments are used in quantitative water management i planning instruments which aim to balance uses with the capacity of the resource to avoid crisis management details are given in the following paragraph and ii crisis instruments which aim to limit the impact of a drought surface river flow below threshold levels details of crisis management in beauce are provided in appendix 1 while this issue is beyond the scope of this paper it is interesting to complement our understanding of beauce s water governance 2 2 1 water demand control and planning in beauce the existing planning policy is a combination of regulatory and economic instruments the regulatory instrument is a flexible quota and the economic instrument is a water tax a technical measure was also implemented involving the removal of a series of wells 6 6 new wells have been constructed to replace the old ones because pumping in wells located near the stream directly affected the flow rate of a few small and highly sensitive watercourses the following two paragraphs provide details of the flexible quota and the water tax in 1997 a volume based quota system was introduced each year a coefficient reflecting the state of the groundwater at the beginning of the cropping season is defined by the administration the quota is updated every year at the beginning of the season by multiplying the reference quota by the yearly coefficient to determine the volume that can be withdrawn each year since 2009 individual coefficients have also been calculated for four hydrogeological units sub sectors of the beauce aquifer that display differing hydrodynamic properties the reference quota i e when coefficients are 1 is 420 million m3 two thresholds h1 and h2 determine the coefficient appendix 4 shows the yearly coefficient according to the piezometric level for the beauce centrale region h3 is the highest alert threshold so far the values for the coefficient vary between 0 4 and 1 depending on the year and the region the government publishes the yearly water availability coefficient around the 1the government publishes the yearly water of april during the year a website informs farmers about changes in groundwater levels which means they can anticipate the level of the coefficient before the official statement is released another characteristic of the quota system is that there are no restrictions on the dynamics of water use in other words water may be used partially or totally on spring or summer crops thus farmers must plan cropping and irrigation patterns jointly at the beginning of the growing season despite the uncertainty regarding spring and summer weather conditions to comply with the wfd water pays water principle a water tax is collected in france from all farmers that abstract more than 1000 m3 the amount is fixed in relation to the basin and the user type the reference tax level is t a x r e f 0 014 m3 for farmers in beauce although the effect of this instrument will be analysed in this paper one should keep in mind that it has not been locally adapted to act on behaviour as an incentive the tax is designed in its principles at national level with a policy objective of preventing or reparing damages caused to the environment by collecting public revenue and acting as an incentive for water use to avoid misuse the amount can be adapted if the water body is in a zone de répartition des eaux i e if the water body is with quantitative problems but it has not been and is never to the extend of our knowledge adapted to local economic conditions to ensure it acts as an incentive 7 7 see https programme eau climat eau seine normandie fr les redevances taux et modes de calcul and https aides redevances eau loire bretagne fr home redevances agriculture html 2 2 2 analysis of the interest of the actual instruments in beauce the originality of the beauce quota system is that it varies depending on the state of the groundwater this is useful because it significantly reduces the cost for farming compared to a fixed quota system a fixed quota based on dry years would limit water use above the necessary level and induce significant costs in relatively wet years a fixed quota based on average or wet years would not provide the same environmental benefits and would not comply with the wfd the flexible quota and the tax on water withdrawals are both active instruments that must be respected however only one of the two actually restricts the water demand in a given situation depending on the circumstances either the quota system or the tax may determine farmer s behaviour and affect total water demand this is illustrated in fig 2 which shows water demand curves and the variability of the quota constraint for two different situations i the first corresponds to a case where the quota is a limiting factor and the shadow value of water λ w a t e r is positive ii in the second case the tax and total cost of water are limiting factors the shadow value of water is 0 and the quota does not limit behaviour in beauce both situations occur they can be observed in different regions within the same year in the case of a specific region their occurrence depends on the year and the water demand parameters input and output prices as well as the biophysical parameters of water production therefore the variability depends on i water demand and ii quota level consequently given the regional hydrogeological and economic characteristics the use of both instruments improves environmental performance more than in the case with a single instrument it is also worth mentioning that even when the tax is not constraining water use and quota is which is often the case in beauce the revenue collected by the government is allocated to implement other water management measures the quota system relies on individual historical quotas the sum of which should correspond to the total volume of water that can be abstracted per year in a given situation based on a reference or normal situation however this is not the case because so called dead volumes corresponding to a share of the volumes of some quotas are never authorised this is a problem of over allocation the flexible quota system makes it possible to impose a reduction coefficient every year and thus manage over allocation however individual discrepancies cannot be managed with this instrument indeed this would require resetting initial entitlements to align them with the total sustainable abstraction volume and not historical practices 2 2 3 developing innovative instruments although the current management scheme has been recognised as a step towards sustainable management it has failed to overcome drought related problems during the summer alert levels are reached for surface water this might be accentuated by climate change as suggested by our modelling results see results section we developed and tested alternative instruments to examine effectiveness and cost effectiveness for climate change scenarios they are described below an overview of the combination of instruments is given in table 1 baseline with 6 different regions 6 reg 6 reg on the basis of the zoning of the hydrogeological model which relies on hydrodynamic properties we tested the baseline scenario by dividing the beauce centrale into three sub areas to see whether deciphering the coefficient and corresponding water withdrawal rights would improve the level of piezometric heads and at what cost for farmers the advantage of breaking down the spatial policy level is to get closer to a tailored or first best policy after a preliminary evaluation the instrument seemed unsatisfactory in terms of environmental performance we then introduced an alternative option for the instrument 6 reg by reinforcing the quota calculation function this involved associating a new coefficient to threshold levels 0 2 and 0 05 to s2 and s3 respectively appendix 4 gives the relation between coefficient and piezometric level water fee based on the piezometric level flxtax to increase the environmental efficiency of the tax mechanism we indexed the tax rate to the piezometric level the aim is to indicate the relative scarcity of the resource through a price signal to reduce water demand in critical years the tax is calculated as follows t a x f l x 2 t a x r e f 1 h h i g h r e f h n with h n h n h n 1 h n 2 3 this means that the current tax rate would be doubled and multiplied by the difference between a mean observed piezometric level and a high water reference piezometer level 2001 is taken as a high water reference if the water level is x meter below the reference level the tax would be increased of respectively x 100 this tax can be charaterized as an ambiant tax 13 given that the same tax is levied on all farmers in the same aquifer area regardless of their individual water use the tax is combined with a fixed quota system coefficient 1 which is less restrictive than the reference water tax based on the piezometric level combined with the quota system flxtxq this instrument combines the previous flexible tax system flxtax and the reference flexible quota system groundwater resource substitution substi one option discussed by the administration is to develop substitute water resources to compensate for the reduction in groundwater availability in the eastern part of the region montargois and fusain the substitute water resource would be derived from water collected from the farm drainage system and additional surface water is pumped into artificial ponds in the wet season this solution has a further benefit because it limits the nitrate contamination of water drainage water is collected in reservoirs and reused for irrigation instead of flowing into the ecosystem this does not negatively affect the infiltration in the aquifer because the pond recharge occurs in the wet season when the groundwater flows into surface river systems the investment costs are estimated to be around 5 m3 with a 30 year depreciation period and a discount rate of 2 5 the cost amounts to 0 24 m3 quota buybacks buybck similarly to the premium to reduce irrigation the idea of buy back is to pay farmers for all the cubic metres they give up compared to a reference situation ideally without buy backs in return for a uniform payment in france this system does not exist as far as we know however it has been applied in spain 14 it is a more effective policy than the premium to reduce irrigation the latter does not take into account water application rates per hectare which are a determining factor when it comes to reducing irrigation the farmer may choose to sell their water right by comparing the subsidy payment and the estimated marginal value of water a buy back scheme is effective if the level of payment equals the shadow value of water in our experiment the buy back premium was set at 0 20 m3 for the experiment this incentive should affect the intensive margin adjustment and bring about a shift from highly irrigated crops to less irrigated crops desirrigation premium desirri paying farmers to abandon irrigation is already envisaged in france through the desirrigation premium as part of the agro environmental measures cap 8 8 the european common agricultural policy pillar ii the premium was fixed to 250 ha and is payed to farmers who prove that they have reduced their irrigated area compared to a reference situation this incentive should affect the extensive margin bringing about a shift from irrigated areas to non irrigated areas 3 hydro economic model and robustness analysis 3 1 current approaches in hydro economic modelling the growing concern about the need to coordinate economic and environmental policies calls for a global understanding of the interaction between socio economics and the biophysical functionning of water resources and related ecosystems hydro economic modelling is a pragmatic response to the need to represent the biophysical and economic system as a whole the aim of developing this type of model is to understand the impact of climate change or other global change scenarios and to simulate alternative management schemes in areas where there is conflict over water or when water causes damage such as floods 15 hydro economic models are often developed at the scale of water resources to account for local economic institutional and biophysical characteristics however some hem exist at larger global scales such as alcamo floerke and maerker 16 hydro economic models have developed over the last 10 20 years examples can be found all over the world as quoted by varela ortega et al 17 several authors have reviewed empirical hydro economic models harou et al 10 brouwer and hofkes 18 the first type can be qualified as analytical models typically they are non calibrated and adopt a social planner perspective they are rarely defined as hydro economic models sometimes they are called dynamic or optimal control models here the central question is the optimal control of temporal groundwater allocation of water from a social point of view even if this optimum is far from the private optimum that might be closer to the real observed allocation which might be closer to the genuine allocation observed some examples are provided by burt 19 rubio and casino 20 koundouri 21 koundouri and christou 22 a second type includes models with a more empirical approach to hydro economic modelling they are designed to represent real world processes without considering whether long term water use is optimal from a social planners perspective this is the approach used in the present study these models can be used to test the effect of agricultural water pricing 23 the selection of climate change adaptation measures 24 or to calculate the economic value of water or the costs of water scarcity 25 another distinction can be made between models that are spatially explicit e g farm scale grid model covering several km and those that model regions semi distributed models the first requires important computational means because data flow has to be managed between different models through coupling e g bulatewicz et al 26 mulligan et al 27 however they provide spatially explicit information that can be useful to analyse policies and distributional effects on both resources and economics good quality economic or hydrological data is rarely available at a spatially explicit level alternatively in the case of regional modelling good quality data is usually available standard or historical databases but at a reduced spatially explicit level in addition regional modelling allows for the development of holistic models which integrate both the economic and hydrological representations of processes on the same platform this is helpful for supporting large simulation sets to explore uncertainties such as those related to climate change 3 2 robust decision making rdm rdm is an analytical framework that takes account of the profound uncertainties affecting decision making 28 it was initially developed by the rand corporation to focus on the question of long term planning and sustainability it relies on an iterative framework which connects decision makers with a modelling capacity capable of simulating the effect of uncertainty on performance indicators unlike research for optimality it internalises the uncertainty of some unknown parameters in the selection criteria this is a different approach to classical optimality criteria which produces a single outcome for a defined set of input parameters these approaches are useful for identifying decisions that hedge against uncertainty lempert et al 29 and hallegatte 30 are central references that develop the rdm analytical framework the optimality approach explores uncertainty effects with a sensitivity analysis and thus may provide different results in relation to the central problem it differs from rdm criteria which provide a single outcome for several uncertainty scenarios with rdm a rdm algorithm has to be described to express the selection criteria indicators must be calculated for individual results scenario x instrument to facilitate the interpretation of a matrix of results this differs from a one dimensional comparison used in a deterministic approach which is easy to interpret selection of the option that yields the maximum or minimum as a function of the selection criteria the matrix becomes multi dimensional if several criteria are considered multiple criteria the challenge for rdm is to combine the information provided by multiple scenarios of uncertainty for each of the programmes indeed the results ranking of instruments from the best to the worst according to a given indicator may vary depending on the scenario as we have seen previously a robust instrument is one that avoids critical cases and secures minimum satisfaction in all cases several robust decision making criteria could be envisaged the minimum maximum regret is a good candidate as it minimises the risk of significant regret and is in line with the concept of robustness other criteria such as the minmax selection of the best worst case option which is more conservative could have been considered the advantage of the minmaxregret criteria is that they do not require any extra information and can be considered as a starting point in robustness analysis 31 the regret is the distance between the indicator for an instrument and the best indicator in a given scenario i e there are as many regrets as there are scenarios x instruments for each instrument the maximum regret can be calculated for all scenarios the instrument that provides the minimum maximum regret for all scenarios is chosen with these criteria thus the options can be ranked from least robust to most robust 4 the beauce hydro economic model we develop a hydro economic model of agriculture and groundwater in beauce it is composed of six independent regional models the main advantage which justifies the choice of a holistic hydro economic model instead of a compartment model is that it facilitates the exchange of input and output parameters between models in our case this means we can conduct a multiple year simulation as well as numerous policy or scenario simulations three main dynamic connections between the economic and hydrogeological models are represented in our model i irrigation water withdrawal influences the piezometric head of the aquifer ii the yearly regulatory withdrawal constraints depend on the piezometric head level iii the cost of water for farmers is a function of the depth of the aquifer the latter can be considered a partially internalized externality the more water farmers pump the deeper the piezometer level and the higher the cost of supplying water the model has a yearly time scale a hydrological year starts on the 1st of april of each year this is assumed to be the date when piezometric levels are observed in order to determine the yearly coefficient 9 9 in reality this date is variable but it is always in march or april the sustainability of the hydrogeological system is ensured when the hydrogeological balance keeps the piezometric levels above a specific threshold we build a dynamic recursive model the optimization of the economic maximisation function is conducted on a yearly basis n but it includes constraints based on the piezometric head level in year n 1 it corresponds to a multi period simulation without inter temporal optimization 10 10 inter temporal optimization is a multi time period optimization this can be useful for two main settings the first is the farmers decision with regard to growing perennial crops e g balali et al 23 connor et al 46 the second is the social planner s perspective which maximises over a long time period here we assume that farmers are myopic and do not account for the input allocation in years to come because they grow annual field crops in the simulation the yearly withdrawal coefficients are first calculated according to the piecewise linear functions determined for the region which give the coefficient as a function of the piezometric level h n see appendix 4 then the economic model represents farmers behaviour in terms of choice of cropping patterns and water allocation at the beginning of the agricultural season in relation to the yearly water availability it is important to note that some crops have to be sown before the farmers know exactly what the yearly coefficient will be on the basis of expert advice we assume that the cropping pattern will not be changed re optimised after the 1st of april 11 11 the farmer already has an idea of the order of magnitude of the yearly coefficient before the official announcement because information is available on an internet site then the weather conditions that occur in late spring and summer are randomly and independently drawn from past records and classified as dry medium and wet these determine the aquifer recharge the real water application on crops and the resulting withdrawals we assume that there is no difference between the abstracted volume and applied volume of water because of individual access and equipment the hydrogeological model simulates the piezometric head level h n 1 for the following year n 1 and natural drainage 4 1 the economic model the economic model represents the farming sector s behaviour in terms of yearly cropping and input land and water allocation at regional level six regions are considered 12 12 the beauce regions are sufficiently homogenous to consider that modelling a whole region as a unique farmer is acceptable detailed arguments are given in graveline and mérel 34 it is a programming model of agricultural supply based on the principles of positive mathematical programming pmp 32 with decreasing marginal yields at the crop level and constant elasticity of substitution ces between land and water for irrigated crops as refined by mérel simon and yi 33 it is calibrated in order to perfectly replicate the observed reference and the accounting profits the model is taken from graveline and mérel 34 13 13 this calibration is referred to as the profit rule in graveline and mérel 34 we choose this calibration because we believe the profit calibration rule to be more likely to be accepted by decision makers as they might be interested in the evolution and replication of profits our economic model has the advantage of representing three potential adaptation margins of farming as broken down by mérel et al 35 and described in graveline and mérel 34 these are the super extensive margin the extensive and the intensive which are respectively the shift from irrigated crop to rain fed crop the shift from an intensive to a less water intensive crop and the reduction of the applied water quantity for a given crop and land unit agronomic data from morardet and hanot 36 on yield response to water is used to calibrate the model see graveline and mérel 34 for more information on the calibration of the yield response elasticity in the short term intensive adjustments often called deficit irrigation 14 14 we do not refer to the distribution strategy of water application along the cropping season as we do not have these variables in our model we only refer to the reduction of water application per hectare and per crop are very likely to occur because they do not involve structural change they are simply an adaptation of the input application level the reference allocation we replicate is a vector q i x i l x i w η i y i w λ l λ w of activity outputs q i acreages x i l water uses x i w own price supply elasticities η i yield response elasticities to water y i w and rents for scarce resources land and water λ l λ w l stands for land and w stands for water i stands

revenue p i q i the per cubic meter water cost c w is composed of the water tax and the cost of the energy needed to pump the water thus it is a function of the piezometric level of the aquifer h n

the unit energy cost electricity here g the acceleration of gravity l h n the total head loss and η p u m p the efficiency of the pump with the given parameters the margin d c w d h n equals 0 98 1000 m3 which means the cost of water increases by about 1 for 1000 m3 for every meter decrease in piezometric level this appears negligible compared to a reference total cost of water of about 16 16 depending on piezometric level here it is calculated for h 110 m 59 1000 m3 or 0 001 compared to a total 0 059 m3 cost the calibration parameter and data cropping patterns yields prices are given in appendix 2 for more information on the economic model the reader can refer to graveline and mérel 34 in simulation the economic model runs each year given the available water b w sum of the quotas multiplied by the yearly coefficient and water costs c w calculated according the piezometric head h n of the given year we assume that farmers make their cropping pattern and water application decisions for a relative dry year according bouarfa et al 37 who realize a field experimental study on impact of water reduction on farms this is justified by a risk averse behaviour assumption the optimised cropping pattern is supposed to be adopted but the real water application is actualized according to the weather conditions that occur in late spring and summer 4 2 hydrogeologic model the hydrogeological model is a regional semi distributed model it follows the principles of groundwater balance inflow minus outflow in relation to induced water table changes using the aquifer storage coefficient it was set up following three main steps the first step was to define homogenous hydrogeological zones the second focused on gathering data and calculating model parameters while the third concentrated on refining and calibrating the model the beauce agricultural region is divided into four regulatory zones to provide a satisfactory representation of the hydrogeological processes we broke the beauce down into six homogeneous hydrogeological zones this zoning is based on geological characteristics and on relatively homogenous infiltrations it is coherent with the regulatory zoning the beauce centrale is further divided into three zones and the three remaining zones are the same as in the regulatory zoning see fig 1 the hydrogeological model has been refined from the simple groundwater mass balance equation that states that the piezometric level at the beginning of the growing year h n 1 is a function of effective natural recharge r n natural drainage d n withdrawal per year w t n and per sector t agriculture drinking water industry storage coefficient c e n and area s the natural drainage is understood as the natural flows to other systems other aquifer or surface flows in the case of beauce the drainage towards surface river systems is significant we characterise the drainage in year n as the sum of the drainage of year n 1 plus a term that is proportionate to the head difference between two years h n h n 1 the effective recharge r n is the volume of water from the surface rain surface waters which reaches the aquifer in year n the beauce aquifer is characterised by a high level of inertia as shown by the lag effects of rainfall on groundwater levels and the aquifer s substantial depth its size and thickness also explain the system s inertia and long reaction time 17 17 see details at http sigescen brgm fr fiche d identite nappe de beauce html therefore to improve the model s specification the recharge should be composed of the infiltration i n directly dependent from the yearly precipitations and from the previous year s infiltration periods of drought for example do not reduce groundwater levels suddenly since the effect is buffered over several years we assume that the conductivity within each zone is such that the level of the aquifer on the 1st of april of year n is homogeneous over each zone and represents the sum of extractions of year n 1 18 18 see pfeiffer and lin 47 for a critical discussion on this assumption our model is as follows aquifer regional index is omitted for clarity h n 1 h n r n t 1 β t w t n d n s c e n with d n d n 1 c d s h n h n 1 r n i n c r i n 1 1 c r β t is the return flow from the extraction back to the aquifer note the drainage coefficient c d represents the share of the drainage that is due to the head pressure implied by the difference of the head in year n and year n 1 c r is an inertia term that applies to the recharge of year n 1 the model is calibrated by calibrating the parameters c e n c d c r with observed piezometric and pluviometric data the calibration of the model is further developed in appendix 2 4 3 characterizing uncertainty design of scenarios the future uncertainty is represented by three climatic change and three product price scenarios constructed all nine combinations of climate change and product price scenarios are performed for the simulations 4 3 1 simulation of future climate scenarios to characterise uncertainty relative to climatic change we developed a simplified approach to produce scenarios because the application of downscaling methods was beyond the scope of this research 19 19 boé et al 48 details the various methods available to produce climatic scenarios and propose an application to french river basins a series of climatic years are randomly picked from previous years i e 1970 2007 to build a reference climate scenario for the period 2013 2040 20 20 a first test was realized to see if the distribution of previous years was statistically similar to a normal law or other common probability laws but this was not the case this would have enabled to produce more consistent future climate scenarios that would not replicate exactly the distribution of previous years and that could have been modified on their standard deviation also a longer time period would have probably enabled to fit a probability law a climatic year is characterised by regional infiltration and efficient precipitation these climatic scenarios are used for the runs and transformed as described in the next paragraph for climate change scenarios to build climate change into the climatic scenarios and account for uncertainty three climate change coefficients are determined 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 21 21 boé et al 48 give a decrease of about 3 for spring and 10 for summer precipitation in the loire river basin and 19 evapotranspiration in spring and 13 in summer for the period 2046 2065 both parameter intervene in the infiltration determination similar patterns are provided for the seine river basin ducharne et al 45 estimate for a pessimistic a2 sres scenario a 23 reduction in precipitation of the seine river basin and 37 in the groundwater recharge at the 2100 horizon we do not account for changes in the distribution of precipitations within the year that could affect some crops more than others the climate change coefficient is multiplied by the infiltration from 2020 and above the same coefficient is used to increase the water need per crop x i w due to increased evapotranspiration to represent the effect of the rise in temperature the yield water elasticity i e the impact of water application on yields see economic model remains the same because we lacked information on the potential evolution for this parameter a simple translation of the dose response function is conducted these assumptions imply that the yield might be modified as a function of the constraints on water more water is needed to grow one unit in quantity this set of assumptions simplifies the climate change adaptation of the model particularly in terms of crop growth with implications for quantities costs and revenues however it enables that we can explore effects on the water balance without resorting to a crop growth model the economic impact must be interpreted with care thus these scenarios account for a reduction in infiltration which affects the groundwater balances simulated using the hydrogeological model and crop water requirements we assume that the demands for industrial water use and drinking water remain constant on the basis of past and recent trends the yield data do not account for other climate change effects such as crop growth which may be affected by changes in temperature or carbon dioxide concentration 4 3 2 uncertainty in product prices and expected product prices we determined product price scenarios to account for the uncertainty associated with product prices and expected prices farm product sale prices the reference scenario is constructed by randomly drawing prices from 1980 to 2014 price deviations are set at 0 15 and 0 15 for cereal prices to characterise relative price uncertainty other crop prices are constant this coefficient will be applied to product prices in the reference scenario 5 results the different simulations performed are presented in table 2 two main types of indicators are considered for the analysis i effectiveness indicators which are for instance the piezometric level or the frequency with the piezometric level respect thresholds and ii cost indicators of the policy the model produces a lot of other output values that could have been analysed water use cropping patterns quantities produced but for sake of clarity and to keep the focus on instrument s assessment we stick with these two types of indicators 5 1 analysis of the reference instruments the hydro economic model was used to simulate the dynamic combined evolution of farming and the aquifer state from 2010 to 2040 to analyse the respective role of both instruments i quota and ii taxes shadow values or marginal benefit of water were used to indicate the value of 1 or 1 m3 of water the shadow value indicates if the quota or the tax is constraining as demonstrated in section 2 2 2 according to our results the quota is constraining most of the time in most of the regions this is coherent with the fact that the quota system is a local policy that was designed and adapted for the region unlike the tax which is national and not specifically geared to incentivising beauce farmers this also illustrates that the two instruments complement each other because they are both active the shadow values indicate that the areas where water is valued most i e with high shadow values are montargois and fusain in the east of the region here substitution resources are being considered by the administration and farmers to compensate for water restrictions with a low coefficient often around 0 5 reducing the quota to only 50 of its base level 5 2 impact of climatic change with the reference instrument we then explore the impact of increasing water scarcity due to climate change on the current hydro economic system using the reference instrument and considering price uncertainty current management fails to compensate for climate change as shown by the distribution of the frequency of threshold compliance the frequency of years when the piezometric level is above the 3 different thresholds considering all simulations of climate prices and years between 2014 and 2040 this is lower for the simulations with climate change than for the reference for all the regions see fig 3 the instruments autoregulation capacity seems insufficient to maintain piezometric levels and threshold levels are reached more often with climate change however the effect of climate change does not dramatically change the patterns of threshold level frequencies the results suggest two different patterns of regional sensitivity in terms of the agriculture aquifer system s response to climate change b blesoise b c calc b c sable and b c ss couv are significantly affected by climate change because the water levels reach the highest threshold with about 20 less frequency in contrast montargois and fusain are little affected by climate change as shown here however their threshold levels are not fully respected even without climate change when it comes to conserving the piezometric levels with climate change in all regions the effectiveness of the reference instrument seems limited in montargois and fusain the instrument is already ineffective in the reference situation without climatic change the average cost for farming due to reduced water availability resulting from climate change is limited to 3 of annual net revenues after 2020 years with effect of climate change even though the effects on individual farms should be investigated and would reveal differences the cost induced by climate change on farming seems limited in beauce this can be explained by the fact that irrigated agriculture adapts and the effect on water resources is limited more specifically i the total cultivated area remains stable ii the greater water requirements for growing crops are satisfied by increasing water use per unit of land and decreasing the area with irrigated crops extensive margin adjustment our model does not account for the specific effects of temperature on crop growth therefore these conclusions must be interpreted with care these results both the deterioration of piezometric heads and the low cost for farming may be an incentive to revise the actual policy in the light of climate change 5 3 cost effectiveness of alternative instruments under climate change scenario this paragraph presents and discusses the simulation results of different economic and regulatory instruments presented in section 2 2 3 they are tested for the climatic change scenarios and price uncertainty scenarios results for both types of indicators are presented in table 4 cost for farming is the profit difference between the policy and an open access scenario no regulation social cost is the cost for farming net of water tax revenues or water subsidy expenses the effectiveness is an indicator on a scale of 1 regarding the relative closeness of the piezometric level h n compared to the worst case open access and the best base scenario no irrigation effectiveness is calculated as e h h n o r e g h n o i r r h n o r e g an effectiveness of 1 or 100 means piezometric level are not affected by farming an effectiveness of 0 means there are as affected as in the open access case cost effectiveness is the ratio of the social cost by the effectiveness in ha eff unit the lower the better it could also be called the efficiency the shadow value of water is given to indicate the level of constraint provided by the quota system the different instruments do not provide very contrasted results in terms of piezometric level or effectiveness more differences are observed in terms of cost for farming as well as for social costs as expected there is a relative trade off between piezometric head and agricultural profits when costs for farming increase the piezometric level increase the challenge is to identify and design an instrument with the best trade off e g the lowest cost effectiveness ratio for a given level of environmental performance in theory economic instruments provide better cost effectiveness because they encourage those water savings with the least costs however the overall water savings e g the environmental performance of the instrument are not guaranteed or fixed ex ante 6 reg and flxtxq are most effective resp e 0 62 and e 0 61 but flxtxq is more cost effective than 6 reg 62 2 78 1 right after are flxtax buybck and desirr instruments e 0 58 and 0 59 and flxtax is more cost effective than buybck and desirr instrument 53 8 68 1 73 7 buybck is more cost effective than desirr which is explained because buybck allows farmer to adapt the water application rate per hectare intensive margin rather than suppress irrigation altogether extensive margin both instruments are appealing in comparison to the reference instrument they generate lower costs for farming and improve environmental performance provided public money is spent social cost is higher on average desirr reduces water use by 5 and buybck by 4 compared to the reference instrument the tax instrument no quota is less effective at maintaining piezometric levels 0 45 versus 0 55 than the reference therefore it is not a candidate for improving water management the substi instrument allows farmers to substitute some of their groundwater withdrawals for irrigation with water collected in ponds in the autumn and winter the simulation suggests that water is collected and used for irrigation to substitute groundwater in all regions except in b c sable depending on the year the pond water substitutes or supplements groundwater use to increase overall water use on average this option increases use supplementary use by 5 however from an environmental point of view the substi instrument is of little interest because it is less effective than the reference instrument nonetheless it is slightly cheaper for farming and society 2 ha which explains why farmers are willing to implement this type of solution the 6 reg instrument which consists of introducing a differentiation in the calculation for the coefficient between the three regions b c calc b c sable and b c ss couv only seems effective at maintaining better piezometric levels for b c ss couv it has no impact on the largest region b c calc and has a negative impact reduction of water availability constraints on b c sable thus it seems irrelevant given that it has negligible aggregated impact on effectiveness and shows a positive cost compared to the reference instrument the results of the mean and standard deviation of the shadow value of water for each of the policies indicate the most active mechanisms quota or tax as discussed previously this can be interpreted as the cost of the water resource constraint quota constraint all alternative instruments except the 6reg show a reduced shadow value of water this indicates a lower constraint in terms of the quota system and a relatively high price based incentive notably the flxtxq instrument presents a shadow value of water of 0 033 m3 which is far below the reference cost of the water use constraint 0 117 m3 5 4 regional results table 5 gives the effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of instruments for each region two types of regions can be distinguished in relative terms the three first regions b blesoise b c calc b c sable have a higher potential for improvement and a lower cost effectiveness than the three other regions b c ss couv fusain montargois these patterns are similar accross instruments a positive relationship between cost effectiveness and effectiveness is consistent with intuition and corresponds to increasing marginal cost of environmental efforts however it is interesting to note that in some cases for instance flxtax good effectiveness can also be characterised by relatively low cost effectiveness which is particularly interesting when comparing the effectiveness of alternative instruments with the reference instrument the evolution is similar for all regions positive or negative except for the flxtax instrument the latter improves the piezometric levels for the first four regions and reduces it for fusain and montargois this shows that in fusain and montargois the quota system is necessary to maintain the same effectiveness as in the reference in the other regions a nearly pure price based instrument the flxtax improves both the effectiveness and the cost effectiveness compared to the reference instrument the flxtxq seems a better choice because it improves the effectiveness in all regions albeit at a higher cost the substitution instrument shows that the agricultural response differs according to the region although water use increases by only 5 globally it increases by more than 80 in fusain where the option is also the most controversial in the b c sable this option is not adopted because substitution does not cost less than groundwater or the shadow value of water for irrigation i e the opportunity cost of extra water use 5 5 robustness the concept of robustness offers a different perspective that considers the dimension of uncertainty or any source of variability i e space time years price and climate scenarios which integrate climate change assumptions these aspects are ignored in a deterministic setting which aggregates different results into a mean as presented in previous sections robustness is particularly relevant for the environmental indicator piezometric level because groundwater flows into surface watercourses the cause and effect is discontinuous for example below a certain groundwater level there is a very strong impact with regard to the impacts on farming costs robustness could also be useful in terms of agricultural sustainability one dry season can put a farmer out of business although this is not the case in beauce table 6 presents the selected instruments with the robustness minmaxregret algorithm according effectiveness and cost effectiveness optimality results from the previous section are reported for comparision to produce unique combined criteria we combine the ranking for both indicators for effectiveness the results show that the flxtxq is more robust than the 6 reg instrument while 6 reg is more optimal than flxtxq e 0 62 vs 0 61 this result indicates that 6 reg generates lower piezometric levels than flxtxq although it produces slightly better outcomes on average the reg 6 seems not to be robust in terms of effectiveness therefore we can discard this option despite the fact that it appeared optimal the tax instrument is the most cost effective considering both optimality and robustness the combination of both indicators provides similar results for the first best the flxtxq is preferred with both criteria considering robustness has little effect on the results of cost effectiveness however robustness might be achieved at a higher cost than optimality here adopting the flxtxq instrument versus the 6 reg instrument induces benefits in terms of social costs tax revenues mask the extra farming costs 10 ha while farming cost increase by 33 ha see table 3 when spatial variability differences between regions 22 22 the spatial robustness enables to select instruments that do not induce extreme negative outcomes in one region compared to the best region and thus induce relative homogeneous outcomes among regions is considered in the robustness analysis the results remain the same 6 conclusion the main local instrument in beauce which is a flexible quota system is highly original as far as we know it is unique it has the advantage of introducing flexibility in an instrument with a rigid design it is coupled with an economic instrument a low tax on water use which is not a local policy instrument but a european water policy instrument although the incentive is very modest it is sometimes acting on behaviour the flexibility limits the cost for farming while ensuring that certain environmental objectives are achieved interestingly the flexible quota system addresses the problem of the over allocation of water entitlements instead of reducing water rights definitively the rights are revised each year depending on the level of the aquifer under french law water entitlements are not rights but annual authorisations that are systematically renewed each year however the difficulty of reducing historical reference authorizations is particularly critical the recent change to a single collective management body which will be in charge of controlling the total annual volumes for abstraction in a region illustrates another strategy the aim is to avoid a top down decision imposed by the administration on the farmer to reduce individual water abstraction volumes in this system the single management body which is not governmental will monitor compliance with the total water allocation by managing individual water allocation however this reference instrument does not seem to be sufficiently effective to achieve good environmental performance this statement is particularly pertinent in the light of climate change forecasts given the likely reduction in rainfall and recharge as well as the increase in evapotranspiration the simulations described in this paper show that increasing the economic incentives with a flexible tax on water use that varies with the state of the groundwater seems both effective and cost effective it also appears to be robust in a context of climate and price uncertainties flxtxq which maintains the reference flexible quota system the combination of both quantitative based and price based instruments seems particularly pertinent in beauce where the state of the aquifer allows for the withdrawal of different volumes of water depending on the years the quota ensures a minimum fixed constraint that is independent from the water demand variation linked to price variations the tax introduces flexibility by cutting the demand for farms where the marginal net benefit of water use is less than the tax this varies with price acceptability may also be higher than with a single instrument that would imply a more constraining quota or tax in addition the robust flexible quota and tax policy could easily be implemented because of the existing sophisticated administrative framework for adapting and enforcing annual quotas and tax levies tax payment procedures information on annual coefficient etc with the shift towards a regional quota rather than an individual quota the increase in use of price based instruments such as the flexible tax could help identify and allocate cheaper water savings it is an alternative to negotiations that aim to reallocate the regional quota to individuals with very high transaction costs introducing flexibility in terms of the volume of water allocated quantitative or the tax level is a cost effective feature in basins where the intra annual variability of available resources is significant it is a way to reduce the cost that differs from a fixed tax or quota it should also satisfy water resource constraints in dry years this new system based on two instrument could be justified in the tinbergen rule logic of one instrument per policy objective by i authorizing total yearly water use according the amount that can be sustainably handled by water resources quota constraint and ii reallocating water use where water is most valued to maximize social benefits in time in terms of sequencing the introduction of instruments in time it might be smarter to first reinforce the quota which is by far more constraining today than the tax and then to introduce the flexible tax to reallocate extra water savings although our modelling results are obviously case specific the analysis of the mechanisms discussed in this paper has broader application that we develop in the two following paragraphs the two instruments we analyse for the reference policy have been designed for i safeguarding piezometric levels quota instrument and ii contributing financially for a potential harm to the environment tax while acting as an incentive to limit water use we show that the tax is rarely active as an incentive table 3 no change in behaviour is observed and can question the interest of the current european wfd withdrawal water tax because it is not locally adapted and have little chance to act as an incentive as such it could be smarter to present it only as an individual contribution to a collective financial effort to manage water bodies rather than arguing that it acts as an incentive without having tested the efficiency depending on marginal water value which is very variable throughout europe s farming systems or to upgrade it s design in order to guarantee its incentive characteristic even though our results show little effect of the reference tax on the water use and environmental performance they show that the most robust policy among the options considered is a combination of a flexible tax and a flexible quota the flexible tax has been redesigned from the initial tax to be constraining and reflect the need for water savings according the state of the water bodies this result encourages the adaptation of economic instruments to the regional hydrological and economic specificities in europe if the tax should have an incentive role of reallocation induce less use where water is less valuable and reallocate it when or where it s more valuable the tax should be properly and locally adapted according economic specificities to be effective from a methodological point of view the hydro economic model we developed is an interesting approach for exploring a variety of management alternatives and policies relating to the hydrogeological and agricultural economic system the proposed approach is particularly relevant because it suits all types of policy exercises and provides detailed insights into agricultural economics shadow values of water make it possible to interpret the agricultural response in terms of alternative water resources our model is a good trade off between detailed modelling and calibration on the one hand and implementation and data requirements on the other hand the perfectly calibrated econom ic model produces detailed adaptation margins including deficit irrigation adjusting the water application rate however modelling on a regional scale does not take account of individual specificities or analysis for instance the problem of dead volumes over allocation cannot be analysed at farm scale with our model the simplified hydrogeological approach is satisfactory from a calibration point of view because it replicates the observed years correctly the main advantage is that it provides a unique platform to accommodate a variety of simulations in addition it is calibrated accurately to represent realistic hydrogeological and economic processes a robustness criterion is used to account for and avoid unsatisfactory outcomes in the face of uncertainty the criterion is developed for three dimensions time and space variability regional and climate uncertainty robustness affects the results which suggests that it should be taken into account in future modelling the perspective of this work includes an improved representation of other non agricultural water requirements including ecological water demands and their benefits further analysis could focus on integrating uncertainty with regard to the evolution of agricultural policy and input prices this would be helpful for the development of adapted and robust or flexible policy changes

rinaudo brgm for his valuable comments on an earlier version of the paper j c maréchal brgm for his helpful comments on the hydrogeological model and y caballero brgm for his insights on climate scenario modelling i would also like to thank the two reviewers and the editors as well as i olivier who proofread the english language of the manuscript appendix 1 crisis management in beauce since 1995 the first quantitative groundwater management instrument to be applied in beauce involved temporary water use restrictions in summer when surface river flows were below threshold levels when the first aquifer threshold level is reached alert farmers must stop irrigating for 24 h or 48 h per week when a second threshold is reached crisis all non essential water uses including agricultural irrigation must stop these constraints apply to all farmers in beauce the crisis management measures act as a safety net if the planning policy has failed to avoid a crisis situation extra measures are taken to reduce the impact of the drought on ecosystems and priority uses the more restrictive the planning policy is the more costly it is for farming and the more efficient from an environmental protection point of view the restriction is imposed with no warning per se when there is no rain and when crops and rivers need water the economic impacts of restrictions can be seen as the damage cost of drought they necessarily cost more for the farmers than adapting cropping and irrigation in advance the farmer s capacity to adapt is limited once crops have been sown sunk costs on the other hand greater caution and stronger restrictions reducing the quota or increasing tax represent a high cost for farmers and the environmental benefits are limited greater restrictions involve negotiations with the farming sector and high transaction costs which should also be considered according to experts a 24 or 48 h irrigation ban on abstraction has a limited impact on the aquifer most farmers find ways to organise irrigation and labour at least cost to continue supplying the same quantity of water to their crops however discrepancies emerged with regard to the impact of the restriction which call for a detailed field analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper the temporary restriction measures in beauce are less restrictive than elsewhere the alert level imposes a 50 reduction on abstraction for non essential uses the temporary restriction also imposes restrictions on other users restrictions are imposed on citizens for non essential water uses such as watering gardens filling pools or cleaning cars the alert level simply bans water use for several hours per day therefore the impacts are negligible because it is easy to postpone water use until later the same day e g watering the garden etc even if it causes some inconvenience appendix 2 data and calibration the economic and hydrogeological models were calibrated for the six regions hydrogeological model calibration the calibration phase aims to calibrate the following model parameters storage coefficient c e n the drainage coefficient c d and the recharge coefficient c r it also serves to initialize the drainage value d 0 the hydrogeological calibration programme consists in minimizing the distance between each year and each zones estimated piezometric level h n as specified in our model and the observed piezometric level using non linear least squares the program is solved in gams with a non linear solver the calibration performs well as the observed and modeled piezometric levels for all regions are close except for region montargois see appendix 3 for the graphs that compares observed and modeled years the nash sutcliff index 38 is 0 931 0 977 0 981 0 965 0 939 0 675 respectively for the 6 regions and 0 951 for the whole model a perfect fitted calibration would give an index of 1 data for hydrogeological model calibration piezometric heads withdrawals and recharge are observed for the calibration period 1997 to 2009 at a yearly time step piezometric heads piezometric heads groundwater monitoring data for the reference piezometers of each of the hydrogeological sectors are collected from the national database for groundwater ades www ades eaufrance fr we assume that the piezometric heads of the reference piezometers are representative of each zone they have been chosen as reference piezometers by the administration to monitor the state of the groundwater and impose groundwater abstraction restrictions to the corresponding areas as a function of the piezometric head 39 withdrawals a water withdrawal database has been set up from data produced by water agencies on the basis of the taxes recovered for water uses for the years 1998 2009 thus we were able to compile water withdrawal per type of user water utilities for drinking water distribution industries and farming per area per type of resource and per year it should be possible to generate a good approximation of the total volume of water abstracted from the aquifer since farmers have to declare their withdrawals and pay the corresponding tax however there is a minimum volume 7000 m3 below which farmers do not have to declare their water use 23 23 note that this volume correspond to less than about 4 ha of irrigated corn or about 10 ha of irrigated wheat we assume that most withdrawals are declared for the tax and recorded in the database in order to correct the data we added 10 of the volume of the observed agricultural use to account for missing data for water utilities and industry we assume that all volumes are declared infiltration infiltration is calculated for each year and aquifer zone the limestone aquifer is characterised by high infiltration rates while sandstones and clays show more surface runoff the infiltration or recharge is calculated from two values the effective rainfall and a geomorphological index idpr effective rainfall is the rainfall that is available for runoff or infiltration it is calculated from meteorological data météofrance available at a grid size of 8 km 8 km the index idpr represents the characteristic of a soil with respect to infiltration and runoff the estimation of this index is detailed in schomburgk et al 40 the return flow b e t a t are set to zero in the case of the beauce aquifer because no return flows to groundwater from irrigation or sewage are considered significant the fact that irrigation water is largely used by crops sprinkler technology has a good water use effectiveness close to 80 and the geological formation of the aquifer support this assumption economic model calibration the model is calibrated on observed cropping patterns for 2009 taken as the reference situation see tables below sources of data are the french farm payment agency for cropping patterns and ministère de l agriculture et de l agroalimentaire 41 for crop yields and land rents we use reference irrigation levels conditional on soil type from morardet and hanot 36 and update them using more recent information by bouarfa et al 37 expected prices of outputs for the year 2009 are calculated based on adaptive expectations from observed prices for the years 2005 2008 42 yearly average prices are obtained from the french statistical office costs are recovered from brunel bouarfa and ruelle 43 and yield response to water are characterised with morardet and hanot 36 2009 correspond to relative important reductions of water availability compared to the initial quantity of quotas as the coefficient was 0 59 in 2009 the climate of 2009 had a wet spring but a dry summer however likely evolution might strengthen these constraints with a coefficient up to 0 2 37 the interest of having an already constraining reference but not an extreme one is that the simulations keep the model within a reasonable range that guaranty model validity the total agricultural area modeled is 593 000 ha which is more than 90 of the total farming area the remaining 10 include mainly set aside pasture and orchards within the modeled area about 20 are irrigated crops in the reference situation table 7
