3170,a steady state analytical solution based on the method of green s function is presented for the analysis of hydraulic interference between pumping wells and ambient flow in a heterogeneous wedge shaped aquifer two intersecting streams with spatially variable head form the boundaries of the wedge and establish non uniform distribution of ambient flow across it the dual zone aquifer consists of two porous media of constant but contrasting transmissivities and refraction conditions are exactly satisfied along their common interface the method of green s function affords an integral representation of boundary heads which is readily evaluated in terms of lerch transcendent function integration of cauchy riemann equations gives the associated stream function in closed form which in turn completes analytical description of the flow net a systematic way for the assessment of mass balance at both aquifer and sub aquifer well capture zone scales is discussed which also helps identifying whether a certain reach of the boundary stream is losing or gaining water to or from the adjoining aquifer the solution is general in the sense that the wedge angle location and discharge of the wells dual zone transmissivities and slopes of boundary head variation can be arbitrary chosen the solution encompasses the case of stream barrier wedge as a subset hypothetical examples demonstrate the complex interaction between surface subsurface waters showing formation of stagnation point on the capture zone envelopes in each case head profiles are in excellent agreement with numerical counterparts from adaptive finite element method finally uncertainty analysis quantifies the extent to which stochastic nature of dual zone transmissivities and boundary head slopes model inputs affects hydraulic head at specific observation points model output keywords flow net wedge shaped aquifer heterogeneity variable boundary heads method of green s function uncertainty analysis data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in natural hydrogeological settings pairs of arbitrary oriented streams may intersect to delineate lateral boundaries of a wedge shaped aquifer samani and zarei doudeji 2012 radial heterogeneity of the hydrogeological parameters is expected to arise downstream from the apex of the wedge as a consequence of spatial variability of sediment deposition characteristics in the radial direction fig 1 in particular the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the major stratigraphic units varies in accordance with the patterns of sedimentation zoning such spatial distributions commonly exhibit transition from high permeability coarse grained sediments near the confluence point to low permeability fine grained deposition downstream from the wedge shaped aquifer samani and sedghi 2015 likewise in a typical alluvial aquifer high permeability units of sand and gravel are usually deposited near mountain area whereas low permeability units of clay and silt manifest themselves toward the edge of the fan liang and zhang 2013 in such hydrogeological settings it would be more realistic to account for the spatial variability of boundary head along the common interface between stream and adjoining aquifer yeh and chang 2006 the boundary head must adjust itself to the stream channel morphology following the changes in bed slope that generally become milder from upland toward plain area head difference across the boundary streams would establish an ambient groundwater flow commonly directed from the high elevation section toward the low elevation section of the stream samani and zarei doudeji 2012 mahdavi 2020 2021 the ambient flow contributes to the water balance at the aquifer scale the hydrogeological conditions characterizing the aquifer borders would affect formation of the well capture zone particularly if pumping lasts for sufficiently long time so that the cone of depression extends laterally and intersects the boundaries of the flow system mahdavi 2019a delineation of the capture zone plays a key role in the design of contaminated groundwater remediation schemes bioremediation and surface subsurface water interactions zarei doudeji and samani 2018 furthermore the aquifer heterogeneity tends to complicate the topology of flow around a pumping well kacimov and obnosov 2018 and alters the pattern of ambient flow through refraction of streamlines strack 2017 a variety of mathematical models have been devoted to boundary value problems bvps that govern the hydraulics of groundwater flow in non rectangular aquifer domains it is common practice to conceptualize an extraction or injection well as a point sink or source by appending to the governing partial differential equation a term linearly proportional to the well discharge multiplied by a dirac delta function the solution of such bvps known as green s function quantifies the aquifer response to concentrated extraction injection activity at an arbitrary point this can be constructed on an analytical or semi analytical basis green s functions based on the image well theory enable handling aquifers bounded by triangular or wedge shaped borders but under certain geometrical constraints it is limited to either isosceles right angled triangle mahdavi and seyyedian 2013 or equilateral triangle mahdavi 2019b and the wedge angle has to be a multiple of 180 samani and zarei doudeji 2012 recently the method of image wells is extended to relax restrictions on specifying the wedge angle nikoletos and katsifarakis 2022 the solution essentially represents an approximate application of image wells though it can predict drawdown in wedge shaped aquifers with desirable accuracy it is worth mentioning that the same bvp has been solved exactly by the method of eigenfunction expansion chan et al 1978 and later on reexamined by schwarz christoffel conformal mapping nagheli et al 2020 both of which are applicable to wedge configurations not necessarily belonging to the aforementioned restricted set few analytical solutions exist for irregularly shaped domains delineating homogeneous aquifers kuo et al 1994 nagheli et al 2020 for heterogeneous aquifers a parameter zonation structure has been included at the cost of satisfying extra conditions to ensure continuities of drawdown and flux on the interface between each two neighboring zones huang and yeh 2016 the same applies when introducing local inhomogeneities in a regional aquifer system strack 2017 semi analytical flow models usually implement laplace transform for time dependent bvp in conjunction with additional integral transform s for spatial variables in most cases evaluation of the associated green s function involves numerical laplace inversion for converting the results back to the physical space green s functions have been constructed semi analytically for drawdown prediction in wedge shaped flow systems examples appeared in the cases of leaky aquifers sedghi et al 2012 multi zone aquifers samani and sedghi 2015 and unconfined fractured aquifers sedghi and zhan 2018 despite the role of ambient flow in regional aquifer systems it is rarely addressed by analytical flow models in wedge shaped aquifers notable examples account for ambient flow arisen either from some features e g lakes river sections areas of recharge at far field samani and zarei doudeji 2012 or from the slopes curves and elevations of the aquifer boundaries yeh and chang 2006 both of these solutions pertain to homogeneous aquifers the former is however restricted to certain wedge configurations while the latter entails special techniques for evaluating the infinite integral of bessel functions furthermore uniform ambient flow can be resulted from boundary streams of constant but contrasting heads mahdavi 2020 2021 to the best of author s knowledge there exists no analytical study to describe how non uniform ambient flow affects the flow topology in heterogeneous wedge shaped aquifer under steady state pumping therefore the present study in aimed at developing analytical solution for such hydrogeological settings with non uniform ambient flow arisen from stream wise varying boundary heads the flow system comprises two zones of constant but contrasting transmissivities which are hydraulically connected through a common interface referred to as interzonal boundary in heterogeneous aquifer systems it is not uncommon to see distinct interfaces across which material properties jump abruptly this may appear as contrasting geological blocks of constant but differing hydraulic conductivity craig 2015 the spatial variability of hydrogeological parameters is often expressed by piecewise constant function samani and sedghi 2015 strack 2017 such an idealization also permits assessment of hydrogeological impacts due to coastal land reclamation hu et al 2008 as well as analysis of mound dynamics in heterogeneous aquifers under precipitation recharge das et al 2014 to address the problem of refraction in two component composite aquifer the green s function from mahdavi 2021 is adopted and further manipulated to impose desirable head variability on the common interface between the surrounding streams and the wedge shaped aquifer the resulting expressions for dual zone potentials are then integrated on the basis of cauchy riemann equations to arrive at spatial distribution of stream function the solutions involve infinite series of trigonometric functions which are then summed analytically in terms of lerch transcendent function this completes a series free closed form representation of the flow net which is easily evaluated for a given set of hydrogeological parameters hypothetical examples illustrate key features of the present solution 2 conceptual model the areal extent of the stream aquifer system suggests formulation of the problem in terms of radial and angular coordinates r θ with the origin of coordinate system at the apex of the wedge fig 2 a the aquifer is confined by horizontal impervious layers on its bottom and top sides but extends to infinity in the radial direction the heterogeneity of flow system is characterized by two zones of constant but contrasting transmissivities specified by t 1 for 0 r r zone 1 and by t 2 for r r zone 2 with r representing the position of interzonal boundary the heterogeneity ratio of adjacent zones is defined by λ t 1 t 2 let φ j r θ denotes the potential which is related to the hydraulic head h j by φ j t j h j for j 1 2 the following boundary value problem bvp governs the spatial distribution of dual zone potentials 1 2 φ j σ j the laplacian is expressed by 2 φ j 1 r r r φ j r 1 r 2 2 φ j θ 2 in polar coordinates the source term σ j q wj δ r r wj δ θ θ wj r accounts for pumping wells of discharge q wj placed at r wj θ wj in the way shown in fig 2 the dirac delta function is designated by δ having the unit of the reciprocal of the parameter in its argument semi infinite streams s r and s l form the boundary of flow system and delineate the wedge shape aquifer on its right and left borders along rays θ 0 and θ β respectively fig 2 and 0 β π starting from h o at the apex of the wedge the boundary heads decline stream wise with constant slopes α hr 0 and α hl 0 along the segments of s r and s l that surround zone 1 the boundary streams then stabilize constant heads upon reaching zone 2 such variation of boundary heads is consistent with the fact that the stream head must obey the changes in channel bed slope that generally become milder from upland toward plain area this is confirmed through the analysis of morphological configuration of a major alluvial fan in the lake alakol region kazakhstan norini et al 2016 eqs 2 and 3 express stream wise changes in boundary heads 2 o n s r h 1 r 0 h o α hr r 0 r r h 2 r 0 h 1 r 0 r r and 3 o n s l h 1 r

function is not given in their analytical study 5 2 an overview of hypothetical examples four hypothetical examples referred to as case 1 to case 4 henceforth are examined in order to highlight key features of the present solution the ambient flow is characterized by α hr 1 5 α hl 0 0015 in case 1 and by α hr α hl 0 001 in case 2 stream stream wedge in case 3 α hr 0 0015 but stream s l is replaced by an impervious barrier stream barrier wedge other numerical values assigned to model parameters in the first three cases are β 60 h o 100 m r 3000 m and t 1 4 t 2 40 m 2 day λ 4 computations are first carried out without any withdrawal present merely ambient flow in section 5 3 and then with pumping wells included in section 5 4 for this purpose two wells of constant extraction rate q w 1 100 m 3 day and q w 2 50 m 3 day referred to as well 1 and well 2 henceforth are superimposed on the ambient flow the locations of withdrawal are r w 1 θ w 1 2000 m 20 and r w 2 θ w 2 3500 m 45 in both case 1 and case 2 case 4 examines a single zone homogenous aquifer r having β 43 and t 1 30 m 2 day with ambient flow characterized by α hr 0 75 α hl 0 0012 and h o 100 m 5 3 ambient flow in the absence of pumping wells 5 3 1 stream aquifer water exchange interaction of aquifer and surrounding streams can be quantified in terms of volumetric rates of water exchange across their common interfaces along s r and s l denoted respectively by q sr and q sl 22 q sr r 0 r 1 r φ s 1 θ θ 0 d r f o r r r 0 r 1 r φ s 1 θ θ 0 d r r r 1 r φ s 2 θ θ 0 d r f o r r r which according to cauchy riemann equation 14 can be written as 23 q sr r 0 r ψ s 1 r θ 0 d r f o r r r 0 r ψ s 1 r θ 0 d r r r ψ s 2 r θ 0 d r f o r r r the integrands appearing in 23 are essentially in the form d ψ sj ψ sj r d r yeilding 24 q sr r ψ s 1 r 0 f o r r r ψ s 1 r 0 ψ s 2 r 0 ψ s 2 r 0 f o r r r similar computations result in 25 q sl r ψ s 1 r β f o r r r ψ s 2 r β ψ s 1 r β ψ s 2 r β f o r r r note that r measures the stream wise distance and ψ s 1 0 0 ψ s 1 0 β 0 positive values of q sr and q sl identify net inflow to the aquifer from the reach 0 r of the respective stream and the reach loses water losing reach while negative values indicate net outflow from the aquifer and the reach receives groundwater discharge gaining reach indeed both of 24 and 25 relate the water exchange over a stream reach to the difference between stream functions at the starting and ending points of that reach moreover 24 and 25 enable dealing with stream reaches starting from points other than the apex of the wedge suppose a reach of s r that lies between r 1 and r 2 where r 2 r 1 if q sr r 2 q sr r 1 then reach loses water and recharges the adjoining aquifer otherwise if q sr r 2 q sr r 1 then reach gains water from the discharge of adjoining aquifer fig 3 depicts variation of q sr and q sl as function of stream wise distance r zero value of q sr at point a in case 1 is an indication of equilibrium between the losing and gaining reaches upstream from that point fig 3a to be more specific any stream reach chosen in the interval 0 r p would lose water to the adjoining aquifer because the curve of q sr is monotonically increasing over this interval downstream from r p the curve descends and gaining water from the adjoining aquifer predominates in any stream reach chosen referring to fig 3b any stream reach belonging to interval 0 r p 2 in case 2 0 r p 3 in case 3 would lose water while outside this interval the stream has gaining reaches r r p 2 in case 2 and r r p 3 in case 3 since the volumetric rates of stream aquifer water exchange q sr and q sl in case 2 and q sr in case 3 vanish for r conservation of mass is ensured within the dual zone aquifers of case 2 and case 3 5 3 2 flow nets the flow nets shown in figs 4 to 6 are contour maps of ψ sj and φ sj for the three cases mentioned above and refer to pre pumping state of stream aquifer system it is known that the ambient flow is generally directed from regions of higher water levels toward the regions of comparatively lower heads since head varies more gently along s l compered to s r α hr α hl in case 1 the average head is greater along s l with reference to 2 3 and streamlines mostly terminate into s r as fig 4 indicates therefore the direction of ambient flow is generally from s l to s r in both aquifer zones the heterogeneity of dual zone aquifer causes refraction of streamlines in a manner analogous to snell s law of optics all incoming streamlines that strike the interzonal boundary in zone 1 will refract toward the boundary normal upon arriving at zone 2 which consists of less permeable porous medium at relatively large distances from the apex of the wedge in zone 2 the contributions from the terms involving the ratio r r become negligibly small which in turn simplifies 13 to φ s 2 φ o λ α l r λ α r α l r λ 1 θ β and 19 to ψ s 2 α r α l r β λ l n r under such circumstances the contours of φ s 2 distribute in a fan like pattern while those of ψ s 2 form concentric circles the flow net exhibits such asymptotic behavior at large radial distances in zone 2 fig 4 in hydrogeological context stagnation point can be defined as a location in the flow field where both the radial component q r j r θ φ j r and the angular component q θ j r θ 1 r φ j θ of comprehensive discharge vector vanish strack 2017 a streamline coming from zone 1 locally reverses it direction at point b on s l and produces a streamline toward s r which is labeled bc in fig 4 the ambient flow stagnates at point b because hydraulic gradient is zero everywhere along the constant head stream in zone 2 q r 2 r b β 0 and darcian velocity changes sign normal to the boundary stream at point b q θ 2 r b β 0 also at this point head contour h 97 m joins the boundary stream of the same constant head in zone 2 the flow fields studied in what follows exhibit similar patterns near stagnation points f in fig 7 b and c in fig 8 and c in fig 9 since there would be no flow passing across streamline bc mass must be conserved inside the area enclosed by this streamline reach 0 r b of s l and reach 0 r c of s r in other words net inflow and outflow must counterbalance each other so that q sr r c q sl r b 0 for the enclosed area this condition is met because q sr r c 65 4 m 3 day and q sl r b 65 4 m 3 day as explicitly indicated in fig 3a in case 2 the flow net is symmetric with respect to the aquifer bisector which represent groundwater divide fig 5 as pattern of streamlines reveals the amount of stream water that enters the aquifer returns back to the same stream further downstream both of s r and s l contribute equally to the stream aquifer water exchange with the same rate of q sr q sl fig 3b to construct the flow net of case 3 shown in fig 6 ψ sj and φ sj are evaluated for an extended domain having apex angle of 2 β subject to α hr α hl 0 0015 the lower half of domain occupying the area 0 r and 0 θ β defines the intended solution domain whereby ray θ β resembles an impervious barrier across which no flow would pass due to flow symmetry in the extended domain 5 4 interaction of ambient flow and pumping wells the pumping well develops a cone of depression around the location of withdrawal that extends outward in all directions mutual interaction can thus be expected between groundwater pumping and stream reaches that are located in both upgradient and downgradient directions capture zones are likely to form around the wells with the shape and areal extent controlled by the hydrogeological conditions along the aquifer borders mahdavi 2019a the flow net of case 1 is shown in fig 7 where the contours of hydraulic head are distributed in uniform intervals of 0 25 m exception is the contour line that twists around well 1 and intersects itself at point a the flow stagnates at this point q r 1 r a θ a 0 and q θ 1 r a θ a 0 owing to interference of ambient flow with high hydraulic gradients around well 1 point a is also intersection of four streamlines two originate from and two merge at this point the latter two labeled ac and ad delineate the boundary of the capture zone for well 1 and are commonly referred to as bounding streamlines the capture zone of well 1 is also surrounded by reach 0 r c of s r and reach 0 r d of s l under steady state condition all of the water pumped by each well must come from streamflow depletion as a consequence mass must be conserved inside the well capture zone the amount of water that enters the capture zone from an adjoining stream losing reach can be obtained following an analysis similar to that outlined for the derivation of 24 and 25 the rates of inflow from reaches 0 r c and 0 r d are evaluated as ψ 1 r c 0 ψ 1 0 0 27 48 m 3 day and ψ 1 0 β ψ 1 r d β 72 52 m 3 day respectively the sum of these contributions is thus 100 m 3 day which exactly counterbalances the amount of water that is extracted by the pumping well q w 1 the flow stagnates on the downgradient side of well 2 at point b producing bounding streamlines be and bg that envelop the well capture zone the capture zone of well 2 is supplied on its upgradient side by losing reach r e r g which consists of two sub reaches along s l r e r in zone 1 and r r g in zone 2 the rates of inflow from the sub reaches are respectively ψ 1 r e β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r β 31 17 m 3 day and ψ 2 r β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 r g β 18 83 m 3 day the sum of which equals q w 2 as expectd from the mass balance inside the well capture zone in above expressions the notations r wj and r wj designate whether r approaches r wj from the left side r r wj or from the right side r r wj respectively this accounts for the jump in the functional value of ψ wj across the radial position of the well with reference to 16 and 17 the flow net of case 2 shown in fig 8 reveals formation of capture zone for well 1 which is enclosed by bounding streamlines ad and ae the water pumped by well 1 is supplied partially by reach 0 r e of s r and partially by reach 0 r d of s l which respectively amount to ψ 1 r w 1 0 ψ 1 0 0 ψ 1 r e 0 ψ 1 r w 1 0 73 22 m 3 day and ψ 1 0 β ψ 1 r d β 26 78 m 3 day outside this capture zone well 2 receives contributions from rest of the boundary streams that is r r e on s r and r r d on s l the inflow rates are respectively ψ 1 r 0 ψ 1 r e 0 ψ 2 r w 2 0 ψ 2 r 0 ψ 2 0 ψ 2 r w 2 0 5 94 m 3 day and ψ 1 r d β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r β ψ 2 r β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 β 44 06 m 3 day these contributions sum to extraction rate of well 2 and mass is conserved outside the capture zone of well 1 too to include the effects of pumping wells in case 3 two image wells are needed in the extended aquifer domain mentioned earlier image wells are mirror reflections of the real wells with respect to ray θ β and are located at r wj 2 β θ wj each pumping at the same extraction rate as that of the corresponding real well this ensures imposition of no flow condition across the impervious barrier chan et al 1978 yeh and chang 2006 mahdavi and seyyedian 2013 the flow net constructed in this way is shown in fig 9 where the capture zone of well 1 is delineated by bounding streamlines ad and ae stream reach r d r e loses water at the rate of ψ 1 r e 0 ψ 1 r d 0 100 m 3 day which fully supports the withdrawal at well 1 along impervious barrier two streamlines flow in opposite directions merge together and stagnate at point b this in turn produces a streamline towards well 2 the aquifer of case 4 is exposed to a permanent source of contamination over a segment of s r that lies between r a 500 m to r b 1000 m it is scheduled to contain the contaminated reach through continuous pumping of adjoining aquifer with a well placed on ray θ β 3 downstream from the contaminated reach r w 1 r b the required pumping rate and radial position of the well can be determined following a trial and error process by satisfying the following constraint the containment of contamination is achieved if well capture zone fully encompasses the contaminated reach zarei doudeji and samani 2018 mahdavi 2021 for the well capture zone delineated in this way conservation of mass requires a pumping rate that is equal to inflow from reach r a r b this reads ψ 1 r b 0 ψ 1 r a 0 q w 1 with ψ 1 evaluated based on 21 setting r w 1 1050 m as a first trial results in q w 1 21 62 m 3 day and by assessment of the flow net associated with this pumping rate not shown here one obtains r a 488 6 m and r b 992 9 m for the stream wise extent of the contaminated reach which deviate from desired values the radial position of the well is changed iteratively and above steps are repeated until the solution converges to r w 1 1062 m and q w 1 21 33 m 3 day reproducing the reach extent with acceptable accuracy r a 499 7 m and r b 1000 3 m fig 10 depicts the flow net associated with the converged solution where the well capture zone is delineated by bounding streamlines ac and bc since no contaminated water can escape from the boundaries of the capture zone the portion of flow that is bypassed by the well outside the capture zone will not be disturbed by the polluted inflow from the contaminated reach besides the qualitative assessments described so far it is beneficial to check the validity of present solution against its numerical counterpart the adaptive finite element method implemented in matlab toolbox pdetool is chosen for numerical comparisons mahdavi 2021 2022 the toolbox admits computational domains of finite dimensions therefore the aquifer domain is truncated to a finite wedge of sufficiently large radius 5 r in order to resemble the condition of infinite radial extent as adopted in the forgoing analysis discretization starts from a relatively rough mesh consisting of triangular elements and adaptively refines to get smaller triangles in the regions of high hydraulic gradient close to the wells refinements stop when changes in the solution between two successive steps fall below a prescribed tolerance hydraulic heads are compared with fem results along rays passing through the well positions fig 11 a b and along the aquifer bisector fig 11c excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical curves in each case 5 5 uncertainty analysis by multivariate first order variance estimation method uncertainties in the input parameters of hydrologic models may propagate through the model to produce dispersion in the outputs even if the model itself is not corrupted by error or bias in the following analysis it is assumed that the uncertainty of model output is due to stochastic characters of transmissivity field kitanidis 1997 and boundary head estimation hantush and mariño 1994 these are treated as uncorrelated random variables x t 1 t 2 α hr α hl with mean values x k and variances var x k specified for each of k 1 2 3 4 the first order variance estimation method is adopted here for the uncertainty analysis it provides a simple yet reliable way of quantifying the expected variability of model output when one or more model inputs involve some degree of randomness stochastic basic variables provided that the coefficients of variations of stochastic basic variables and the nonlinearity in the model structure are not large benjamin and cornell 1970 based on the taylor series expansion tung and yen 2005 the multivariate first order approximation to the variance of hydraulic head var h j is given by 26 var h j k 1 4 h j x k 2 var x k eq 26 implies each of the stochastic basic variable x k contributes to the dispersion of h j in a manner proportional to its own variance and to a factor which is related to the sensitivity of h j to changes in x k the sensitivity coefficients partial derivatives in 26 are evaluated based on the mean values of stochastic basic variables taking the other model parameters as being deterministic special attention is focused on the percentage contributions of uncertainty of each of x k s to the overall uncertainty of the hydraulic heads in case 1 the percentage contributions are denoted by η j x k and can be computed by rearranging 26 as follows 27 η j x k h j x k 2 var x k var h j since most of the existing analytical solutions encounter singularity at the location of withdrawal it is common practice to monitor the aquifer response to pumping in a close vicinity of the well sedghi et al 2009 the head uncertainties are thus quantified along the arcs r 1 05 r w 1 in zone 1 fig 12 a and r 1 05 r w 2 in zone 2 fig 12b both of which covering the full lateral extent 0 θ β the mean values chosen for the stochastic basic variables are t 1 4 t 2 40 m 2 day and α hr 1 5 α hl 0 0015 for each stochastic basic variable the coefficient of variation is set to c v x k 0 05 and the variance is calculated by the formula var x k c v x k x k 2 tung and yen 2005 from fig 12 some notable observations can be made i the uncertainty associated with the transmissivity of zone 1 η 1 t 1 contributes almost 22 to the overall head uncertainty in the vicinity of well 1 the curve of η 2 t 2 reveals a comparable trend with a slightly higher impact 28 in the vicinity of well 2 ii the curves of η 1 α hr and η 1 α hl show 100 at θ 0 and θ β respectively therefore in the close vicinity of a boundary stream the head uncertainty is entirely contributed by the randomness inherent in the estimation of boundary head slope the curves of η 2 α hr and η 2 α hl behave in a similar fashion iii the curve of η 1 α hr sustains a higher level of head uncertainty compared with what t 1 does even though the magnitude of var α hr is appreciably much smaller than var t 1 this is because of the relative magnitude of sensitivity coefficients h 1 α hr h 1 t 1 so that η 1 α hr η 1 t 1 everywhere along the arc r 1 05 r w 1 and iv practically insignificant contribution can be observed from the curve of η 2 t 1 when quantifying the head uncertainty along the arc r 1 05 r w 2 similarly the curve of η 1 t 2 indicates an almost null impact on the results therefore the head uncertainty in each aquifer zone is not affected by the uncertainty associated with the transmissivity of the adjacent zone 6 conclusions the problem of surface subsurface water interaction was solved analytically for a heterogeneous aquifer surrounded by two intersecting streams of spatially variable heads the aquifer heterogeneity was represented by two zones of contrasting transmissivities and the flow net in such a composite setting was constructed by the method of green s function the results apply to steady state pumping whenever aquifer storage depletion is no longer taking place and streamflow depletion is the only source of the pumped water a number of conclusions can be drawn from the results i interaction of surface subsurface waters was quantified in terms of volumetric rates of water exchange across the stream aquifer interface denoted by q sr and q sl for s r and s l respectively this helps identifying whether a certain reach of the stream is losing or gaining water for example stream wise increase of q sr along a reach implies that it loses water and recharges the adjoining aquifer fig 3 ii variations in the boundary head slope influence the formation of well capture zone among other affecting factors it is confirmed through comparing the flow net in case 1 against that of case 2 the former shows separate capture zones formed around each well fig 7 while the latter reveals formation of only one capture zone fig 8 iii the conservation of mass was assessed at the capture zone scale whereby the portion of water contributed by a certain reach of the stream was expressed as difference between the values of stream functions at the points enclosing that reach the inflow from losing reach es exactly counterbalanced the pumping rate in all cases studied iv by adopting multivariate first order variance estimation method the uncertainty in the head model output was related to stochastic character of dual zone transmissivities and boundary head slopes model inputs for observation points located near a stream the head uncertainty can be entirely attributed to the randomness in the estimation of boundary head slope uncertainties in the estimation of transmissivity only have impact on the model outputs observed near a pumping well however the limitations of the present formulation can be summarized as follows i dual zone wedge shaped aquifer is addressed in this work multi zone representation of aquifer heterogeneity is more realistic comparing to the presented one ii no analytical expression is proposed for the capture zone and capture time iii transient flow in 3 d wedge shaped aquifer is not considered iv streambeds are not explicitly taken into account relaxing the above limitations may render a pure analytical approach mathematically intractable and semi analytical techniques would be required finally as a topic for future research one may notice the generality of 11 in the sense that any head distribution of practical interest e g piece wise constant or piece wise linear can be imposed on the stream aquifer interface but possibly at the cost of evaluating the resulting integral through a numerical algorithm credit authorship contribution statement ali

3170,a steady state analytical solution based on the method of green s function is presented for the analysis of hydraulic interference between pumping wells and ambient flow in a heterogeneous wedge shaped aquifer two intersecting streams with spatially variable head form the boundaries of the wedge and establish non uniform distribution of ambient flow across it the dual zone aquifer consists of two porous media of constant but contrasting transmissivities and refraction conditions are exactly satisfied along their common interface the method of green s function affords an integral representation of boundary heads which is readily evaluated in terms of lerch transcendent function integration of cauchy riemann equations gives the associated stream function in closed form which in turn completes analytical description of the flow net a systematic way for the assessment of mass balance at both aquifer and sub aquifer well capture zone scales is discussed which also helps identifying whether a certain reach of the boundary stream is losing or gaining water to or from the adjoining aquifer the solution is general in the sense that the wedge angle location and discharge of the wells dual zone transmissivities and slopes of boundary head variation can be arbitrary chosen the solution encompasses the case of stream barrier wedge as a subset hypothetical examples demonstrate the complex interaction between surface subsurface waters showing formation of stagnation point on the capture zone envelopes in each case head profiles are in excellent agreement with numerical counterparts from adaptive finite element method finally uncertainty analysis quantifies the extent to which stochastic nature of dual zone transmissivities and boundary head slopes model inputs affects hydraulic head at specific observation points model output keywords flow net wedge shaped aquifer heterogeneity variable boundary heads method of green s function uncertainty analysis data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in natural hydrogeological settings pairs of arbitrary oriented streams may intersect to delineate lateral boundaries of a wedge shaped aquifer samani and zarei doudeji 2012 radial heterogeneity of the hydrogeological parameters is expected to arise downstream from the apex of the wedge as a consequence of spatial variability of sediment deposition characteristics in the radial direction fig 1 in particular the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the major stratigraphic units varies in accordance with the patterns of sedimentation zoning such spatial distributions commonly exhibit transition from high permeability coarse grained sediments near the confluence point to low permeability fine grained deposition downstream from the wedge shaped aquifer samani and sedghi 2015 likewise in a typical alluvial aquifer high permeability units of sand and gravel are usually deposited near mountain area whereas low permeability units of clay and silt manifest themselves toward the edge of the fan liang and zhang 2013 in such hydrogeological settings it would be more realistic to account for the spatial variability of boundary head along the common interface between stream and adjoining aquifer yeh and chang 2006 the boundary head must adjust itself to the stream channel morphology following the changes in bed slope that generally become milder from upland toward plain area head difference across the boundary streams would establish an ambient groundwater flow commonly directed from the high elevation section toward the low elevation section of the stream samani and zarei doudeji 2012 mahdavi 2020 2021 the ambient flow contributes to the water balance at the aquifer scale the hydrogeological conditions characterizing the aquifer borders would affect formation of the well capture zone particularly if pumping lasts for sufficiently long time so that the cone of depression extends laterally and intersects the boundaries of the flow system mahdavi 2019a delineation of the capture zone plays a key role in the design of contaminated groundwater remediation schemes bioremediation and surface subsurface water interactions zarei doudeji and samani 2018 furthermore the aquifer heterogeneity tends to complicate the topology of flow around a pumping well kacimov and obnosov 2018 and alters the pattern of ambient flow through refraction of streamlines strack 2017 a variety of mathematical models have been devoted to boundary value problems bvps that govern the hydraulics of groundwater flow in non rectangular aquifer domains it is common practice to conceptualize an extraction or injection well as a point sink or source by appending to the governing partial differential equation a term linearly proportional to the well discharge multiplied by a dirac delta function the solution of such bvps known as green s function quantifies the aquifer response to concentrated extraction injection activity at an arbitrary point this can be constructed on an analytical or semi analytical basis green s functions based on the image well theory enable handling aquifers bounded by triangular or wedge shaped borders but under certain geometrical constraints it is limited to either isosceles right angled triangle mahdavi and seyyedian 2013 or equilateral triangle mahdavi 2019b and the wedge angle has to be a multiple of 180 samani and zarei doudeji 2012 recently the method of image wells is extended to relax restrictions on specifying the wedge angle nikoletos and katsifarakis 2022 the solution essentially represents an approximate application of image wells though it can predict drawdown in wedge shaped aquifers with desirable accuracy it is worth mentioning that the same bvp has been solved exactly by the method of eigenfunction expansion chan et al 1978 and later on reexamined by schwarz christoffel conformal mapping nagheli et al 2020 both of which are applicable to wedge configurations not necessarily belonging to the aforementioned restricted set few analytical solutions exist for irregularly shaped domains delineating homogeneous aquifers kuo et al 1994 nagheli et al 2020 for heterogeneous aquifers a parameter zonation structure has been included at the cost of satisfying extra conditions to ensure continuities of drawdown and flux on the interface between each two neighboring zones huang and yeh 2016 the same applies when introducing local inhomogeneities in a regional aquifer system strack 2017 semi analytical flow models usually implement laplace transform for time dependent bvp in conjunction with additional integral transform s for spatial variables in most cases evaluation of the associated green s function involves numerical laplace inversion for converting the results back to the physical space green s functions have been constructed semi analytically for drawdown prediction in wedge shaped flow systems examples appeared in the cases of leaky aquifers sedghi et al 2012 multi zone aquifers samani and sedghi 2015 and unconfined fractured aquifers sedghi and zhan 2018 despite the role of ambient flow in regional aquifer systems it is rarely addressed by analytical flow models in wedge shaped aquifers notable examples account for ambient flow arisen either from some features e g lakes river sections areas of recharge at far field samani and zarei doudeji 2012 or from the slopes curves and elevations of the aquifer boundaries yeh and chang 2006 both of these solutions pertain to homogeneous aquifers the former is however restricted to certain wedge configurations while the latter entails special techniques for evaluating the infinite integral of bessel functions furthermore uniform ambient flow can be resulted from boundary streams of constant but contrasting heads mahdavi 2020 2021 to the best of author s knowledge there exists no analytical study to describe how non uniform ambient flow affects the flow topology in heterogeneous wedge shaped aquifer under steady state pumping therefore the present study in aimed at developing analytical solution for such hydrogeological settings with non uniform ambient flow arisen from stream wise varying boundary heads the flow system comprises two zones of constant but contrasting transmissivities which are hydraulically connected through a common interface referred to as interzonal boundary in heterogeneous aquifer systems it is not uncommon to see distinct interfaces across which material properties jump abruptly this may appear as contrasting geological blocks of constant but differing hydraulic conductivity craig 2015 the spatial variability of hydrogeological parameters is often expressed by piecewise constant function samani and sedghi 2015 strack 2017 such an idealization also permits assessment of hydrogeological impacts due to coastal land reclamation hu et al 2008 as well as analysis of mound dynamics in heterogeneous aquifers under precipitation recharge das et al 2014 to address the problem of refraction in two component composite aquifer the green s function from mahdavi 2021 is adopted and further manipulated to impose desirable head variability on the common interface between the surrounding streams and the wedge shaped aquifer the resulting expressions for dual zone potentials are then integrated on the basis of cauchy riemann equations to arrive at spatial distribution of stream function the solutions involve infinite series of trigonometric functions which are then summed analytically in terms of lerch transcendent function this completes a series free closed form representation of the flow net which is easily evaluated for a given set of hydrogeological parameters hypothetical examples illustrate key features of the present solution 2 conceptual model the areal extent of the stream aquifer system suggests formulation of the problem in terms of radial and angular coordinates r θ with the origin of coordinate system at the apex of the wedge fig 2 a the aquifer is confined by horizontal impervious layers on its bottom and top sides but extends to infinity in the radial direction the heterogeneity of flow system is characterized by two zones of constant but contrasting transmissivities specified by t 1 for 0 r r zone 1 and by t 2 for r r zone 2 with r representing the position of interzonal boundary the heterogeneity ratio of adjacent zones is defined by λ t 1 t 2 let φ j r θ denotes the potential which is related to the hydraulic head h j by φ j t j h j for j 1 2 the following boundary value problem bvp governs the spatial distribution of dual zone potentials 1 2 φ j σ j the laplacian is expressed by 2 φ j 1 r r r φ

function is designated by δ having the unit of the reciprocal of the parameter in its argument semi infinite streams s r and s l form the boundary of flow system and delineate the wedge shape aquifer on its right and left borders along rays θ 0 and θ β respectively fig 2 and 0 β π starting from h o at the apex of the wedge the boundary heads decline stream wise with constant slopes α hr 0 and α hl 0 along the segments of s r and s l that surround zone 1 the boundary streams then stabilize constant heads upon reaching zone 2 such variation of boundary heads is consistent with the fact that the stream head must obey the changes in channel bed slope that generally become milder from upland toward plain area this is confirmed through the analysis of morphological configuration of a major alluvial fan in the lake alakol region kazakhstan norini et al 2016 eqs 2 and 3 express stream wise changes in boundary heads 2 o n s r h 1 r 0 h o α hr r 0 r r h 2 r 0 h 1 r 0 r r and 3 o n s l h 1 r

their common interfaces along s r and s l denoted respectively by q sr and q sl 22 q sr r 0 r 1 r φ s 1 θ θ 0 d r f o r r r 0 r 1 r φ s 1 θ θ 0 d r r r 1 r φ s 2 θ θ 0 d r f o r r r which according to cauchy riemann equation 14 can be written as 23 q sr r 0 r ψ s 1 r θ 0 d r f o r r r 0 r ψ s 1 r θ 0 d r r r ψ s 2 r θ 0 d r f o r r r the integrands appearing in 23 are essentially in the form d ψ sj ψ sj r d r yeilding 24 q sr r ψ s 1 r 0 f o r r r ψ s 1 r 0 ψ s 2 r 0 ψ s 2 r 0 f o r r r similar computations result in 25 q sl r ψ s 1 r β f o r r r ψ s 2 r β ψ s 1 r β ψ s 2 r β f o r r r note that r measures the stream wise distance and ψ s 1 0 0 ψ s 1 0 β 0 positive values of q sr and q sl identify net inflow to the aquifer from the reach 0 r of the respective stream and the reach loses water losing reach while negative values indicate net outflow from the aquifer and the reach receives groundwater discharge gaining reach indeed both of 24 and 25 relate the water exchange over a stream reach to the difference between stream functions at the starting and ending points of that reach moreover 24 and 25 enable dealing with stream reaches starting from points other than the apex of the wedge suppose a reach of s r that lies between r 1 and r 2 where r 2 r 1 if q sr r 2 q sr r 1 then reach loses water and recharges the adjoining aquifer otherwise if q sr r 2 q sr r 1 then reach gains water from the discharge of adjoining aquifer fig 3 depicts variation of q sr and q sl as function of stream wise distance r zero value of q sr at point a in case 1 is an indication of equilibrium between the losing and gaining reaches upstream from that point fig 3a to be more specific any stream reach chosen in the interval 0 r p would lose water to the adjoining aquifer because the curve of q sr is monotonically increasing over this interval downstream from r p the curve descends and gaining water from the adjoining aquifer predominates in any stream reach chosen referring to fig 3b any stream reach belonging to interval 0 r p 2 in case 2 0 r p 3 in case 3 would lose water while outside this interval the stream has gaining reaches r r p 2 in case 2 and r r p 3 in case 3 since the volumetric rates of stream aquifer water exchange q sr and q sl in case 2 and q sr in case 3 vanish for r conservation of mass is ensured within the dual zone aquifers of case 2 and case 3 5 3 2 flow nets the flow nets shown in figs 4 to 6 are contour maps of ψ sj and φ sj for the three cases mentioned above and refer to pre pumping state of stream aquifer system it is known that the ambient flow is generally directed from regions of higher water levels toward the regions of comparatively lower heads since head varies more gently along s l compered to s r α hr α hl in case 1 the average head is greater along s l with reference to 2 3 and streamlines mostly terminate into s r as fig 4 indicates therefore the direction of ambient flow is generally from s l to s r in both aquifer zones the heterogeneity of dual zone aquifer causes refraction of streamlines in a manner analogous to snell s law of optics all incoming streamlines that strike the interzonal boundary in zone 1 will refract toward the boundary normal upon arriving at zone 2 which consists of less permeable porous medium at relatively large distances from the apex of the wedge in zone 2 the contributions from the terms involving the ratio r r become negligibly small which in turn simplifies 13 to φ s 2 φ o λ α l r λ α r α l r λ 1 θ β and 19 to ψ s 2 α r α l r β λ l n r under such circumstances the contours of φ s 2 distribute in a fan like pattern while those of ψ s 2 form concentric circles the flow net exhibits such asymptotic behavior at large radial distances in zone 2 fig 4 in hydrogeological context stagnation point can be defined as a location in the flow field where both the radial component q r j r θ φ j r and the angular component q θ j r θ 1 r φ j θ of comprehensive discharge vector vanish strack 2017 a streamline coming from zone 1 locally reverses it direction at point b on s l and produces a streamline toward s r which is labeled bc in fig 4 the ambient flow stagnates at point b because hydraulic gradient is zero everywhere along the constant head stream in zone 2 q r 2 r b β 0 and darcian velocity changes sign normal to the boundary stream at point b q θ 2 r b β 0 also at this point head contour h 97 m joins the boundary stream of the same constant head in zone 2 the flow fields studied in what follows exhibit similar patterns near stagnation points f in fig 7 b and c in fig 8 and c in fig 9 since there would be no flow passing across streamline bc mass must be conserved inside the area enclosed by this streamline reach 0 r b of s l and reach 0 r c of s r in other words net inflow and outflow must counterbalance each other so that q sr r c q sl r b 0 for the enclosed area this condition is met because q sr r c 65 4 m 3 day and q sl r b 65 4 m 3 day as explicitly indicated in fig 3a in case 2 the flow net is symmetric with respect to the aquifer bisector which represent groundwater divide fig 5 as pattern of streamlines reveals the amount of stream water that enters the aquifer returns back to the same stream further downstream both of s r and s l contribute equally to the stream aquifer water exchange with the same rate of q sr q sl fig 3b to construct the flow net of case 3 shown in fig 6 ψ sj and φ sj are evaluated for an extended domain having apex angle of 2 β subject to α hr α hl 0 0015 the lower half of domain occupying the area 0 r and 0 θ β defines the intended solution domain whereby ray θ β resembles an impervious barrier across which no flow would pass due to flow symmetry in the extended domain 5 4 interaction of ambient flow and pumping wells the pumping well develops a cone of depression around the location of withdrawal that extends outward in all directions mutual interaction can thus be expected between groundwater pumping and stream reaches that are located in both upgradient and downgradient directions capture zones are likely to form around the wells with the shape and areal extent controlled by the hydrogeological conditions along the aquifer borders mahdavi 2019a the flow net of case 1 is shown in fig 7 where the contours of hydraulic head are distributed in uniform intervals of 0 25 m exception is the contour line that twists around well 1 and intersects itself at point a the flow stagnates at this point q r 1 r a θ a 0 and q θ 1 r a θ a 0 owing to interference of ambient flow with high hydraulic gradients around well 1 point a is also intersection of four streamlines two originate from and two merge at this point the latter two labeled ac and ad delineate the boundary of the capture zone for well 1 and are commonly referred to as bounding streamlines the capture zone of well 1 is also surrounded by reach 0 r c of s r and reach 0 r d of s l under steady state condition all of the water pumped by each well must come from streamflow depletion as a consequence mass must be conserved inside the well capture zone the amount of water that enters the capture zone from an adjoining stream losing reach can be obtained following an analysis similar to that outlined for the derivation of 24 and 25 the rates of inflow from reaches 0 r c and 0 r d are evaluated as ψ 1 r c 0 ψ 1 0 0 27 48 m 3 day and ψ 1 0 β ψ 1 r d β 72 52 m 3 day respectively the sum of these contributions is thus 100 m 3 day which exactly counterbalances the amount of water that is extracted by the pumping well q w 1 the flow stagnates on the downgradient side of well 2 at point b producing bounding streamlines be and bg that envelop the well capture zone the capture zone of well 2 is supplied on its upgradient side by losing reach r e r g which consists of two sub reaches along s l r e r in zone 1 and r r g in zone 2 the rates of inflow from the sub reaches are respectively ψ 1 r e β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r β 31 17 m 3 day and ψ 2 r β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 r g β 18 83 m 3 day the sum of which equals q w 2 as expectd from the mass balance inside the well capture zone in above expressions the notations r wj and r wj designate whether r approaches r wj from the left side r r wj or from the right side r r wj respectively this accounts for the jump in the functional value of ψ wj across the radial position of the well with reference to 16 and 17 the flow net of case 2 shown in fig 8 reveals formation of capture zone for well 1 which is enclosed by bounding streamlines ad and ae the water pumped by well 1 is supplied partially by reach 0 r e of s r and partially by reach 0 r d of s l which respectively amount to ψ 1 r w 1 0 ψ 1 0 0 ψ 1 r e 0 ψ 1 r w 1 0 73 22 m 3 day and ψ 1 0 β ψ 1 r d β 26 78 m 3 day outside this capture zone well 2 receives contributions from rest of the boundary streams that is r r e on s r and r r d on s l the inflow rates are respectively ψ 1 r 0 ψ 1 r e 0 ψ 2 r w 2 0 ψ 2 r 0 ψ 2 0 ψ 2 r w 2 0 5 94 m 3 day and ψ 1 r d β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r w 1 β ψ 1 r β ψ 2 r β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 r w 2 β ψ 2 β 44 06 m 3 day these contributions sum to extraction rate of well 2 and mass is conserved outside the capture zone of well 1 too to include the effects of pumping wells in case 3 two image wells are needed in the extended aquifer domain mentioned earlier image wells are mirror reflections of the real wells with respect to ray θ β and are located at r wj 2 β θ wj each pumping at the same extraction rate as that of the corresponding real well this ensures imposition of no flow condition across the impervious barrier chan et al 1978 yeh and chang 2006 mahdavi and seyyedian 2013 the flow net constructed in this way is shown in fig 9 where the capture zone of well 1 is delineated by bounding streamlines ad and ae stream reach r d r e loses water at the rate of ψ 1 r e 0 ψ 1 r d 0 100 m 3 day which fully supports the withdrawal at well 1 along impervious barrier two streamlines flow in opposite directions merge together and stagnate at point b this in turn produces a streamline towards well 2 the aquifer of case 4 is exposed to a permanent source of contamination over a segment of s r that lies between r a 500 m to r b 1000 m it is scheduled to contain the contaminated reach through continuous pumping of adjoining aquifer with a well placed on ray θ β 3 downstream from the contaminated reach r w 1 r b the required pumping rate and radial position of the well can be determined following a trial and error process by satisfying the following constraint the containment of contamination is achieved if well capture zone fully encompasses the contaminated reach zarei doudeji and samani 2018 mahdavi 2021 for the well capture zone delineated in this way conservation of mass requires a pumping rate that is equal to inflow from reach r a r b this reads ψ 1 r b 0 ψ 1 r a 0 q w 1 with ψ 1 evaluated based on 21 setting r w 1 1050 m as a first trial results in q w 1 21 62 m 3 day and by assessment of the flow net associated with this pumping rate not shown here one obtains r a 488 6 m and r b 992 9 m for the stream wise extent of the contaminated reach which deviate from desired values the radial position of the well is changed iteratively and above steps are repeated until the solution converges to r w 1 1062 m and q w 1 21 33 m 3 day reproducing the reach extent with acceptable accuracy r a 499 7 m and r b 1000 3 m fig 10 depicts the flow net associated with the converged solution where the well capture zone is delineated by bounding streamlines ac and bc since no contaminated water can escape from the boundaries of the capture zone the portion of flow that is bypassed by the well outside the capture zone will not be disturbed by the polluted inflow from the contaminated reach besides the qualitative assessments described so far it is beneficial to check the validity of present solution against its numerical counterpart the adaptive finite element method implemented in matlab toolbox pdetool is chosen for numerical comparisons mahdavi 2021 2022 the toolbox admits computational domains of finite dimensions therefore the aquifer domain is truncated to a finite wedge of sufficiently large radius 5 r in order to resemble the condition of infinite radial extent as adopted in the forgoing analysis discretization starts from a relatively rough mesh consisting of triangular elements and adaptively refines to get smaller triangles in the regions of high hydraulic gradient close to the wells refinements stop when changes in the solution between two successive steps fall below a prescribed tolerance hydraulic heads are compared with fem results along rays passing through the well positions fig 11 a b and along the aquifer bisector fig 11c excellent agreement is found between the analytical and numerical curves in each case 5 5 uncertainty analysis by multivariate first order variance estimation method uncertainties in the input parameters of hydrologic models may propagate through the model to produce dispersion in the outputs even if the model itself is not corrupted by error or bias in the following analysis it is assumed that the uncertainty of model output is due to stochastic characters of transmissivity field kitanidis 1997 and boundary head estimation hantush and mariño 1994 these are treated as uncorrelated random variables x t 1 t 2 α hr α hl with mean values x k and variances var x k specified for each of k 1 2 3 4 the first order variance estimation method is adopted here for the uncertainty analysis it provides a simple yet reliable way of quantifying the expected variability of model output when one or more model inputs involve some degree of randomness stochastic basic variables provided that the coefficients of variations of stochastic basic variables and the nonlinearity in the model structure are not large benjamin and cornell 1970 based on the taylor series expansion tung and yen 2005 the multivariate first order approximation to the variance of hydraulic head var h j is given by 26 var h j k 1 4 h j x k 2 var x k eq 26 implies each of the stochastic basic variable x k contributes to the dispersion of h j in a manner proportional to its own variance and to a factor which is related to the sensitivity of h j to changes in x k the sensitivity coefficients partial derivatives in 26 are evaluated based on the mean values of stochastic basic variables taking the other model parameters as being deterministic special attention is focused on the percentage contributions of uncertainty of each of x k s to the overall uncertainty of the hydraulic heads in case 1 the percentage contributions are denoted by η j x k and can be computed by rearranging 26 as follows 27 η j x k h j x k 2 var x k var h j since most of the existing analytical solutions encounter singularity at the location of withdrawal it is common practice to monitor the aquifer response to pumping in a close vicinity of the well sedghi et al 2009 the head uncertainties are thus quantified along the arcs r 1 05 r w 1 in zone 1 fig 12 a and r 1 05 r w 2 in zone 2 fig 12b both of which covering the full lateral extent 0 θ β the mean values chosen for the stochastic basic variables are t 1 4 t 2 40 m 2 day and α hr 1 5 α hl 0 0015 for each stochastic basic variable the coefficient of variation is set to c v x k 0 05 and the variance is calculated by the formula var x k c v x k x k 2 tung and yen 2005 from fig 12 some notable observations can be made i the uncertainty associated with the transmissivity of zone 1 η 1 t 1 contributes almost 22 to the overall head uncertainty in the vicinity of well 1 the curve of η 2 t 2 reveals a comparable trend with a slightly higher impact 28 in the vicinity of well 2 ii the curves of η 1 α hr and η 1 α hl show 100 at θ 0 and θ β respectively therefore in the close vicinity of a boundary stream the head uncertainty is entirely contributed by the randomness inherent in the estimation of boundary head slope the curves of η 2 α hr and η 2 α hl behave in a similar fashion iii the curve of η 1 α hr sustains a higher level of head uncertainty compared with what t 1 does even though the magnitude of var α hr is appreciably much smaller than var t 1 this is because of the relative magnitude of sensitivity coefficients h 1 α hr h 1 t 1 so that η 1 α hr η 1 t 1 everywhere along the arc r 1 05 r w 1 and iv practically insignificant contribution can be observed from the curve of η 2 t 1 when quantifying the head uncertainty along the arc r 1 05 r w 2 similarly the curve of η 1 t 2 indicates an almost null impact on the results therefore the head uncertainty in each aquifer zone is not affected by the uncertainty associated with the transmissivity of the adjacent zone 6 conclusions the problem of surface subsurface water interaction was solved analytically for a heterogeneous aquifer surrounded by two intersecting streams of spatially variable heads the aquifer heterogeneity was represented by two zones of contrasting transmissivities and the flow net in such a composite setting was constructed by the method of green s function the results apply to steady state pumping whenever aquifer storage depletion is no longer taking place and streamflow depletion is the only source of the pumped water a number of conclusions can be drawn from the results i interaction of surface subsurface waters was quantified in terms of volumetric rates of water exchange across the stream aquifer interface denoted by q sr and q sl for s r and s l respectively this helps identifying whether a certain reach of the stream is losing or gaining water for example stream wise increase of q sr along a reach implies that it loses water and recharges the adjoining aquifer fig 3 ii variations in the boundary head slope influence the formation of well capture zone among other affecting factors it is confirmed through comparing the flow net in case 1 against that of case 2 the former shows separate capture zones formed around each well fig 7 while the latter reveals formation of only one capture zone fig 8 iii the conservation of mass was assessed at the capture zone scale whereby the portion of water contributed by a certain reach of the stream was expressed as difference between the values of stream functions at the points enclosing that reach the inflow from losing reach es exactly counterbalanced the pumping rate in all cases studied iv by adopting multivariate first order variance estimation method the uncertainty in the head model output was related to stochastic character of dual zone transmissivities and boundary head slopes model inputs for observation points located near a stream the head uncertainty can be entirely attributed to the randomness in the estimation of boundary head slope uncertainties in the estimation of transmissivity only have impact on the model outputs observed near a pumping well however the limitations of the present formulation can be summarized as follows i dual zone wedge shaped aquifer is addressed in this work multi zone representation of aquifer heterogeneity is more realistic comparing to the presented one ii no analytical expression is proposed for the capture zone and capture time iii transient flow in 3 d wedge shaped aquifer is not considered iv streambeds are not explicitly taken into account relaxing the above limitations may render a pure analytical approach mathematically intractable and semi analytical techniques would be required finally as a topic for future research one may notice the generality of 11 in the sense that any head distribution of practical interest e g piece wise constant or piece wise linear can be imposed on the stream aquifer interface but possibly at the cost of evaluating the resulting integral through a numerical algorithm credit authorship contribution statement ali

3171,in recent years the water conflict between competing users in the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river has intensified causing severe social economic and ecological problems this research aims to alleviate water conflicts between multiple objectives that consider eight cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin to be the regulatory bodies using the optimal operation model and fuzzy optimization evaluation model the innovative approach combining the parallel mechanism with optimization algorithms i e flower pollination algorithm and non dominated

basin alleviating water conflicts and ensuring socio economic development and ecological safety keywords heihe river basin reservoir operation water supply dilemma transformation rules fuzzy optimization optimal dispatching scheme 1 introduction water resources in river basins are often responsible for the comprehensive water supply to demanding sectors such as daily life agricultural and industrial production and ecological services as a result there are different levels of water conflict between demanding sectors reservoir construction is a vital engineering method for water resource allocation ostadrahimi et al 2012 scientific and reasonable reservoir operation can effectively alleviate the problem of water shortage in river basins promote economic development and alleviate water conflicts madani and hooshyar 2014 the difference between the objectives in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river basin has resulted in the intensification of water use conflicts which could seriously affect residents lives economic development and ecosystem especially in the heihe river basin of china si et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 meanwhile the law of power generation irrigation and ecological water use in the basin is unclear and lacks a reasonable and practical regulation scheme therefore it is urgent to explore the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs in the heihe river basin to ease the water conflict and achieve comprehensive benefits li et al 2021 wang and guo 2020 due to the difficulty of dimensionality nonlinearities and conflicts between different objectives managing a multi reservoir system of the river basin is a complex task however many researchers stick their guns to realize maximizing the effect of multi objective reservoirs operation huang et al 2014 lee 2012 qi et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 reservoir operation optimization aims to determine release and transfer decisions that maximize water management objectives such as ensuring a reliable water supply hydropower generation ecological irrigation water use and mitigation of downstream floods elahe et al 2018 lin and rutten 2016 wu et al 2016 in recent years researchers have attempted to incorporate the above objectives into reservoir operation and have established the multi objectives optimization model to explore the relationship between various objectives afshar et al 2020 lin et al 2020 tsai et al 2015 uen et al 2018 yang et al 2020 yassin et al 2019 due to the difference in water use in each study basin the corresponding multi objectives optimization models of each basin are established respectively chen et al 2018 goorani and shabanlou 2021 yan et al 2020 yu et al 2021 for instance considering the water use and the comprehensive utilization demand of various ecological functions in different periods of the lower reaches a multi objective dispatching model based on ecology water supply and power generation benefits for the yellow river cascade reservoirs is established wang et al 2017 a multi objective optimal operation model integrating four objectives of power generation ecology water supply and shipping under flood control constraints is constructed and applied to the reservoir system composed of 30 reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river chen et al 2020 the fully fuzzy linear programming reservoir operation model where all parameters and decision variables are fuzzy numbers is demonstrated through a case study of jayakwadi reservoir stage ii maharashtra india with the objectives of maximization of annual releases for irrigation and hydropower generation kamodkar 2013 in addition based on the traditional model new concepts such as risk theory leader follower game and climate change are incorporated into the reservoir operation to improve the model to obtain the optimal operation strategy of the reservoir huang et al 2018 karami and dariane 2018 khorshidi et al 2019 tsai et al 2015 turgut et al 2019 in the past when solving multi objective problems for reservoir management and operation it was often converted into single objective and then solved by mathematical programming algorithms such as linear programming nonlinear programming and dynamic programming cohon and marks 1975 nowadays the evolutionary algorithms are very helpful since complex simulation models can be directly embedded within them and they are also powerful for deriving the trade off among conflicting objectives in multi objective optimization problems haghighi et al 2018 madani and hooshyar 2014 peng et al 2017 schardong et al 2013 many multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been developed to solve various multi objective reservoirs operation models markowska et al 2020 prakash et al 2015 schardong and simonovic 2015 turgut et al 2019 yassin et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 among them the particle swarm optimization pso bai et al 2017 delgarm et al 2016 hojjati et al 2018 tsoukalas and makropoulos 2015 and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii azadeh et al 2017 sadatsakkak et al 2015 uen et al 2018 wang et al 2017 are commonly applied in addition research on the application of novel algorithms improvement of previous algorithms and comparison of algorithm solution performance emerge in endlessly for instance luo et al 2015 proposed a multi objective immune algorithm based on

comparing the performance of the implemented animal inspired evolutionary algorithms in the reviewed literature mahsa et al 2020 lei et al 2018 taormina and chau 2015 dobson et al 2019 discussed the advantages limitations and the scope of application of different optimization methods and provided practical guidelines for matching the properties of a system and operation problem with a suitable optimization method however research on the temporal distribution of water use objectives in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river basin is sparse moreover the competitive relationship among multi objectives considered in previous studies usually describes the qualitative strength chen et al 2018 elahe et al 2018 uen et al 2018 which does not directly form quantitative conversion formulas

operation models respectively 2 proposing parallel flower pollination algorithm and parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm and solving the operation models by using them 3 choosing the optimal dispatching scheme by fuzzy optimization model based on the comprehensive weighting method 2 1 multiple objectives and model construction the selection of objectives strives to be close to the actual river basin situation the reservoir in the upper and middle reaches can generate electricity which is the clean energy by using water head difference there is a large area of farmland in the middle reaches that need the reservoir to allocate water resources for irrigation the water consumption in the middle reaches will crowd out the ecological water supply requirements therefore this paper chooses three objectives of hydropower generation irrigation and ecology to explore the competitive relationship and transformation rules among the multiple objectives power generation irrigation and ecology of reservoirs this paper establishes the complete model for cascade reservoirs including three objectives the index formulas characterizing the three objective values are as follows 2 1 1 multiple objectives 1 power generation of cascade reservoirs 1 e m 1 m t 1 t n m t δ t m 1 m t 1 t k m q f m t h m t δ t where e is total power generation of reservoir group during

reservoir at time t δ t is the time duration 2 irrigation assurance rate the occurrence probability of years in which the expected irrigation water consumption can be fully met in years of irrigation

ecological water discharge from the section at time t 2 1 2 model construction using the above multiple objective formulas the following single objective double objective and triple objective models are established the objective functions and related constraints are presented as follows 1 objectives a objective 1 o1 maximum irrigation water supply assurance rate 6 o 1 max p i b objective 2 o2

medium and long term optimal operation of reservoirs is a nonlinear high dimensional and multi peak complex optimization problem the existing single objective evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm have the defects of low computational efficiency unstable results and easily fall into local optimum the multi objective evolutionary algorithms such as non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii multi objective particle swarm optimization do not consider the diversity and distribution of solutions and have the disadvantages of slow convergence speed and low robustness therefore this paper intends to introduce parallel mechanism optimization algorithms to overcome the above algorithm problems parallel mechanism means that an application is decomposed into multiple subtasks and assigned to different processors on a parallel machine each processor cooperates to execute subtasks in parallel to expand the scale of the problem and improve its efficiency the parallel mechanism optimization algorithm has the advantages of high calculation speed and solution accuracy the basic calculation steps of the matlab parallel mechanism are shown in fig 1 1 parallel flower pollination algorithm p fpa the flower pollination algorithm is a simple and efficient bionic optimization algorithm proposed by yang et al 2014 considering that the principle of flower pollination algorithm is easy to understand has few control parameters strong global optimization ability and the efficiency of parallel computing this paper merges parallel mechanism and flower pollination algorithm to form p fpa to solve the single objective operation models of reservoirs the calculation flow chart of p fpa is based on the conventional reservoir operation model the maximum power generation model is shown in fig 2 2 parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia based on the human immune response principle gong et al 2014 proposed non dominated neighbor immune algorithm for solving multi objective optimization problems due to the low computational complexity the efficient search performance and the uniform distribution of pareto front solutions of non dominated neighbor immune algorithm as well as the high efficiency of parallel computing this paper introduces parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia to solve the double objectives and triple objective operation models of reservoirs the calculation flow chart of p nnia is based on the conventional reservoir operation model the maximum power generation model is shown in fig 3 2 3 multi schemes evaluation model there is an apparent competitive relationship among the three objectives of power generation irrigation and ecology in the optimal operation however it is impossible to select the optimal dispatching scheme directly from a feasible solution set on the pareto frontier curve therefore selecting an optimal dispatching scheme needs to construct an evaluation indicator system and establish a multi schemes evaluation model for scheme optimization and recommendation 2 3 1 evaluation indicator system the cascade reservoirs are mainly responsible for comprehensive utilization tasks such as power generation irrigation and ecology therefore considering different dispatching tasks and the subjective tendency of watershed managers five indicators are selected annual power generation of cascade reservoirs annual water shortage of irrigation maximum water shortage depth of irrigation annual water shortage of ecology and water supply in the critical ecological period each indicator and its meaning are shown in table 1 to eliminate the difference in the optimization direction and dimension of the indicators the indicators are normalized and then the normalized indicators are given weight respectively the ideal weight must reflect the subjective preferences of decision makers and conform to the law of objective development finally achieving the unity of subjective and objective coordination therefore analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method are chosen to determine the subjective and objective weight of the indicators respectively the reasons for choosing are as follows the principle of analytic hierarchy process is to decompose complex decision making problems into objectives criteria programs and other levels and to provide a quantitative basis for analysis by comparing the importance of various related factors layer by layer the weight decision of entropy weight method mainly depends on the discreteness of the indicator data itself which can objectively reflect the information order of the data itself eliminate the subjectivity of the weight of each factor and make the evaluation index more realistic zhou et al 2007 deng et al 2012 gao et al 2016 considering that the importance of each objective and each indicator is mixed with the subjective will of many decision makers the linear weighted combination method in comprehensive weighting method is adopted to determine the comprehensive weights li et al 2014 yang et al 2016 this method can integrate the advantages of two weighting methods effectively avoid disadvantages and take into account the value of indicator and the amount of information it carries to obtain a more accurate comprehensive weight value suppose the subjective weight of the indicator determined by the analytic hierarchy process is w sub the objective weight of the indicator determined by the entropy weight method is w obj then the comprehensive weight of the indicator is calculated as 18 19 where α is the subjective weight distribution coefficient 18 α j 1 m i 1 n w i sub y i j j 1 m i 1 n w i sub y i j j 1 m i 1 n w i obs y i j 19 w int α w sub 1 α w obj where y i j is the normalized value of the i th indicator of scheme j α is the subjective weight distribution coefficient w sub w obj and w int are subjective weight objective weight and comprehensive weight 2 3 2 fuzzy optimization evaluation model because of the complexity and fuzziness of the decision making for the dispatching scheme a fuzzy optimization evaluation model is applied to search for the optimal dispatching scheme for the multi objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs fuzzy optimization is a method of comprehensively evaluating the system by applying fuzzy set theory that is according to the given evaluation standard and measured value the object is evaluated after fuzzy transformation this method can not only comprehensively score the evaluation matrix but also eliminate subjective randomness which is beneficial to the horizontal and vertical comparison between schemes and indicators its basic concepts are as follows fuzziness refers to an objective property in that the concept of the thing itself is not clear there is no exact definition in essence and there is no definite boundary in quantity for example the quality of scheme is fuzzy and needs subjective judgment a fuzzy set is a set used to express fuzziness concepts and contains multiple fuzzy elements given a domain u then a mapping μ a u 0 1 from u to the unit interval 0 1 is called a fuzzy set on u or a fuzzy subset of u fuzzy set can be denoted as a mapping function μ a is called membership function of fuzzy set a for each x u μ a is called membership degree of element x to fuzzy set a chen and zhao 1993 yang et al 2010 assuming that the system has n schemes to be selected to form the optimal set of the system and there are m indicators to judge the optimal scheme of the system there is a system indicator eigenvalue matrix 20 x x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n x i j m n where x i j is the eigenvalue of the i th indicator of scheme j to eliminate the influence of different dimensions of the eigenvalues of m indicators the matrix x is normalized the normalized formulas are respectively used for the indicators that the larger the better and the smaller the better 21 r i j x i j x i 1 x i 2 x i n x i j 0 22 r i j x i 1 x i 2 x i n x i j x i j 0 when x i j 0 r i j 1 where x i j is the eigenvalue of the i th indicator of scheme j r i j is the relative membership degree of scheme j to the i th indicator is large number operator according to the above normalization formula the indicator characteristic matrix x is transformed into membership matrix r 23 r r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 n r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n r i j m n according to the definition of relative membership degree and relative membership function it can be known from the two poles of the intermediate transition of the reference continuum the maximum relative membership degree g i 1 o r g g 1 g 2 g m t 1 1 1 t and the minimum relative membership degree b i 1 o r b b 1 b 2 b m t 1 1 1 t to solve the optimal value of the relative membership u j of scheme j the following optimization criteria are established minimize the square sum of the weighted distance from the superior scheme and the weighted distance from the inferior scheme in scheme j han et al 2003 according to the above fuzzy optimization theory a fuzzy optimization evaluation model is constructed to optimize the multi objective dispatching scheme in this research m evaluation indicators and n dispatching schemes constitute a fuzzy scheme set a a 1 a 2 a n the decision matrix is x x i j m n x i j is the i th indicator value of scheme a j and the relative membership matrix r r i j m n is obtained through normalization among the limited solutions the superior ideal and the inferior solution are defined as g g i m 1 and b b i m 1 where g i j 1 n r i j b i j 1 n r i j i 1 2 n due to the conflict between objectives the ideal optimal solution g generally does not exist for this reason the optimal solution is to choose the most satisfactory solution which is close to g and far from b as far as possible the weighted distance between the solution and g or b is defined as 24 d j w i 1 m w i g i r i j 2 d j w i 1 m w i r i j b i 2 where d j w is the euclidean distance between the scheme a j and the superior scheme d j w is the euclidean distance between the scheme a j and the inferior scheme g i and b i are the maximum and minimum relative membership of the i th indicator w i is the weight of the i th indicator r i j is the relative membership degree of scheme a j to the i th indicator if the degree of membership of scheme a j belonging to g is u j then the degree of membership belonging to b is 1 u j and the comprehensive weight function of the difference between g and b is defined as 25 f j u j w u j 2 i 1 m w i g i r i j 2 1 u j 2 w i r i j b i 2 where f j u j w is the square sum of the weighted distance from the superior scheme and the weighted distance from the inferior scheme in scheme j u j is the relative membership degree of scheme j according to formula 25 for comprehensive weight function the establishment of multi objective fuzzy optimization evaluation model is 26 min f u w f 1 u 1 w f 2 u 2 w f n u n w 27 s t i 1 m w i 1 w i 0 i 1 2 m 0 u j 1 j 1 2 n where min f u w is minimizing the square sum of the weighted distance from the superior scheme and the weighted distance from the inferior scheme in total schemes by constructing the lagrangian function and solving the above decision model the membership degree of schemes calculation formula is 28 u j 1 i 1 m w i g i r i j 2 i 1 m w i r i j b i 2 1 1 d j w d j w 2 1 where u j is the relative membership degree of scheme j g i and b i are the maximum and minimum relative membership of the i th indicator w i is the weight of the i th indicator r i j is the relative membership degree of scheme j to the i th indicator 3 study area and data given the prominent contradiction of water use in heihe river basin the importance of ecological protection and the similarity between basin objectives and models it is chosen as a case study the heihe river basin is located in the middle of the hexi corridor in china and flows through qinghai gansu province and the inner mongolia autonomous region the relevant research data collected includes characteristic parameters of reservoirs and power stations control section runoff data 97 water distribution plan of heihe river etc 3 1 the heihe river basin the heihe river basin is the second largest inland basin in northwest china with a drainage area of 143 000 km2 ranging from 98 101 30 e 37 50 42 40 n li et al 2021 the basin spans three different natural environmental units the upstream area has high terrain severe cold and humid climate the midstream area has flat terrain with significant temperature differences between day and night an important irrigated agricultural area in gansu province the downstream area has an arid climate and sparse vegetation which is the border area surrounding the natural oasis of the gobi desert reservoirs undertake a certain amount of power generation tasks population growth and economic development in the middle reaches of the basin have led to the continuous increase of farmland irrigation water consumption and less and less water has been discharged downstream resulting in further aggravation of ecological and environmental problems in the lower reaches such as river and lake drying up groundwater level decline forest trees dying out and sandstorms the location of the heihe river basin is shown in fig 4 3 2 data situation according to the objectives of water resources development and management in heihe river basin eight cascade reservoirs have been built in the basin s upper reaches they undertake irrigation water supply for agricultural irrigation areas along the line and downstream ecological water supply they also play multiple benefits such as flood control power generation and sand flushing through water storage replenishment function and runoff regulation of runoff regulation reservoirs the leading reservoir is the huangzangsi reservoir with annual regulation performance and seven runoff hydropower stations the dead water level of huangzangsi is 2580 m and the flood control level and normal water level are both 2628 m the node diagram of reservoirs hydrologic station and control section is shown in fig 5 the definitions of acronyms in fig 5 are shown in table 2 this paper has collected the runoff data of qilian zamashike and yingluoxia hydrological stations in the upper reaches of heihe river basin information on each station is shown in table 3 the typical year is determined by the p iii line fit method based on its hydrological station s measured annual runoff data from 1956 to 2014 typical years selected are low flow year 1974 1975 normal flow year 1977 1978 and high flow year 1958 1959 yingluoxia and zhengyixia are the control sections of the middle and lower reaches of the basin the most significant water demand in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin is the agricultural irrigation area according to the huangzangsi reservoir design report the agricultural water supply process undertaken by the reservoir can be obtained on the other hand the water loss in the lower reaches of the heihe river is severe at this stage zhengyixia reservoir is planned and designed and the inflow of the middle reaches of the water will be adjusted meanwhile the yellow river water conservancy commission stipulated that the downstream ecological water supply annual discharge of the zhengyixia section should meet the 97 water distribution plan therefore zhengyixia section is selected as the control section of the downstream ecology among them the 97 water distribution plan is a water distribution plan for the mainstream of the heihe river approved by the ministry of water resources as shown in fig 6 4 results and discussion based on the characteristic parameters of reservoirs power stations and the runoff data of control sections the above methodology is applied to the heihe river basin for the case study the parallel mechanism optimization algorithm is compared with other algorithms and tested to verify the efficiency and stability of parallel flower pollination algorithm through the establishment and solution of the reservoir operation model and scheme evaluation model the time distribution laws of water supply dilemma are clarified the conversion rules between multi objective are revealed and the optimal scheme considering multi objective benefits is recommended 4 1 algorithm evaluation the parallel flower pollination algorithm p fpa is adopted to solve single objective problems while the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia is adopted to solve multi objective problems compared with the most extensive the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii for solving multi objective reservoir operation models non dominated neighbor immune algorithm has advantages in convergence and diversity in addition its pareto solution set distribution is more homogeneous zhang 2013 moreover the p nnia combined with parallel mechanism will significantly improve the computational efficiency based on the original performance therefore this study does not test the solving ability of the p nnia but only evaluates the performance of the p fpa the performance of the p fpa is evaluated with the average annual runoff data as input parameters particle swarm optimization pso and cuckoo search cs are added as reference methods for comparison bai et al 2017 there are two reasons firstly these two algorithms are widely used in reservoir optimization operation which is very representative secondly pso algorithm has advantages in computational efficiency and flexibility while cuckoo algorithm has better optimization ability and stability therefore taking them as the comparison standard the superiority of p fpa is more able to highlight its superiority the algorithm parameters are set as follows number of workers 4 the population size 60 the maximum number of iterations 500 transfer probability of pollination mode 0 8 these specific parameters are ideal parameter values obtained through multiple trial calculations which take into account the operation time and the optimization ability parameter settings with the same meaning in pso and cs are the same as p fpa the test platform software is matlab2016 the software program runs on a quad core computer workstation with 4 gb of memory and a cpu speed of 2 7 ghz the above three algorithms are all random search algorithms thus the search results are unstable therefore the program runs independently ten times and the evolutionary process of three algorithms is obtained as shown in fig 7 the preliminary results findings are listed as follows 1 it is challenging to optimize when pso runs to the 100 th iteration where the individual solution in each group is almost the same cs also falls into a locally optimal solution when it is iterated to the 150 th iteration nevertheless p fpa converges at about the 250 th iteration afterward p fpa convergence slows down but the optimal local solution continuously jumps out and the optimization continues p fpa has robust global search ability and is not easy to fall into premature its adaptability is significantly better than other algorithms 2 from the late crowding degree of the curve cluster p fpa has the densest curve cluster followed by cs and pso is extremely divergent it shows that the stability and accuracy of p fpa are the best the objective value power generation and calculation time of ten independent operations under three algorithms are counted as shown in table 4 it can be seen in table 4 1 p fpa cs pso for each objective value of power generation indicating that p fpa has the outstanding optimizing ability 2 p fpa cs pso for variance indicating that p fpa has excellent stability 3 in terms of calculation time p fpa is about 1 2 of cs and 1 3 of pso indicating that p fpa is extremely efficient in the calculation in summary the optimization ability stability and calculation efficiency of the p fpa show excellent performance with improved computing hardware facilities such as high performance workstation platforms the calculation efficiency of parallel mechanism optimization algorithms will be significantly improved 4 2 models results based on the long series and typical annual runoff data of the heihe river basin the parallel mechanism optimization algorithms are adopted to solve multi objective models the optimized operation results under seven models are analyzed by comparing the impact relationships among the objectives of irrigation ecological water supply and power generation the multi objective competition relationship and transformation rules of the heihe river basin are revealed 4 2 1 single objective operation results by parallel flower pollination algorithm based on the long series of monthly runoff data from 1957 to 2012 this paper applies the parallel flower pollination algorithm p fpa to solve the single objective model 1 3 the calculation results of cascade reservoir groups under different models are shown in table 5 and summarized as follows 1 when irrigation is the objective of regulation it will cause a slight loss of power generation but when choosing ecology it will cause a more significant loss of power generation it can be seen that there is relatively intense competition between power generation and ecological objectives while competition between power generation and irrigation objectives is relatively weak 2 when ecology is the objective of regulation both the irrigation guarantee rate and the annual average water shortage for irrigation have been severely damaged which shows a fortissimo competition between irrigation and ecological objectives 3 when taking power generation as the regulation objective the guaranteed rate and multi year average water shortage of irrigation and ecological objectives are both between the results of model 1 and 2 therefore it indicates that model 3 is a compromise solution between the two contradictory objectives of irrigation and ecology 4 comparing the irrigation and ecological indicators of the three models the ecological objective is more accessible to guarantee than the irrigation objective the main reason is that the supply of ecological water only needs to meet the total amount requirement however the supply of irrigation water needs to meet the total amount and process to further explore the regularity of distribution of the contradiction between irrigation and ecological water supply in the inter annual and annual period the compromise solution model 3 is selected for research the guaranteed year of irrigation water supply in the midstream of the irrigation area is recorded as 1 the downstream 97 water distribution plan the guaranteed year of ecological water supply is recorded as 1 the inter annual distribution of irrigation and ecological guarantee is plotted as shown in fig 8 according to the monthly average water shortage in the irrigation area and the monthly average discharge from the zhengyixia section the annual change process of irrigation water shortage and ecological discharge is shown in fig 9 the results are summarized as follows 1 the contradiction of inter annual water supply is mainly affected by the frequency of incoming water irrigation is more accessible to guarantee than ecological water supply requirements in wet years while the opposite is true in dry years here is why a because the middle reaches of the irrigation water process are certain and the incoming water from upstream is abundant it will naturally meet the requirements of the irrigation water supply b the ecologic water discharge needs to meet the 97 water diversion plan and the extension of the plan curve will inevitably increase the amount of ecological water discharge in wet years as a result ecology is easy to meet in dry years and difficult to meet in wet years 2 the contradiction between irrigation and ecological water supply is mainly concentrated in october and april here s why a to ensure the total amount of downstream ecological water supply the reservoir must ensure a certain amount of water discharge which leads to insufficient water supply during the period of high agricultural water demand and april is exactly the peak of spring irrigation b to ensure water demand in the middle reaches of the irrigation area the reservoir has drained to the dead storage during the flood season from july to september however the incoming water in the following october cannot meet the requirements of the agricultural water supply 4 2 2 double objective operation results by parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm the results of the single objective model clarified the time distribution laws of the contradiction between irrigation and ecological water supply and the competitive relationship among the multiple objectives of power generation irrigation and ecology is analyzed however the laws of conversion between the two objectives are not yet clear therefore based on the runoff data of typical years with high normal and low flow the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia is adopted to solve double objective model 4 6 to analyze the conversion rules between the double objective quantitatively the pareto optimal solution method is adopted to obtain the multi objective optimal operation process of the reservoir group the pareto frontier curves corresponding to different models are shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 1 the pareto curve of irrigation and ecology shows a linear contradiction the reason is that the ecological objective has only total control which makes the law of the two competing water uses relatively simple if irrigation requirements are to be met it will inevitably reduce the discharge of zhengyixia section and destroy the downstream ecological water supply however if ecological water supply is to be met it will occupy the irrigation water which cannot meet the requirements of irrigation guarantee rate therefore the two objectives of irrigation and ecology approximatively show a linear contradiction relationship of 1 1 that is every 100 million m3 reduction of irrigation water supply can increase 100 million m3 of ecological water 2 the pareto curve of irrigation and power generation shows a piecewise linear contradiction the slope of the piecewise straight line decreases which means that the conversion efficiency of irrigation and power generation decreases water flow and water head are the two variables that have the greatest influence on power generation before the turning point the water head h has a greater influence on power generation the raising water head will reduce the discharge which is more unfavorable to the downstream irrigation water so the conversion rate is large after the turning point the water flow q has a greater influence on power generation more discharge can increase the power generation and alleviate the irrigation water shortage in the downstream irrigation area so the conversion rate is small however with the increase in water inflow the segmentation point gradually moves to the left and the conversion efficiency between objectives increases 3 the pareto curve of ecology and power generation has great differences in line type and segmentation points the reason is that the opposite competitive relationship between irrigation and ecological objectives as shown in fig 9 leads to the opposite transformation law between ecology power generation and irrigation power generation that is the conversion rate is the opposite moreover because the ecological objective is based on the annual water discharge requirement of the zhengyixia section and the total ecological discharge requirement is higher in high flow year resulting in the instability of the relationship between ecology and power generation and there are two turning points the linear fitting of the pareto curves of the two objectives is conducted to obtain the conversion formula between the two objectives as shown in table 6 the pareto curve and its piecewise points between the two objectives provide rich decision making schemes for decision makers and help to make dynamic decisions according to the incoming water and maximize the comprehensive benefits simultaneously the conversion formula is conducive to the quantitative description of the conversion between objectives and has important application value 4 2 3 triple objective operation results by parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm to further verify the competitive relationship among three objectives model 7 considering irrigation ecology and power generation is solved by the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia the triple objective relationship is shown in fig 11 the bubble size in the figure represents the power generation the larger the bubble the larger the power generation it can be seen from fig 11 1 the bubbles present approximately parallel linear clusters and the bubbles of the linear clusters gradually increase from bottom left to top right it shows that power generation increases the irrigation and ecological water shortage show an increasing trend which verifies the competitive relationship between power generation and water supply irrigation and ecology 2 the two objectives of irrigation and ecology are linearly related which is consistent with the competitive relationship obtained from double objective operation results in model 4 that is there is the strongest competitive relationship between irrigation and ecological objectives 3 the bubbles are larger in the upper left than in the lower right where the red bubbles with the largest power generation are mainly distributed at both ends of the straight clusters this is consistent with the competitive relationship obtained from double objective operation results in model 5 and 6 that is the power generation ecology competition is stronger than the power generation irrigation objectives 4 2 4 evaluation for dispatching schemes theoretically each non inferior solution in the pareto curve is a feasible dispatching scheme in which the most balanced dispatching scheme is recommended but in fact the absolute equilibrium is difficult to achieve therefore the schemes with the up conversion relationship close to 1 1 are selected schemes 1 5 are selected before and after the turning points including segment points of the irrigation power generation pareto curve similarly schemes 6 10 are selected from the ecology power generation pareto curve to form a set of typical annual dispatching schemes 1 10 based on the theoretical method of the multi scheme fuzzy evaluation model the subjective and objective weights of different typical years are calculated by analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method and the comprehensive weights are calculated by formulas 18 19 the calculation results are shown in table 7 the subjective and objective comprehensive weights are introduced into the formula 28 and the rank of each scheme in different typical years is calculated as shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the optimal dispatching scheme of typical years selected by fuzzy optimization is scheme 5 which is the scheme with the closest transformation coefficient of 1 1 1 among power generation irrigation and ecological objectives scheme 5 also is the turning point scheme of the irrigation power generation pareto curve the optimal scheme has recently received a multi objective equilibrium state which conforms to the rules of multi objective conversion 5 conclusions establishing a harmonious relationship of water use between upstream middle and downstream regions maintaining ecological health and promoting high quality development of the heihe river basin are challenging and crucial tasks in this research we optimize multi objective reservoir operation to reduce water utilization conflicts and improve the benefits of water conservancy facilities for eight cascade reservoirs regulatory bodies seven reservoir operation models are constructed to incorporate the objectives of irrigation hydropower generation and ecological water supply and applied to heihe river basin the innovative approach combining the parallel mechanism with optimization algorithms i e the flower pollination algorithm and the non dominated neighbor immune algorithm are proposed to cope with the dilemmas between three objectives power generation irrigation and ecological water supply based on multiple schemes selected from the multi objective pareto front curve the fuzzy optimization evaluation model recommends the optimal dispatching scheme the main findings are drawn as follows 1 the parallel flower pollination algorithm has the parallel mechanism s efficiency while retaining the algorithm s performance after evaluation the parallel flower pollination algorithm has the advantages of strong optimization ability high stability and outstanding calculation efficiency to solve the reservoir operation problem 2 the annual and inter annual distribution of irrigation ecological water supply dilemmas were clarified among them it is more straightforward to guarantee the irrigation objective than the ecological one during the year the period of water supply dilemmas starts from october to the next april the inter annual water supply dilemma is mainly affected by the frequency of incoming water it is more manageable to guarantee irrigation objectives than ecological objectives in wet years and vice versa in dry years 3 the pareto front curve of power generation irrigation and ecology fig 10 obtained from the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm indicates a piecewise linear dilemma between two objectives where an increase in hydropower output will inevitably result in a decrease in water supply irrigation and ecology the qualitative transformation rules of the two objectives reveal that the competitive relationship between irrigation and ecology is the strongest followed by the competitive relationship between ecology and power generation the competitive relationship between ecology and power generation is relatively weak the transformation rules revealed by the triple objective bubble diagram fig 11 are consistent with the above rules 4 the optimal dispatching scheme in each typical year is scheme 5 which is the scheme with the ratio values of the transformation coefficients among power generation irrigation and ecological objectives the closest to 1 1 1 respectively this provides an essential reference for sustainable management of water resources alleviation of water conflicts and an increase in ecological safety over the heihe river basin in future research there is still a lot of work worthy of in depth research for example each water consumption unit in the middle reaches of the irrigation area is regarded as a whole which is deviated from the actual situation and the water allocation does not consider groundwater moreover the ecological water supply in the lower reaches of the heihe river basin is only studied above zhengyixia section the next step will consider each irrigation area separately and add the groundwater model in the middle reaches and the water resources allocation model in the lower reaches so that decision makers can intuitively perceive the operation effect of the middle and lower reaches in addition current studies are based on historical data in the context of global climate change and hydrological forecasting it is worth considering and measuring whether existing optimal dispatching results can guide and respond to future hydrological situations the next step is to study the coupling of global climate model or hydrological forecast technology with

3171,in recent years the water conflict between competing users in the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river has intensified causing severe social economic and ecological problems this research

optimization optimal dispatching scheme 1 introduction water resources in river basins are often responsible for the comprehensive water supply to demanding sectors such as daily life agricultural and industrial production and ecological services as a result there are different levels of water conflict between demanding sectors reservoir construction is a vital engineering method for water resource allocation ostadrahimi et al 2012 scientific and reasonable reservoir operation can effectively alleviate the problem of water shortage in river basins promote economic development and alleviate water conflicts madani and hooshyar 2014 the difference between the objectives in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river basin has resulted in the intensification of water use conflicts which could seriously affect residents lives economic development and ecosystem especially in the heihe river basin of china si et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 meanwhile the law of power generation irrigation and ecological water use in the basin is unclear and lacks a reasonable and practical regulation scheme therefore it is urgent to explore the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs in the heihe river basin to ease the water conflict and achieve comprehensive benefits li et al 2021 wang and guo 2020 due to the difficulty of dimensionality nonlinearities and conflicts between different objectives managing a multi reservoir system of the river basin is a complex task however many researchers stick their guns to realize maximizing the effect of multi objective reservoirs operation huang et al 2014 lee 2012 qi et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 reservoir operation optimization aims to determine release and transfer decisions that maximize water management objectives such as ensuring a reliable water supply hydropower generation ecological irrigation water use and mitigation of downstream floods elahe et al 2018 lin and rutten 2016 wu et al 2016 in recent years researchers have attempted to incorporate the above objectives into reservoir operation and have established the multi objectives optimization model to explore the relationship between various objectives afshar et al 2020 lin et al 2020 tsai et al 2015 uen et al 2018 yang et al 2020 yassin et al 2019 due to the difference in water use in each study basin the corresponding multi objectives optimization models of each basin are established respectively chen et al 2018 goorani and shabanlou 2021 yan et al 2020 yu et al 2021 for instance considering the water use and the comprehensive utilization demand of various ecological functions in different periods of the lower reaches a multi objective dispatching model based on ecology water supply and power generation benefits for the yellow river cascade reservoirs is established wang et al 2017 a multi objective optimal operation model integrating four objectives of power generation ecology water supply and shipping under flood control constraints is constructed and applied to the reservoir system composed of 30 reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river chen et al 2020 the fully fuzzy linear programming reservoir operation model where all parameters and decision variables are fuzzy numbers is demonstrated through a case study of jayakwadi reservoir stage ii maharashtra india with the objectives of maximization of annual releases for irrigation and hydropower generation kamodkar 2013 in addition based on the traditional model new concepts such as risk theory leader follower game and climate change are incorporated into the reservoir operation to improve the model to obtain the optimal operation strategy of the reservoir huang et al 2018 karami and dariane 2018 khorshidi et al 2019 tsai et al 2015 turgut et al 2019 in the past when solving multi objective problems for reservoir management and operation it was often converted into single objective and then solved by mathematical programming algorithms such as linear programming nonlinear programming and dynamic programming cohon and marks 1975 nowadays the evolutionary algorithms are very helpful since complex simulation models can be directly embedded within them and they are also powerful for deriving the trade off among conflicting objectives in multi objective optimization problems haghighi et al 2018 madani and hooshyar 2014 peng et al 2017 schardong et al 2013 many multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been developed to solve various multi objective reservoirs operation models markowska et al 2020 prakash et al 2015 schardong and simonovic 2015 turgut et al 2019 yassin et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 among them the particle swarm optimization pso bai et al 2017 delgarm et al 2016 hojjati et al 2018 tsoukalas and makropoulos 2015 and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii azadeh et al 2017 sadatsakkak et al 2015 uen et al 2018 wang et al 2017 are commonly applied in addition research on the application of novel algorithms improvement of previous algorithms and comparison of algorithm solution performance emerge in endlessly for instance luo et al 2015 proposed a multi objective immune algorithm based on preference selection to solve the multi objective model considering the flood control and water supply objectives for the ankang reservoir xu et al 2017 proposed a multi starting point multi objective simulated annealing algorithm based on hybrid dynamic programming to solve the problems with the operation of hydropower units to improve the efficiency of reservation management elahe et al 2018 developed the fixed length gene genetic programming as a multi objective optimization method and compared its performance with that of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii in calculating multi objective reservoirs operational rules in terms of algorithm comparison the differences between the proposed animal inspired evolutionary algorithms and their improved versions are identified by comparing the performance of the implemented animal inspired evolutionary algorithms in the reviewed literature mahsa et al 2020 lei et al 2018 taormina and chau 2015 dobson et al 2019 discussed the advantages limitations and the scope of application of different optimization methods and provided practical guidelines for matching the properties of a system and operation problem with a suitable optimization method however research on the temporal distribution of water use objectives in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river basin is sparse moreover the competitive relationship among multi objectives considered in previous studies usually describes the qualitative strength chen et al 2018 elahe et al 2018 uen et al 2018 which does not directly form quantitative conversion formulas by contrast in this research seven reservoir operation models are constructed to incorporate the objectives of irrigation hydropower generation and ecological water supply and applied to heihe river basin the innovative approach combining the parallel mechanism with optimization algorithms i e flower pollination algorithm and non dominated neighbor immune algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal operation models this research would clarify the time distribution laws of water supply dilemmas reveal competitive relation and transformation rules between multiple objectives and extract the conversion formula between multiple objectives based on evaluation indicator system and subjective and objective comprehensive weighting methods i e analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method a fuzzy optimization evaluation model is applied to search for the optimal dispatching scheme for the multi objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 constructs a multi objective operation model involving three parts objectives based on the functions of cascade reservoirs related constraints and optimization algorithms section 3 briefly introduces the study area and related data section 4 presents the results and discussion of the case study and the evaluation of the parallel mechanism optimization algorithm finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the core content of this paper includes three parts 1 establishing single objective double objective and triple objective reservoir operation models respectively 2 proposing parallel flower pollination algorithm and parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm and solving the operation models by using them 3 choosing the optimal dispatching scheme by fuzzy optimization model based on the comprehensive weighting method 2 1 multiple objectives and model construction the selection of objectives strives to be close to the actual river basin situation the reservoir in the upper and middle reaches can generate electricity which is the clean energy by using water head difference there is a large area of farmland in the middle reaches that need the reservoir to allocate water resources for irrigation the water consumption in the middle reaches will crowd out the ecological water supply requirements therefore this paper chooses three objectives of hydropower generation irrigation and ecology to explore the competitive relationship and transformation rules among the multiple objectives power generation irrigation and ecology of reservoirs this paper establishes the complete model for cascade reservoirs including three objectives the index formulas characterizing the three objective values are as follows 2 1 1 multiple objectives 1 power generation of cascade reservoirs 1 e m 1 m t 1 t n m t δ t m 1 m t 1 t k m q f m t h m t δ t where e is total power generation of reservoir group during operation period n m t is the power output of the m th reservoir at time t k m is the output coefficient of the m th reservoir qf m t and h m t are the power generation flow and head of the m th reservoir at time t δ t is the time duration 2 irrigation assurance rate the occurrence probability of years in which the expected irrigation water consumption can be fully met in years of irrigation 2 p i m i n 100 where p i is irrigation assurance rate m i is the number of years when irrigation water consumption is satisfied n is total years calculated 3 irrigation water shortage the difference

ecological water discharge 5 w e w d e i 1 t w s e t where w e is annual water shortage on ecological control section w d e is ecological water discharge requirements from section w s e t is ecological water discharge from the section at time t 2 1 2 model construction using the above multiple objective formulas the following single objective double objective and triple objective models are established the objective functions and related constraints are presented as follows 1 objectives a objective 1 o1 maximum irrigation water supply assurance rate 6 o 1 max p i b objective 2 o2 maximum ecological water supply assurance rate 7 o 2 max p e c objective 3 o3 maximum power generation of cascade reservoirs 8 o 3 max e d objective 4 o4 minimal water shortage for irrigation and

w i w e e 2 constraints the constraints considered include water balance water level flow hydropower generation etc chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 karami and dariane 2018 si et al 2019 turgut et al 2019 a water balance equation of reservoirs 13 v m t 1 v m t q m t q m t δ t where v m t is the storage of the m th reservoir at time t q m t and q m t are the inflow and outflow of the m th reservoir

medium and long term optimal operation of reservoirs is a nonlinear high dimensional and multi peak complex optimization problem the existing single objective evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm have the defects of low computational efficiency unstable results and easily fall into local optimum the multi objective evolutionary algorithms such as non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii multi objective particle swarm optimization do not consider the diversity and distribution of solutions and have the disadvantages of slow convergence speed and low robustness therefore this paper intends to introduce parallel mechanism optimization algorithms to overcome the above algorithm problems parallel mechanism means that an application is decomposed into multiple subtasks and assigned to different processors on a parallel machine each processor cooperates to execute subtasks in parallel to expand the scale of the problem and improve its efficiency the parallel mechanism optimization algorithm has the advantages of high calculation speed and solution accuracy the basic calculation steps of the matlab parallel mechanism are shown in fig 1 1 parallel flower pollination algorithm p fpa the flower pollination algorithm is a simple and efficient bionic optimization algorithm proposed by yang et al 2014 considering that the principle of flower pollination algorithm is easy to understand has few control parameters strong global optimization ability and the efficiency of parallel computing this paper merges parallel mechanism and flower pollination algorithm to form p fpa to solve the single objective operation models of reservoirs the calculation flow chart of p fpa is based on the conventional reservoir operation model the maximum power generation model is shown in fig 2 2 parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia based on the human immune response principle gong et al 2014 proposed non dominated neighbor immune algorithm for solving multi objective optimization problems due to the low computational complexity the efficient search performance and the uniform distribution of pareto front solutions of non dominated neighbor immune algorithm as well as the high efficiency of parallel computing this paper introduces parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia to solve the double objectives and triple objective operation models of reservoirs the calculation flow chart of p nnia is based on the conventional reservoir operation model the maximum power generation model is shown in fig 3 2 3 multi schemes evaluation model there is an apparent competitive relationship among the three objectives of power generation irrigation and ecology in the optimal operation however it is impossible to select the optimal dispatching scheme directly from a feasible solution set on the pareto frontier curve therefore selecting an optimal dispatching scheme needs to construct an evaluation indicator system and establish a multi schemes evaluation model for scheme optimization and recommendation 2 3 1 evaluation indicator system the cascade reservoirs are mainly responsible for comprehensive utilization tasks such as power generation irrigation and ecology therefore considering different dispatching tasks and the subjective tendency of watershed managers five indicators are selected annual power generation of cascade reservoirs annual water shortage of irrigation maximum water shortage depth of irrigation annual water shortage of ecology and water supply in the critical ecological period each indicator and its meaning are shown in table 1 to eliminate the difference in the optimization direction and dimension of the indicators the indicators are normalized and then the normalized indicators are given weight respectively the ideal weight must reflect the subjective preferences of decision makers and conform to the law of objective development finally achieving the unity of subjective and objective coordination therefore analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method are chosen to determine the subjective and objective weight of the indicators respectively the reasons for choosing are as follows the principle of analytic hierarchy process is to decompose complex decision making problems into objectives criteria programs and other levels and to provide a quantitative basis for analysis by comparing the importance of various related factors layer by layer the weight decision of entropy weight method mainly depends on the discreteness of the indicator data itself which can objectively reflect the information order of the data itself eliminate the subjectivity of the weight of each factor and make the evaluation index more realistic zhou et al 2007 deng et al 2012 gao et al 2016 considering that the importance of each objective and each indicator is mixed with the subjective will of many decision makers the linear weighted combination method in comprehensive weighting method is adopted to determine the comprehensive weights li et al 2014 yang et al 2016 this method can integrate the advantages of two weighting methods effectively avoid disadvantages and take into account the value of indicator and the amount of information it carries to obtain a more accurate comprehensive weight value suppose the subjective weight of the indicator determined by the analytic hierarchy process is w sub the objective weight of the indicator determined by the entropy weight method is w obj then the comprehensive weight of the indicator is calculated as 18 19 where α is the subjective weight distribution coefficient 18 α j 1 m i 1 n w i sub y i j j 1 m i 1 n w i sub y i j j 1 m i 1 n w i obs y i j 19 w int α w sub 1 α w obj where y i j is the normalized value of the i th indicator of scheme j α is the subjective weight distribution coefficient w sub w obj and w int are subjective weight objective weight and comprehensive weight 2 3 2 fuzzy optimization evaluation model because of the complexity and fuzziness of the decision making for the dispatching scheme a fuzzy optimization evaluation model is applied to search for the optimal dispatching scheme for the multi objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs fuzzy optimization is a method of comprehensively evaluating the system by applying fuzzy set theory that is according to the given evaluation standard and measured value the object is evaluated after fuzzy transformation this method can not only comprehensively score the evaluation matrix but also eliminate subjective randomness which is beneficial to the horizontal and vertical comparison between schemes and indicators its basic concepts are as follows fuzziness refers to an objective property in that the concept of the thing itself is not clear there is no exact definition in essence and there is no definite boundary in quantity for example the quality of scheme is fuzzy and needs subjective judgment a fuzzy set is a set used to express fuzziness concepts and contains multiple fuzzy elements given a domain u then a mapping μ a u 0 1 from u to the unit interval 0 1 is called a fuzzy set on u or a fuzzy subset of u fuzzy set can be denoted as a mapping function μ a is called membership function of fuzzy set a for each x u μ a is called membership degree of element x to fuzzy set a chen and zhao 1993 yang et al 2010 assuming that the system has n schemes to be selected to form the optimal set of the system and there are m indicators to judge the optimal scheme of the system there is a system indicator eigenvalue matrix 20 x x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n x i j m n where x i j is the eigenvalue of the i th indicator of scheme j to eliminate the influence of different dimensions of the eigenvalues of m indicators the matrix x is normalized the normalized formulas are respectively used for the indicators that the larger the better and the smaller the better 21 r i j x i j x i 1 x i 2 x i n x i j 0 22 r i j x i 1 x i 2 x i n x i j x i j 0 when x i j 0 r i j 1 where x i j is the eigenvalue of the i th indicator of scheme j r i j is the relative membership degree of scheme j to the i th indicator is large number operator according to the above normalization formula the indicator characteristic matrix x is transformed into membership matrix r 23 r r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 n r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n r i j m n according to the definition of relative membership degree and relative membership function it can be known from the two poles of the intermediate transition of the reference continuum the maximum relative membership degree g i 1 o r g g 1 g 2 g m t 1 1 1 t and the minimum relative membership degree b i 1 o r b b 1 b 2 b m t 1 1 1 t to solve the optimal value of the relative membership u j of scheme j the following optimization criteria are established minimize the square sum of the weighted distance from the superior scheme and the weighted distance from the inferior scheme in scheme j han et al 2003 according to the above fuzzy optimization theory a fuzzy optimization evaluation model is constructed to optimize the multi objective dispatching scheme in this research m evaluation indicators and n dispatching schemes constitute a fuzzy scheme set a a 1 a 2 a n the decision matrix is x x i j m n x i j is the i th indicator value of scheme a j and the relative membership matrix r r i j m n is obtained through normalization among the limited solutions the superior ideal and the inferior solution are defined as g g i m 1 and b b i m 1 where g i j 1 n r i j b i j 1 n r i j i 1 2 n due to the conflict between objectives the ideal optimal solution g generally does not exist for this reason the optimal solution is to choose the most satisfactory solution which is close to g and far from b as far as possible the weighted distance between the solution and g or b is defined as 24 d j w i 1 m w i g i r i j 2 d j w i 1 m w i r i j b i 2 where d j w is the euclidean distance between the scheme a j and the superior scheme d j w is the euclidean distance between the scheme a j and the inferior scheme g i and b i are the maximum and minimum relative membership of the i th indicator w i is the weight of the i th indicator r i j is the relative membership degree of scheme a j to the i th indicator if the degree of membership of scheme a j belonging to g is u j then the degree of membership belonging to b is 1 u j and the comprehensive weight function of the difference between g and b is defined as 25 f j u j w u j 2 i 1 m w i g i r i j 2 1 u j 2 w i r i j b i 2 where f j u j w is the square sum of the weighted distance from the superior scheme and the weighted distance from the inferior scheme in scheme j u j is the relative membership degree of scheme j according to formula 25 for comprehensive weight function the establishment of multi objective fuzzy optimization evaluation model is 26 min f u w f 1 u 1 w f 2 u 2 w f n u n w 27 s t i 1 m w i 1 w i 0 i 1 2 m 0 u j 1 j 1 2 n where min f u w is minimizing the square sum of the weighted distance from the superior scheme and the weighted distance from the inferior scheme in total schemes by constructing the lagrangian function and solving the above decision model the membership degree of schemes calculation formula is 28 u j 1 i 1 m w i g i r i j 2 i 1 m w i r i j b i 2 1 1 d j w d j w 2 1 where u j is the relative membership degree of scheme j g i and b i are the maximum and minimum relative membership of the i th indicator w i is the weight of the i th indicator r i j is the relative membership degree of scheme j to the i th indicator 3 study area and data given the prominent contradiction of water use in heihe river basin the importance of ecological protection and the similarity between basin objectives and models it is chosen as a case study the heihe river basin is located in the middle of the hexi corridor in china and flows through qinghai gansu province and the inner mongolia autonomous region the relevant research data collected includes characteristic parameters of reservoirs and power stations control section runoff data 97 water distribution plan of heihe river etc 3 1 the heihe river basin the heihe river basin is the second largest inland basin in northwest china with a drainage area of 143 000 km2 ranging from 98 101 30 e 37 50 42 40 n li et al 2021 the basin spans three different natural environmental units the upstream area has high terrain severe cold and humid climate the midstream area has flat terrain with significant temperature differences between day and night an important irrigated agricultural area in gansu province the downstream area has an arid climate and sparse vegetation which is the border area surrounding the natural oasis of the gobi desert reservoirs undertake a certain amount of power generation tasks population growth and economic development in the middle reaches of the basin have led to the continuous increase of farmland irrigation water consumption and less and less water has been discharged downstream resulting in further aggravation of ecological and environmental problems in the lower reaches such as river and lake drying up groundwater level decline forest trees dying out and sandstorms the location of the heihe river basin is shown in fig 4 3 2 data situation according to the objectives of water resources development and management in heihe river basin eight cascade reservoirs have been built in the basin s upper reaches they undertake irrigation water supply for agricultural irrigation areas along the line and downstream ecological water supply they also play multiple benefits such as flood control power generation and sand flushing through water storage replenishment function and runoff regulation of runoff regulation reservoirs the leading reservoir is the huangzangsi reservoir with annual regulation performance and seven runoff hydropower stations the dead water level of huangzangsi is 2580 m and the flood control level and normal water level are both 2628 m the node diagram of reservoirs hydrologic station and control section is shown in fig 5 the definitions of acronyms in fig 5 are shown in table 2 this paper has collected the runoff data of qilian zamashike and yingluoxia hydrological stations in the upper reaches of heihe river basin information on each station is shown in table 3 the typical year is determined by the p iii line fit method based on its hydrological station s measured annual runoff data from 1956 to 2014 typical years selected are low flow year 1974 1975 normal flow year 1977 1978 and high flow year 1958 1959 yingluoxia and zhengyixia are the control sections of the middle and lower reaches of the basin the most significant water demand in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin is the agricultural irrigation area according to the huangzangsi reservoir design report the agricultural water supply process undertaken by the reservoir can be obtained on the other hand the water loss in the lower reaches of the heihe river is severe at this stage zhengyixia reservoir is planned and designed and the inflow of the middle reaches of the water will be adjusted meanwhile the yellow river water conservancy commission stipulated that the downstream ecological water supply annual discharge of the zhengyixia section should meet the 97 water distribution plan therefore zhengyixia section is selected as the control section of the downstream ecology among them the 97 water distribution plan is a water distribution plan for the mainstream of the heihe river approved by the ministry of water resources as shown in fig 6 4 results and discussion based on the characteristic parameters of reservoirs power stations and the runoff data of control sections the above methodology is applied to the heihe river basin for the case study the parallel mechanism optimization algorithm is compared with other algorithms and tested to verify the efficiency and stability of parallel flower pollination algorithm through the establishment and solution of the reservoir operation model and scheme evaluation model the time distribution laws of water supply dilemma are clarified the conversion rules between multi objective are revealed and the optimal scheme considering multi objective benefits is recommended 4 1 algorithm evaluation the parallel flower pollination algorithm p fpa is adopted to solve single objective problems while the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia is adopted to solve multi objective problems compared with the most extensive the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii for solving multi objective reservoir operation models non dominated neighbor immune algorithm has advantages in convergence and diversity in addition its pareto solution set distribution is more homogeneous zhang 2013 moreover the p nnia combined with parallel mechanism will significantly improve the computational efficiency based on the original performance therefore this study does not test the solving ability of the p nnia but only evaluates the performance of the p fpa the performance of the p fpa is evaluated with the average annual runoff data as input parameters particle swarm optimization pso and cuckoo search cs are added as reference methods for comparison bai et al 2017 there are two reasons firstly these two algorithms are widely used in reservoir optimization operation which is very representative secondly pso algorithm has advantages in computational efficiency and flexibility while cuckoo algorithm has better optimization ability and stability therefore taking them as the comparison standard the superiority of p fpa is more able to highlight its superiority the algorithm parameters are set as follows number of workers 4 the population size 60 the maximum number of iterations 500 transfer probability of pollination mode 0 8 these specific parameters are ideal parameter values obtained through multiple trial calculations which take into account the operation time and the optimization ability parameter settings with the same meaning in pso and cs are the same as p fpa the test platform software is matlab2016 the software program runs on a quad core computer workstation with 4 gb of memory and a cpu speed of 2 7 ghz the above three algorithms are all random search algorithms thus the search results are unstable therefore the program runs independently ten times and the evolutionary process of three algorithms is obtained as shown in fig 7 the preliminary results findings are listed as follows 1 it is challenging to optimize when pso runs to the 100 th iteration where the individual solution in each group is almost the same cs also falls into a locally optimal solution when it is iterated to the 150 th iteration nevertheless p fpa converges at about the 250 th iteration afterward p fpa convergence slows down but the optimal local solution continuously jumps out and the optimization continues p fpa has robust global search ability and is not easy to fall into premature its adaptability is significantly better than other algorithms 2 from the late crowding degree of the curve cluster p fpa has the densest curve cluster followed by cs and pso is extremely divergent it shows that the stability and accuracy of p fpa are the best the objective value power generation and calculation time of ten independent operations under three algorithms are counted as shown in table 4 it can be seen in table 4 1 p fpa cs pso for each objective value of power generation indicating that p fpa has the outstanding optimizing ability 2 p fpa cs pso for variance indicating that p fpa has excellent stability 3 in terms of calculation time p fpa is about 1 2 of cs and 1 3 of pso indicating that p fpa is extremely efficient in the calculation in summary the optimization ability stability and calculation efficiency of the p fpa show excellent performance with improved computing hardware facilities such as high performance workstation platforms the calculation efficiency of parallel mechanism optimization algorithms will be significantly improved 4 2 models results based on the long series and typical annual runoff data of the heihe river basin the parallel mechanism optimization algorithms are adopted to solve multi objective models the optimized operation results under seven models are analyzed by comparing the impact relationships among the objectives of irrigation ecological water supply and power generation the multi objective competition relationship and transformation rules of the heihe river basin are revealed 4 2 1 single objective operation results by parallel flower pollination algorithm based on the long series of monthly runoff data from 1957 to 2012 this paper applies the parallel flower pollination algorithm p fpa to solve the single objective model 1 3 the calculation results of cascade reservoir groups under different models are shown in table 5 and summarized as follows 1 when irrigation is the objective of regulation it will cause a slight loss of power generation but when choosing ecology it will cause a more significant loss of power generation it can be seen that there is relatively intense competition between power generation and ecological objectives while competition between power generation and irrigation objectives is relatively weak 2 when ecology is the objective of regulation both the irrigation guarantee rate and the annual average water shortage for irrigation have been severely damaged which shows a fortissimo competition between irrigation and ecological objectives 3 when taking power generation as the regulation objective the guaranteed rate and multi year average water shortage of irrigation and ecological objectives are both between the results of model 1 and 2 therefore it indicates that model 3 is a compromise solution between the two contradictory objectives of irrigation and ecology 4 comparing the irrigation and ecological indicators of the three models the ecological objective is more accessible to guarantee than the irrigation objective the main reason is that the supply of ecological water only needs to meet the total amount requirement however the supply of irrigation water needs to meet the total amount and process to further explore the regularity of distribution of the contradiction between irrigation and ecological water supply in the inter annual and annual period the compromise solution model 3 is selected for research the guaranteed year of irrigation water supply in the midstream of the irrigation area is recorded as 1 the downstream 97 water distribution plan the guaranteed year of ecological water supply is recorded as 1 the inter annual distribution of irrigation and ecological guarantee is plotted as shown in fig 8 according to the monthly average water shortage in the irrigation area and the monthly average discharge from the zhengyixia section the annual change process of irrigation water shortage and ecological discharge is shown in fig 9 the results are summarized as follows 1 the contradiction of inter annual water supply is mainly affected by the frequency of incoming water irrigation is more accessible to guarantee than ecological water supply requirements in wet years while the opposite is true in dry years here is why a because the middle reaches of the irrigation water process are certain and the incoming water from upstream is abundant it will naturally meet the requirements of the irrigation water supply b the ecologic water discharge needs to meet the 97 water diversion plan and the extension of the plan curve will inevitably increase the amount of ecological water discharge in wet years as a result ecology is easy to meet in dry years and difficult to meet in wet years 2 the contradiction between irrigation and ecological water supply is mainly concentrated in october and april here s why a to ensure the total amount of downstream ecological water supply the reservoir must ensure a certain amount of water discharge which leads to insufficient water supply during the period of high agricultural water demand and april is exactly the peak of spring irrigation b to ensure water demand in the middle reaches of the irrigation area the reservoir has drained to the dead storage during the flood season from july to september however the incoming water in the following october cannot meet the requirements of the agricultural water supply 4 2 2 double objective operation results by parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm the results of the single objective model clarified the time distribution laws of the contradiction between irrigation and ecological water supply and the competitive relationship among the multiple objectives of power generation irrigation and ecology is analyzed however the laws of conversion between the two objectives are not yet clear therefore based on the runoff data of typical years with high normal and low flow the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia is adopted to solve double objective model 4 6 to analyze the conversion rules between the double objective quantitatively the pareto optimal solution method is adopted to obtain the multi objective optimal operation process of the reservoir group the pareto frontier curves corresponding to different models are shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 1 the pareto curve of irrigation and ecology shows a linear contradiction the reason is that the ecological objective has only total control which makes the law of the two competing water uses relatively simple if irrigation requirements are to be met it will inevitably reduce the discharge of zhengyixia section and destroy the downstream ecological water supply however if ecological water supply is to be met it will occupy the irrigation water which cannot meet the requirements of irrigation guarantee rate therefore the two objectives of irrigation and ecology approximatively show a linear contradiction relationship of 1 1 that is every 100 million m3 reduction of irrigation water supply can increase 100 million m3 of ecological water 2 the pareto curve of irrigation and power generation shows a piecewise linear contradiction the slope of the piecewise straight line decreases which means that the conversion efficiency of irrigation and power generation decreases water flow and water head are the two variables that have the greatest influence on power generation before the turning point the water head h has a greater influence on power generation the raising water head will reduce the discharge which is more unfavorable to the downstream irrigation water so the conversion rate is large after the turning point the water flow q has a greater influence on power generation more discharge can increase the power generation and alleviate the irrigation water shortage in the downstream irrigation area so the conversion rate is small however with the increase in water inflow the segmentation point gradually moves to the left and the conversion efficiency between objectives increases 3 the pareto curve of ecology and power generation has great differences in line type and segmentation points the reason is that the opposite competitive relationship between irrigation and ecological objectives as shown in fig 9 leads to the opposite transformation law between ecology power generation and irrigation power generation that is the conversion rate is the opposite moreover because the ecological objective is based on the annual water discharge requirement of the zhengyixia section and the total ecological discharge requirement is higher in high flow year resulting in the instability of the relationship between ecology and power generation and there are two turning points the linear fitting of the pareto curves of the two objectives is conducted to obtain the conversion formula between the two objectives as shown in table 6 the pareto curve and its piecewise points between the two objectives provide rich decision making schemes for decision makers and help to make dynamic decisions according to the incoming water and maximize the comprehensive benefits simultaneously the conversion formula is conducive to the quantitative description of the conversion between objectives and has important application value 4 2 3 triple objective operation results by parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm to further verify the competitive relationship among three objectives model 7 considering irrigation ecology and power generation is solved by the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm p nnia the triple objective relationship is shown in fig 11 the bubble size in the figure represents the power generation the larger the bubble the larger the power generation it can be seen from fig 11 1 the bubbles present approximately parallel linear clusters and the bubbles of the linear clusters gradually increase from bottom left to top right it shows that power generation increases the irrigation and ecological water shortage show an increasing trend which verifies the competitive relationship between power generation and water supply irrigation and ecology 2 the two objectives of irrigation and ecology are linearly related which is consistent with the competitive relationship obtained from double objective operation results in model 4 that is there is the strongest competitive relationship between irrigation and ecological objectives 3 the bubbles are larger in the upper left than in the lower right where the red bubbles with the largest power generation are mainly distributed at both ends of the straight clusters this is consistent with the competitive relationship obtained from double objective operation results in model 5 and 6 that is the power generation ecology competition is stronger than the power generation irrigation objectives 4 2 4 evaluation for dispatching schemes theoretically each non inferior solution in the pareto curve is a feasible dispatching scheme in which the most balanced dispatching scheme is recommended but in fact the absolute equilibrium is difficult to achieve therefore the schemes with the up conversion relationship close to 1 1 are selected schemes 1 5 are selected before and after the turning points including segment points of the irrigation power generation pareto curve similarly schemes 6 10 are selected from the ecology power generation pareto curve to form a set of typical annual dispatching schemes 1 10 based on the theoretical method of the multi scheme fuzzy evaluation model the subjective and objective weights of different typical years are calculated by analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method and the comprehensive weights are calculated by formulas 18 19 the calculation results are shown in table 7 the subjective and objective comprehensive weights are introduced into the formula 28 and the rank of each scheme in different typical years is calculated as shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the optimal dispatching scheme of typical years selected by fuzzy optimization is scheme 5 which is the scheme with the closest transformation coefficient of 1 1 1 among power generation irrigation and ecological objectives scheme 5 also is the turning point scheme of the irrigation power generation pareto curve the optimal scheme has recently received a multi objective equilibrium state which conforms to the rules of multi objective conversion 5 conclusions establishing a harmonious relationship of water use between upstream middle and downstream regions maintaining ecological health and promoting high quality development of the heihe river basin are challenging and crucial tasks in this research we optimize multi objective reservoir operation to reduce water utilization conflicts and improve the benefits of water conservancy facilities for eight cascade reservoirs regulatory bodies seven reservoir operation models are constructed to incorporate the objectives of irrigation hydropower generation and ecological water supply and applied to heihe river basin the innovative approach combining the parallel mechanism with optimization algorithms i e the flower pollination algorithm and the non dominated neighbor immune algorithm are proposed to cope with the dilemmas between three objectives power generation irrigation and ecological water supply based on multiple schemes selected from the multi objective pareto front curve the fuzzy optimization evaluation model recommends the optimal dispatching scheme the main findings are drawn as follows 1 the parallel flower pollination algorithm has the parallel mechanism s efficiency while retaining the algorithm s performance after evaluation the parallel flower pollination algorithm has the advantages of strong optimization ability high stability and outstanding calculation efficiency to solve the reservoir operation problem 2 the annual and inter annual distribution of irrigation ecological water supply dilemmas were clarified among them it is more straightforward to guarantee the irrigation objective than the ecological one during the year the period of water supply dilemmas starts from october to the next april the inter annual water supply dilemma is mainly affected by the frequency of incoming water it is more manageable to guarantee irrigation objectives than ecological objectives in wet years and vice versa in dry years 3 the pareto front curve of power generation irrigation and ecology fig 10 obtained from the parallel non dominated neighbor immune algorithm indicates a piecewise linear dilemma between two objectives where an increase in hydropower output will inevitably result in a decrease in water supply irrigation and ecology the qualitative transformation rules of the two objectives reveal that the competitive relationship between irrigation and ecology is the strongest followed by the competitive relationship between ecology and power generation the competitive relationship between ecology and power generation is relatively weak the transformation rules revealed by the triple objective bubble diagram fig 11 are consistent with the above rules 4 the optimal dispatching scheme in each typical year is scheme 5 which is the scheme with the ratio values of the transformation coefficients among power generation irrigation and ecological objectives the closest to 1 1 1 respectively this provides an essential reference for sustainable management of water resources alleviation of water conflicts and an increase in ecological safety over the heihe river basin in future research there is still a lot of work worthy of in depth research for example each water consumption unit in the middle reaches of the irrigation area is regarded as a whole which is deviated from the actual situation and the water allocation does not consider groundwater moreover the ecological water supply in the lower reaches of the heihe river basin is only studied above zhengyixia section the next step will consider each irrigation area separately and add the groundwater model in the middle reaches and the water resources allocation model in the lower reaches so that decision makers can intuitively perceive the operation effect of the middle and lower reaches in addition current studies are based on historical data in the context of global climate change and hydrological forecasting it is worth considering and measuring whether existing optimal dispatching results can guide and respond to future hydrological situations the next step is to study the coupling of global climate model or hydrological forecast technology with

drought causes environmental damage economic and social disadvantages it is considered less seriously than other phenomena sharma and sen 2021 shahpari et al 2021 dobler morales and bocco 2021 lack of groundwater resources as a crisis requires proper management and monitoring of the groundwater abstraction especially in areas with surface water shortages where water demands are provided from groundwater resources jaafarzadeh et al 2021 shukla et al 2021 naseri et al 2021 groundwater reserves are very valuable especially in arid and semi arid regions due to less precipitation than evapotranspiration with the advancement of science in the last century the study of water resources and proper planning for greater and better access to these resources has always been a key issue in scientific research amiri et al 2021a panneerselvam et al 2021 pool et al 2021 in many areas groundwater level changes are measured by applying piezometers and monitoring observation wells measuring changes with this approach on a global scale will be very costly and time consuming also the lack of accurate spatial resolution and measuring point has limited the use of this method khorrami et al

field created with changes in groundwater these changes can be converted into total changes in water on the earth by obtaining changes in soil moisture which play an essential role in regional water changes as well as other factors the remaining amount can be attributed to groundwater xu et al 2021 khorrami et al 2021 massoud et al 2021b jahangir and soltani 2019 the distance between the grace

calculating the value of twsa utilizing grace gfo satellites data b fill the information gap between grace and grace fo c find the best gaussian filter radius in kilometer gfrk to calculate the value of twsa d twsa estimation utilizing least number of inputs e creating a basic equation to calculating twsa utilizing grace gfo considering the importance of lake urmia basin lub and the fact that the drying of lake urmia as a crisis can play an important role in creating natural and human problems and hazards in this study the amount of twsa and gwa in lub are studied and predicted for the future lub is located in the northwest of iran and lake urmia is located there which is in danger of drought lack of water in this area and the subsequent drying of lake urmia has many destructive effects most of which are salt dust due to the development of dust production centers in lake urmia and adjacent saline areas and its development into agricultural and residential areas also the loss of agricultural lands and effects on production increased migration from adjacent areas to the lake and especially the evacuation of villages near the lake and changes and fluctuations in climatic parameters of the region are among these risks foroumandi et al 2021 foroumandi et al 2022a foroumandi et al 2022b 2 materials and methods the present research applied three types of datasets

result in the better performance in gfrk here the gfrk value has been calculated without using a filter and by changing the gfrk value 100 1200 with the results presented in fig 6 the results show that if gfrk is not used in estimating the twsa value the following are obtained rmse 37 287 mae 29 936 si 36 995 r 0 551 and rms 104 218 the use of 100 gfrk in estimating the twsa value caused a relative improvement in the results and yielded the statistical parameters as rmse 37 289 mae 29 904 si 36 996 r 0 555 and rms 104 189 from 100 gfrk onwards with increasing gfrk value the efficiency of twsa estimation has decreased for 200 grfk the value of r decreased to 0 54 and also the error values increased as rmse 37 336 mae 30 061 si 37 043 and rms 104 440 which indicates a decrease in performance compared to 100 grfk at 300 gfrk the performance of r rmse mae si and rms decreased by 6 13 0 73 1 33 0 73 and 0 9 respectively as the grfk value increases the performance of twsa calculating decreases and reached the lowest value at 1200 grfk at 1200 grfk the r value has reached 0 021 and rmse mae si and rms reached to 46 823 38 37 46 455 and 131 648 respectively as can be seen in the figure the rms value at 100 gfrk is minimum which indicates its better efficiency in estimating the twsa value in the study area thus 100 gfrk has the best performance in estimating the value of twsa in the study area 3 3 ua results for grace gfo by different gfrks ua for different gfrk values in the twsa calculation shows that in the non filter the mee value is 3 132 and the sdee value is 39 04 the value of wub in this case is equal to 6 29 which is the value of uncertainty in the twsa calculation use of gfrk 100 shows that the mee value has diminished by 0 16 and reached 3 127 while the sdee value is unchanged compared to non filter the value of wub in this case has reached 6 28 which indicates an improvement in the performance of gfrk 100 by 0 16 compared to the previous case using gfrk 200 the mee value has reached 3 116 and the sdee value has grown by 0 21 to 39 12 the wub value in this case has reached 6 31 which is a rise of 0 48 compared to gfrk 100 here due to the positive and negative changes of twsa the mee value cannot be a suitable criterion and as can be seen with increasing gfrk value despite reduction of wub mee value has dropped up to this point gfrk 100 has had the best performance and the lowest uncertainty compared to other gfrk values for gfrk 300 the sdee increased by 0 9 compared to gfrk 100 to 39 39 and wub is equal to 6 35 showing a performance reduction of 1 12 according to the table the value of sdee and wub has been calculated up to gfrk 1200 and their value has increased at gfrk 1200 it has reached the maximum value showing a 25 32 increase in the value of wub and 24 97 in the value of sdee so gfrk 100 is the optimal value in calculating twsa table 1 3 4 results of gmdh modeling in this study the gmdh model was used to model the amount of twsa in the study area for this issue two methods were considered for modeling the twsa value using input parameters by ml in the first method the data had a trend while in the second method the data trend was deleted to remove the data trend a mean of ten pixels was obtained and by routing the formula related to its line was calculated finally the trend in the data was deleted using this relation 15 trend grace g f o 1 0498 x 118 88 trend removal from existing data revealed that modeling results using trendless data would provide better results so for the modeling the data trend was deleted and finally this trend was added to the data again for the modeling six inputs sm1 sm2 sm3 at et and pcsw are used gmdh structures for 2 3 4 5 and 6 gmdh by 2 inputs model 1 gmdh m1 gmdh by 3 inputs model 2 gmdh m2 gmdh by 4 inputs model 3 gmdh m3 gmdh by 5 inputs model 4 gmdh m4 gmdh by 6 inputs model 5 gmdh m5 were obtained the inputs for each structure are shown in fig 7 to obtain the best structure for the gmdh model the number of inputs was limited and by creating all necessary conditions for the modeling the best model with varying numbers of inputs was obtained according to the figure initially the amount of model inputs was limited to two the results showed that the use of sm2 and et had the best results compared to other inputs then this was done with three inputs and sm2 et and at had the best results compared to other inputs this was done for 4 and 5 inputs and the best combination was selected finally all inputs were used to calculate the twsa value according to fig 7 sm2 and et inputs are the most important ones in calculating the twsa value and have been presented in all models in this research the at value is also observed in all models except in the gmdh m1 model table 2 reports the statistical parameters rmse mae r and aic for modeling the twsa value with two six inputs gmdh m1 results with two inputs sm2 and et have the best results compared to the other models with two inputs in this model the value of r is equal to 0 705 the rmse and mae values are 36 352 and 29 133 respectively the aic value for the gmdh m1 is 1240 89 in gmdh m2 the sm2 at and et parameters have the best results compared to other inputs here the r value has increased to 0 732 suggesting a better performance compared to gmdh m1 also the values of rmse and mae are 34 965 and 27 819 respectively the value of aic in this model with 0 59 improvement has shown a better performance than the gmdh m1 for gmdh m3 with four inputs which include sm2 at et and pcsw the performance of the model compared to the gmdh m2 model for r rmse mae and aic has dropped by 0 74 0 96 0 184 and 0 26 respectively for gmdh m4 with five inputs sm1 sm2 at et and pcsw the value of r has reached 0 728 the aic value compared to the gmdh m2 model increased by 0 17 and reached 1235 69 the rmse and mae values are 33 38 and 26 69 respectively here despite the reduction in the errors this decline has not been so large and it has not affected the results much also the value of r is higher in the gmdh m2 model the aic value in this model has increased so gmdh m2 model is still introduced as the superior model the gmdh m5 model was calculated for six input parameters sm1 sm2 sm3 at et and pcsw the r and errors of rmse and mae are very close to the gmdh m2 model and have reached 0 734 34 793 and 27 662 respectively the r value gas improved by 0 31 while the rmse and mae values are improved by 0 49 and 0 56 respectively which is a very small value due to the addition of three new inputs to the model the aic value has also increased significantly and reached 1255 9 1 81 increase thus gmdh m2 is introduced as the best model in estimating twsa value fig 8 depicts the structure of the best gmdh model gmdh m2 in this model from six inputs were used to model the twsa value x1 sm1 x2 sm2 x3 sm3 x4 at x5 et x6 pcsw three inputs were used x2 x4 and x6 while the other three inputs have not been used dead neurons x1 x3 and x6 here x2 and x5 to produce x11 x4 and x5 to produce x12 were used finally the value of y y twsa was calculated from the combination of x11 and x12 the formula presented by the gmdh m2 for calculating twsa is shown in eq 16 twsa 1 7397 0 36191 x11 0 693 x12 0 0086 x11 2 0 0028 x12 2 0 0051 x11 x12 16 x11 110 1999 1 0603 x2 1 4940 x5 0 0015 x2 2 0 0038 x5 2 0 0057 x2 x5 16 1 x12 52 8676 4 3107 x4 3 3226 x5 0 1368 x4 2 0 0155 x5 2 0 0328 x4 x5 16 2 3 5 uncertainty analysis ua results for gmdh exports examination of uncertainty value for five models presented with different numbers of inputs shows that in gmdh m1 with sm2 and et inputs mee and sdee are 4 019 and 36 155 respectively and wub value in this model is 2 714 for gmdh m2 the wub value with 4 2 reduction has reached 2 6 the mee and sdee values in this model are 4 729 and 34 669 respectively in the gmdh m3 model with elevation of the number of inputs the wub value has decreased to 2 62 in this model the mee and sdee values have reached 5 11 and 34 953 respectively in the gmdh m4 with five inputs the lowest value of wub has occurred reaching 2 51 the mee and sdee values have reached 0 856 and 33 391 respectively increasing the number of inputs to six gmdh m5 the value of wub has reached 2 59 mee and sdee in this model were found 4 378 and 34 542 respectively hence the performance of the gmdh m5 is very close to that of the gmdh m2 so it is observed that despite the changes in uncertainty in the models their values are very close to each other and there is minor difference between the uncertainties of different models thus according to previous results gmdh m2 is selected as the superior model in calculating the twsa value table 3 3 6 fill grace gfo missing data in this section the missing data related to grace gfo data were obtained by applying the gmdh m2 model which is the best model for estimating the twsa value in the study area to this end using sm2 at and et data which are the input values for the gmdh m2 model the values of twsa for the pixels by missed data were calculated fig 9 has been obtained for pixels 1 5 and 10 after filling missing data according to the diagrams the model has been able to correctly identify the trend of data and correctly predict the trend of changes in the amount of twsa in the region which is also a sign of the proper function of the model in estimating the value of twsa in the study area 3 7 groundwater after calculating twsa by grace gfo satellites data and filling the gaps with ml by subtracting the number of effective parameters in the value of twsa from it the amount of gwa in the area can be found 17 gwa t w s a grace g f o s m n s d w e p c s w where gwa is groundwater anomaly in this section the average of ten study pixels was used and compared with observation wells in the study area to calculate the accuracy of gwa along with the average of groundwater changes in the area the results show that grace gfo could estimate the gwa value with r 0 595 also the values of rmse and mae are equal to 47 01 and 37 77 respectively fig 10 3 8 climate change cc results considering the values of sm2 at and et which are the inputs of the best gmdh model gmdh m2 in calculating the twsa value it is necessary to obtain these three parameters to calculate the twsa value for the future following the results these three parameters have been calculated for the two periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 for this regard canesm2 was used to obtain these parameters in the future for obtaining the best results three representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios and also ma scenario mean of all were used and their changes for 2006 2060 were obtained

by 2 and 6 respectively and grew by 5 and 3 65 3 for summer and autumn in the second period plus in the spring the value of et dropped by 9 in other seasons there is an increase in the value of et compared to the first period fig 12 3 9 twsa in future by applying sm2 at and et in the gmdh m2 which was selected as the best model in estimating twsa the value of these three parameters was estimated for the future by canesm2 and used as input of the gmdh m2 to obtain monthly and seasonal variations in twsa values for the future the results indicate that the gmdh m2 model has been able to estimate the twsa changes for the period 2006 2020 with an accuracy of r 0 882 rmse 59 84 and mae 51 8 the results show that for two periods especially the period 2041 2060 the magnitude of twsa has decreased sharply in the first period the twsa value decreased by 194 41 kg m2 on average and for the second period diminished by 446 55 kg m2 compared to the value obtained in the period 2006

12 kg m2 in the first period and 467 93 kg m2 in the second period which had a decline by 177 73 kg m2 and 424 53 kg m2 in the twsa for two periods respectively in summer this decrement has reached 213 57 kg m2 and 470 67 kg m2 for the first and second periods in autumn the largest reduction in twsa was seen so that in the first period it fell by 593 52 and it reached 187 76 kg m2 and in the second period it decreased by 1258 4 and reached 440 70 kg m2 fig 14 fig 15 has plotted twsa monthly variations for grace gfo and gmdh m2 values for the observation and two study periods the chart

more than 40 000 hamidi et al 2021 bakhshianlamouki et al 2020 pourmoghim et al 2022 that it leads to high water withdrawal and a continuous drop in groundwater level in the lub and near lake urmia 74 dams have been built which is one of the main causes of the water crisis in the region salimi et al 2019 the rainfed area is 123 387 ha the irrigated lands of 67 210 ha that most of irrigated lands are cultivated in spring and autumn which greatly increase water consumption daneshi et al 2021 also other factors such as changing the pattern of rainfed to irrigated agriculture parsinejad et al 2021 not using a modern irrigation system rahimi and breuste 2021 esmaeilnezhad et al 2021 lack of familiarity of farmers with the correct principles of water consumption es haghi et al 2022 growing crops with high water consumption and using water for agricultural activities without paying attention to the water rights ahmadzadeh et al 2022 parsinejad et al 2022 and implementation of large development projects without conducting environmental assessment studies maleki et al 2022 are other reasons in creating water crisis in lub on the other hand climate change also affects the amount of water in the study area one of the important effects of climate change is seasonal change pozner et al 2022 these changes can affect the ecosystem of the region and also affect the growth of plants cui and xie 2022 according to the results obtained in this study climatic parameters have changed in different seasons and these changes have affected the amount of twsa and gwa and reduced them fig 15 and fig 18 results obtained in this study the results of previous studies such as hosseini moghari et al 2020 fatolazadeh et al 2016 and zarinmehr et al 2022 confirms the results of groundwater depletion therefore proper management of water resources in this area is very important a sharp decrease in the amount of water in the spring which plants regrowth is in this season leads to changing the ecosystem of the region and also breads destruction of agriculture and the economy of the region romshoo and marazi 2022 reduction of water resources in the region has reduced the volume of the lake urmia and severe salinity of water and the only creature in it is a shrimp called artemia urmiana which is in danger of extinction with these conditions and only in a few months of the year provide conditions for this creature to live again given these conditions and also predicting a sharp decline in twsa and gwa in the region the use of effective methods of water resources management and environmental issues in this region is the only way to reduce the effects and damage of this crisis 5 conclusion one of the main limitations in the use of grace gfo satellites data is the presence of missing data in this data which always put researchers in trouble for using this information in this study with the available data the twsa value was obtained by applying grace gfo satellites data plus simple and practical equation to calculate its value for missing data in the past and future further calculation of twsa without using grace gfo satellites data was presented the results obtained from grace gfo satellites data showed that the use of 100grfk offered the best results in estimating the value of twsa in the study area r 0 555 rmse 37 289 mae 29 904 si 36 996 and rms 104 189 then the results obtained from grace gfo satellites data were modeled by utilizing gmdh and the results were estimated for models with two to six inputs where the best models with the lowest number of inputs were selected the results indicated that the performance of gmdh m2 which had three inputs sm2 at and et was better than the performance of other models r 0 732 rmse 34 96 mae 27 82 and aic 1233 59 thus gmdh m2 model was selected as the best model in calculating twsa finally the equation related to this model was extracted and presented to estimate the value of twsa in the study area then using this equation the missing data values were calculated next by applying the estimated twsa the groundwater changes in the area were calculated showing the appropriate accuracy of the model in estimating the value of gwa r 0 595 rmse 47 01 mae 37 77 finally by employing canesm2 sm2 at and et changes which are the input of gmdh m2 for calculating twsa value were calculated for two periods 2021 2040 and 2040 2060 the results revealed a decrease of 196 32 kg m2 in the first period of the twsa and 448 47 kg m2 in the second period compared to the observational average also the changes of gwa for the two study periods indicated that its value diminished by 209 84 kg m2 for the first period and dropped by 446 83 kg m2 for the second period despite of the excellent and practical results obtained in this research which can be an effective step in the development of such a kind of research there are some nice and effective suggestions for those researchers regarding promoting the methods used in this research they should use other filters instead of gfrk and compare them with it in calculating the amount of twsa also using other ml methods can overcome limitations of the gmdh model such as only using adjacent layers to produce the next layer and also only generating second degree equations in the modelling process that leads to easier equations in the twsa calculating

changes with this approach on a global scale will be very costly and time consuming also the lack of accurate spatial resolution and measuring point has limited the use of this method khorrami et al 2021 ali et al 2021 noori et al 2021 wang et al 2022 with the advancement of science and the growth of technology these measurements could be done through remote sensing rs data using this data the

calculating the value of twsa utilizing grace gfo satellites data b fill the information gap between grace and grace fo c find the best gaussian filter radius in kilometer gfrk to calculate the value of twsa d twsa estimation utilizing least number of inputs e creating a basic equation to calculating twsa utilizing grace gfo considering the importance of lake urmia basin lub and the fact that the drying of lake urmia as a crisis can play an important role in creating natural and human problems and hazards in this study the amount of twsa and gwa in lub are studied and predicted for the future lub is located in the northwest of iran and lake urmia is located there which is in danger of drought lack of water in this area and the subsequent drying of lake urmia has many destructive effects most of which are salt dust due to the development of dust production centers in lake urmia and adjacent saline areas and its development into agricultural and residential areas also the loss of agricultural lands and effects on production increased migration from adjacent areas to the lake and especially the evacuation of villages near the lake and changes and fluctuations in climatic parameters of the region are among these risks foroumandi et al 2021 foroumandi et al 2022a foroumandi et al 2022b 2 materials and methods the present research applied three types of datasets

calculate twsa the results reveal that the value of twsa in the region has a decreasing trend compared to its long term average such that the twsa value was changed from a positive range at the beginning of the period to a negative range in the final years the points of the chart that are empty are the times when the unreleased data or the retrieved information could not be used and available one of the goals of this research is to obtain this information by applying ml the following month grace gfo information is not available shows in fig 4 fig 5 illustrates 10 study grace gfo satellites pixels in the study area fig 1 twsa changes reveal a downward trend in the region where the value of twsa calculated by grace gfo has changed from 220 to 220 fig 5 3 2 grace gfo validation to ensure the efficiency of grace gfo in estimating the twsa value it is necessary to compare the obtained values with the actual ones to this aim rmse mae si and r values were calculated for different values of gfrk to select the best gfrk value with the lowest error in calculating twsa in the study area also the sum of rmse mae and si was introduced as rms where a lower value of rms result in the better performance in gfrk here the gfrk value has been calculated without using a filter and by changing the gfrk value 100 1200 with the results presented in fig 6 the results show that if gfrk is not used in estimating the twsa value the following are obtained rmse 37 287 mae 29 936 si 36 995 r 0 551 and rms 104 218 the use of 100 gfrk in estimating the twsa value caused a relative improvement in the results and yielded the statistical parameters as rmse 37 289 mae 29 904 si 36 996 r 0 555 and rms 104 189 from 100 gfrk onwards with increasing gfrk value the efficiency of twsa estimation has decreased for 200 grfk the value of r decreased to 0 54 and also the error values increased as rmse 37 336 mae 30 061 si 37 043 and rms 104 440 which indicates a decrease in performance compared to 100 grfk at 300 gfrk the performance of r rmse mae si and rms decreased by 6 13 0 73 1 33 0 73 and 0 9 respectively as the grfk value increases the performance of twsa calculating decreases and reached the lowest value at 1200 grfk at 1200 grfk the r value has reached 0 021 and rmse mae si and rms reached to 46 823 38 37 46 455 and 131 648 respectively as can be seen in the figure the rms value at 100 gfrk is minimum which indicates its better efficiency in estimating the twsa value in the study area thus 100 gfrk has the best performance in estimating the value of twsa in the study area 3 3 ua results for grace gfo by different gfrks ua for different gfrk values in the twsa calculation shows that in the non filter the mee value is 3 132 and the sdee value is 39 04 the value of wub in this case is equal to 6 29 which is the value of uncertainty in the twsa calculation use of gfrk 100 shows that the mee value has diminished by 0 16 and reached 3 127 while the sdee value is unchanged compared to non filter the value of wub in this case has reached 6 28 which indicates an improvement in the performance of gfrk 100 by 0 16 compared to the previous case using gfrk 200 the mee value has reached 3 116 and the sdee value has grown by 0 21 to 39 12 the wub value in this case has reached 6 31 which is a rise of 0 48 compared to gfrk 100 here due to the positive and negative changes of twsa the mee value cannot be a suitable criterion and as can be seen with increasing gfrk value despite reduction of wub mee value has dropped up to this point gfrk 100 has had the best performance and the lowest uncertainty compared to other gfrk values for gfrk 300 the sdee increased by 0 9 compared to gfrk 100 to 39 39 and wub is equal to 6 35 showing a performance reduction of 1 12 according to the table the value of sdee and wub has been calculated up to gfrk 1200 and their value has increased at gfrk 1200 it has reached the maximum value showing a 25 32 increase in the value of wub and 24 97 in the value of sdee so gfrk 100 is the optimal value in calculating twsa table 1 3 4 results of gmdh modeling in this study the gmdh model was used to model the amount of twsa in the study area for this issue two methods were considered for modeling the twsa value using input parameters by ml in the first method the data had a trend while in the second method the data trend was deleted to remove the data trend a mean of ten pixels was obtained and by routing the formula related to its line was calculated finally the trend in the data was deleted using this relation 15 trend grace g f o 1 0498 x 118 88 trend removal from existing data revealed that modeling results using trendless data would provide better results so for the modeling the data trend was deleted and finally this trend was added to the data again for the modeling six inputs sm1 sm2 sm3 at et and pcsw are used gmdh structures for 2 3 4 5 and 6 gmdh by 2 inputs model 1 gmdh m1 gmdh by 3 inputs model 2 gmdh m2 gmdh by 4 inputs model 3 gmdh m3 gmdh by 5 inputs model 4 gmdh m4 gmdh by 6 inputs model 5 gmdh m5 were obtained the inputs for each structure are shown in fig 7 to obtain the best structure for the gmdh model the number of inputs was limited and by creating all necessary conditions for the modeling the best model with varying numbers of inputs was obtained according to the figure initially the amount of model inputs was limited to two the results showed that the use of sm2 and et had the best results compared to other inputs then this was done with three inputs and sm2 et and at had the best results compared to other inputs this was done for 4 and 5 inputs and the best combination was selected finally all inputs were used to calculate the twsa value according to fig 7 sm2 and et inputs are the most important ones in calculating the twsa value and have been presented in all models in this research the at value is also observed in all models except in the gmdh m1 model table 2 reports the statistical parameters rmse mae r and aic for modeling the twsa value with two six inputs gmdh m1 results with two inputs sm2 and et have the best results compared to the other models with two inputs in this model the value of r is equal to 0 705 the rmse and mae values are 36 352 and 29 133 respectively the aic value for the gmdh m1 is 1240 89 in gmdh m2 the sm2 at and et parameters have the best results compared to other inputs here the r value has increased to 0 732 suggesting a better performance compared to gmdh m1 also the values of rmse and mae are 34 965 and 27 819 respectively the value of aic in this model with 0 59 improvement has shown a better performance than the gmdh m1 for gmdh m3 with four inputs which include sm2 at et and pcsw the performance of the model compared to the gmdh m2 model for r rmse mae and aic has dropped by 0 74 0 96 0 184 and 0 26 respectively for gmdh m4 with five inputs sm1 sm2 at et and pcsw the value of r has reached 0 728 the aic value compared to the gmdh m2 model increased by 0 17 and reached 1235 69 the rmse and mae values are 33 38 and 26 69 respectively here despite the reduction in the errors this decline has not been so large and it has not affected the results much also the value of r is higher in the gmdh m2 model the aic value in this model has increased so gmdh m2 model is still introduced as the superior model the gmdh m5 model was calculated for six input parameters sm1 sm2 sm3 at et and pcsw the r and errors of rmse and mae are very close to the gmdh m2 model and have reached 0 734 34 793 and 27 662 respectively the r value gas improved by 0 31 while the rmse and mae values are improved by 0 49 and 0 56 respectively which is a very small value due to the addition of three new inputs to the model the aic value has also increased significantly and reached 1255 9 1 81 increase thus gmdh m2 is introduced as the best model in estimating twsa value fig 8 depicts the structure of the best gmdh model gmdh m2 in this model from six inputs were used to model the twsa value x1 sm1 x2 sm2 x3 sm3 x4 at x5 et x6 pcsw three inputs were used x2 x4 and x6 while the other three inputs have not been used dead neurons x1 x3 and x6 here x2 and x5 to produce x11 x4 and x5 to produce x12 were used finally the value of y y twsa was calculated from the combination of x11 and x12 the formula presented by the gmdh m2 for calculating twsa is shown in eq 16 twsa 1 7397 0 36191 x11 0 693 x12 0 0086 x11 2 0 0028 x12 2 0 0051 x11 x12 16 x11 110 1999 1 0603 x2 1 4940 x5 0 0015 x2 2 0 0038 x5 2 0 0057 x2 x5 16 1 x12 52 8676 4 3107 x4 3 3226 x5 0 1368 x4 2 0 0155 x5 2 0 0328 x4 x5 16 2 3 5 uncertainty analysis ua results for gmdh exports examination of uncertainty value for five models presented with different numbers of inputs shows that in gmdh m1 with sm2 and et inputs mee and sdee are 4 019 and 36 155 respectively and wub value in this model is 2 714 for gmdh m2 the wub value with 4 2 reduction has reached 2 6 the mee and sdee values in this model are 4 729 and 34 669 respectively in the gmdh m3 model with elevation of the number of inputs the wub value has decreased to 2 62 in this model the mee and sdee values have reached 5 11 and 34 953 respectively in the gmdh m4 with five inputs the lowest value of wub has occurred reaching 2 51 the mee and sdee values have reached 0 856 and 33 391 respectively increasing the number of inputs to six gmdh m5 the value of wub has reached 2 59 mee and sdee in this model were found 4 378 and 34 542 respectively hence the performance of the gmdh m5 is very close to that of the gmdh m2 so it is observed that despite the changes in uncertainty in the models their values are very close to each other and there is minor difference between the uncertainties of different models thus according to previous results gmdh m2 is selected as the superior model in calculating the twsa value table 3 3 6 fill grace gfo missing data in this section the missing data related to grace gfo data were obtained by applying the gmdh m2 model which is the best model for estimating the twsa value in the study area to this end using sm2 at and et data which are the input values for the gmdh m2 model the values of twsa for the pixels by missed data were calculated fig 9 has been obtained for pixels 1 5 and 10 after filling missing data according to the diagrams the model has been able to correctly identify the trend of data and correctly predict the trend of changes in the amount of twsa in the region which is also a sign of the proper function of the model in estimating the value of twsa in the study area 3 7 groundwater after calculating twsa by grace gfo satellites data and filling the gaps with ml by subtracting the number of effective parameters in the value of twsa from it the amount of gwa in the area can be found 17 gwa t w s a grace g f o s m n s d w e p c s w where gwa is groundwater anomaly in this section the average of ten study pixels was used and compared with observation wells in the study area to calculate the accuracy of gwa along with the average of groundwater changes in the area the results show that grace gfo could estimate the gwa value with r 0 595 also the values of rmse and mae are equal to 47 01 and 37 77 respectively fig 10 3 8 climate change cc results considering the values of sm2 at and et which are the inputs of the best gmdh model gmdh m2 in calculating the twsa value it is necessary to obtain these three parameters to calculate the twsa value for the future following the results these three parameters have been calculated for the two periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 for this regard canesm2 was used to obtain these parameters in the future for obtaining the best results three representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios and also ma scenario mean of all were used and their changes for 2006 2060 were obtained to validate the obtaining results the period of 2006 2020 was used and it was compared with the real values these rcps that describe different future climates are named after a conceivable range of radiative forcing values rcp 2 6 2 6 w m2 rcp 4 5 4 5 w m2 and rcp 8 5 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 each of these rcps shows the volume of greenhouse gases ghg emitting in the future rcp 2 6 is a stringent pathway and ghg go to zero by 2100 rcp 4 5 is intermediate scenario that ghg declining after around 2040 and in rcp 8 5 ghg rise by 2100 de masi et al 2021 rusu 2022 beusen et al 2022 thakur

compared to the first period fig 12 3 9 twsa in future by applying sm2 at and et in the gmdh m2 which was selected as the best model in estimating twsa the value of these three parameters was estimated for the future by canesm2 and used as input of the gmdh m2 to obtain monthly and seasonal variations in twsa values for the future the results indicate that the gmdh m2 model has been able to estimate the twsa changes for the period 2006 2020 with an accuracy of r 0 882 rmse 59 84 and mae 51 8 the results show that for two periods especially the period 2041 2060 the magnitude of twsa has decreased sharply in the first period the twsa value decreased by 194 41 kg m2 on average and for the second period diminished by 446 55 kg m2 compared to the value obtained in the period 2006

213 57 kg m2 and 470 67 kg m2 for the first and second periods in autumn the largest reduction in twsa was seen so that in the first period it fell by 593 52 and it reached 187 76 kg m2 and in the second period it decreased by 1258 4 and reached 440 70 kg m2 fig 14 fig 15 has plotted twsa monthly variations for grace gfo and gmdh m2 values for the observation and two study periods the chart shows that despite fewer fluctuations than the value obtained by grace gfo satellites it has followed a similar trend to this period and reached its lowest value in 2060 3 10 groundwater in future the results obtained for the period 2006 2020 show that the values of statistical parameters in the calculation of gwa are as r 0 59 rmse 47 and mae 37 77 the value of gwa for the two periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 shows that the extent of gwa has decreased sharply it can be obtained from grace gfo observations that in the period 2002 2020 the magnitude of gwa decreased by 7 46 kg m2 compared to the average value on average the value of gwa decreased by 2712 02 and 5914 64 compared to the value observed for the first and second periods in the first and second periods the highest reduction was in may when gwa decreased to 337 64 kg m2 and 569 39 kg m2 respectively 787 68 and 1328 34 the lowest reduction was found in september with 67 47 kg m2 and 309 59 kg m2 for the first and second periods 115 57 and 530 37 fig 16 the highest percentage reduction was in february by 5817 49 and 12544 24 for the first and second periods respectively seasonal changes of gwa show that the highest percentage of decrease is in winter which is equal to 4788 56 and 9820 2 for the first and second periods respectively in the first period the value of gwa has changed from 4 79 kg m2 in the observation period to 224 42 kg m2 and in the second period has reached 465 47 kg m2 in spring the magnitude of gwa in the first and second periods dropped by 311 14 kg m2 and 539 39 kg m2 respectively and it has changed from 38 98 kg m2 in the observation period to 272 16 kg m2 and 500 41 kg m2 798 17 and 1383 68 decrease in summer in the first and second periods reductions of 444 19 and 1273 03 are seen in the value of gwa and in autumn this decline has reached 313 24 and 863 15 fig 17 fig 18 has plotted monthly gwa variations for grace gfo values april 2002 march 2021 as well as gmdh m2 values for 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 the chart shows that the gwa changes follow a similar trend to the period 2002 2020 as perceived by grace gfo satellites data and in 2060 the value of this parameter will reach its minimum compared to the observational average 4 discussion in the lub which is one of the important basins of iran the number wells are over 88 000 and unlicensed wells is more than 40 000 hamidi et al 2021 bakhshianlamouki et al 2020 pourmoghim et al 2022 that it leads to high water withdrawal and a continuous drop in groundwater level in the lub and near lake urmia 74 dams have been built which is one of the main causes of the water crisis in the region salimi et al 2019 the rainfed area is 123 387 ha the irrigated lands of 67 210 ha that most of irrigated lands are cultivated in spring and autumn which greatly increase water consumption daneshi et al 2021 also other factors such as changing the pattern of rainfed to irrigated agriculture parsinejad et al 2021 not using a modern irrigation system rahimi and breuste 2021 esmaeilnezhad et al 2021 lack of familiarity of farmers with the correct principles of water consumption es haghi et al 2022 growing crops with high water consumption and using water for agricultural activities without paying attention to the water rights ahmadzadeh et al 2022 parsinejad et al 2022 and implementation of large development projects without conducting environmental assessment studies maleki et al 2022 are other reasons in creating water crisis in lub on the other hand climate change also affects the amount of water in the study area one of the important effects of climate change is seasonal change pozner et al 2022 these changes can affect the ecosystem of the region and also affect the growth of plants cui and xie 2022 according to the results obtained in this study climatic parameters have changed in different seasons and these changes have affected the amount of twsa and gwa and reduced them fig 15 and fig 18 results obtained in this study the results of previous studies such as hosseini moghari et al 2020 fatolazadeh et al 2016 and zarinmehr et al 2022 confirms the results of groundwater depletion therefore proper management of water resources in this area is very important a sharp decrease in the amount of water in the spring which plants regrowth is in this season leads to changing the ecosystem of the region and also breads destruction of agriculture and the economy of the region romshoo and marazi 2022 reduction of water resources in the region has reduced the volume of the lake urmia and severe salinity of water and the only creature in it is a shrimp called artemia urmiana which is in danger of extinction with these conditions and only in a few months of the year provide conditions for this creature to live again given these conditions and also predicting a sharp decline in twsa and gwa in the region the use of effective methods of water resources management and environmental issues in this region is the only way to reduce the effects and damage of this crisis 5 conclusion one of the main limitations in the use of grace gfo satellites data is the presence of missing data in this data which always put researchers in trouble for using this information in this study with the available data the twsa value was obtained by applying grace gfo satellites data plus simple and practical equation to calculate its value for missing data in the past and future further calculation of twsa without using grace gfo satellites data was presented the results obtained from grace gfo satellites data showed that the use of 100grfk offered the best results in estimating the value of twsa in the study area r 0 555 rmse 37 289 mae 29 904 si 36 996 and rms 104 189 then the results obtained from grace gfo satellites data were modeled by utilizing gmdh and the results were estimated for models with two to six inputs where the best models with the lowest number of inputs were selected the results indicated that the performance of gmdh m2 which had three inputs sm2 at and et was better than the performance of other models r 0 732 rmse 34 96 mae 27 82 and aic 1233 59 thus gmdh m2 model was selected as the best model in calculating twsa finally the equation related to this model was extracted and presented to estimate the value of twsa in the study area then using this equation the missing data values were calculated next by applying the estimated twsa the groundwater changes in the area were calculated showing the appropriate accuracy of the model in estimating the value of gwa r 0 595 rmse 47 01 mae 37 77 finally by employing canesm2 sm2 at and et changes which are the input of gmdh m2 for calculating twsa value were calculated for two periods 2021 2040 and 2040 2060 the results revealed a decrease of 196 32 kg m2 in the first period of the twsa and 448 47 kg m2 in the second period compared to the observational average also the changes of gwa for the two study periods indicated that its value diminished by 209 84 kg m2 for the first period and dropped by 446 83 kg m2 for the second period despite of the excellent and practical results obtained in this research which can be an effective step in the development of such a kind of research there are some nice and effective suggestions for those researchers regarding promoting the methods used in this research they should use other filters instead of gfrk and compare them with it in calculating the amount of twsa also using other ml methods can overcome limitations of the gmdh model such as only using adjacent layers to produce the next layer and also only generating second degree equations in the modelling process that leads to easier equations in the twsa calculating

3173,over the last twenty years numerous strategies and policies e g 2030 agenda for sustainable development have emerged to promote flood risk reduction that is compatible with the conservation or restoration of river ecosystems with the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable development in this context vulnerability analysis is considered a key aspect in flood risk reduction and the most widespread methodology for its characterization is the construction of indices however such indices have been obtained so far through a fragmented approach either because they do not consider all vulnerability dimensions i e social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural or components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience moreover indices developed on a regional scale focusing on areas prone to flash floods are rarely validated as the necessary information is often not available and flash floods do not occur simultaneously in all urban areas of a given region this paper addresses the above two knowledge gaps and describes the construction at regional level of a flash flood integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi vulnerability here is characterized holistically integrating in the index all the dimensions and components involved subsequently an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the imvi lastly vulnerability regional spatial patterns were identified through a latent class cluster analysis the methodology implemented here allows one to identify vulnerability sources and their underlying causes helping to improve flood risk management moreover validation outputs enable to determine index uncertainty sources thereby encouraging decision makers to design more cost effective vulnerability reduction strategies keywords flash flood vulnerability analysis flood risk reduction multidimensional framework sustainable development data availability statement original vulnerability indicator dataset used in this study is available at zenodo https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5881545 1 introduction traditionally flood risk management has relied on the use of grey infrastructures complemented by non structural measures such as land use planning or early warning systems among others loucks 2015 however grey infrastructure has often proven to be inefficient being neither socio economically or environmentally sustainable nor a guarantee of total flood protection di baldassarre et al 2015 moreover during their design the assessment of the impact of climate change the characterization of morpho sedimentary dynamics or the analysis of uncertainty and its propagation between the different components have often been neglected vis et al 2010 these infrastructures also create a false sense of security or levee effect tobin 1995 as people are inclined to assume that flood protection is complete besides the construction of grey infrastructures such as reservoirs and levees has disrupted the hydrological regime of many rivers and narrowed or suppressed the lateral connectivity of river systems negatively impacting on aquatic ecosystems and associated ecosystem services bodoque et al 2017 this context has led to numerous recently emerging strategies and policies for promoting flood risk reduction that are compatible with the conservation or restoration of river ecosystems with the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable development hagenlocher et al 2018 at the european level following the adoption of the habitats water framework and flood directives risk mitigation is being enforced to be compatible with the good status of water bodies and the conservation restoration of aquatic ecosystems quevauviller 2014 more recently on 11 december 2019 the european green deal was launched among the actions to be pursued it is intended to restore the natural functions of soil and water bodies aiming to restore biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems while limiting the damage caused by flooding at the global level the hyogo framework for action in force until 2015 and the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction to be developed during the period 2015 2030 emphasize the need to advocate better governance to reinforce the resilience of nations and communities to natural disasters so as to ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national regional and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation these strategic frameworks also encourage countries to implement a variety of measures that safeguard cultural heritage against disaster risks drawing on relevant conventions policy framework and guidance undrr 2015 also noteworthy are the un sustainable development goals sdgs which are the core of the agenda 2030 for sustainable development specifying 17 sdgs broken down into 169 targets and 232 indicators colglazier 2015 of these sdg1 target 1 5 points out the need to build resilience in those societies in situations of vulnerability and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to extreme events sdg 6 target 6 6 aims to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems and sdg11 target 11 b stresses the need to develop and implement a holistic disaster risk management approach to build bridges between disaster risk reduction and sustainable development and thus harmonize the objectives set out in the aforementioned strategies and policies vulnerability analysis has to be multidimensional and integrated birkmann et al 2013 fuchs and thaler 2018 vulnerability analysis targeting natural disasters is most often driven by eliciting indices moreira et al 2021b however to date such indices have been obtained through a fragmented vulnerability analysis either because they do not account for all its dimensions or all its components the most widely considered dimensions have been social flanagan et al 2011 frazier et al 2014 oulahen et al 2015 and physical chen et al 2019 papathoma köhle et al 2019 although we can also find works characterizing economic van der veen and logtmeijer 2005 institutional lassa 2011 papathoma köhle et al 2021 and environmental vulnerability damm 2010 recently vulnerability analysis has been approached with a focus on two or more dimensions most of the literature published on this subject only considers two dimensions such as physical and social zhou et al 2014 percival et al 2019 or social and environmental dimensions estoque and murayama 2014 hagenlocher et al 2018 although there are papers in which more than two are taken into account bolaños valencia et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 however literature including all dimensions is practically non existent with institutional cutter et al 2010 and cultural vojinovic et al 2016 being the most neglected ones regarding flash floods many papers address only one dimension either social aroca jiménez et al 2017 rodríguez gaviria et al 2019 physical papathoma köhle 2016 leal et al 2021 or economic aroca jiménez et al 2018 in cases where more than one dimension is covered these are usually social and physical karagiorgos et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 although papers have been found in which social and economic aroca jiménez et al 2020 and social and environmental asare kyei et al 2017 dimensions with all these studies dealing with all vulnerability components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience the paper of debortoli et al 2017 includes physical socioeconomic and environmental dimensions in their analysis but the different vulnerability components are not regarded moreover very few studies attempt to validate vulnerability results one of the most widespread methodologies employed for this purpose involves the use of proxies such as flood related fatalities zhou et al 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 economic damages zhou et al 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 rufat et al 2019 flood compensations zhou et al 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 rufat et al 2019 or calls made to emergency services kontokosta and malik 2018 other methodologies employed involve administering questionnaires to experts oulahen et al 2015 or to the population affected by a previous flood event fekete 2009 kuhlicke et al 2011 the correlation with other indices already published estoque and murayama 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 debortoli et al 2017 or a spatial comparison with the area affected by a past event flanagan et al 2011 these validation methods are typically applied at a regional or even national level however such methods are not feasible when applied in areas prone to flash floods since these events impact on highly localized areas and therefore do not occur simultaneously in all flash flood prone urban areas of a particular region fekete 2009 alternatively to the above methods the validation of regional flash flood vulnerability indices can be approached by performing sensitivity and uncertainty analyses through monte carlo analysis asare kyei et al 2017 chen et al 2019 aroca jiménez et al 2020 aiming to fill the knowledge gaps described previously this study proposes the construction and validation of an integrated and multidimensional vulnerability index imvi for urban areas prone to flash flooding all components i e exposure susceptibility and resilience and dimensions i e social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural involved are deployed here to do this a database of social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural variables was built and vulnerability factors were extracted after a sequential approach supported by multivariate statistics subsequently the uncertainty and sensitivity of the imvi was analyzed by implementing a monte carlo model assessing the bias between the imvi scores and the median and the median absolute deviation mad obtained from the monte carlo analysis finally spatial patterns of vulnerability were extracted at a regional scale through a latent class cluster analysis lcca 2 methodology 2 1 study area castilla y león is located in the northwest of the iberian peninsula and covers an area of 94 226 km2 which makes it the largest region in spain and one of the largest in the european union fig 1 its relief is mainly based on a plateau 700 1 100 m a s l bordered by steep mountain ranges prone to flash floods morales and ortega 2002 average annual rainfall is of between 400 and 600 mm although in mountainous areas it can reach values close to 2 000 mm almost 88 of the municipalities of castilla y león are classified as deep rural areas i e municipalities with less than 2 000 inhabitants which include most urban areas prone to flash flooding covered here in these areas the aging index reaches 5 44 and they have a dependency rate of 76 ine 2021 the average income per household in deep rural areas is 24 647 the services sector is the activity with the highest percentage of participation in deep rural areas economy 69 2 the unemployment rate in these areas is 12 9 ine 2019 on the other hand 57 of the fluvial territory of deep rural areas is considered to constitute protected natural areas and riparian vegetation occupies 49 of the floodplain on average conversely 42 of the floodplain is under pressure ita 2021 additionally water bodies prone to flash floods have a generally good status according to the criteria of the water framework directive urban planning does not usually follow an orderly pattern in deep rural areas thus buildings tend to have a high average age where 67 of the dwellings are more than 30 years old and 12 are in a dilapidated bad or deficient condition ine 2011 moreover it is common for access to dwellings to be at ground level 61 of the houses concerning the institutional dimension the regional civil protection plan against flood risk was approved in 2010 this instrument recommends the elaboration by municipal administrations of a local flood action plan against floods however practically no municipality in the region has prepared such a local flood action plan inuncyl 2010 finally castilla y león has a rich cultural heritage comprised of 1 771 cultural interest assets of these 8 are located in deep rural areas and they are usually well preserved jcyl 2021 2 2 conceptual framework most vulnerability assessment conceptualizations recognize that vulnerability is governed by exposure sensitivity and resilience components and the integration of social economic environmental physical institutional and cultural dimensions birkmann et al 2013 fuchs and thaler 2018 moreira et al 2021b the methodology deployed here relied on the joint consideration of all components that characterize vulnerability and all its dimensions birkmann et al 2013 moreira et al 2021b table 1 gathers conceptual relationships between the different components and dimensions of vulnerability which are subsequently reflected in the methodological approach deployed here it is worth mentioning that although exposure and vulnerability are assumed to be two different concepts in the traditional risk framework the inclusion of exposure as a component for consideration is currently common practice when assessing vulnerability undrr 2009 asare kyei et al 2017 this is because vulnerability also depends on the areas affected by flash floods or in other words the degree of exposure of the society or local community to this type of natural events therefore if exposure is absent it is not possible to talk about the potential for loss i e vulnerability frazier et al 2014 asare kyei et al 2017 2 3 methodological overview the methodological approach developed here consists of four stages i identifying urban areas prone to flash floods and database compilation ii construction of the integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi iii validation of the imvi and iv identification of vulnerability spatial patterns fig 2 2 3 1 identification of flash flood prone urban areas and database construction the selection of the target municipalities was based on the following premises 1 they must be crossed by a river with longitudinal slopes equal to or 0 01 m m which is an indicator of rivers prone to flash floods bodoque et al 2015 2 river reaches under consideration must have been classified as areas with significant potential risk of flooding asprfs miteco 2021a and 3 population and assets present in the municipalities must be exposed to the 500 year flood miteco 2021b accordingly 57 municipalities were selected for integration in the vulnerability analysis based on a comprehensive literature review an initial set of 496 variables was characterized of which 216 correspond to the social dimension 180 to the economic dimension 49 to the ecosystem dimension 22 to the physical dimension 23 to the institutional dimension and 6 to the cultural heritage dimension aroca jiménez et al 2022 variables were standardized using the z score method and their redundancy was checked by means of correlation matrices for each dimension removing those variables with a pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 9 bera et al 2019 thus the number of variables was reduced to 73 social dimension 67 economic dimension 47 ecosystem dimension and 21 institutional dimension by contrast the number of variables remained unchanged in the other dimensions i e physical and cultural heritage dimensions 2 3 2 construction of the integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi 2 3 2 1 pinpointing the vulnerability factors identifying vulnerability factors relied on the implementation of different approaches depending on the dimensions involved for the social economic physical and institutional dimensions this identification was accomplished in two phases 1 deployment of a hierarchical segmentation analysis hsa for dividing variables into smaller groups 2 performing a principal component analysis pca on the groups identified in the previous step in the ecosystem dimension the division of variables was given as there is a consensus in the scientific community that ecosystem services are classified into the sections provisioning maintenance and regulation and cultural haines young and potschin young 2018 finally for the cultural heritage dimension it was not necessary to identify groups since the number of variables involved is significantly lower than the number of municipalities under consideration hsa was applied to divide the initial set of variables into smaller groups according to the distance or similarity between them using the squared euclidean distance as a similarity measure sarstedt and mooi 2014 moreover ward s method was used as a grouping method which seeks to minimize the variance within each group identified subsequently a pca was applied in each of them the kaiser meyer olkin kmo statistic and the bartlett s test of sphericity were used to test the sampling adequacy of data which were to be used in the pca i e kmo 0 5 and p value 0 05 respectively variables with a communality below 0 3 were eliminated from the groups finally factor scores for each factor were extracted using the least squares regression method sarstedt and mooi 2014 these being the values used to construct the imvi 2 3 2 2 calculation of imvi scores we calculated the integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi for each municipality according to the following equation 1 imvi e x s e r e where ex is exposure se is sensitivity and re is resilience the score of each component vc exposure sensitivity or resilience resulted from the aggregation of the scores of the factors that made up that component for each of the dimensions social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural heritage the above is presented mathematically as follows 2 v c i 1 f soc c i 1 f econ c i 1 f ecos c i 1 f phy c i 1 f ins c i 1 f cul c where i 1 f soc c is the sum of the scores of the factors that made up the component to be calculated for the social dimension and so on for the rest of the dimensions econ is the economic dimension ecos is the ecosystem dimension phy is the physical dimension ins is the institutional dimension and cul is the cultural heritage dimension additionally we computed the score for each dimension vd by summing the scores of the factors that formed that dimension for each of the components to do so we applied the equation 3 v d i 1 f ex d i 1 f se d i 1 f re d where i 1 f ex d is the sum of the scores of the factors that compose the dimension to be calculated for the exposure component and thus successively for the rest of the components se is sensitivity and re is resilience the score for each dimension and component vc d was therefore the sum of the scores of the factors that make up that component for that dimension which was calculated through the equation 4 v c d i 1 f w f s f i 1 f w f where wf is the weight assigned to a factor and sf are the factor scores of that factor the weight of each factor was based on the tolerance statistic which was obtained after performing a regression analysis with the different factors of each dimension sarstedt and mooi 2014 thus high tolerance values meant that factors were poorly correlated with each other and therefore had a higher allocated weight in the imvi conversely low tolerance values meant that the factors were correlated with each other and thus had a lower assigned weight in the imvi aroca jiménez et al 2017 2 3 3 validation of the imvi the imvi was internally validated through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis based on a monte carlo analysis first we fitted the factor scores of the different vulnerability factors and their respective weights to continuous probability distributions the anderson darling a2 statistic was used as a goodness of fit test to determine which distribution best fitted the factor scores and the different weights aroca jiménez et al 2020 thus the scores of the different vulnerability factors and the weights were characterized by the parameters associated with each probability distribution accordingly both scores and weights constituted the input to the monte carlo analysis while the imvi scores and the scores of the different dimensions and components were entered as output functions using the equations 1 2 3 and 4 defined above the number of simulations to be performed in the monte carlo analysis varied depending on the number of input parameters table s7 in the supplementary data tate 2012 both median and median absolute deviation mad were used to analyze uncertainty and thus validate the results obtained firstly the deviation or bias between the median and the mad obtained for each vulnerability factor and weight after monte carlo simulation and the original factor scores and weights were calculated the total bias for each municipality was the result of the sum of all these deviations to analyze the consistency of the vulnerability categories obtained the imvi and the different dimension and component scores were recalculated but considering the median and the mad obtained after performing the monte carlo analysis thus we obtained as many new scores as vulnerability factors were originally included which varied depending on the item under analysis i e imvi component or dimension scores accordingly the probability that a given municipality changed vulnerability category after applying these changes was calculated finally sensitivity was analyzed through the tornado plots obtained for each monte carlo analysis tornado plots allowed identifying which inputs i e vulnerability factors and weights had a greater impact on the different outputs i e imvi dimension and component scores the elements located at the top of the diagram were those that had a greater influence on the imvi dimension and or component scores while the elements located at the bottom of the diagram had the least influence 2 3 4 recognition of spatial vulnerability patterns a latent class cluster analysis lcca was conducted to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability to do this a latent categorical variable was created and the probability that a municipality belonged to a certain cluster was calculated this being based on the scores of the different components broken down by dimensions ten different models were analyzed considering from no such heterogeneity i e all municipalities belonged to the same cluster to heterogeneity with 10 spatial patterns i e municipalities were divided into 10 clusters the minimum value of the bayesian information criterion bic helped us to select the best model and therefore to determine the optimal number of clusters vermunt and magidson 2016 the wald statistic was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences between the different clusters of urban areas p value 0 05 the profile of the optimal model i e the marginal distribution of the scores of each component per dimension within each cluster of municipalities helped to determine the different sources of vulnerability for each cluster of municipalities aroca jiménez et al 2018 lastly an analysis of variance anova was conducted to verify if the differences obtained in the imvi scores between the different clusters discerned were statistically significant sarstedt and mooi 2014 3 results 3 1 integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi a total of 162 variables distributed into 57 vulnerability factors characterized the vulnerability of the urban areas of interest detailed results of the hsa and pca can be found in figs s1 s4 and tables s1 s6 of the supplementary data respectively the social dimension is composed of 47 variables and 12 factors 29 and 21 of the total of variables and factors respectively the economic dimension is integrated by 41 variables 25 and 11 factors 19 the ecosystem dimension is composed of 36 variables 22 and 21 factors 37 the physical and institutional dimensions are organized by 16 variables 10 and 5 factors each 9 finally the cultural heritage dimension is integrated by 6 variables 4 and 3 factors 5 regarding vulnerability components exposure is composed of 61 variables 34 and 16 factors 28 sensitivity is integrated by 71 variables 39 and 24 factors 42 finally 48 variables 27 and 17 factors 30 comprise the resilience component since the weights were calculated by dimension the sum of the weights of the factors that constitute each dimension is always 1 but the sum of factor weights that constitute each component varies with the susceptibility component harboring the highest weight in the imvi 2 24 followed by resilience 1 92 and exposure 1 84 fig 3 shows the imvi score for each urban area disaggregated by vulnerability components the imvi scores were depicted in 5 categories i e very high high medium low and very low the bar chart shows the score in each vulnerability component the left bar represents the score in the exposure component the middle bar the sensitivity scores and the right bar the resilience scores bar heights are directly proportional to the component scores i e the larger the size of the bar the higher the score on the component the direction of the bar shows whether that score is positive i e above the mean or negative i e below the mean the color of the bar displays the corresponding category to each component score according to the quintile method except for the resilience component where the color is inverted to make the understanding of the map more intuitive accordingly the color red is associated with very high exposure and sensitivity and very low resilience while dark green color is associated with very low exposure and sensitivity and very high resilience imvi values range from 0 49 i e maximum vulnerability to 0 42 i e minimum vulnerability for urban areas that have a very high imvi score a very high exposure is the most common category 36 regarding sensitivity the very high category is the most frequent one 55 similarly the most prevalent resilience category is very low 45 conversely very low is the most common category in exposure and sensitivity for urban areas with very low imvi scores 58 and 67 respectively however the most common category is low in the case of resilience 42 imvi scores disaggregated by vulnerability dimensions can be found in fig s5 of the supplementary data vulnerability component scores were disaggregated by dimension scores fig 4 a 4b and 4c the color of the municipalities shows the scores for the vulnerability components exposure sensitivity or resilience while the associated bar chart shows the score for that component disaggregated by dimensions bars represent from left to right the scores in the social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural heritage dimensions although only the dimensions that characterize the component shown are included exposure varies between 1 27 and 1 27 those municipalities with very high exposure show very high social 64 of the cases economic 73 ecosystem 55 physical 73 and cultural heritage 36 vulnerability on the other hand those municipalities that have very low exposure present very low social 50 economic 83 and physical 67 vulnerability low values in the ecosystem dimension 50 and medium values in the cultural heritage dimension 42 regarding sensitivity it ranges from 0 63 to 0 69 municipalities with very high sensitivity also show very high physical 64 of the cases and cultural heritage 55 vulnerability high values in the economic 36 and ecosystem 45 dimensions and medium values in the social dimension 45 on the other hand municipalities with very low sensitivity have very low social 50 of the cases physical 50 and cultural heritage 83 vulnerability too while in the economic and ecosystem dimensions they have low 33 and medium 42 values finally resilience ranges from 1 01 to 0 99 urban areas with very high resilience also present very high ecosystem and institutional vulnerability 73 of the cases in both dimensions high and low 27 in both cases being the most frequent categories in the social dimension and medium and very low 27 in both cases the most frequent in the economic dimension on the other hand urban areas with very low resilience often have very low values in all dimensions social 83 of cases economic 75 ecosystem 50 and institutional 67 3 2 validation of the imvi imvi component and dimension scores shown in fig 4a 4b and 4c were considered the baseline scores table 2 shows the regional average of the total bias i e the sum of the differences between the baseline scores and the median or the median absolute deviation mad of the vulnerability factors that make up each element for all the municipalities the elements evaluated were the imvi different component and different dimension scores and weights allocated to each factor the average is expressed in absolute format i e the regional average of the sum of all the biases for all the factors and weights that compose each element listed in the table and in relative format i e dividing the abovementioned average by the number of vulnerability factors and weights that compose each element biases can be positive or negative which depends on whether most of the different vulnerability factor scores and their weights were above or below the median or the mad obtained in the monte carlo analysis indicating higher or lower vulnerability respectively those dimensions that accumulate a higher total absolute bias between the baseline scores and the median are the social 2 32 and the economic 1 77 while the dimensions that accumulate a higher total relative bias are the physical 0 21 and the social 0 19 on the other hand the dimensions that accumulate a lower total absolute bias with respect to the median are the cultural heritage 0 03 and the ecosystem 0 19 while the dimensions that accumulate a lower total relative bias are the ecosystem 0 01 and the cultural heritage 0 01 regarding the mad the dimensions that have a higher total absolute bias are the ecosystem 11 03 and the social 5 38 while those that show a higher total relative bias are the cultural heritage 0 55 and the ecosystem 0 53 conversely cultural heritage 1 66 and physical 1 90 dimensions accumulate the lowest total absolute bias and physical 0 38 and institutional 0 40 dimensions accumulate the lowest total relative bias further the exposure component accumulates the highest total absolute and relative bias from the median 2 66 and 0 17 respectively while resilience accumulates the lowest total absolute 0 55 and relative 0 03 bias compared to mad susceptibility is the component that shows the highest absolute 13 41 and relative 0 56 total bias while exposure shows the lowest absolute and relative total bias 6 20 and 0 39 respectively total bias values for each urban area between the imvi baseline scores and the median fig 5 a and the mad fig 5b obtained in the monte carlo analysis for the imvi scores are shown in fig 5 six categories have been represented differentiating between positive i e pinkish color range and negative i e bluish color range biases color intensity reflects the values of these biases for both positive and negative biases the low category comprises the values of biases up to the 50th percentile the moderate category the values of those up to the 80th percentile and the high category the remaining extreme values tate 2013 thus a more intense color represents higher biases i e lower robustness of the baseline scores and a lighter color represents smaller biases i e higher robustness of the baseline scores the text label associated with each municipality shows the vulnerability category to which each municipality belongs to with respect to the imvi baseline values see the categories in fig 3 in those municipalities where imvi values are very high total biases from the median are positive in 91 of the cases and are usually moderate 55 of the cases although they are high in 36 of the cases regarding total biases from the mad these are mostly negative 91 of the cases and low in 82 of the cases in contrast in municipalities where imvi values are very low total biases from the median are negative in 92 of cases and moderate 42 with respect to mad total biases are negative in all municipalities and high 67 of cases fig showing total bias values between the baseline scores of different components and dimensions and the median and the mad obtained through the monte carlo analysis can be found in figs s6 s14 of the supplementary data consistency of the vulnerability categories obtained for each element analyzed imvi component and dimension scores and weights was analyzed through disaggregation of the total bias we calculated as many new scores as vulnerability factors and weights were included in each analyzed element but considering the median and the mad obtained in the monte carlo simulation instead of the baseline scores table 3 shows the average probability of the vulnerability category of a given element increasing decreasing or remaining stable if the median or mad values of each factor and weights are considered the higher the probability that categories remain stable the higher the robustness of the scores the ecosystem dimension is the one with the highest number of cases in which categories remain stable 82 4 and 77 4 for the estimation from the median and mad respectively the cultural heritage dimension shows the lowest percentage of cases in which categories remain stable both if we consider the median 57 9 and the mad 51 3 regarding components the exposure has the highest percentage of cases in which categories remain unchanged 87 8 while the resilience component is that with the lowest percentage 85 1 considering the median just the opposite occurs when considering the mad where the component with the highest percentage of cases in which categories remain stable is the resilience component 81 9 while the component with the lowest percentage is the exposure 77 8 the probability that urban areas change their imvi category after considering median fig 6 a or mad fig 6b instead of the baseline scores for the different vulnerability factors and weights is shown in fig 6 regarding the median vulnerability categories did not change in 86 4 of the cases in 81 6 of the cases if the mad is considered of the 57 municipalities 15 did not change their imvi category when considering the median 26 of the total municipalities concerning the mad 20 of the 57 did not change their imvi category 35 those municipalities that have a very high imvi maintain their category stable in 79 of the cases when considering the median and in 78 of the cases when considering the mad of the municipalities with a very high imvi 45 did not change the category when considering the median or the mad those municipalities that have a very low imvi keep the category stable in 96 and 91 of the cases when taking into account the median and the mad respectively moreover municipalities with a very low imvi do not change category in 42 of the cases when the median is considered increasing this percentage to 50 when the mad is accounted for fig showing the probabilities of changing the vulnerability category in the different components and dimensions can be found in figs s15 s23 of the supplementary data influence of the different vulnerability factors on the imvi baseline scores is shown in fig 7 those factors that have a higher influence on the imvi scores are located at the top of the sensitivity tornado plot while those factors that have a lower influence are at the bottom the size of the bars indicates the range of variation that each factor causes on the imvi scores orange bars show the score obtained in the monte carlo analysis for each factor when considering the 5th percentile while the blue bars represent the score when considering the 95th percentile the vertical axis shows the factor names and in parenthesis the component and the dimension in which each factor is included the first parenthesis indicates the component ex is exposure se sensitivity and re resilience and the second one corresponds to the dimension soc is social econ is economic ecos is ecosystem phy is physical ins is institutional and cul is cultural heritage if we look at the first 15 factors located at the top of the sensitivity tornado plot the most influential dimensions on the imvi scores are economic and ecosystem and the most represented component is sensitivity conversely if we look at the last 15 factors located at the bottom factors that have the lowest influence on imvi scores belong to the ecosystem and economic dimensions and express exposure and resilience in equal parts fig showing the influence of the different factors on the different component and dimension scores can be found in figs s24 s32 of the supplementary data 3 3 regional spatial patterns of vulnerability the minimum value of the bic statistic determined that the best model was the one considering 3 clusters of municipalities parameters associated with the best model indicated that the factors expressing exposure in the cultural heritage dimension and sensitivity in the social ecosystem and physical dimensions were not statistically significant for dividing the municipalities into clusters i e p value 0 05 fig 8 shows to which cluster each urban area belonged the associated bar chart shows characteristics of the different patterns identified bars show the standard deviations from the means for each component disaggregated by dimension and cluster excluding those that did not prove to be significant i e cultural heritage exposure and social ecosystem and physical sensitivity bar direction indicates whether the standard deviation is positive or negative in the case of bars related to the exposure and sensitivity components a positive standard deviation indicates exposure and sensitivity values above the cluster mean i e higher vulnerability while a negative standard deviation indicates values below the cluster mean i e lower vulnerability regarding resilience a positive standard deviation indicates resilience values above the cluster mean i e lower vulnerability while a negative deviation indicates resilience values below the cluster mean i e higher vulnerability cluster 1 comprises a total of 33 municipalities 57 of the total and it is mainly characterized by showing the lowest values in all factors except those expressing institutional resilience cluster 2 contains a total of 12 municipalities 22 of the total and it is characterized by showing the highest values in all factors expressing exposure in all dimensions and in those expressing cultural heritage sensitivity although they also have the highest values in all factors expressing resilience in all dimensions and the lowest values in those expressing economic sensitivity finally cluster 3 also comprises 12 municipalities and it is characterized by presenting the lowest values in all factors expressing resilience in all dimensions and the highest values in factors expressing economic sensitivity on the other hand this last cluster contains the municipalities with the lowest values in the factors expressing social and ecosystem exposure and cultural heritage sensitivity while the values for the factors expressing economic and physical exposure are intermediate table 4 shows the results of the pairwise comparison among the different clusters of municipalities to test if there are statistically significant differences between the means obtained for the different components disaggregated by dimensions as far as exposure is concerned there are significant differences in the mean of the social and ecosystem dimensions between clusters 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 while significant differences in the mean scores of the economic and physical dimensions occur in all clusters in the case of sensitivity there are significant differences in the economic dimension between clusters 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 and significant differences in the cultural heritage dimension occur between clusters 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 finally there are significant differences in the resilience component in the social economic and ecosystem dimensions between clusters 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 while significant differences occur in the institutional dimension between clusters 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 finally tests were made as to whether there were statistically significant differences in the imvi baseline scores between the different clusters of urban areas obtained in the lcca levene s test indicated the suitability of performing an anova i e p value 0 05 which identified statistically significant differences in imvi scores between groups 1 and 2 and 1 and 3 i e p value 0 05 the post hoc hds tukey test associated with the anova on the different clusters showed that cluster 2 contains the urban areas with the highest imvi values mean of 0 122 and standard deviation of 0 214 followed by cluster 3 mean of 0 087 and standard deviation of 0 181 and finally cluster 1 the least vulnerable one mean of 0 076 and standard deviation of 0 150 4 discussion this paper describes the construction and validation of an integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi at regional scale in urban areas prone to flash flooding vulnerability analysis was addressed holistically considering all vulnerability dimensions i e social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural and components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience subsequently an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the imvi through the monte carlo method assessing vulnerability holistically entails consideration of all its dimensions and components which are aggregated to compile indices birkmann et al 2013 bera et al 2019 this approach allows aggregating multidimensional information which ensures a better representation of reality anderson et al 2019 moreover this methodology is transferable to other spatial contexts as it can be adapted to the needs of the territory especially in terms of indicator selection oulahen et al 2015 and the analysis scale which should coincide with the management scale rufat et al 2019 for urban contexts where information is very scarce the methodological framework deployed here can be combined with expert based approaches to better reflect the vulnerability sources and to make the developed index policy relevant oulahen et al 2015 malgwi et al 2021 vulnerability analysis continues to be performed in a fragmented way without considering its different components and dimensions as a whole aroca jiménez et al 2020 indeed to the best of our knowledge the work described here is the first to address vulnerability holistically the use of integrated and multidimensional approaches is key to identifying vulnerability sources and their underlying causes since results are disaggregated aroca jiménez et al 2017 2018 when component scores are decomposed by dimensions we observe that the highest exposure values are mainly due to the physical economic and social dimensions regarding physical exposure protective structures are of great importance in urban areas because flash floods are usually triggered very fast and torrential karagiorgos et al 2016 flash floods can damage and even paralyze commercial and tourist activities and infrastructures located in flood prone areas with the consequent economic losses that this can entail for the municipalities frazier et al 2014 the budget available in the flash flood prone urban areas covered here is usually limited so coping with the economic damage caused by floods in collective buildings e g schools can be complicated aroca jiménez et al 2018 the increase in the occupation of flood prone areas by infrastructures such as communication routes or sewage treatment plants can lead to increased costs associated with clean up or damage reparation kumar et al 2021 exposed dwellings usually have some floors below and only one floor above ground level and the housing access at ground level bodoque et al 2016a which can increase vulnerability because people and their assets cannot be moved to a safer area vojinovic et al 2016 lastly collective buildings such as schools retirement homes sports facilities or health care centers located in flash flood prone areas can be occupied by a sensitive population that would require external assistance to leave hazard areas aroca jiménez et al 2020 the highest sensitivity values are mainly due to the physical and cultural dimensions urban planning in mountainous areas does not usually follow an orderly pattern papathoma köhle et al 2019 which can make it difficult for emergency services to evacuate a flood prone area rahman et al 2016 they also are buildings with a high average age which can cause their structural integrity to be compromised by flash floods rodríguez gaviria et al 2019 moreover the original construction material and age of cultural heritage assets are key aspects to consider in their management since flash floods can cause the collapse of the structure either by prolonged exposure to water or by the impact itself vojinovic et al 2016 lastly the highest resilience values are due to ecosystem and institutional dimensions regarding the ecosystem dimension resilience is mainly dominated by cultural ecosystem services despite the difficulty in characterizing them hernández morcillo et al 2013 the results obtained here show a clear influence of cultural ecosystem services on the system capacity to cope with and recover from an impact so it is very important to include related indicators when analyzing vulnerability to flash floods talbot et al 2018 a high coverage of protected natural spaces and species richness makes ecosystems more robust and functional and thus less prone to degradation hagenlocher et al 2018 moreover effective flood risk management needs the trust of the population in relevant risk management institutions papathoma köhle et al 2021 which requires a comprehensive analysis of the social perception of risk and a good communication strategy bodoque et al 2016b the capacity to invest in risk adaptation and mitigation strategies is a sign that institutions are functional and able to react faster and support the recovery of the population if a disastrous event occurs thus reducing the negative consequences papathoma köhle et al 2021 each methodological choice made in the index construction process involves subjectivity and therefore introduces uncertainty tate 2012 beccari 2016 this uncertainty is mainly related to the quality and availability of the original data and the normalization weighting and aggregation methods moreira et al 2021a 2021b indicator selection is the stage that has the greatest impact on the index outputs and it often depends on the data availability which is one of the main limitations when characterizing vulnerability in flash flood prone areas aroca jiménez et al 2020 the imvi outputs were validated here through a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using the monte carlo method and involving the median as an unbiased estimator of central tendency and the mad as an estimator of dispersion the median has been used by other authors before tate 2012 2013 and other researchers have used other dispersion measures than the mad such as standard deviation asare kyei et al 2017 feizizadeh and kienberger 2017 and coefficient of variation tate 2013 however the mad is recommended as a more robust dispersion measure than the dispersion estimators mentioned above leys et al 2013 our findings show that the total deviations of the imvi scores from the median and the mad were moderate in those urban areas with the highest vulnerability values there is also a high probability around 80 that urban areas do not change their vulnerability category after considering the scores obtained in the monte carlo analysis implying that the imvi obtained here is robust the use of integrated and multidimensional approaches also makes it possible to disaggregate results by uncertainty sources moreover discerning the factors that account for the greatest range of variation through a global sensitivity analysis provides more reliable results than local sensitivity analyses as it considers how simultaneous changes in all parameters impact on the imvi outcome feizizadeh and kienberger 2017 this represents an important step forward in the implementation of vulnerability indices as it allows decision makers to be aware of the limitations of the indices while developing tailored vulnerability reduction strategies based on the results of the uncertainty analysis finally the regional spatial patterns of vulnerability extracted through the lcca can contribute to the design of vulnerability reduction strategies tailored to the needs of each municipality cluster thus vulnerability reduction strategies of urban areas included in cluster 1 should be directed towards institutional strengthening through for example communication strategies that improve the relationship between the different public institutions involved in risk management blázquez et al 2021 regarding the municipalities included in cluster 2 vulnerability reduction strategies should focus on reducing exposure in this sense local level flood risk management plans that consider long term vulnerability reduction measures are required for this purpose such measures should be integrated into urban planning as well as into adaptation plans and policies papathoma köhle et al 2021 mapping spatial patterns of vulnerability can assist in building synergies between different policy areas such as urban planning or climate change adaptation which could help the implementation and objective fulfillment of strategies like the sendai framework the sustainable development goals sdgs or the european green deal yang et al 2019 lastly municipalities included in cluster 3 should target their vulnerability reduction strategies towards improving resilience in all its dimensions these areas have the least social economic ecosystem and institutional resources to cope with and recover from flood impacts therefore they should be priority areas for action in an emergency due to the high external support they would require aroca jiménez et al 2020 in the long term they also need a better coordination of the different institutions involved to improve flood risk management papathoma köhle et al 2021 which can be an opportunity to bring disaster risk reduction closer to sustainable development yang et al 2019 5 conclusions a flash flood integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi has been constructed and validated at regional scale in this work vulnerability has been characterized holistically taking into account all its dimensions and components this approach allows one to identify vulnerability sources and their underlying causes since index outputs are disaggregated quantitatively and graphically by dimensions and components the above increases the transparency of the index construction process which can improve the confidence of decision makers in the index and thus facilitate its implementation to enhance flood risk management the stochastic validation of the imvi makes it possible to disaggregate index results according to uncertainty and sensitivity sources this is a breakthrough for including vulnerability indices in flood risk management plans as managers can be aware of the index limitations and could design vulnerability reduction strategies considering the uncertainties finally the identification of vulnerability spatial patterns at the regional scale through latent class cluster analysis can help in the design of vulnerability reduction strategies tailored to the needs of each identified cluster of urban areas the above apart from helping to improve flood risk management can help to identify priority areas for action upon the declaration of an emergency situation either for the competent authorities to prioritize actions in emergency management or for a more efficient allocation of economic resources for actual emergency management credit authorship contribution statement estefanía aroca jiménez methodology validation formal

3173,over the last twenty years numerous strategies and policies e g 2030 agenda for sustainable development have emerged to promote flood risk reduction that is compatible with the conservation or restoration of river ecosystems with the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable development in this context vulnerability analysis is considered a key aspect in flood risk reduction and the most widespread methodology for its characterization is the construction of indices however such indices have been obtained so far through a fragmented approach either because they do not consider all vulnerability dimensions i e social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural or components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience moreover indices developed on a regional scale focusing on areas prone to flash floods are rarely validated as the necessary information is often not available and flash floods do not occur simultaneously in all urban areas of a given region this paper addresses the above two knowledge gaps and describes the construction at regional level of a flash flood integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi vulnerability here is characterized holistically integrating in the index all the dimensions and components involved subsequently an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the imvi lastly vulnerability regional spatial patterns were identified through a latent class cluster analysis the methodology implemented here allows one to identify vulnerability sources and their underlying causes helping to improve flood risk management moreover validation outputs enable to determine index uncertainty sources thereby encouraging decision makers to design more cost effective vulnerability reduction strategies

study is available at zenodo https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5881545 1 introduction traditionally flood risk management has relied on the use of grey infrastructures complemented by non structural measures such as land use planning or early warning systems among others loucks 2015 however grey infrastructure has often proven to be inefficient being neither socio economically or environmentally sustainable nor a guarantee of total flood protection di baldassarre et al 2015 moreover during their design the assessment of the impact of climate change the characterization of morpho sedimentary dynamics or the analysis of uncertainty and its propagation between the different components have often been neglected vis et al 2010 these infrastructures also create a false sense of security or levee effect tobin 1995 as people are inclined to assume that flood protection is complete besides the construction of grey infrastructures such as reservoirs and levees has disrupted the hydrological regime of many rivers and narrowed or suppressed the lateral connectivity of river systems negatively impacting on aquatic ecosystems and associated ecosystem services bodoque et al 2017 this context has led to numerous recently emerging strategies and policies for promoting flood risk reduction that are compatible with the conservation or restoration of river ecosystems with the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable development hagenlocher et al 2018 at the european level following the adoption of the habitats water framework and flood directives risk mitigation is being enforced to be compatible with the good status of water bodies and the conservation restoration of aquatic ecosystems quevauviller 2014 more recently on 11 december 2019 the european green deal was launched among the actions to be pursued it is intended to restore the natural functions of soil and water bodies aiming to restore biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems while limiting the damage caused by flooding at the global level the hyogo framework for action in force until 2015 and the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction to be developed during the period 2015 2030 emphasize the need to advocate better governance to reinforce the resilience of nations and communities to natural disasters so as to ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national regional and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation these strategic frameworks also encourage countries to implement a variety of measures that safeguard cultural heritage against disaster risks drawing on relevant conventions policy framework and guidance undrr 2015 also noteworthy are the un sustainable development goals sdgs which are the core of the agenda 2030 for sustainable development specifying 17 sdgs broken down into 169 targets and 232 indicators colglazier 2015 of these sdg1 target 1 5 points out the need to build resilience in those societies in situations of vulnerability and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to extreme events sdg 6 target 6 6 aims to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems and sdg11 target 11 b stresses the need to develop and implement a holistic disaster risk management approach to build bridges between disaster risk reduction and sustainable development and thus harmonize the objectives set out in the aforementioned strategies and policies vulnerability analysis has to be multidimensional and integrated birkmann et al 2013 fuchs and thaler 2018 vulnerability analysis targeting natural disasters is most often driven by eliciting indices moreira et al 2021b however to date such indices have been obtained through a fragmented vulnerability analysis either because they do not account for all its dimensions or all its components the most widely considered dimensions have been social flanagan et al 2011 frazier et al 2014 oulahen et al 2015 and physical chen et al 2019 papathoma köhle et al 2019 although we can also find works characterizing economic van der veen and logtmeijer 2005 institutional lassa 2011 papathoma köhle et al 2021 and environmental vulnerability damm 2010 recently vulnerability analysis has been approached with a focus on two or more dimensions most of the literature published on this subject only considers two dimensions such as physical and social zhou et al 2014 percival et al 2019 or social and environmental dimensions estoque and murayama 2014 hagenlocher et al 2018 although there are papers in which more than two are taken into account bolaños valencia et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 however literature including all dimensions is practically non existent with institutional cutter et al 2010 and cultural vojinovic et al 2016 being the most neglected ones regarding flash floods many papers address only one dimension either social aroca jiménez et al 2017 rodríguez gaviria et al 2019 physical papathoma köhle 2016 leal et al 2021 or economic aroca jiménez et al 2018 in cases where more than one dimension is covered these are usually social and physical karagiorgos et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 although papers have been found in which social and economic aroca jiménez et al 2020 and social and environmental asare kyei et al 2017 dimensions with all these studies dealing with all vulnerability components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience the paper of debortoli et al 2017 includes physical socioeconomic and environmental dimensions in their analysis but the different vulnerability components are not regarded moreover very few studies attempt to validate vulnerability results one of the most widespread methodologies employed for this purpose involves the use of proxies such as flood related fatalities zhou et al 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 economic damages zhou et al 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 rufat et al 2019 flood compensations zhou et al 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 rufat et al 2019 or calls made to emergency services kontokosta and malik 2018 other methodologies employed involve administering questionnaires to experts oulahen et al 2015 or to the population affected by a previous flood event fekete 2009 kuhlicke et al 2011 the correlation with other indices already published estoque and murayama 2014 bakkensen et al 2017 debortoli et al 2017 or a spatial comparison with the area affected by a past event flanagan et al 2011 these validation methods are typically applied at a regional or even national level however such methods are not feasible when applied in areas prone to flash floods since these events impact on highly localized areas and therefore do not occur simultaneously in all flash flood prone urban areas of a particular region fekete 2009 alternatively to the above methods the validation of regional flash flood vulnerability indices can be approached by performing sensitivity and uncertainty analyses through monte carlo analysis asare kyei et al 2017 chen et al 2019 aroca jiménez et al 2020 aiming to fill the knowledge gaps described previously this study proposes the construction and validation of an integrated and multidimensional vulnerability index imvi for urban areas prone to flash flooding all components i e exposure susceptibility and resilience and dimensions i e social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural involved are deployed here to do this a database of social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural variables was built and vulnerability factors were extracted after a sequential approach supported by multivariate statistics subsequently the uncertainty and sensitivity of the imvi was analyzed by implementing a monte carlo model assessing the bias between the imvi scores and the median and the median absolute deviation mad obtained from the monte carlo analysis finally spatial patterns of vulnerability were extracted at a regional scale through a latent class cluster analysis lcca 2 methodology 2 1 study area castilla y león is located in the northwest of the iberian peninsula and covers an area of 94 226 km2 which makes it the largest region in spain and one of the largest in the european union fig 1 its relief is mainly based on a plateau 700 1 100 m a s l bordered by steep mountain ranges prone to flash floods morales and ortega 2002 average annual rainfall is of between 400 and 600 mm although in mountainous areas it can reach values close to 2 000 mm almost 88 of the municipalities of castilla y león are classified as deep rural areas i e municipalities with less than 2 000 inhabitants which include most urban areas prone to flash flooding covered here in these areas the aging index reaches 5 44 and they have a dependency rate of 76 ine 2021 the average income per household in deep rural areas is 24 647 the services sector is the activity with the highest percentage of participation in deep rural areas economy 69 2 the unemployment rate in these areas is 12 9 ine 2019 on the other hand 57 of the fluvial territory of deep rural areas is considered to constitute protected natural areas and riparian vegetation occupies 49 of the floodplain on average conversely 42 of the floodplain is under pressure ita 2021 additionally water bodies prone to flash floods have a generally good status according to the criteria of the water framework directive urban planning does not usually follow an orderly pattern in deep rural areas thus buildings tend to have a high average age where 67 of the dwellings are more than 30 years old and 12 are in a dilapidated bad or deficient condition ine 2011 moreover it is common for access to dwellings to be at ground level 61 of the houses concerning the institutional dimension the regional civil protection plan against flood risk was approved in 2010 this instrument recommends the elaboration by municipal administrations of a local flood action plan against floods however practically no municipality in the region has prepared such a local flood action plan inuncyl 2010 finally castilla y león has a rich cultural heritage comprised of 1 771 cultural interest assets of these 8 are located in deep rural areas and they are usually well preserved jcyl 2021 2 2 conceptual framework most vulnerability assessment conceptualizations recognize that vulnerability is governed by exposure sensitivity and resilience components and the integration of social economic environmental physical institutional and cultural dimensions birkmann et al 2013 fuchs and thaler 2018 moreira et al 2021b the methodology deployed here relied on the joint consideration of all components that characterize vulnerability and all its dimensions birkmann et al 2013 moreira et al 2021b table 1 gathers conceptual relationships between the different components and dimensions of vulnerability which are subsequently reflected in the methodological approach deployed here it is worth mentioning that although exposure and vulnerability are assumed to be two different concepts in the traditional risk framework the inclusion of exposure as a component for consideration is currently common practice when assessing vulnerability undrr 2009 asare kyei et al 2017 this is because vulnerability also depends on the areas affected by flash floods or in other words the degree of exposure of the society or local community to this type of natural events therefore if exposure is absent it is not possible to talk about the potential for loss i e vulnerability frazier et al 2014 asare kyei et al 2017 2 3 methodological overview the methodological approach developed here consists of four stages i identifying urban areas prone to flash floods and database compilation ii construction of the integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi iii validation of the imvi and iv identification of vulnerability spatial patterns fig 2 2 3 1 identification of flash flood prone urban areas and database construction the selection of the target municipalities was based on the following premises 1 they must be crossed by a river with longitudinal slopes equal to or 0 01 m m which is an indicator of rivers prone to flash floods bodoque et al 2015 2 river reaches under consideration must have been classified as areas with significant potential risk of flooding asprfs miteco 2021a and 3 population and assets present in the municipalities must be exposed to the 500 year flood miteco 2021b accordingly 57 municipalities were selected for integration in the vulnerability analysis based on a comprehensive literature review an initial set of 496 variables was characterized of which 216 correspond to the social dimension 180 to the economic dimension 49 to the ecosystem dimension 22 to the physical dimension 23 to the institutional dimension and 6 to the cultural heritage dimension aroca jiménez et al 2022 variables were standardized using the z score method and their redundancy was checked by means of correlation matrices for each dimension removing those variables with a pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 9 bera et al 2019 thus the number of variables was reduced to 73 social dimension 67 economic dimension 47 ecosystem dimension and 21 institutional dimension by contrast the number of variables remained unchanged in the other dimensions i e physical and cultural heritage dimensions 2 3 2 construction of the integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi 2 3 2 1 pinpointing the vulnerability factors identifying vulnerability factors relied on the implementation of different approaches depending on the dimensions involved for the social economic physical and institutional dimensions this identification was accomplished in two phases 1 deployment of a hierarchical segmentation analysis hsa for dividing variables into smaller groups 2 performing a principal component analysis pca on the groups identified in the previous step in the ecosystem dimension the division of variables was given as there is a consensus in the scientific community that ecosystem services are classified into the sections provisioning maintenance and regulation and cultural haines young and potschin young 2018 finally for the cultural heritage dimension it was not necessary to identify groups since the number of variables involved is significantly lower than the number of municipalities under consideration hsa was applied to divide the initial set of variables into smaller groups according to the distance or similarity between them using the squared euclidean distance as a similarity measure sarstedt and mooi 2014 moreover ward s method was used as a grouping method which seeks to minimize the variance within each group identified subsequently a pca was applied in each of them the kaiser meyer olkin kmo statistic and the bartlett s test of sphericity were used to test the sampling adequacy of data which were to be used in the pca i e kmo 0 5 and p value 0 05 respectively variables with a communality below 0 3 were eliminated from the groups finally factor scores for each factor were extracted using the least squares regression method sarstedt and mooi 2014 these being the values used to construct the imvi 2 3 2 2 calculation of imvi scores we calculated the integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi for each municipality according to the following equation 1 imvi e x s e r e where ex is exposure se is sensitivity and re is resilience the score of each component vc exposure sensitivity or resilience resulted from the aggregation of the scores of the factors that made up that component for each of the dimensions social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural heritage the above is presented mathematically as follows 2 v c i 1 f soc c i 1 f econ c i 1 f ecos c i 1 f phy c i 1 f ins c i 1 f cul c where i 1 f soc c is the sum of the scores of the factors that made up the component to be calculated for the social dimension and so on for the rest of the dimensions econ is the economic dimension ecos is the ecosystem dimension phy is the physical dimension ins is the institutional dimension and cul is the cultural heritage dimension additionally we computed the score for each dimension vd by summing the scores of the factors that formed that dimension for each of the components to do so we applied the equation 3 v d i 1 f ex d i 1 f se d i 1 f re d where i 1 f ex d is the sum of the scores of the factors that compose the dimension to be calculated for the exposure component and thus successively for the rest of the components se is sensitivity and re is resilience the score for each dimension and component vc d was therefore the sum of the scores of the factors that make up that component for that dimension which was calculated through the equation 4 v c d i 1 f w f s f i 1 f w f where wf is the weight assigned to a factor and sf are the factor scores of that factor the weight of each factor was based on the tolerance statistic which was obtained after performing a regression analysis with the different factors of each dimension sarstedt and mooi 2014 thus high tolerance values meant that factors were poorly correlated with each other and therefore had a higher allocated weight in the imvi conversely low tolerance values meant that the factors were correlated with each other and thus had a lower assigned weight in the imvi aroca jiménez et al 2017 2 3 3 validation of the imvi the imvi was internally validated through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis based on a monte carlo analysis first we fitted the factor scores of the different vulnerability factors and their respective weights to continuous probability distributions the anderson darling a2 statistic was used as a goodness of fit test to determine which distribution best fitted the factor scores and the different weights aroca jiménez et al 2020 thus the scores of the different vulnerability factors and the weights were characterized by the parameters associated with each probability distribution accordingly both scores and weights constituted the input to the monte carlo analysis while the imvi scores and the scores of the different dimensions and components were entered as output functions using the equations 1 2 3 and 4 defined above the number of simulations to be performed in the monte carlo analysis varied depending on the number of input parameters table s7 in the supplementary data tate 2012 both median and median absolute deviation mad were used to analyze uncertainty and thus validate the results obtained firstly the deviation or bias between the median and the mad obtained for each vulnerability factor and weight after monte carlo simulation and the original factor scores and weights were calculated the total bias for each municipality was the result of the sum of all these deviations to analyze the consistency of the vulnerability categories obtained the imvi and the different dimension and component scores were recalculated but considering the median and the mad obtained after performing the monte carlo analysis thus we obtained as many new scores as vulnerability factors were originally included which varied depending on the item under analysis i e imvi component or dimension scores accordingly the probability that a given municipality changed vulnerability category after applying these changes was calculated finally sensitivity was analyzed through the tornado plots obtained for each monte carlo analysis tornado plots allowed identifying which inputs i e vulnerability factors and weights had a greater impact on the different outputs i e imvi dimension and component scores the elements located at the top of the diagram were those that had a greater influence on the imvi dimension and or component scores while the elements located at the bottom of the diagram had the least influence 2 3 4 recognition of spatial vulnerability patterns a latent class cluster analysis lcca was conducted to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability to do this a latent categorical variable was created and the probability that a municipality belonged to a certain cluster was calculated this being based on the scores of the different components broken down by dimensions ten different models were analyzed considering from no such heterogeneity i e all municipalities belonged to the same cluster to heterogeneity with 10 spatial patterns i e municipalities were divided into 10 clusters the minimum value of the bayesian information criterion bic helped us to select the best model and therefore to determine the optimal number of clusters vermunt and magidson 2016 the wald statistic was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences between the different clusters of urban areas p value 0 05 the profile of the optimal model i e the marginal distribution of the scores of each component per dimension within each cluster of municipalities helped to determine the different sources of vulnerability for each cluster of municipalities aroca jiménez et al 2018 lastly an analysis of variance anova was conducted to verify if the differences obtained in the imvi scores between the different clusters discerned were statistically significant sarstedt and mooi 2014 3 results 3 1 integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi a total of 162 variables distributed into 57 vulnerability factors characterized the vulnerability of the urban areas of interest detailed results of the hsa and pca can be found in figs s1 s4 and tables s1 s6 of the supplementary data respectively the social dimension is composed of 47 variables and 12 factors 29 and 21 of the total of variables and factors respectively the economic dimension is integrated by 41 variables 25 and 11 factors 19 the ecosystem dimension is composed of 36 variables 22 and 21 factors 37 the physical and institutional dimensions are organized by 16 variables 10 and 5 factors each 9 finally the cultural heritage dimension is integrated by 6 variables 4 and 3 factors 5 regarding vulnerability components exposure is composed of 61 variables 34 and 16 factors 28 sensitivity is integrated by 71 variables 39 and 24 factors 42 finally 48 variables 27 and 17 factors 30 comprise the resilience component since the weights were calculated by dimension the sum of the weights of the factors that constitute each dimension is always 1 but the sum of factor weights that constitute each component varies with the susceptibility component harboring the highest weight in the imvi 2 24 followed by resilience 1 92 and exposure 1 84 fig 3 shows the imvi score for each urban area disaggregated by vulnerability components the imvi scores were depicted in 5 categories i e very high high medium low and very low the bar chart shows the score in each vulnerability component the left bar represents the score in the exposure component the middle bar the sensitivity scores and the right bar the resilience scores bar heights are directly proportional to the component scores i e the larger the size of the bar the higher the score on the component the direction of the bar shows whether that score is positive i e above the mean or negative i e below the mean the color of the bar displays the corresponding category to each component score according to the quintile method except for the resilience component where the color is inverted to make the understanding of the map more intuitive accordingly the color red is associated with very high exposure and sensitivity and very low resilience while dark green color is associated with very low exposure and sensitivity and very high resilience imvi values range from 0 49 i e maximum vulnerability to 0 42 i e minimum vulnerability for urban areas that have a very high imvi score a very high exposure is the most common category 36 regarding sensitivity the very high category is the most frequent one 55 similarly the most prevalent resilience category is very low 45 conversely very low is the most common category in exposure and sensitivity for urban areas with very low imvi scores 58 and 67 respectively however the most common category is low in the case of resilience 42 imvi scores disaggregated by vulnerability dimensions can be found in fig s5 of the supplementary data vulnerability component scores were disaggregated by dimension scores fig 4 a 4b and 4c the color of the municipalities shows the scores for the vulnerability components exposure sensitivity or resilience while the associated bar chart shows the score for that component disaggregated by dimensions bars represent from left to right the scores in the social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural heritage dimensions although only the dimensions that characterize the component shown are included exposure varies between 1 27 and 1 27 those municipalities with very high exposure show very high social 64 of the cases economic 73 ecosystem 55 physical 73 and cultural heritage 36 vulnerability on the other hand those municipalities that have very low exposure present very low social 50 economic 83 and physical 67 vulnerability low values in the ecosystem dimension 50 and medium values in the cultural heritage dimension 42 regarding sensitivity it ranges from 0 63 to 0 69 municipalities with very high sensitivity also show very high physical 64 of the cases and cultural heritage 55 vulnerability high values in the economic 36 and ecosystem 45 dimensions and medium values in the social dimension 45 on the other hand municipalities with very low sensitivity have very low social 50 of the cases physical 50 and cultural heritage 83 vulnerability too while in the economic and ecosystem dimensions they have low 33 and medium 42 values finally resilience ranges from 1 01 to 0 99 urban areas with very high resilience also present very high ecosystem and institutional vulnerability 73 of the cases in both dimensions high and low 27 in both cases being the most frequent categories in the social dimension and medium and very low 27 in both cases the most frequent in the economic dimension on the other hand urban areas with very low resilience often have very low values in all dimensions social 83 of cases economic 75 ecosystem 50 and institutional 67 3 2 validation of the imvi imvi component and dimension scores shown in fig 4a 4b and 4c were considered the baseline scores table 2 shows the regional average of the total bias i e the sum of the differences between the baseline scores and the median or the median absolute deviation mad of the vulnerability factors that make up each element for all the municipalities the elements evaluated were the imvi different component and different dimension scores and weights allocated to each factor the average is expressed in absolute format i e the regional average of the sum of all the biases for all the factors and weights that compose each element listed in the table and in relative format i e dividing the abovementioned average by the number of vulnerability factors and weights that compose each element biases can be positive or negative which depends on whether most of the different vulnerability factor scores and their weights were above or below the median or the mad obtained in the monte carlo analysis indicating higher or lower vulnerability respectively those dimensions that accumulate a higher total absolute bias between the baseline scores and the median are the social 2 32 and the economic 1 77 while the dimensions that accumulate a higher total relative bias are the physical 0 21 and the social 0 19 on the other hand the dimensions that accumulate a lower total absolute bias with respect to the median are the cultural heritage 0 03 and the ecosystem 0 19 while the dimensions that accumulate a lower total relative bias are the ecosystem 0 01 and the cultural heritage 0 01 regarding the mad the dimensions that have a higher total absolute bias are the ecosystem 11 03 and the social 5 38 while those that show a higher total relative bias are the cultural heritage 0 55 and the ecosystem 0 53 conversely cultural heritage 1 66 and physical 1 90 dimensions accumulate the lowest total absolute bias and physical 0 38 and institutional 0 40 dimensions accumulate the lowest total relative bias further the exposure component accumulates the highest total absolute and relative bias from the median 2 66 and 0 17 respectively while resilience accumulates the lowest total absolute 0 55 and relative 0 03 bias compared to mad susceptibility is the component that shows the highest absolute 13 41 and relative 0 56 total bias while exposure shows the lowest absolute and relative total bias 6 20 and 0 39 respectively total bias values for each urban area between the imvi baseline scores and the median fig 5 a and the mad fig 5b obtained in the monte carlo analysis for the imvi scores are shown in fig 5 six categories have been represented differentiating between positive i e pinkish color range and negative i e bluish color range biases color intensity reflects the values of these biases for both positive and negative biases the low category comprises the values of biases up to the 50th percentile the moderate category the values of those up to the 80th percentile and the high category the remaining extreme values tate 2013 thus a more intense color represents higher biases i e lower robustness of the baseline scores and a lighter color represents smaller biases i e higher robustness of the baseline scores the text label associated with each municipality shows the vulnerability category to which each municipality belongs to with respect to the imvi baseline values see the categories in fig 3 in those municipalities where imvi values are very high total biases from the median are positive in 91 of the cases and are usually moderate 55 of the cases although they are high in 36 of the cases regarding total biases from the mad these are mostly negative 91 of the cases and low in 82 of the cases in contrast in municipalities where imvi values are very low total biases from the median are negative in 92 of cases and moderate 42 with respect to mad total biases are negative in all municipalities and high 67 of cases fig showing total bias values between the baseline scores of different components and dimensions and the median and the mad obtained through the monte carlo analysis can be found in figs s6 s14 of the supplementary data consistency of the vulnerability categories obtained for each element analyzed imvi component and dimension scores and weights was analyzed through disaggregation of the total bias we calculated as many new scores as vulnerability factors and weights were included in each analyzed element but considering the median and the mad obtained in the monte carlo simulation instead of the baseline scores table 3 shows the average probability of the vulnerability category of a given element increasing decreasing or remaining stable if the median or mad values of each factor and weights are considered the higher the probability that categories remain stable the higher the robustness of the scores the ecosystem dimension is the one with the highest number of cases in which categories remain stable 82 4 and 77 4 for the estimation from the median and mad respectively the cultural heritage dimension shows the lowest percentage of cases in which categories remain stable both if we consider the median 57 9 and the mad 51 3 regarding components the exposure has the highest percentage of cases in which categories remain unchanged 87 8 while the resilience component is that with the lowest percentage 85 1 considering the median just the opposite occurs when considering the mad where the component with the highest percentage of cases in which categories remain stable is the resilience component 81 9 while the component with the lowest percentage is the exposure 77 8 the probability that urban areas change their imvi category after considering median fig 6 a or mad fig 6b instead of the baseline scores for the different vulnerability factors and weights is shown in fig 6 regarding the median vulnerability categories did not change in 86 4 of the cases in 81 6 of the cases if the mad is considered of the 57 municipalities 15 did not change their imvi category when considering the median 26 of the total municipalities concerning the mad 20 of the 57 did not change their imvi category 35 those municipalities that have a very high imvi maintain their category stable in 79 of the cases when considering the median and in 78 of the cases when considering the mad of the municipalities with a very high imvi 45 did not change the category when considering the median or the mad those municipalities that have a very low imvi keep the category stable in 96 and 91 of the cases when taking into account the median and the mad respectively moreover municipalities with a very low imvi do not change category in 42 of the cases when the median is considered increasing this percentage to 50 when the mad is accounted for fig showing the probabilities of changing the vulnerability category in the different components and dimensions can be found in figs s15 s23 of the supplementary data influence of the different vulnerability factors on the imvi baseline scores is shown in fig 7 those factors that have a higher influence on the imvi scores are located at the top of the sensitivity tornado plot while those factors that have a lower influence are at the bottom the size of the bars indicates the range of variation that each factor causes on the imvi scores orange bars show the score obtained in the monte carlo analysis for each factor when considering the 5th percentile while the blue bars represent the score when considering the 95th percentile the vertical axis shows the factor names and in parenthesis the component and the dimension in which each factor is included the first parenthesis indicates the component ex is exposure se sensitivity and re resilience and the second one corresponds to the dimension soc is social econ is economic ecos is ecosystem phy is physical ins is institutional and cul is cultural heritage if we look at the first 15 factors located at the top of the sensitivity tornado plot the most influential dimensions on the imvi scores are economic and ecosystem and the most represented component is sensitivity conversely if we look at the last 15 factors located at the bottom factors that have the lowest influence on imvi scores belong to the ecosystem and economic dimensions and express exposure and resilience in equal parts fig showing the influence of the different factors on the different component and dimension scores can be found in figs s24 s32 of the supplementary data 3 3 regional spatial patterns of vulnerability the minimum value of the bic statistic determined that the best model was the one considering 3 clusters of municipalities parameters associated with the best model indicated that the factors expressing exposure in the cultural heritage dimension and sensitivity in the social ecosystem and physical dimensions were not statistically significant for dividing the municipalities into clusters i e p value 0 05 fig 8 shows to which cluster each urban area belonged the associated bar chart shows characteristics of the different patterns identified bars show the standard deviations from the means for each component disaggregated by dimension and cluster excluding those that did not prove to be significant i e cultural heritage exposure and social ecosystem and physical sensitivity bar direction indicates whether the standard deviation is positive or negative in the case of bars related to the exposure and sensitivity components a positive standard deviation indicates exposure and sensitivity values above the cluster mean i e higher vulnerability while a negative standard deviation indicates values below the cluster mean i e lower vulnerability regarding resilience a positive standard deviation indicates resilience values above the cluster mean i e lower vulnerability while a negative deviation indicates resilience values below the cluster mean i e higher vulnerability cluster 1 comprises a total of 33 municipalities 57 of the total and it is mainly characterized by showing the lowest values in all factors except those expressing institutional resilience cluster 2 contains a total of 12 municipalities 22 of the total and it is characterized by showing the highest values in all factors expressing exposure in all dimensions and in those expressing cultural heritage sensitivity although they also have the highest values in all factors expressing resilience in all dimensions and the lowest values in those expressing economic sensitivity finally cluster 3 also comprises 12 municipalities and it is characterized by presenting the lowest values in all factors expressing resilience in all dimensions and the highest values in factors expressing economic sensitivity on the other hand this last cluster contains the municipalities with the lowest values in the factors expressing social and ecosystem exposure and cultural heritage sensitivity while the values for the factors expressing economic and physical exposure are intermediate table 4 shows the results of the pairwise comparison among the different clusters of municipalities to test if there are statistically significant differences between the means obtained for the different components disaggregated by dimensions as far as exposure is concerned there are significant differences in the mean of the social and ecosystem dimensions between clusters 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 while significant differences in the mean scores of the economic and physical dimensions occur in all clusters in the case of sensitivity there are significant differences in the economic dimension between clusters 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 and significant differences in the cultural heritage dimension occur between clusters 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 finally there are significant differences in the resilience component in the social economic and ecosystem dimensions between clusters 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 while significant differences occur in the institutional dimension between clusters 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 finally tests were made as to whether there were statistically significant differences in the imvi baseline scores between the different clusters of urban areas obtained in the lcca levene s test indicated the suitability of performing an anova i e p value 0 05 which identified statistically significant differences in imvi scores between groups 1 and 2 and 1 and 3 i e p value 0 05 the post hoc hds tukey test associated with the anova on the different clusters showed that cluster 2 contains the urban areas with the highest imvi values mean of 0 122 and standard deviation of 0 214 followed by cluster 3 mean of 0 087 and standard deviation of 0 181 and finally cluster 1 the least vulnerable one mean of 0 076 and standard deviation of 0 150 4 discussion this paper describes the construction and validation of an integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi at regional scale in urban areas prone to flash flooding vulnerability analysis was addressed holistically considering all vulnerability dimensions i e social economic ecosystem physical institutional and cultural and components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience subsequently an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the imvi through the monte carlo method assessing vulnerability holistically entails consideration of all its dimensions and components which are aggregated to compile indices birkmann et al 2013 bera et al 2019 this approach allows aggregating multidimensional information which ensures a better representation of reality anderson et al 2019 moreover this methodology is transferable to other spatial contexts as it can be adapted to the needs of the territory especially in terms of indicator selection oulahen et al 2015 and the analysis scale which should coincide with the management scale rufat et al 2019 for urban contexts where information is very scarce the methodological framework deployed here can be combined with expert based approaches to better reflect the vulnerability sources and to make the developed index policy relevant oulahen et al 2015 malgwi et al 2021 vulnerability analysis continues to be performed in a fragmented way without considering its different components and dimensions as a whole aroca jiménez et al 2020 indeed to the best of our knowledge the work described here is the first to address vulnerability holistically the use of integrated and multidimensional approaches is key to identifying vulnerability sources and their underlying causes since results are disaggregated aroca jiménez et al 2017 2018 when component scores are decomposed by dimensions we observe that the highest exposure values are mainly due to the physical economic and social dimensions regarding physical exposure protective structures are of great importance in urban areas because flash floods are usually triggered very fast and torrential karagiorgos et al 2016 flash floods can damage and even paralyze commercial and tourist activities and infrastructures located in flood prone areas with the consequent economic losses that this can entail for the municipalities frazier et al 2014 the budget available in the flash flood prone urban areas covered here is usually limited so coping with the economic damage caused by floods in collective buildings e g schools can be complicated aroca jiménez et al 2018 the increase in the occupation of flood prone areas by infrastructures such as communication routes or sewage treatment plants can lead to increased costs associated with clean up or damage reparation kumar et al 2021 exposed dwellings usually have some floors below and only one floor above ground level and the housing access at ground level bodoque et al 2016a which can increase vulnerability because people and their assets cannot be moved to a safer area vojinovic et al 2016 lastly collective buildings such as schools retirement homes sports facilities or health care centers located in flash flood prone areas can be occupied by a sensitive population that would require external assistance to leave hazard areas aroca jiménez et al 2020 the highest sensitivity values are mainly due to the physical and cultural dimensions urban planning in mountainous areas does not usually follow an orderly pattern papathoma köhle et al 2019 which can make it difficult for emergency services to evacuate a flood prone area rahman et al 2016 they also are buildings with a high average age which can cause their structural integrity to be compromised by flash floods rodríguez gaviria et al 2019 moreover the original construction material and age of cultural heritage assets are key aspects to consider in their management since flash floods can cause the collapse of the structure either by prolonged exposure to water or by the impact itself vojinovic et al 2016 lastly the highest resilience values are due to ecosystem and institutional dimensions regarding the ecosystem dimension resilience is mainly dominated by cultural ecosystem services despite the difficulty in characterizing them hernández morcillo et al 2013 the results obtained here show a clear influence of cultural ecosystem services on the system capacity to cope with and recover from an impact so it is very important to include related indicators when analyzing vulnerability to flash floods talbot et al 2018 a high coverage of protected natural spaces and species richness makes ecosystems more robust and functional and thus less prone to degradation hagenlocher et al 2018 moreover effective flood risk management needs the trust of the population in relevant risk management institutions papathoma köhle et al 2021 which requires a comprehensive analysis of the social perception of risk and a good communication strategy bodoque et al 2016b the capacity to invest in risk adaptation and mitigation strategies is a sign that institutions are functional and able to react faster and support the recovery of the population if a disastrous event occurs thus reducing the negative consequences papathoma köhle et al 2021 each methodological choice made in the index construction process involves subjectivity and therefore introduces uncertainty tate 2012 beccari 2016 this uncertainty is mainly related to the quality and availability of the original data and the normalization weighting and aggregation methods moreira et al 2021a 2021b indicator selection is the stage that has the greatest impact on the index outputs and it often depends on the data availability which is one of the main limitations when characterizing vulnerability in flash flood prone areas aroca jiménez et al 2020 the imvi outputs were validated here through a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using the monte carlo method and involving the median as an unbiased estimator of central tendency and the mad as an estimator of dispersion the median has been used by other authors before tate 2012 2013 and other researchers have used other dispersion measures than the mad such as standard deviation asare kyei et al 2017 feizizadeh and kienberger 2017 and coefficient of variation tate 2013 however the mad is recommended as a more robust dispersion measure than the dispersion estimators mentioned above leys et al 2013 our findings show that the total deviations of the imvi scores from the median and the mad were moderate in those urban areas with the highest vulnerability values there is also a high probability around 80 that urban areas do not change their vulnerability category after considering the scores obtained in the monte carlo analysis implying that the imvi obtained here is robust the use of integrated and multidimensional approaches also makes it possible to disaggregate results by uncertainty sources moreover discerning the factors that account for the greatest range of variation through a global sensitivity analysis provides more reliable results than local sensitivity analyses as it considers how simultaneous changes in all parameters impact on the imvi outcome feizizadeh and kienberger 2017 this represents an important step forward in the implementation of vulnerability indices as it allows decision makers to be aware of the limitations of the indices while developing tailored vulnerability reduction strategies based on the results of the uncertainty analysis finally the regional spatial patterns of vulnerability extracted through the lcca can contribute to the design of vulnerability reduction strategies tailored to the needs of each municipality cluster thus vulnerability reduction strategies of urban areas included in cluster 1 should be directed towards institutional strengthening through for example communication strategies that improve the relationship between the different public institutions involved in risk management blázquez et al 2021 regarding the municipalities included in cluster 2 vulnerability reduction strategies should focus on reducing exposure in this sense local level flood risk management plans that consider long term vulnerability reduction measures are required for this purpose such measures should be integrated into urban planning as well as into adaptation plans and policies papathoma köhle et al 2021 mapping spatial patterns of vulnerability can assist in building synergies between different policy areas such as urban planning or climate change adaptation which could help the implementation and objective fulfillment of strategies like the sendai framework the sustainable development goals sdgs or the european green deal yang et al 2019 lastly municipalities included in cluster 3 should target their vulnerability reduction strategies towards improving resilience in all its dimensions these areas have the least social economic ecosystem and institutional resources to cope with and recover from flood impacts therefore they should be priority areas for action in an emergency due to the high external support they would require aroca jiménez et al 2020 in the long term they also need a better coordination of the different institutions involved to improve flood risk management papathoma köhle et al 2021 which can be an opportunity to bring disaster risk reduction closer to sustainable development yang et al 2019 5 conclusions a flash flood integrated multidimensional vulnerability index imvi has been constructed and validated at regional scale in this work vulnerability has been characterized holistically taking into account all its dimensions and components this approach allows one to identify vulnerability sources and their underlying causes since index outputs are disaggregated quantitatively and graphically by dimensions and components the above increases the transparency of the index construction process which can improve the confidence of decision makers in the index and thus facilitate its implementation to enhance flood risk management the stochastic validation of the imvi makes it possible to disaggregate index results according to uncertainty and sensitivity sources this is a breakthrough for including vulnerability indices in flood risk management plans as managers can be aware of the index limitations and could design vulnerability reduction strategies considering the uncertainties finally the identification of vulnerability spatial patterns at the regional scale through latent class cluster analysis can help in the design of vulnerability reduction strategies tailored to the needs of each identified cluster of urban areas the above apart from helping to improve flood risk management can help to identify priority areas for action upon the declaration of an emergency situation either for the competent authorities to prioritize actions in emergency management or for a more efficient allocation of economic resources for actual emergency management credit authorship contribution statement estefanía aroca jiménez methodology validation formal

3174,runoff projection under future climate scenarios has been widely studied to investigate the impacts of climate change on regional water availability however uncertainty in runoff projection due to different etp inputs has not been fully assessed this study firstly adopted the physically based penman model temperature based hargreaves model and radiation based abtew jensen haise and modified makkink models to drive xinanjiang xaj model thus investigating the influence of different potential evapotranspiration etp inputs on runoff simulation then we used the validated xaj model to project runoff in north johnstone catchment northeast australia lastly we quantified the uncertainty caused by 34 global climate models gcms different representative concentrative pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 rcp8 5 and different etp models with the technique of three way analysis of variance anova we found that xaj model performed well r2 0 88 nse 0 86 and showed low sensitivity to different etp inputs in runoff simulation and projection under future climate scenarios spring and winter runoff had a large decrease which was mainly caused by the decrease in rainfall the mean decreases in spring and winter runoff were 14 6 20 1 and 10 3 15 2 respectively by 2090s under rcp8 5 gcms 50 9 67 4 and their interaction with rcps 35 4 46 6 were the dominant factors resulting in uncertainty in runoff projection our study not only advanced the understanding of the impacts of different etp inputs on runoff projection but also offered insights on the understanding of the roles different factors played in the uncertainty in runoff projection we expect such knowledge can provide a way forward to narrow down the uncertainty in runoff projection thus providing more robust information for policy makers in water management keywords runoff xinanjiang model potential evapotranspiration climate change gcms uncertainty 1 introduction runoff is one of the key processes in water transport both for surface water bodies e g rivers lakes wetlands and oceans and groundwater ghasemizade and schirmer 2013 kuchment 2004 the amount of runoff from each rainfall event has direct or indirect influences on water availability in many aspects of human activities such as agricultural and industrial production and domestic life allan et al 2020 devi et al 2015 previous studies have shown that climate change with increased temperature and changed rainfall patterns has great impacts on runoff arnell and gosling 2013 bosshard et al 2013 im et al 2009 for instance arnell and gosling 2013 found that more than 47 of the land surface would experience increases in mean annual runoff whereas around 36 of that would witness mean annual runoff decrease due to changes in temperature and rainfall meanwhile considerable variation in the impact of climate change on runoff has been found among different regions arnell and gosling 2013 do et al 2017 shen et al 2014 providing a robust projection of regional runoff under climate change plays a significant role in understanding local water resources management and revealing the impacts of a changing climate on local hydrological cycle allan et al 2020 yan et al 2020 different kinds of methods such as climate elasticity xing et al 2018 yang and yang 2011 bayesian approach freni et al 2009 and hydrological model chiew et al 2018 islam et al 2014 can be used for runoff simulation and projection compared with other methods one of the most important advantages of hydrological models is that they are capable to detect the hydroclimate response to changes by offering a comprehensive and reliable approach at a certain catchment guo et al 2017a li et al 2020 in previous studies hydrological models were widely used as powerful tools to investigate runoff response to climate change fowler et al 2018 pechlivanidis et al 2016 vaze and teng 2011 specifically historical observed rainfall and runoff sequences are used to calibrate and validate the performance of hydrological models then runoff can be projected by the calibrated hydrological models forced with the climatic factors derived from global climate models gcms arnell 2011 chen and yu 2015 for instance senent aparicio et al 2017 investigated the influence of climate change on runoff in mediterranean europe with swat model and found that runoff would decrease due to the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall in western australia islam et al 2014 downscaled climatic data from 11 gcms under a2 and b1 emission scenarios to drive lucicat model for the future rainfall runoff projection they found that projected decrease in rainfall would result in a large decrease in runoff for western australia in the mid and late of 21st century according to closed water balance runoff for a certain region is roughly the difference between rainfall and actual evapotranspiration eta in a long term period montaldo and oren 2018 therefore the estimation of eta is expected to influence the simulation of runoff riegger and tourian 2014 in the process of runoff simulation with most hydrological models potential evapotranspiration etp is an essential input to calculate eta used for simulating runoff bai et al 2016 li and zhang 2017 however various etp models generally produce different etp estimates feng et al 2016 kumar et al 1987 kumar roy et al 2020 in this case which etp model could produce better runoff simulation is an important question to answer dakhlaoui et al 2020 oudin et al 2005 seiller and anctil 2016 in other words will the difference in etp estimates result in different runoff simulations projections addressing this question is important in runoff projection under a changing climate as etp is greatly influenced by future climate pan et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 oudin et al 2005 adopted etp estimated by 27 etp models to drive four rainfall runoff hydrological models and investigate the influence of different etp inputs on historical runoff simulation over 308 catchments across france australia and the united states they found that these hydrological models showed low sensitivity to etp inputs but temperature based and radiation based etp models yielded the best runoff simulation under future climate scenarios seiller and anctil 2016 assessed the sensitivity of 20 hydrological models in runoff projection to etp estimated by 24 different equations they found that the different etp inputs exerted moderate influence on runoff projection in korea bae et al 2011 investigated the sensitivity of three hydrological models to seven etp methods in runoff projection with downscaled climate data from 13 gcms they concluded that the influence of different etp on runoff projection became larger on the contrary dakhlaoui et al 2020 found that discharge simulated by three hydrological models was not sensitive to the etp estimates under different climate conditions in summary though studies about the influence of different etp inputs on future runoff projection are becoming common there is no consistent conclusion yet another unavoidable challenge in future runoff projection is the uncertainty caused by many factors such as gcms hydrological models knutti and sedláček 2012 teng et al 2015 and emission scenarios woldemeskel et al 2016 for instance teng et al 2012 projected runoff based on 15 gcms with five hydrological models in southeast australia and found that uncertainty caused by gcms was much larger than that caused by hydrological models vetter et al 2017 investigated the uncertainty in runoff projection caused by five gcms four rcps and nine hydrological models across 12 large scale catchments worldwide they found that gcms and rcps were the main factors resulting in the uncertainty similarly chegwidden et al 2019 found that the choice of rcps or gcms was the main source influencing the spread in annual streamflow volume and timing these studies would provide useful information to quantify the dominant source of uncertainty in runoff projection however few of them considered the possible contribution of different etp inputs and their interaction with other factors to the uncertainty in runoff projection given that etp is essential for runoff projection especially the influence of etp may become larger under future climate scenarios seiller and anctil 2016 it is necessary to include etp in the uncertainty analysis in runoff projection thus the objectives of this study are dual 1 to investigate the influence of different etp inputs both in historical runoff simulation and future runoff projection 2 to quantify the relative contribution of gcms rcps etp models and their interaction to the uncertainty in runoff projection to achieve these goals we calibrated and validated xinanjiang xaj a rainfall runoff hydrological model driven by different etp inputs against observed historical runoff at a humid catchment in northeastern australia then we used validated xaj model to project future runoff under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with climate data downscaled from 34 gcms based on the projected runoff we quantified the relative contribution of different factors with the method of analysis of variance we expect this study can offer further insights into the impacts of different etp inputs on runoff projection and help to clarify the role of etp inputs on the related uncertainty the knowledge from this study will be helpful to guide the etp model choice in future runoff projection results in this study can also provide a way forward to narrow down uncertainty in runoff projection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is north johnstone catchment 17 16 s 17 38 s 145 28 e 146 40 e fig 1 locating in the wet tropics of queensland australia it covers an area of 924 km2 with elevation ranging from 18 m to 1370 m zhang et al 2020 the mean maximum and minimum temperatures in this catchment are around 26 0 c and 16 7 c respectively mean annual rainfall in this catchment is around 2530 mm and mean annual runoff is around 1900 mm the area is influenced by the monsoon and tropical lows depressions thus most of its rainfall occurs in austral warmer months from december to may specifically the mean summer dec feb and autumn mar may rainfall is around 1120 mm and 840 mm whereas the mean rainfall in winter jun aug and spring sep nov is around 300 mm and 270 mm respectively correspondingly the production of runoff also showed seasonal difference larger than 70 of runoff yielded in summer and autumn fig 2 showed the seasonal temporal trends of potential evapotranspiration rainfall and runoff in north johnstone catchment in the research period it showed that rainfall in summer and autumn is generally higher than evapotranspiration whereas spring and winter rainfall were lower than evapotranspiration in other words spring and winter are relatively drier than summer and autumn in this region pasture and conserved natural rainforest are the main vegetation types of the catchment the area of pasture and conserved natural rainforest cover 51 and 37 of the catchment respectively rafiei et al 2020 banana sugarcane tea and tropical fruit are the main agricultural product in the catchment meanwhile runoff from this catchment is one of the water sources running to the great barrier reef gbr thus changes in runoff here may have an influence on the ecological function of gbr 2 2 observed historical climatic data and downscaled future climatic data historical daily climatic data from ten weather sites fig 1 within or near by the catchment was extracted from the scientific information for land owners silo patched point dataset https www longpaddock qld gov au silo datadrill index php jeffrey et al 2001 these data included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin maximum relative humidity rhmax minimum relative humidity rhmin solar radiation rs and rainfall on the one hand they were used to estimate historical etp and drive xinanjiang model for historical runoff simulation on the other hand they were used to do second bias correction for gcms output as a part of the statistical downscaling procedure monthly tmax tmin rs and rainfall under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were downscaled from 34 gcms grids to these ten sites with the method developed by liu and zuo 2012 in detail the monthly gridded climate data from gcms were firstly interpolated to the ten sites with inverse distance weighted interpolation method then bias correction was carried out to correct the stationary bias and systemic errors embedded with the site specific monthly gcm projections against silo historical data lastly daily climatic data at these sites were generated using a stochastic weather generator liu and zuo 2012 the detailed information about the 34 gcms can be referred to shi et al 2020 these downscaled climate data were used to estimate etp under climate change scenarios then the etp and downscaled rainfall were used in xaj model as inputs for runoff projection in theory the downscaled climate data from gcms would be comparable to the observed ones if the bias correction in the second step was perfect during the downscaling procedure thus the projected runoff with downscaled climate data was also expected to be similar to those of an otherwise identically simulated with observations however as the bias correction in the second step mainly works for stationary bias and systemic errors e g mean bias and projected trends in the future and fails in correcting the bias caused by misrepresentation of dynamical physical processes or non stationary biases caused by gcms haerter et al 2011 yang et al 2016 in other words the runoff projected with downscaled climate data is not likely to be as the same as the one of an otherwise identically simulated with observations the difference between runoff projected with downscaled gcm data and runoff identically simulated with observations can be viewed as biophysical biases in this study we adopted a secondary bias correction method yang et al 2016 to correct the multi year averages of projected runoff with the following equation 1 roff r o f f g rof f gbl rof f obl where roff is the projected value after the second bias correction roff g is the projected value from xaj model driven by downscaled climate data rof f gbl is the mean projected runoff over a historical baseline period with downscaled climate data rof f obl is the corresponding mean runoff over the historical period with observed climate data 2 3 empirical etp models air temperature and solar radiation are two key factors influencing etp it s reported that they can explain about 80 of variations in etp almorox et al 2015 priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 meanwhile compared with other climatic factors e g wind speed air temperatures downscaled from gcms are more reliable under future climate scenarios guo et al 2017b furthermore oudin et al 2005 reported that temperature based etp models can produce reliable runoff simulation therefore this study adopted both the physically based penman model the commonly used temperature based hargreaves hs and radiation based models including jensen haise jh abtew ab and modified makkink mak to investigate the influence of different etp inputs on runoff simulation their performance in estimating etp has been demonstrated in shi et al 2020 the mathematical expressions of these empirical etp models were shown in the following equations the physical based penman model 2 et p penman

the calculation of these parameters can be referred to allen et al 1998 2 4 xinanjiang xaj model as a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff hydraulic model the xaj model has been widely used to simulate runoff in humid and sub humid regions li et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 due to the consistent performance of xaj model in runoff simulation it also has been widely used to investigate the response of runoff to climate change seiller and anctil 2014 tian et al 2013 xaj model is divided into four sub models namely a three layer evapotranspiration sub model runoff production sub model separation of runoff components sub model and flow concentration sub model zhang et al 2019 zhao 1992 fig 3 and table 1 showed the flow chart and 16 parameters used in xaj model respectively the area mean daily rainfall and etp are inputs for this model and daily runoff and eta are the outputs the runoff simulated by xaj model is based on the assumption that runoff is produced after the soil moisture content of the aeration zone has reached field capacity zhao 1992 2 5 calibration and validation of xaj model and scenario analysis the calculated etp and the observed rainfall at all ten sites were used to calculate the area mean etp and area mean rainfall to drive xaj model for runoff simulation historical daily observed discharge from the tung oil gauge which received most of the streamflow from the catchment was extracted from the bureau of meteorology website https www bom gov au waterdata were used to calibrate and validate xaj model the historical climatic data from 1998 to 2010 were used to calibrate xaj model while the data from 2011 to 2017 were used for model s validation this study used sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona a global optimization method to optimize xaj model parameters zhang et al 2019 firstly individual etp model was used to calculate etp and drive xaj model then the parameters calibrated by a certain etp model were used to validate xaj model for other etp models in addition to the one used for calibration in other words cross model validation was carried out among these etp models to investigate the sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs then the group of parameters that produced the best runoff simulation for all etp models were used in runoff projections with downscaled climatic data under future climate scenarios the empirical models including jh ab mak and hs were used to project future runoff in order to investigate the influence of different etp models on runoff projection nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the xaj model driven by different models estimated etp against observed runoff the nse has been widely used in comparing hydrologic model performance fang et al 2020 li et al 2009 it ranges from to 1 the value of 1 represents that the model simulated runoff perfectly matches with the observed runoff therefore the closer the nse value is to 1 the better the hydrological model performs generally a hydrological model with nse and r2 larger than 0 50 is capable of effectively simulating stream flow for a certain catchment zhang et al 2019 the nse r2 and rmse were calculated with the following equations 11 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 12 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim 2 where q obs i mm day 1 was the observed runoff for i th day q sim i mm day 1 was simulated runoff for i th day q obs mm day 1 and q sim mm day 1 are the corresponding mean daily values of observed runoff and simulated runoff in the research period to project the change of runoff in the future period we divided the downscaled climatic data into five time periods namely baseline period from 1998 to 2017 near future period from 2021 to 2040 2030s middle future period from 2041 to 2060 2050s far future period from 2061 to 2080 2070s and further future period from 2081 to 2100 2090s 2 6 partitioning uncertainty to different sources analysis of variance anova method is capable of separating the total observed variances into different sources and considering the interactive contributions of different sources bosshard et al 2013 lee et al 2021 in other words one of the advantages of anova method is that it quantifies both uncertainty related to each source and uncertainty related to the interaction among different sources morim et al 2019 yip et al 2011 interaction effects in anova represent the combined effects of factors on the dependent variable thus this method has been widely used in uncertainty analysis in climate change impact assessment lee et al 2021 morim et al 2019 wang et al 2020a for instance yip et al 2011 adopted anova method to quantify the total uncertainty in climate projections into uncertainties related to gcms rcps and their interaction morim et al 2019 adopted a three way anova method to quantify the uncertainty in wind wave climate projections related to gcms rcps and different wave modelling methods gcms rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 2030s 2050s 2070s and 2090s respectively and etp models are the sources contributing to the uncertainty for runoff projection in our study accordingly we adopted a three way anova method and varied the 34 gcms 4 etp models and 8 rcp scenarios rcp4 5 2030s rcp4 5 2050s rcp4 5 2070s rcp4 5 2090s rcp8 5 2030s rcp8 5 2050s rcp8 5 2070s and rcp8 5 2090s in all possible combinations which is 1088 subsets in total to analyze the relative and interactive contribution of these sources that is the anova was fit based on the projected mean seasonal runoff x g r e for the g th gcm r th rcp scenarios and e th etp model equation 14 to equation 29 showed the calculation of total sum of squares and squares due to individual effects and interactive effects the calculation

the total sum square and sum squares for each uncertainty source the relative contribution of each uncertainty source was calculated as the proportion of the partial variances ss to the total sum of the variances sst 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the xaj model as one of the key inputs in runoff simulation difference was observed in etp estimated by different models figure s1 for instance more etp estimated by ab was lower than 4 mm day 1 whereas jh estimated etp were more likely to be higher than 4 mm day 1 however the observed runoff and simulated runoff from the xaj model driven by different etp inputs did not show great difference as indicated by similar r2 fig 4 top panel nse fig 4 middle panel and rmse fig 4 bottom panel both in calibration and validation periods take the validation period as an explanation r2 nse and rmse ranged from 0 88 to 0 89 0 86 to 0 88 and from 2 74 mm day 1 to 2 90 mm day 1 respectively the high r2 and nse indicated that xaj model was capable to simulate observed runoff very well meanwhile the results suggested that etp models i e penman model which had more complicated structures were not always likely to outperform the simple empirical models in runoff simulation fig 5 showed the daily runoff temporal trends from 1998 to 2017 it showed that temporal trends of observed runoff were well replicated by xaj model regardless of the etp inputs this finding also confirmed that the difference of etp inputs had little influence on the runoff simulation 3 2 changes in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration under future climate scenarios compared with the baseline period 1998 2017 the change of rainfall under future climate scenarios showed seasonal difference fig 6 in general the decreases in spring and winter rainfall were higher than that in summer and autumn the mean decreases for spring rainfall ranged from 2 to 3 5 under rcp4 5 and from 5 3 to 11 1 under rcp8 5 the corresponding mean decreases for winter rainfall ranged from 3 4 to 8 8 and from 6 2 to 7 1 respectively contrary to the decreases in seasonal rainfall all seasonal etp would increase in the future fig 7 the magnitudes of increases showed variation among etp models specifically jh and ab generally projected higher increases in etp than hs and mak did another pattern showed by etp increases was that the increases under rcp8 5 were higher than that under rcp4 5 meanwhile the increases of etp also became higher with the time getting into the further future periods the mean increases of spring etp projected by jh ab varied from 1 9 1 8 2030s to 8 0 6 4 2090s under rcp4 5 while mak hs projected increases ranged from 0 7 0 3 2030s to 3 0 3 5 2090s under rcp8 5 the jh ab projected increases ranged from 3 0 2 9 2030s to 16 5 13 1 2090s and mak hs projected increases ranged from 1 3 0 8 2030s to 5 1 7 1 2090s 3 3 changes in runoff under future climate scenarios the changes of runoff under future climate scenarios with different etp inputs were shown in fig 8 we found that the seasonal difference of changes in runoff was similar to that in rainfall in other words spring and winter runoff generally showed larger decreases than that in summer and autumn furthermore runoff would generally experience larger decreases under rcp8 5 than that under rcp4 5 for the same future period for example xaj model with all etp inputs projected a slight decrease around 0 7 in spring runoff under rcp4 5 by 2030s whereas the decrease was around 15 7 under rcp8 5 by 2090s the decrease of spring runoff projected with different etp inputs ranged from 10 1 mak to 13 1 jh under rcp4 5 and from 14 6 mak to 20 1 jh under rcp8 5 the mean decreases of winter runoff varied from 2 1 mak to 3 4 jh by 2030s and from 5 9 mak to 8 9 jh by 2090s under rcp4 5 the corresponding decreases under rcp8 5 were 7 4 mak 9 3 jh by 2030s and 10 3 mak 15 2 jh by 2090s to investigate the relationship between changes in runoff and changes in rainfall and etp the scatter plots between them were shown in fig 9 the r2 between changes in runoff and etp was not larger than 0 46 whereas the r2 between changes in runoff and rainfall was no less than 0 86 this finding indicated that changes in runoff were mainly caused by changes in rainfall 3 4 uncertainty in runoff projection fig 10 displayed the relative contribution of different sources to the uncertainty caused in runoff projection for each season gcms generally contributed the most to the uncertainty ranging from 50 9 to 67 4 the interaction between gcms and rcps also played a significant role in the total uncertainty ranging from 35 4 to 46 6 in contrast the uncertainty caused by different etp models was minor for all seasons even though it was getting larger in winter than that in spring the minor role of etp models may be explained by the fact that runoff projection via xaj model was rarely influenced by the difference of etp models as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 low sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs compared with xaj model driven by physically based penman calculated etp it showed comparable or even better ability in runoff simulation with temperature based hs and radiation based etp inputs for instance with the same r2 and nse rmse produced by xaj model with penman etp was even larger 0 05 mm day 1 than that produced by xaj model with ab and hs etp inputs fig 4 in spite of the small difference among different etp inputs xaj model performed well in reproducing daily observed runoff fig 5 with r2 larger than 0 88 nse larger than 0 86 and rmse less than 3 23 mm day 1 fig 4 under future climate scenarios runoff projected with different etp inputs also showed similar change patterns fig 8 these findings demonstrated the low sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs similar results were also reported in previous studies dakhlaoui et al 2020 kelleher and shaw 2018 in detail dakhlaoui et al 2020 compared runoff projection by three hydrological models with different etp estimations in northern tunisia they claimed that hydrological projections with different etp estimations were similar indicating the low sensitivity of hydrological models to different etp inputs overall we found that the difference in runoff projection yielded by different etp inputs was small for xaj model this could be partially explained by the fact that the difference in etp estimates was trade off by difference in the calibrated model s parameters for instance the coefficient of deep evapotranspiration c shown in table 2 was different as a result of the different etp inputs in other words the calibration procedure of xaj model with different etp inputs also produced different parameters thus trading off the difference in etp inputs and yielding similar and good runoff simulation considering that some downscaled daily climate data e g wind speed or relative humidity are not always available to support the use of complicated etp models oudin et al 2005 randall et al 2007 the low sensitivity of xaj model to etp inputs is helpful to improve our confidence in the use of temperature based or radiation based etp models in future runoff projection 4 2 runoff projections based on xaj under future climate scenarios this study predicted a general decrease in runoff under future climate scenarios especially for spring and winter fig 8 a decrease in runoff under a changing climate was reported by previous studies both in northeast and other parts of australia eccles et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 potter et al 2010 for example in southwest western australia barria et al 2015 found that projected runoff by 2050 2080 would decrease by 10 80 compared to runoff in 1970 2000 in a subtropical catchment of queensland eccles et al 2021 investigated the influence of climate change on runoff with climatic data downscaled from multi model ensemble gcms to drive a lumped conceptual hydrological model they found that both high and mean streamflow were predicted to decrease note that their decreases in spring and winter were much larger than that in summer and autumn which is consistent with our results decrease in runoff was mainly caused by a decrease in rainfall though the increasing etp also amplified the reduction fig 6 we found that the r2 between projected changes in runoff and rainfall was more than 0 86 fig 9 which was much higher than its correlation with changes in etp this demonstrated that rainfall is the main driving factor in the change of projected runoff as reported by charles et al 2020 they claimed that increasing etp would cause an additional reduction in runoff under a warming climate but changes in rainfall mainly determine the relative results similarly donohue et al 2011 assessed the sensitivity of runoff to changes in precipitation and etp based on budyko s curve they found that the change of precipitation caused larger change in runoff than that caused by the same change of etp in this study the dominant role of rainfall in influencing runoff changes may also partially explain the low sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs rainfall in north johnstone catchment mainly occurs in summer and autumn fig 2 zhang et al 2020 by contrast spring and winter are dry seasons for this catchment the decreases of future rainfall and runoff will make these two seasons drier compared to baseline which is likely to result in severe influence on the agricultural production and ecological functions in this catchment potter et al 2010 for instance the concentrations of nutrient and sediment may become larger as the flushing times tend to be longer apart with the dry seasons getting drier eccles et al 2020 eccles et al 2021 meanwhile water consuming industries such as irrigators forestry and wetland in this region may face increasing demands and competition for water during these drier seasons petheram et al 2012 4 3 uncertainty in runoff projection we found that gcms followed by interaction between gcms and rcps was the dominant source of uncertainty in projected runoff changes fig 10 similar results were reported by other studies lee et al 2021 found that gcms accounted for more than 45 of the total uncertainty in the projection of streamflow caused by hydrological model parameters gcms and rcps at coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed at global scale arnell and gosling 2013 reported that gcm related uncertainty in hydrological projection was the largest among uncertainty caused by gcms emission scenarios and the natural variability in hydrological regimes the dominant role of gcms played in the uncertainty in runoff projection may be attributed to the large uncertainty in rainfall projected by gcms according to woldemeskel et al 2016 gcms accounted for around 90 of the uncertainty in rainfall projection therefore the large uncertainty in rainfall projection caused by gcms is likely to be transmitted to runoff projection as gcms downscaled rainfall is an essential input for xaj model as petheram et al 2012 reported in their study that the largest uncertainty in runoff projection was caused by rainfall projections from different gcms the high r2 0 86 between change in runoff and rainfall in our study also support this conclusion different pathways of carbon dioxide other anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases aerosols and so on were associated with different rcps and used as inputs to force gcms to generate different climate simulations meinshausen et al 2011 in other words gcms projections under different rcps will result in different temperature and rainfall changes therefore great contribution from the interaction between gcms and rcps to the uncertainty in runoff projection was not unexpected lee et al 2021 compared to uncertainty caused by gcms uncertainty caused by etp models was small though its contribution in autumn and winter became larger fig 10 this finding may be explained by the fact that the projection of runoff is more influenced by rainfall instead of etp charles et al 2020 rajulapati et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 that r2 between change in runoff and change in etp was barely larger than 0 40 the uncertainty in runoff projection poses a great challenge for decision makers in taking measures to adapt to the possible water scarcity and stress though it is impossible to avoid uncertainty in climate projections it is possible to reduce uncertainty from them hawkins and sutton 2011 shoaib et al 2018 for instance narrowing down uncertainty from gcms can be realized by screening the performance of gcms and choosing gcms which can well replicate historical observations for runoff projection wang et al 2020b quantified how many gcms should be used to fully cover the uncertainty caused by them in runoff projection and concluded that at least 10 gcms should be used therefore attention should be paid both to the quality and to the quantity of gcms used in runoff projection in addition another key requirement for reducing uncertainty in climate change impact assessment in hydrology is to better characterize climate change at the local level the accuracy of climate system modeling has been improved over the last decades chen et al 2021 woldemeskel et al 2016 with incorporating important physical processes increasing models complexities and improving model s resolution chen et al 2021 found that the latest coupled model intercomparison project phases 6 cmip6 performed better in simulating extreme precipitation in western north pacific and east asia 4 4 limitations of this study in this study we only used one hydrological model to assess the impacts of climate change on runoff previous studies demonstrated that the direction of projected future runoff change by different hydrological models for a certain catchment is likely to be consistent pechlivanidis et al 2016 teng et al 2012 however it is very important to adopt multiple hydrology models to investigate the magnitude of runoff change under future climate in addition as only one hydrological model was used in this study the contribution of hydrological models to uncertainty in runoff projection was not investigated some studies concluded that uncertainty caused by hydrological models was small compared with that caused by gcms and rcps aryal et al 2019 bosshard et al 2013 gosling and arnell 2011 for example teng et al 2012 adopted five hydrological models with downscaled climate data from 15 gcms to investigate climate change impact on runoff in southeastern australia and analyzed the uncertainty caused by different sources they found that the uncertainty in runoff change caused by gcms with a certain hydrological model was around four or five times larger than the uncertainty caused by hydrological models with a certain gcm even so it is still necessary to include this factor in the future study to avoid the possible underestimation of the total uncertainty related with runoff projection bosshard et al 2013 note that our results were specific to a certain catchment projected by xaj model it may yield discordant conclusions when different catchments or hydrological models are used for instance jung et al 2012 claimed that uncertainty in hydrological projection at rain dominated basin was different with that in the snow dominated basin therefore it is necessary for future research to consider more hydrological models to investigate the influence of etp models at multiple contrasting catchments 5 conclusions we investigated the influence of different etp inputs on runoff simulation and projection with xaj model in north johnstone catchment northeast australia meanwhile we quantified the contribution of gcms rcps etp models and their interaction to the uncertainty in runoff projection with a method of three way analysis of variance our findings indicated that xaj model performed well in runoff simulation in the study catchment we found that xaj model with different etp inputs projected similar decreases in spring and winter runoff while a small change in summer and autumn runoff it is feasible to adopt simple empirical etp models to project runoff especially when some downscaled climate data e g winds and vapour pressure are not available we also found that gcms and its interaction with rcps contributed the most to the uncertainty in runoff projection this highlighted the necessity to adopt multiple gcms and rcps to comprehensively project the potential influence of climate change on runoff our finding also provide a way forward to narrow down the uncertainty in runoff projection note that all our results are specific to xaj model at a wet tropical catchment in future studies we expect to employ more hydrological models with different etp inputs driven by the latest cmip6 climatic data to quantify the uncertainty on runoff projection at various catchments credit authorship

3174,runoff projection under future climate scenarios has been widely studied to investigate the impacts of climate change on regional water availability however uncertainty in runoff projection due to different etp inputs has not been fully assessed this study firstly adopted the physically based penman model temperature based hargreaves model and radiation based abtew jensen haise and modified makkink models to drive xinanjiang xaj model thus investigating the influence of different potential evapotranspiration etp inputs on runoff simulation then we used the validated xaj model to project runoff in north johnstone catchment northeast australia lastly we quantified the uncertainty caused by 34 global climate models gcms different representative concentrative pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 rcp8 5 and different etp models with the technique of three way analysis of variance anova we found that xaj model performed well r2 0 88 nse 0 86 and showed low sensitivity to different etp inputs in runoff simulation and projection under future climate scenarios spring and winter runoff had a large decrease which was mainly caused by the decrease in rainfall the mean decreases in spring and winter runoff were 14 6 20 1 and 10 3 15 2 respectively by 2090s under rcp8 5 gcms 50 9 67 4 and their interaction with rcps 35 4 46 6 were the dominant factors resulting in uncertainty in runoff projection our study not only advanced the understanding of the impacts of different etp inputs on runoff projection but also offered insights on the understanding of the roles different factors played in the uncertainty in runoff projection we expect such knowledge can provide a way forward to narrow down the uncertainty in runoff projection thus providing more robust information for policy makers in water management keywords runoff xinanjiang model potential evapotranspiration climate change gcms uncertainty 1 introduction runoff is one of the key processes in water transport both for surface water bodies e g rivers lakes wetlands and oceans and groundwater ghasemizade and schirmer 2013 kuchment 2004 the amount of runoff from each rainfall event has direct or indirect influences on water availability in many aspects of human activities such as agricultural and industrial production and domestic life allan et al 2020 devi et al 2015 previous studies have shown that climate change with increased temperature and changed rainfall patterns has great impacts on runoff arnell and gosling 2013 bosshard et al 2013 im et al 2009 for instance arnell and gosling 2013 found that more than 47 of the land surface would experience increases in mean annual runoff whereas around 36 of that would witness mean annual runoff decrease due to changes in temperature and rainfall meanwhile considerable variation in the impact of climate change on runoff has been found among different regions arnell and gosling 2013 do et al 2017 shen et al 2014 providing a robust projection of regional runoff under climate change plays a significant role in understanding local water resources management and revealing the impacts of a changing climate on local hydrological cycle allan et al 2020 yan et al 2020 different kinds of methods such as climate elasticity xing et al 2018 yang and yang 2011 bayesian approach freni et al 2009 and hydrological model chiew et al 2018 islam et al 2014 can be used for runoff simulation and projection compared with other methods one of the most important advantages of hydrological models is that they are capable to detect the hydroclimate response to changes by offering a comprehensive and reliable approach at a certain catchment guo et al 2017a li et al 2020 in previous studies hydrological models were widely used as powerful tools to investigate runoff response to climate change fowler et al 2018 pechlivanidis et al 2016 vaze and teng 2011 specifically historical observed rainfall and runoff sequences are used to calibrate and validate the performance of hydrological models then runoff can be projected by the calibrated hydrological models forced with the climatic factors derived from global climate models gcms arnell 2011 chen and yu 2015 for instance senent aparicio et al 2017 investigated the influence of climate change on runoff in mediterranean europe with swat model and found that runoff would decrease due to the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall in western australia islam et al 2014 downscaled climatic data from 11 gcms under a2 and b1 emission scenarios to drive lucicat model for the future rainfall runoff projection they found that projected decrease in rainfall would result in a large decrease in runoff for western australia in the mid and late of 21st century according to closed water balance runoff for a certain region is roughly the difference between rainfall and actual evapotranspiration eta in a long term period montaldo and oren 2018 therefore the estimation of eta is expected to influence the simulation of runoff riegger and tourian 2014 in the process of runoff simulation with most hydrological models potential evapotranspiration etp is an essential input to calculate eta used for simulating runoff bai et al 2016 li and zhang 2017 however various etp models generally produce different etp estimates feng et al 2016 kumar et al 1987 kumar roy et al 2020 in this case which etp model could produce better runoff simulation is an important question to answer dakhlaoui et al 2020 oudin et al 2005 seiller and anctil 2016 in other words will the difference in etp estimates result in different runoff simulations projections addressing this question is important in runoff projection under a changing climate as etp is greatly influenced by future climate pan et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 oudin et al 2005 adopted etp estimated by 27 etp models to drive four rainfall runoff hydrological models and investigate the influence of different etp inputs on historical runoff simulation over 308 catchments across france australia and the united states they found that these hydrological models showed low sensitivity to etp inputs but temperature based and radiation based etp models yielded the best runoff simulation under future climate scenarios seiller and anctil 2016 assessed the sensitivity of 20 hydrological models in runoff projection to etp estimated by 24 different equations they found that the different etp inputs exerted moderate influence on runoff projection in korea bae et al 2011 investigated the sensitivity of three hydrological models to seven etp methods in runoff projection with downscaled climate data from 13 gcms they concluded that the influence of different etp on runoff projection became larger on the contrary dakhlaoui et al 2020 found that discharge simulated by three hydrological models was not sensitive to the etp estimates under different climate conditions in summary though studies about the influence of different etp inputs on future runoff projection are becoming common there is no consistent conclusion yet another unavoidable challenge in future runoff projection is the uncertainty caused by many factors such as gcms hydrological models knutti and sedláček 2012 teng et al 2015 and emission scenarios woldemeskel et al 2016 for instance teng et al 2012 projected runoff based on 15 gcms with five hydrological models in southeast australia and found that uncertainty caused by gcms was much larger than that caused by hydrological models vetter et al 2017 investigated the uncertainty in runoff projection caused by five gcms four rcps and nine hydrological models across 12 large scale catchments worldwide they found that gcms and rcps were the main factors resulting in the uncertainty similarly chegwidden et al 2019 found that the choice of rcps or gcms was the main source influencing the spread in annual streamflow volume and timing these studies would provide useful information to quantify the dominant source of uncertainty in runoff projection however few of them considered the possible contribution of different etp inputs and their interaction with other factors to the uncertainty in runoff projection given that etp is essential for runoff projection especially the influence of etp may become larger under future climate scenarios seiller and anctil 2016 it is necessary to include etp in the uncertainty analysis in runoff projection thus the objectives of this study are dual 1 to investigate the influence of different etp inputs both in historical runoff simulation and future runoff projection 2 to quantify the relative contribution of gcms rcps etp models and their interaction to the uncertainty in runoff projection to achieve these goals we calibrated and validated xinanjiang xaj a rainfall runoff hydrological model driven by different etp inputs against observed historical runoff at a humid catchment in northeastern australia then we used validated xaj model to project future runoff under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with climate data downscaled from 34 gcms based on the projected runoff we quantified the relative contribution of different factors with the method of analysis of variance we expect this study can offer further insights into the impacts of different etp inputs on runoff projection and help to clarify the role of etp inputs on the related uncertainty the knowledge from this study will be helpful to guide the etp model choice in future runoff projection results in this study can also provide a way forward to narrow down uncertainty in runoff projection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is north johnstone catchment 17 16 s 17 38 s 145 28 e 146 40 e fig 1 locating in the wet tropics of queensland australia it covers an area of 924 km2 with elevation ranging from 18 m to 1370 m zhang et al 2020 the mean maximum and minimum temperatures in this catchment are around 26 0 c and 16 7 c respectively mean annual rainfall in this catchment is around 2530 mm and mean annual runoff is around 1900 mm the area is influenced by the monsoon and tropical lows depressions thus most of its rainfall occurs in austral warmer months from december to may specifically the mean summer dec feb and autumn mar may rainfall is around 1120 mm and 840 mm whereas the mean rainfall in winter jun aug and spring sep nov is around 300 mm and 270 mm respectively correspondingly the production of runoff also showed seasonal difference larger than 70 of runoff yielded in summer and autumn fig 2 showed the seasonal temporal trends of potential evapotranspiration rainfall and runoff in north johnstone catchment in the research period it showed that rainfall in summer and autumn is generally higher than evapotranspiration whereas spring and winter rainfall were lower than evapotranspiration in other words spring and winter are relatively drier than summer and autumn in this region pasture and conserved natural rainforest are the main vegetation types of the catchment the area of pasture and conserved natural rainforest cover 51 and 37 of the catchment respectively rafiei et al 2020 banana sugarcane tea and tropical fruit are the main agricultural product in the catchment meanwhile runoff from this catchment is one of the water sources running to the great barrier reef gbr thus changes in runoff here may have an influence on the ecological function of gbr 2 2 observed historical climatic data and downscaled future climatic data historical daily climatic data from ten weather sites fig 1 within or near by the catchment was extracted from the scientific information for land owners silo patched point dataset https www longpaddock qld gov au silo datadrill index php jeffrey et al 2001 these data included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin maximum relative humidity rhmax minimum relative humidity rhmin solar radiation rs and rainfall on the one hand they were used to estimate historical etp and drive xinanjiang model for historical runoff simulation on the other hand they were used to do second bias correction for gcms output as a part of the statistical downscaling procedure monthly tmax tmin rs and rainfall under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were downscaled from 34 gcms grids to these ten sites with the method developed by liu and zuo 2012 in detail the monthly gridded climate data from gcms were firstly interpolated to the ten sites with inverse distance weighted interpolation method then bias correction was carried out to correct the stationary bias and systemic errors embedded with the site specific monthly gcm projections against silo historical data lastly daily climatic data at these sites were generated using a stochastic weather generator liu and zuo 2012 the detailed information about the 34 gcms can be referred to shi et al 2020 these downscaled climate data were used to estimate etp under climate change scenarios then the etp and downscaled rainfall were used in xaj model as inputs for runoff projection in theory the downscaled climate data from gcms would be comparable to the observed ones if the bias correction in the second step was perfect during the downscaling procedure thus the projected runoff with downscaled climate data was also expected to be similar to those of an otherwise identically simulated with observations however as the bias correction in the second step mainly works for stationary bias and systemic errors e g mean bias and projected trends in the future and fails in correcting the bias caused by misrepresentation of dynamical physical processes or non stationary biases caused by gcms haerter et al 2011 yang et al 2016 in other words the runoff projected with downscaled climate data is not likely to be as the same as the one of an otherwise identically simulated with observations the difference between runoff projected with downscaled gcm data and runoff identically simulated with observations can be viewed as biophysical biases in this study we adopted a secondary bias correction method yang et al 2016 to correct the multi year averages of projected runoff with the following equation 1 roff r o f f g rof f gbl rof f obl where roff is the projected value after the second bias correction roff g is the projected value from xaj model driven by downscaled climate data rof f gbl is the mean projected runoff over a historical baseline period with downscaled climate data rof f obl is the corresponding mean runoff over the historical period with observed climate data 2 3 empirical etp models air temperature and solar radiation are two key factors influencing etp it s reported that they can explain about 80 of variations in etp almorox et al 2015 priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 meanwhile compared with other climatic factors e g wind speed air temperatures downscaled from gcms are more reliable under future climate scenarios guo et al 2017b furthermore oudin et al 2005 reported that temperature based etp models can produce reliable runoff simulation therefore this study adopted both the physically based penman model the commonly used temperature based hargreaves hs and radiation based models including jensen haise jh abtew ab and modified makkink mak to investigate the influence of different etp inputs on runoff simulation their performance in estimating etp has been demonstrated in shi et al 2020 the mathematical expressions of these empirical etp models were shown in the following equations the physical based penman model 2 et p penman

runoff in humid and sub humid regions li et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 due to the consistent performance of xaj model in runoff simulation it also has been widely used to investigate the response of runoff to climate change seiller and anctil 2014 tian et al 2013 xaj model is divided into four sub models namely a three layer evapotranspiration sub model runoff production sub model separation of runoff components sub model and flow concentration sub model zhang et al 2019 zhao 1992 fig 3 and table 1 showed the flow chart and 16 parameters used in xaj model respectively the area mean daily rainfall and etp are inputs for this model and daily runoff and eta are the outputs the runoff simulated by xaj model is based on the assumption that runoff is produced after the soil moisture content of the aeration zone has reached field capacity zhao 1992 2 5 calibration and validation of xaj model and scenario analysis the calculated etp and the observed rainfall at all ten sites were used to calculate the area mean etp and area mean rainfall to drive xaj model for runoff simulation historical daily observed discharge from the tung oil gauge which received most of the streamflow from the catchment was extracted from the bureau of meteorology website https www bom gov au waterdata were used to calibrate and validate xaj model the historical climatic data from 1998 to 2010 were used to calibrate xaj model while the data from 2011 to 2017 were used for model s validation this study used sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona a global optimization method to optimize xaj model parameters zhang et al 2019 firstly individual etp model was used to calculate etp and drive xaj model then the parameters calibrated by a certain etp model were used to validate xaj model for other etp models in addition to the one used for calibration in other words cross model validation was carried out among these etp models to investigate the sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs then the group of parameters that produced the best runoff simulation for all etp models were used in runoff projections with downscaled climatic data under future climate scenarios the empirical models including jh ab mak and hs were used to project future runoff in order to investigate the influence of different etp models on runoff projection nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the xaj model driven by different models estimated etp against observed runoff the nse has been widely used in comparing hydrologic model performance fang et al 2020 li et al 2009 it ranges from to 1 the value of 1 represents that the model simulated runoff perfectly matches with the observed runoff therefore the closer the nse value is to 1 the better the hydrological model performs generally a hydrological model with nse and r2 larger than 0 50 is capable of effectively simulating stream flow for a certain catchment zhang et al 2019 the nse r2 and rmse were calculated with the following equations 11 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 12 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim 2 where q obs i mm day 1 was the observed runoff for i th day q sim i mm day 1 was simulated runoff for i th day q obs mm day 1 and q sim mm day 1 are the corresponding mean daily values of observed runoff and simulated runoff in the research period to project the change of runoff in the future period we divided the downscaled climatic data into five time periods namely baseline period from 1998 to 2017 near future period from 2021 to 2040 2030s middle future period from 2041 to 2060 2050s far future period from 2061 to 2080 2070s and further future period from 2081 to 2100 2090s 2 6 partitioning uncertainty to different sources analysis of variance anova method is capable of separating the total observed variances into different sources and considering the interactive contributions of different sources bosshard et al 2013 lee et al 2021 in other words one of the advantages of anova method is that it quantifies both uncertainty related to each source and uncertainty related to the interaction among different sources morim et al 2019 yip et al 2011 interaction effects in anova represent the combined effects of factors on the dependent variable thus this method has been widely used in uncertainty analysis in climate change impact assessment lee et al 2021 morim et al 2019 wang et al 2020a for instance yip et al 2011 adopted anova method to quantify the total uncertainty in climate projections into uncertainties related to gcms rcps and their interaction morim et al 2019 adopted a three way anova method to quantify the uncertainty in wind wave climate projections related to gcms rcps and different wave modelling methods gcms rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 2030s 2050s 2070s and 2090s respectively and etp models are the sources contributing to the uncertainty for runoff projection in our study accordingly we adopted a three way anova method and varied the 34 gcms 4 etp models and 8 rcp scenarios rcp4 5 2030s rcp4 5 2050s rcp4 5 2070s rcp4 5 2090s rcp8 5 2030s rcp8 5 2050s rcp8 5 2070s and rcp8 5 2090s in all possible combinations which is 1088 subsets in total to analyze the relative and interactive contribution of these sources that is the anova was fit based on the projected mean seasonal runoff x g r e for the

the variances sst 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the xaj model as one of the key inputs in runoff simulation difference was observed in etp estimated by different models figure s1 for instance more etp estimated by ab was lower than 4 mm day 1 whereas jh estimated etp were more likely to be higher than 4 mm day 1 however the observed runoff and simulated runoff from the xaj model driven by different etp inputs did not show great difference as indicated by similar r2 fig 4 top panel nse fig 4 middle panel and rmse fig 4 bottom panel both in calibration and validation periods take the validation period as an explanation r2 nse and rmse ranged from 0 88 to 0 89 0 86 to 0 88 and from 2 74 mm day 1 to 2 90 mm day 1 respectively the high r2 and nse indicated that xaj model was capable to simulate observed runoff very well meanwhile the results suggested that etp models i e penman model which had more complicated structures were not always likely to outperform the simple empirical models in runoff simulation fig 5 showed the daily runoff temporal trends from 1998 to 2017 it showed that temporal trends of observed runoff were well replicated by xaj model regardless of the etp inputs this finding also confirmed that the difference of etp inputs had little influence on the runoff simulation 3 2 changes in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration under future climate scenarios compared with the baseline period 1998 2017 the change of rainfall under future climate scenarios showed seasonal difference fig 6 in general the decreases in spring and winter rainfall were higher than that in summer and autumn the mean decreases for spring rainfall ranged from 2 to 3 5 under rcp4 5 and from 5 3 to 11 1 under rcp8 5 the corresponding mean decreases for winter rainfall ranged from 3 4 to 8 8 and from 6 2 to 7 1 respectively contrary to the decreases in seasonal rainfall all seasonal etp would increase in the future fig 7 the magnitudes of increases showed variation among etp models specifically jh and ab generally projected higher increases in etp than hs and mak did another pattern showed by etp increases was that the increases under rcp8 5 were higher than that under rcp4 5 meanwhile the increases of etp also became higher with the time getting into the further future periods the mean increases of spring etp projected by jh ab varied from 1 9 1 8 2030s to 8 0 6 4 2090s under rcp4 5 while mak hs projected increases ranged from 0 7 0 3 2030s to 3 0 3 5 2090s under rcp8 5 the jh ab projected increases ranged from 3 0 2 9 2030s to 16 5 13 1 2090s and mak hs projected increases ranged from 1 3 0 8 2030s to 5 1 7 1 2090s 3 3 changes in runoff under future climate scenarios the changes of runoff under future climate scenarios with different etp inputs were shown in fig 8 we found that the seasonal difference of changes in runoff was similar to that in rainfall in other words spring and winter runoff generally showed larger decreases than that in summer and autumn furthermore runoff would generally experience larger decreases under rcp8 5 than that under rcp4 5 for the same future period for example xaj model with all etp inputs projected a slight decrease around 0 7 in spring runoff under rcp4 5 by 2030s whereas the decrease was around 15 7 under rcp8 5 by 2090s the decrease of spring runoff projected with different etp inputs ranged from 10 1 mak to 13 1 jh under rcp4 5 and from 14 6 mak to 20 1 jh under rcp8 5 the mean decreases of winter runoff varied from 2 1 mak to 3 4 jh by 2030s and from 5 9 mak to 8 9 jh by 2090s under rcp4 5 the corresponding decreases under rcp8 5 were 7 4 mak 9 3 jh by 2030s and 10 3 mak 15 2 jh by 2090s to investigate the relationship between changes in runoff and changes in rainfall and etp the scatter plots between them were shown in fig 9 the r2 between changes in runoff and etp was not larger than 0 46 whereas the r2 between changes in runoff and rainfall was no less than 0 86 this finding indicated that changes in runoff were mainly caused by changes in rainfall 3 4 uncertainty in runoff projection fig 10 displayed the relative contribution of different sources to the uncertainty caused in runoff projection for each season gcms generally contributed the most to the uncertainty ranging from 50 9 to 67 4 the interaction between gcms and rcps also played a significant role in the total uncertainty ranging from 35 4 to 46 6 in contrast the uncertainty caused by different etp models was minor for all seasons even though it was getting larger in winter than that in spring the minor role of etp models may be explained by the fact that runoff projection via xaj model was rarely influenced by the difference of etp models as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 low sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs compared with xaj model driven by physically based penman calculated etp it showed comparable or even better ability in runoff simulation with temperature based hs and radiation based etp inputs for instance with the same r2 and nse rmse produced by xaj model with penman etp was even larger 0 05 mm day 1 than that produced by xaj model with ab and hs etp inputs fig 4 in spite of the small difference among different etp inputs xaj model performed well in reproducing daily observed runoff fig 5 with r2 larger than 0 88 nse larger than 0 86 and rmse less than 3 23 mm day 1 fig 4 under future climate scenarios runoff projected with different etp inputs also showed similar change patterns fig 8 these findings demonstrated the low sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs similar results were also reported in previous studies dakhlaoui et al 2020 kelleher and shaw 2018 in detail dakhlaoui et al 2020 compared runoff projection by three hydrological models with different etp estimations in northern tunisia they claimed that hydrological projections with different etp estimations were similar indicating the low sensitivity of hydrological models to different etp inputs overall we found that the difference in runoff projection yielded by different etp inputs was small for xaj model this could be partially explained by the fact that the difference in etp estimates was trade off by difference in the calibrated model s parameters for instance the coefficient of deep evapotranspiration c shown in table 2 was different as a result of the different etp inputs in other words the calibration procedure of xaj model with different etp inputs also produced different parameters thus trading off the difference in etp inputs and yielding similar and good runoff simulation considering that some downscaled daily climate data e g wind speed or relative humidity are not always available to support the use of complicated etp models oudin et al 2005 randall et al 2007 the low sensitivity of xaj model to etp inputs is helpful to improve our confidence in the use of temperature based or radiation based etp models in future runoff projection 4 2 runoff projections based on xaj under future climate scenarios this study predicted a general decrease in runoff under future climate scenarios especially for spring and winter fig 8 a decrease in runoff under a changing climate was reported by previous studies both in northeast and other parts of australia eccles et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 potter et al 2010 for example in southwest western australia barria et al 2015 found that projected runoff by 2050 2080 would decrease by 10 80 compared to runoff in 1970 2000 in a subtropical catchment of queensland eccles et al 2021 investigated the influence of climate change on runoff with climatic data downscaled from multi model ensemble gcms to drive a lumped conceptual hydrological model they found that both high and mean streamflow were predicted to decrease note that their decreases in spring and winter were much larger than that in summer and autumn which is consistent with our results decrease in runoff was mainly caused by a decrease in rainfall though the increasing etp also amplified the reduction fig 6 we found that the r2 between projected changes in runoff and rainfall was more than 0 86 fig 9 which was much higher than its correlation with changes in etp this demonstrated that rainfall is the main driving factor in the change of projected runoff as reported by charles et al 2020 they claimed that increasing etp would cause an additional reduction in runoff under a warming climate but changes in rainfall mainly determine the relative results similarly donohue et al 2011 assessed the sensitivity of runoff to changes in precipitation and etp based on budyko s curve they found that the change of precipitation caused larger change in runoff than that caused by the same change of etp in this study the dominant role of rainfall in influencing runoff changes may also partially explain the low sensitivity of xaj model to different etp inputs rainfall in north johnstone catchment mainly occurs in summer and autumn fig 2 zhang et al 2020 by contrast spring and winter are dry seasons for this catchment the decreases of future rainfall and runoff will make these two seasons drier compared to baseline which is likely to result in severe influence on the agricultural production and ecological functions in this catchment potter et al 2010 for instance the concentrations of nutrient and sediment may become larger as the flushing times tend to be longer apart with the dry seasons getting drier eccles et al 2020 eccles et al 2021 meanwhile water consuming industries such as irrigators forestry and wetland in this region may face increasing demands and competition for water during these drier seasons petheram et al 2012 4 3 uncertainty in runoff projection we found that gcms followed by interaction between gcms and rcps was the dominant source of uncertainty in projected runoff changes fig 10 similar results were reported by other studies lee et al 2021 found that gcms accounted for more than 45 of the total uncertainty in the projection of streamflow caused by hydrological model parameters gcms and rcps at coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed at global scale arnell and gosling 2013 reported that gcm related uncertainty in hydrological projection was the largest among uncertainty caused by gcms emission scenarios and the natural variability in hydrological regimes the dominant role of gcms played in the uncertainty in runoff projection may be attributed to the large uncertainty in rainfall projected by gcms according to woldemeskel et al 2016 gcms accounted for around 90 of the uncertainty in rainfall projection therefore the large uncertainty in rainfall projection caused by gcms is likely to be transmitted to runoff projection as gcms downscaled rainfall is an essential input for xaj model as petheram et al 2012 reported in their study that the largest uncertainty in runoff projection was caused by rainfall projections from different gcms the high r2 0 86 between change in runoff and rainfall in our study also support this conclusion different pathways of carbon dioxide other anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases aerosols and so on were associated with different rcps and used as inputs to force gcms to generate different climate simulations meinshausen et al 2011 in other words gcms projections under different rcps will result in different temperature and rainfall changes therefore great contribution from the interaction between gcms and rcps to the uncertainty in runoff projection was not unexpected lee et al 2021 compared to uncertainty caused by gcms uncertainty caused by etp models was small though its contribution in autumn and winter became larger fig 10 this finding may be explained by the fact that the projection of runoff is more influenced by rainfall instead of etp charles et al 2020 rajulapati et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 that r2 between change in runoff and change in etp was barely larger than 0 40 the uncertainty in runoff projection poses a great challenge for decision makers in taking measures to adapt to the possible water scarcity and stress though it is impossible to avoid uncertainty in climate projections it is possible to reduce uncertainty from them hawkins and sutton 2011 shoaib et al 2018 for instance narrowing down uncertainty from gcms can be realized by screening the performance of gcms and choosing gcms which can well replicate historical observations for runoff projection wang et al 2020b quantified how many gcms should be used to fully cover the uncertainty caused by them in runoff projection and concluded that at least 10 gcms should be used therefore attention should be paid both to the quality and to the quantity of gcms used in runoff projection in addition another key requirement for reducing uncertainty in climate change impact assessment in hydrology is to better characterize climate change at the local level the accuracy of climate system modeling has been improved over the last decades chen et al 2021 woldemeskel et al 2016 with incorporating important physical processes increasing models complexities and improving model s resolution chen et al 2021 found that the latest coupled model intercomparison project phases 6 cmip6 performed better in simulating extreme precipitation in western north pacific and east asia 4 4 limitations of this study in this study we only used one hydrological model to assess the impacts of climate change on runoff previous studies demonstrated that the direction of projected future runoff change by different hydrological models for a certain catchment is likely to be consistent pechlivanidis et al 2016 teng et al 2012 however it is very important to adopt multiple hydrology models to investigate the magnitude of runoff change under future climate in addition as only one hydrological model was used in this study the contribution of hydrological models to uncertainty in runoff projection was not investigated some studies concluded that uncertainty caused by hydrological models was small compared with that caused by gcms and rcps aryal et al 2019 bosshard et al 2013 gosling and arnell 2011 for example teng et al 2012 adopted five hydrological models with downscaled climate data from 15 gcms to investigate climate change impact on runoff in southeastern australia and analyzed the uncertainty caused by different sources they found that the uncertainty in runoff change caused by gcms with a certain hydrological model was around four or five times larger than the uncertainty caused by hydrological models with a certain gcm even so it is still necessary to include this factor in the future study to avoid the possible underestimation of the total uncertainty related with runoff projection bosshard et al 2013 note that our results were specific to a certain catchment projected by xaj model it may yield discordant conclusions when different catchments or hydrological models are used for instance jung et al 2012 claimed that uncertainty in hydrological projection at rain dominated basin was different with that in the snow dominated basin therefore it is necessary for future research to consider more hydrological models to investigate the influence of etp models at multiple contrasting catchments 5 conclusions we investigated the influence of different etp inputs on runoff simulation and projection with xaj model in north johnstone catchment northeast australia meanwhile we quantified the contribution of gcms rcps etp models and their interaction to the uncertainty in runoff projection with a method of three way analysis of variance our findings indicated that xaj model performed well in runoff simulation in the study catchment we found that xaj model with different etp inputs projected similar decreases in spring and winter runoff while a small change in summer and autumn runoff it is feasible to adopt simple empirical etp models to project runoff especially when some downscaled climate data e g winds and vapour pressure are not available we also found that gcms and its interaction with rcps contributed the most to the uncertainty in runoff projection this highlighted the necessity to adopt multiple gcms and rcps to comprehensively project the potential influence of climate change on runoff our finding also provide a way forward to narrow down the uncertainty in runoff projection note that all our results are specific to xaj model at a wet tropical catchment in future studies we expect to employ more hydrological models with different etp inputs driven by the latest cmip6 climatic data to quantify the uncertainty on runoff projection at various catchments credit authorship
