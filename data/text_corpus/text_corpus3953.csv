19765,titanium xerogel coagulant txc worked better than titanium tetrachloride tc and polytitanium chloride ptc in a wider ph dose range for the removal of turbidity however the underlying mechanisms were not comprehensively understood in this work the better coagulation performance of txc than tc and ptc was systematically elucidated from the following aspects the physicochemical properties of the three coagulants the removal of turbidity and organic matter and the complexation reactions in coagulation the results demonstrate that the merits of txc were attributable to the following characteristics 1 the higher surface charge density total surface site concentration isoelectric point of txc hydrolysates 2 the formation of txc hydrolysates with a net work structure and 3 the strong binding affinity of txc hydrolysates to organic matter caused by the bonded acetylacetone in the txc framework in short the hydrolysis behavior of txc significantly differed from both its precursor tc and the prehydrolyzed ptc the difference in the hydrolysis of txc was derived from the gelation process which led to the polymerization of ti in a way different from prehydrolyzation the elucidation of the hydrolysis mechanisms is useful for the better application of ti based coagulants and may shed light on the preparation of other metal salts graphical abstract image 1 keywords titanium based coagulants mechanism turbidity organic matter acetylacetone 1 introduction in water and wastewater treatment coagulation is an important unit process gregor et al 1997 traditional coagulants such as iron and aluminum salts are widely employed for removal of suspended particles xiao et al 2008 natural organic matter lee and westerhoff 2006 and inorganic ions such as fluorine hu et al 2005 and arsenite lee et al 2003 besides iron and aluminum salts titanium ti salts have also been investigated as coagulants for the several merits 1 ti has a larger charge than those of al and fe lakshmanan et al 2008 zhao et al 2011 2 the floc size formed by ti salts was usually much larger than those formed by al or fe salts zhao et al 2011 chekli et al 2017a which is beneficial for a complete sedimentation in a short time and 3 the final sludge could be calcined to valuable by products namely tio2 photocatalysts kagaya et al 1999 shon et al 2007 which offers a novel solution to sludge disposal the effectiveness of ti salts as coagulants has been proven in removal of turbidity wu et al 2011 organic matter zhao et al 2013a algae chekli et al 2017a nutrients wang et al 2016 chroma wang et al 2016 and heavy metals sun et al 2013 wang et al 2016 prehydrolysis is a useful strategy to improve the coagulation performance of metal salts huang et al 2015 zhao et al 2013b in a previous work wang et al 2016 we demonstrated that gelation was a more effective strategy than prehydrolysis in modification of ti based coagulants a series of titanium xerogel coagulants txc was prepared by a sol gel method with titanium tetrachloride tc as the precursor and acetylacetone acac as a modifying agent wang et al 2016 compared to tc and polytitanium tetrachloride ptc the resultant txc possessed better removal capacity for nutrients chromium and wider applicable coagulant dose ph range in turbidity removal wang et al 2016 it is generally accepted that the solubility and the electrical property of metal hydrolysates determine the coagulation mechanism duan and gregory 2003 wang et al 2002 the more controllable hydrolysis of txc than those of tc and ptc was proposed as one of the main reasons for its better performance wang et al 2016 however the detailed hydrolysis reactions of ti salts were still unclear and the colloid chemistry in the related processes needs further investigation for example in the coagulation tests for humic acid ha kaolin simulated water txc presented a weaker ability for ha removal than tc and ptc it is well known that solution ph has an apparent influence on the solubility of ha which would affect the removal of ha in a coagulation process cheng and chi 2002 the effluent ph after tc ptc coagulation decreased sharply leading to a lowered solubility of ha and therefore a better removal of ha on the contrary the effluent ph from txc coagulation was only mildly decreased therefore the weaker ability of txc for the removal of ha might be attributable to the effect of solution ph if so what would happen if the ph effect was isolated from the coagulation process this needs to be clarified to address the above issues the physicochemical properties including surface charge floc structure and growth kinetics of the hydrolysates from the three coagulants tc ptc and txc were systematically investigated with these information the coagulation performances of the three coagulants for the removal of turbidity and organic matter were fully interpreted 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification tc naoh ethanol acac kaolin powder hcl naclo4 nahco3 1 hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate hpc toluidine blue tbo were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china humic acid sodium salt ha was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa silica microspheres si with 3 μm average diameter fig s1 in supplementary data sd wuhan shuaier company china were used as model particles the chemical compositions of kaolin and si microsphere are al2si2o5 oh 4 and sio2 respectively potassium salt of poly 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid pampsk as a standard polyanionic electrolyte in colloidal titration experiment was obtained from shanghai hengli company china 2 1 2 coagulants txc and ptc were prepared as previously reported wang et al 2016 in the preparation of txc the molar ratio of acac ti and h2o ti was 1 4 and 4 1 respectively after ageing at ambient conditions the resultant xerogel was vacuum dried at 40 c until a constant weight was obtained ptc with a ti oh molar ratio of 1 1 was prepared with a slow alkaline titration method zhao et al 2013b a portion of 0 58 ml concentrated tc solution was dropwise added to 200 ml cold distilled water in an ice water bath under a continuous stirring then 25 ml naoh solution 0 2 m was dropwise added under an intensive agitation to yield a ptc solution 1 g ti l with a basicity of 1 0 stock solutions of tc and ptc of 1 g ti l were prepared freshly prior to use depending on the specific requirements of the analysis hydrolysate products of the coagulants were prepared in advance and freeze dried for nitrogen adsorption raman x ray diffractometer xrd analyses and in situ for zeta potential and atomic force microscope afm analyses 2 1 3 simulated waters compared with kaolin powder si suspension was much more stable and chemical inert pauling 1930 wu et al 2007 therefore si microspheres instead of kaolin powder were employed here to generate the needed turbidity three simulated waters of a high turbidity 500 5 ntu a medium turbidity 50 1 ntu and a low turbidity 5 0 5 ntu were prepared by dispersing certain amounts of si microspheres into 1 l tap water the ph of the silica microsphere suspensions was adjusted with a 0 1 m hcl or a 0 1 m naoh solution to 5 8 0 1 or 9 8 0 1 before jar test an ha stock solution was prepared by adding 1 g ha into 1 l deionized water and was then filtered with a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane in a vacuum suction device to remove any insoluble particles the total dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the ha stock solution was 314 2 mg l prior to coagulation experiments the ha stock solution was diluted with deionized water to the designated concentrations naclo4 was added to adjust the ionic strength to 10 mm the ph of the ha solution was adjusted with a 0 1 m hcl or a 0 1 m naoh solution to the desired value an ha kaolin solution with an initial turbidity of 50 1 ntu was prepared by adding 10 mg ha and 0 2 g kaolin powder into 1 l tap water the ph of the ha kaolin solution was adjusted with a hcl or naoh solution to the range of 5 10 2 2 experimental section 2 2 1 coagulation experiments coagulation tests were conducted with a program controlled jar test apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china following the below procedure 1 min rapid mixing 200 rpm 15 min slow mixing 40 rpm and 20 min sedimentation after these procedures the supernatants were collected for analysis from approximately 2 cm below the water surface using a syringe 2 2 2 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the uptakes of ha on the coagulated flocs the ionic strength of the distilled water 1 l was adjusted to 10 mm with naclo4 after the coagulants 12 mg ti l was added the reaction was adjusted to ph 6 0 7 0 with naoh and stirred the same way as in the coagulation after that the sample was distributed into several 250 ml flasks and adjusted to each designated ph a certain amount of ha solution was added into each bottle after shaken for 24 h at 150 rpm the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper and the concentration of ha was measured 2 3 analytical approaches 2 3 1 characterization of the hydrolysate products the surface chemistry of the hydrolysate products was investigated with three methods potentiometric acid base titration zeta potential determination and colloid titration potentiometric acid base titration of the 100 mg ti l coagulant solution was conducted with an automatic titration system text s1 the acid base titration data were employed for the analysis of surface site concentration hs with the gran plot method gran 1952 the newly prepared flocs after the rapid mixing in the jar test were measured with a nano zetasizer malvern co uk to estimate the isoelectric point of the hydrolysate products of the three coagulants a back colloid titration method text s1 was used to quantitatively determine the surface charge densities of the hydrolysate products a continuous laser diffraction instrument mastersizer 3000 malvern uk was employed in a modified jar test procedure to record the particle size of the flocs a portion of 5 mg ti l coagulant was pipetted at the beginning of the rapid mixing to the beakers containing 800 ml ha kaolin or si suspensions with an initial turbidity of 50 1 ntu raman xrd afm and nitrogen adsorption desorption analyses were conducted to characterize the morphology and structure of the freeze dried flocs and hydrolysate products text s1 2 3 2 characterization of si and ha the surface chemistry of the tested si microspheres was analyzed with zeta potential following the same procedures as those for the hydrolysate products the pk a of ha molecule was determined with acid base titration total acidity was determined with barium exchange and the carboxylic acidity was titrated by calcium acetate at ph 6 7 schnitzer and kahn 1972 2 3 3 solution analysis the residual turbidity rt was directly measured with a hach 2100n turbidity meter usa the supernatants after filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane were firstly acidified with concentrated hno3 and then injected into an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap 6000 thermo usa for the determination of residual ti the residual doc concentration in the supernatant were measured with a toc 5000a analyzer shimadzu co japan a horiba fluoromax 4 fluorescence analyzer germany was used to measure the concentration of ha at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm an excitation range from 280 to 500 nm and an emission range from 300 to 600 nm were utilized to characterize the three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra 3d eem spectra of ha solutions 2 3 4 calculation approach for ti speciation the speciation of ti was calculated based on the stepwise hydrolysis constants of ti table s1 and the complexation constants for ti hydrolysates with acac table s2 the total concentration of ti and acac were set at 0 2 mm and 0 05 mm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the three coagulants 3 1 1 surface chemistry the physicochemical properties of hydrolysate products play a decisive role in coagulation the hydrolysates of ti salts in the entire ph range were shown in fig 1 a according to the hydrolysis constants buettner and valentine 2011 ferri and riccio 1985 and the solubility constant einaga and komatsu 1981 of ti hydroxides table s1 the dominant hydrolysis species in the ph range of 4 10 were ti oh 4 a small fraction of ti oh 2 2 and ti oh 3 existed at ph lower than 4 0 whereas there was a small fraction of ti oh 5 at ph above 10 0 the presence of acac affected the speciation of ti in the ph range of 6 13 fig 1a a small fraction of ti oh 4 acac was formed leading to a slightly inhibited formation of ti oh 4 the hydrolysates from the txc had a larger surface charge density than those of tc and ptc especially in acidic solutions fig 1b the pollutants in water are usually negatively charged therefore a better charge neutralization ability is expected for txc in acidic solutions acid neutralizing capacity anc is a measure of the overall buffering capacity of solutes plus particulates in an aqueous system against acidification the total surface site concentration hs calculated from the gran plot reflects the anc of particulates chu et al 2002 guo et al 2008 the hydrolysates from txc had a larger hs 4 56 mmol g ti than those of tc 2 70 mmol g ti and ptc 3 17 mmol g ti fig 1c which might be attributed to the milder ph reduction of the effluent in the txc system the isoelectric point phiep where the electrokinetic potential ζ equals 0 of txc 5 3 was larger than those of tc and ptc 5 0 fig 1d indicating a preferential association of cations to the txc hydrolysates lützenkirchen et al 2012 the existence of acac in the framework of txc was proved by ftir and elemental analyses in our previous work wang et al 2016 which might be attributed to this enhanced association of cations 3 1 2 structure and morphology the raman spectra fig s2 of the hydrolysates of txc tc ptc had three broad bands centered at 159 460 and 630 cm 1 indicating that all the hydrolysates contained similar structural groups and were amorphous without long range order balachandran and eror 1982 nemanich et al 1980 this is further confirmed by the xrd analysis all the three hydrolysates had no crystal characteristics and there were no distinct differences among the txc tc ptc hydrolysates fig s3 ohtani et al 1997 however the three hydrolysates had quite different surface areas and pore volumes for charge neutralization the flocs with larger surface area had more exposed active sites which could neutralize the negatively charged pollutants dentel 1988 for sweep flocculation porous and loose flocs could better entrap pollutants than a denser one letterman and vanderbrook 1983 the hydrolysates of txc had a typical type i nitrogen adsorption isotherm indicating the predominance of micropores sing 2001 whereas there was a large amount of meso and macropores in the hydrolysates of tc and ptc with median pore sizes of 15 9 and 5 1 nm respectively fig s4 the pore size distribution curves demonstrate that the pores in the hydrolysates of ptc were the most heterogeneous among the three coagulants fig s4 to better understand the differences in the bulk structure of the hydrolysates suspensions of txc tc and ptc 10 mg ti l at ph 3 5 0 3 were observed directly with afm there were significant differences among the hydrolysates of the three coagulants fig 2 the aggregates formed in the tc suspension were highly uniform with mainly large aggregates whereas those in ptc were poly dispersed with both larger aggregates 2 3 times to those in tc and smaller particles in ptc solution the partial prehydrolysis that underwent in the preparation of ptc zhao et al 2013b 2017 led to the larger aggregates while the remain fraction formed only smaller particles due to the weakened driving force wu et al 2016a rouster et al 2017 as a result the dried hydrolysates of ptc showed the largest heterogeneity in pore size fig s4 the tiny particles might lead to the residual ti in the solutions after coagulation the pattern of hydrolysates formed in the txc solution was obviously unique the hydrolysate particles in txc solution connected together one by one to form a large network of particles and extended to a horizontal plane this special network structure might be accountable for the three observed merits of txc over tc and ptc 1 larger floc size 2 lower residual ti and 3 better performance in sweep flocculation the distinct hydrolysis pattern of txc might come from the added acac in its preparation to verify this hypothesis we tested the complexation between acac and ti in ethanol and aqueous solutions fig s5 ethanol was employed because it is the solvent in the sol gel preparation of txc the peak centered at 274 nm in fig s5 comes from the enol form of acac this peak was much weaker in water than in ethanol because the enol to keto tautomerization of acac in aqueous solution spencer et al 1982 an absorption peak of ti acac complexes satoh et al 2008 was observed at 332 nm in both the ethanol and aqueous solutions the absorbance at 332 nm was linear within 0 2 and leveled off as the molar ratio of acac ti was over 2 0 a further increase of acac did not led to more complexation in aqueous solutions the complexation between acac and ti was much weaker because of the hydrolysis of ti fig 1a and the enol to keto tautomerization of acac fig s5 however it should be noted that the presence of acac partially inhibited the hydrolysis of ti fig 1a therefore the ti o acac structure in txc explained the distinct hydrolysis pattern of txc in aqueous solutions fig 2 3 1 3 dynamics of floc growth the structure and morphology discussed in the above section were focused on the hydrolysates that were generated in pure water the dynamics of floc formation in real waters is one of the most important criteria in coagulation two simulated waters a si suspension turbidity only and an ha kaolin solution with the same initial turbidity 50 ntu were chosen to evaluate the floc growth at different initial solution phs fig 3 compared with the flocs in the si suspension the flocs formed in the ha kaolin solution were generally smaller in the si suspension fig 3a except the one at ph 5 0 the flocs in the txc system had the highest growth rate and the largest floc size both txc and ptc underwent fast hydrolysis at ph 6 0 or above whereas the rapid hydrolysis of tc occurred at ph higher than 6 0 in the ha kaolin solution the ph effect became obscure and much more complicated yan et al 2008 the slowest floc formation occurred at solution ph 8 0 9 0 the ha used in this work had two pk a values at around 4 1 and 9 1 fig s6 although the structure of ha is rather complicated the two pk a could be roughly assigned to carboxyl group 0 28 mmol g and phenolic group 2 51 mmol g respectively fig s6 the ph effect on the floc growth in the ha kaolin solutions might be related with the speciation of ha which will be revisited later 3 2 turbidity removal turbidity removal is one of the most important purposes of coagulation in our previous work the performances of tc ptc and txc in removal of turbidity were evaluated with a kaolin ha suspension as the model water wang et al 2016 as aforementioned the presence of ha might interfere with the coagulation process narkis and rebhun 1983 for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms it would be better to evaluate the removal of turbidity and organic matter separately as shown in fig 4 a at an initial solution ph of 5 8 txc worked well whereas tc and ptc were almost ineffective in the solution of a low turbidity 5 ntu tc and ptc became effective in solutions of higher turbidity however they could only work in a much narrower dose range as compared with txc re stabilization occurred as the dose of tc and ptc exceeded 6 mg ti l it seems that the workable dose ranges of tc and ptc were strongly dependent on the zeta potential the selected si microspheres were negatively charged in the ph range of 2 12 fig s7 with the increase of dose particles in the tc and ptc systems re stabilized due to the over neutralization to the opposite charge fig 4a indicating the importance of charge neutralization in the coagulation of si microspheres with tc and ptc txc possessed a larger positive charge density than tc and ptc fig 1c and consequently a stronger charge neutralization capacity however its performance was not affected by the charge reversal which might be benefited from the network structure of the hydrolysates formed from txc and the moderate decrease in effluent ph in solutions with an initial ph of 9 8 all particles in the three coagulation systems were negatively charged fig 4b as a result no charge neutralization occurred for all the three coagulants nevertheless the removal of turbidity was pretty good demonstrating the complete hydrolysis of ti in the alkaline solutions and the dominant role of sweep entrapment in coagulation zhao et al 2013a wu et al 2011 at all solution phs the residual ti concentration in the txc system was much lower than those of tc and ptc for the solutions of an initial ph of 5 8 there was a good correlation between the residual turbidity and the residual ti concentration the lower the effluent ph the higher was the residual ti concentration no matter started at a low or a high ph the effluent ph of txc was higher than those of tc and ptc which partially explained the lower residual ti concentration in the txc system for the solutions of an initial ph of 9 8 although the residual turbidities in the tc and ptc systems were low there were still a considerable amount of residual ti suggesting that the formation of precipitates from tc and ptc were not complete or there were colloidal particles that passed the filtration which was confirmed by the afm observation fig 2 and the ultrafiltration screening results fig s8 as shown in fig 4 txc is effective for turbidity removal in both acidic and basic solutions with a wide range of initial turbidity the coagulation results for the si suspensions further demonstrate the merits of txc workable at a low turbidity and low solution ph in a wide dose range and meanwhile with a low residual ti concentration and a mild ph change 3 3 removal of ha ha is a polyelectrolyte its removal was highly ph dependent gregor et al 1997 narkis and rebhun 1977 addition of tc and ptc to water immediately led to a dramatic decrease of the solution ph whereas txc resulted in a much milder reduction fig s9 to exclude the ph effect prior to the addition of ti coagulants ha solutions were adjusted to certain initial phs to make the three ti ha solutions reaching the same final ph as illustrated in fig 5 txc led to a lower turbidity a higher doc removal and a lower residual ti concentration in a broader ph range than tc and ptc there were sharp changes around the isoelectric points of the hydrolysates from the three coagulants fig 5 such a phenomenon has been observed in the interaction of ha with fe salts cheng 2002 in the presence of ha two reactions occurred competitively in the coagulation system a fast hydrolysis of the metal salt and a complexation between the metal salt and ha chekli et al 2017b once the solution ph was high enough the rapid hydrolysis of ti salts overwhelmed their complexation with ha leading to both a higher residual ha and a higher residual turbidity xu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 it should be noted that the residual turbidity in the ha solutions came from the colloidal precipitates mainly ti ha complexes su et al 2017 sillanpää et al 2018 the wider workable ph range of txc than those of tc and ptc could be attributed to the more controllable hydrolysis of ti in the presence of acac fig 2 the better performance of txc than tc and ptc in ha solutions demonstrate that the previously observed weak ability of txc in removal of ha from the ha kaolin suspensions wang et al 2016 was actually a result of ph effect complexation between ha molecules and ti hydrolysates was proposed as a major mechanism yan et al 2008 by excluding the ph effect the performance of txc in removal of ha was actually better than tc and ptc because the txc had a stronger complexation ability with ha than the other two which was evidenced by the stronger fluorescence quenching of ha by txc fig 6 and fig s10 the peak at 350 nm excitation 450 nm emission was a characteristic fluorescence of humic acid like matter wang et al 2009 at ph 3 5 almost all the functional groups in ha were protonated which were favorable to their binding with the o ti o skeletons as shown in fig 6 at ph 3 5 the addition of the three coagulants did lead to the disappearance of the 350 450 nm peak demonstrating that there was strong binding between the hydrolysates and ha the increase of solution ph greatly reduced the binding between the hydrolysates and ha because both the hydrolysates and ha became negatively charged fig 1d at ph 8 5 the phenolic groups in ha were protonated the ti hydrolysates could still combine with ha through the phenolic moieties which explained the weak but existed fluorescence quenching in the alkaline solutions the binding affinity of ha to the hydrolysates from the three coagulants followed in order of txc tc ptc the stronger binding of ha in the txc system might come from the anchored acac in the hydrolysates of txc fig 7 the complexation between ti hydrolysates and ha was further verified with the adsorption removal of ha by the pre generated hydrolysates as shown in fig 8 the adsorption removal of ha was almost the same as that in coagulation and txc showed the largest ha adsorption capacity this is consistent with a previous report that the removal of organic matter by coagulation was attributed primary to adsorption cheng 2002 since the hydrolysates used in the adsorption experiments were pre generated the residual ti concentrations in the adsorption experiments were much lower than those in coagulation the hydrolysis of txc in coagulation led to the release of the bonded acac at a concentration lower than 5 μmol acac mg ti wang et al 2018 when exposed to sunlight acac could be oxidized to volatile fatty acids that could be used in bio fermentation wu et al 2016b meanwhile the uv acac process was proved to be effective for the decomposition of toxic microcystins wang et al 2018 which would be an additional function in the treatment of algae containing waters with txc based on the tests with daphnia magna bok choy rice seed and arabidopsis thaliana the toxicity of acac and uv acac treated solutions was proved to be lower or comparable to that of the uv h2o2 counterparts yang et al 2018 suggesting that the released acac would not cause adverse environmental impacts 4 conclusions an in depth analysis was conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind the improved coagulation performance of txc over tc and ptc for waters of low turbidity and high organic matter the acac in txc skeleton plays a crucial role in improving the physicochemical properties of the hydrolysate products acac can control the hydrolysis pattern to form a large net work structure which is beneficial to form large floc size with low residual ti concentration acac also improves the surface charge density total surface site concentration and the binding affinity with organic matter these characteristics account for the merits of txc in water wastewater treatment and may broaden the practical application of titanium salt coagulants the strong chelation ability to various metals give acac a shot at regulating the hydrolysis of metal salts to build effective structures for practical application the outstanding merit of txc is the removal of turbidity in both acidic and basic solutions with a wide range of initial turbidity the strong complexation of txc with organic matter would deteriorate the removal of turbidity in organic matter coexisting water therefore more studies on the further modification of txc by composition with some polyelectrolytes or other inorganic metal salts are warranted for the development of more cost effective coagulants acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21522702 21677070 and the

microscope afm analyses 2 1 3 simulated waters compared with kaolin powder si suspension was much more stable and chemical inert pauling 1930 wu et al 2007 therefore si microspheres instead of kaolin powder were employed here to generate the needed turbidity three simulated waters of a high turbidity 500 5 ntu a medium turbidity 50 1 ntu and a low turbidity 5 0 5 ntu were prepared by dispersing certain amounts of si microspheres into 1 l tap water the ph of the silica microsphere suspensions was adjusted with a 0 1 m hcl or a 0 1 m naoh solution to 5 8 0 1 or 9 8 0 1 before jar test an ha stock solution was prepared by adding 1 g ha into 1 l deionized water and was then filtered with a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane in a vacuum suction device to remove any insoluble particles the total dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the ha stock solution was 314 2 mg l prior to coagulation experiments the ha stock solution was diluted with deionized water to the designated concentrations naclo4 was added to adjust the ionic strength to 10 mm the ph of the ha solution was adjusted with a 0 1 m hcl or a 0 1 m naoh solution to the desired value an ha kaolin solution with an initial turbidity of 50 1 ntu was prepared by adding 10 mg ha and 0 2 g kaolin powder into 1 l tap water the ph of the ha kaolin solution was adjusted with a hcl or naoh solution to the range of 5 10 2 2 experimental section 2 2 1 coagulation experiments coagulation tests were conducted with a program controlled jar test apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china following the below procedure 1 min rapid mixing 200 rpm 15 min slow mixing 40 rpm and 20 min sedimentation after these procedures the supernatants were collected for analysis from approximately 2 cm below the water surface using a syringe 2 2 2 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the uptakes of ha on the coagulated flocs the ionic strength of the distilled water 1 l was adjusted to 10 mm with naclo4 after the coagulants 12 mg ti l was added the reaction was adjusted to ph 6 0 7 0 with naoh and stirred the same way as in the coagulation after that the sample was distributed into several 250 ml flasks and adjusted to each designated ph a certain amount of ha solution was added into each bottle after shaken for 24 h at 150 rpm the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper and the concentration of ha was measured 2 3 analytical approaches 2 3 1 characterization of the hydrolysate products the surface chemistry of the hydrolysate products was investigated with three methods potentiometric acid base titration zeta potential determination and colloid titration potentiometric acid base titration of the 100 mg ti l coagulant solution was conducted with an automatic titration system text s1 the acid base titration data were employed for the analysis of surface site concentration hs with the gran plot method gran 1952 the newly prepared flocs after the rapid mixing in the jar test were measured with a nano zetasizer malvern co uk to estimate the isoelectric point of the hydrolysate products of the three coagulants a back colloid titration method text s1 was used to quantitatively determine the surface charge densities of the hydrolysate products a continuous laser diffraction instrument mastersizer 3000 malvern uk was employed in a modified jar test procedure to record the particle size of the flocs a portion of 5 mg ti l coagulant was pipetted at the beginning of the rapid mixing to the beakers containing 800 ml ha kaolin or si suspensions with an initial turbidity of 50 1 ntu raman xrd afm and nitrogen adsorption desorption analyses were conducted to characterize the morphology and structure of the freeze dried flocs and hydrolysate products text s1 2 3 2 characterization of si and ha the surface chemistry of the tested si microspheres was analyzed with zeta potential following the same procedures as those for the hydrolysate products the pk a of ha molecule was determined with acid base titration total acidity was determined with barium exchange and the carboxylic acidity was titrated by calcium acetate at ph 6 7 schnitzer and kahn 1972 2 3 3 solution analysis the residual turbidity rt was directly measured with a hach 2100n turbidity meter usa the supernatants after filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane were firstly acidified with concentrated hno3 and then injected into an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap 6000 thermo usa for the determination of residual ti the residual doc concentration in the supernatant were measured with a toc 5000a analyzer shimadzu co japan a horiba fluoromax 4 fluorescence analyzer germany was used to measure the concentration of ha at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm an excitation range from 280 to 500 nm and an emission range from 300 to 600 nm were utilized to characterize the three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra 3d eem spectra of ha solutions 2 3 4 calculation approach for ti speciation the speciation of ti was calculated based on the stepwise hydrolysis constants of ti table s1 and the complexation constants for ti hydrolysates with acac table s2 the total concentration of ti and acac were set at 0 2 mm and 0 05 mm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the three coagulants 3 1 1 surface chemistry the physicochemical properties of hydrolysate products play a decisive role in coagulation the hydrolysates of ti salts in the entire ph range were shown in fig 1 a according to the hydrolysis constants buettner and valentine 2011 ferri and riccio 1985 and the solubility constant einaga and komatsu 1981 of ti hydroxides table s1 the dominant hydrolysis species in the ph range of 4 10 were ti oh 4 a small fraction of ti oh 2 2 and ti oh 3 existed at ph lower than 4 0 whereas there was a small fraction of ti oh 5 at ph above 10 0 the presence of acac affected the speciation of ti in the ph range of 6 13 fig 1a a small fraction of ti oh 4 acac was formed leading to a slightly inhibited formation of ti oh 4 the hydrolysates from the txc had a larger surface charge density than those of tc and ptc especially in acidic solutions fig 1b the pollutants in water are usually negatively charged therefore a better charge neutralization ability is expected for txc in acidic solutions acid neutralizing capacity anc is a measure of the overall buffering capacity of solutes plus particulates in an aqueous system against acidification the total surface site concentration hs calculated from the gran plot reflects the anc of particulates chu et al 2002 guo et al 2008 the hydrolysates from txc had a larger hs 4 56 mmol g ti than those of tc 2 70 mmol g ti and ptc 3 17 mmol g ti fig 1c which might be attributed to the milder ph reduction of the effluent in the txc system the isoelectric point phiep where the electrokinetic potential ζ equals 0 of txc 5 3 was larger than those of tc and ptc 5 0 fig 1d indicating a preferential association of cations to the txc hydrolysates lützenkirchen et al 2012 the existence of acac in the framework of txc was proved by ftir and elemental analyses in our previous work wang et al 2016 which might be attributed to this enhanced association of cations 3 1 2 structure and morphology the raman spectra fig s2 of the hydrolysates of txc tc ptc had three broad bands centered at 159 460 and 630 cm 1 indicating that all the hydrolysates contained similar structural groups and were amorphous without long range order balachandran and eror 1982 nemanich et al 1980 this is further confirmed by the xrd analysis all the three hydrolysates had no crystal characteristics and there were no distinct differences among the txc tc ptc hydrolysates fig s3 ohtani et al 1997 however the three hydrolysates had quite different surface areas and pore volumes for charge neutralization the flocs with larger surface area had more exposed active sites which could neutralize the negatively charged pollutants dentel 1988 for sweep flocculation porous and loose flocs could better entrap pollutants than a denser one letterman and vanderbrook 1983 the hydrolysates of txc had a typical type i nitrogen adsorption isotherm indicating the predominance of micropores sing 2001 whereas there was a large amount of meso and macropores in the hydrolysates of tc and ptc with median pore sizes of 15 9 and 5 1 nm respectively fig s4 the pore size distribution curves demonstrate that the pores in the hydrolysates of ptc were the most heterogeneous among the three coagulants fig s4 to better understand the differences in the bulk structure of the hydrolysates suspensions of txc tc and ptc 10 mg ti l at ph 3 5 0 3 were observed directly with afm there were significant differences among the hydrolysates of the three coagulants fig 2 the aggregates formed in the tc suspension were highly uniform with mainly large aggregates whereas those in ptc were poly dispersed with both larger aggregates 2 3 times to those in tc and smaller particles in ptc solution the partial prehydrolysis that underwent in the preparation of ptc zhao et al 2013b 2017 led to the larger aggregates while the remain fraction formed only smaller particles due to the weakened driving force wu et al 2016a rouster et al 2017 as a result the dried hydrolysates of ptc showed the largest heterogeneity in pore size fig s4 the tiny particles might lead to the residual ti in the solutions after coagulation the pattern of hydrolysates formed in the txc solution was obviously unique the hydrolysate particles in txc solution connected together one by one to form a large network of particles and extended to a horizontal plane this special network structure might be accountable for the three observed merits of txc over tc and ptc 1 larger floc size 2 lower residual ti and 3 better performance in sweep flocculation the distinct hydrolysis pattern of txc might come from the added acac in its preparation to verify this hypothesis we tested the complexation between acac and ti in ethanol and aqueous solutions fig s5 ethanol was employed because it is the solvent in the sol gel preparation of txc the peak centered at 274 nm in fig s5 comes from the enol form of acac this peak was much weaker in water than in ethanol because the enol to keto tautomerization of acac in aqueous solution spencer et al 1982 an absorption peak of ti acac complexes satoh et al 2008 was observed at 332 nm in both the ethanol and aqueous solutions the absorbance at 332 nm was linear within 0 2 and leveled off as the molar ratio of acac ti was over 2 0 a further increase of acac did not led to more complexation in aqueous solutions the complexation between acac and ti was much weaker because of the hydrolysis of ti fig 1a and the enol to keto tautomerization of acac fig s5 however it should be noted that the presence of acac partially inhibited the hydrolysis of ti fig 1a therefore the ti o acac structure in txc explained the distinct hydrolysis pattern of txc in aqueous solutions fig 2 3 1 3 dynamics of floc growth the structure and morphology discussed in the above section were focused on the hydrolysates that were generated in pure water the dynamics of floc formation in real waters is one of the most important criteria in coagulation two simulated waters a si suspension turbidity only and an ha kaolin solution with the same initial turbidity 50 ntu were chosen to evaluate the floc growth at different initial solution phs fig 3 compared with the flocs in the si suspension the flocs formed in the ha kaolin solution were generally smaller in the si suspension fig 3a except the one at ph 5 0 the flocs in the txc system had the highest growth rate and the largest floc size both txc and ptc underwent fast hydrolysis at ph 6 0 or above whereas the rapid hydrolysis of tc occurred at ph higher than 6 0 in the ha kaolin solution the ph effect became obscure and much more complicated yan et al 2008 the slowest floc formation occurred at solution ph 8 0 9 0 the ha used in this work had two pk a values at around 4 1 and 9 1 fig s6 although the structure of ha is rather complicated the two pk a could be roughly assigned to carboxyl group 0 28 mmol g and phenolic group 2 51 mmol g respectively fig s6 the ph effect on the floc growth in the ha kaolin solutions might be related with the speciation of ha which will be revisited later 3 2 turbidity removal turbidity removal is one of the most important purposes of coagulation in our previous work the performances of tc ptc and txc in removal of turbidity were evaluated with a kaolin ha suspension as the model water wang et al 2016 as aforementioned the presence of ha might interfere with the coagulation process narkis and rebhun 1983 for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms it would be better to evaluate the removal of turbidity and organic matter separately as shown in fig 4 a at an initial solution ph of 5 8 txc worked well whereas tc and ptc were almost ineffective in the solution of a low turbidity 5 ntu tc and ptc became effective in solutions of higher turbidity however they could only work in a much narrower dose range as compared with txc re stabilization occurred as the dose of tc and ptc exceeded 6 mg ti l it seems that the workable dose ranges of tc and ptc were strongly dependent on the zeta potential the selected si microspheres were negatively charged in the ph range of 2 12 fig s7 with the increase of dose particles in the tc and ptc systems re stabilized due to the over neutralization to the opposite charge fig 4a indicating the importance of charge neutralization in the coagulation of si microspheres with tc and ptc txc possessed a larger positive charge density than tc and ptc fig 1c and consequently a stronger charge neutralization capacity however its performance was not affected by the charge reversal which might be benefited from the network structure of the hydrolysates formed from txc and the moderate decrease in effluent ph in solutions with an initial ph of 9 8 all particles in the three coagulation systems were negatively charged fig 4b as a result no charge neutralization occurred for all the three coagulants nevertheless the removal of turbidity was pretty good demonstrating the complete hydrolysis of ti in the alkaline solutions and the dominant role of sweep entrapment in coagulation zhao et al 2013a wu et al 2011 at all solution phs the residual ti concentration in the txc system was much lower than those of tc and ptc for the solutions of an initial ph of 5 8 there was a good correlation between the residual turbidity and the residual ti concentration the lower the effluent ph the higher was the residual ti concentration no matter started at a low or a high ph the effluent ph of txc was higher than those of tc and ptc which partially explained the lower residual ti concentration in the txc system for the solutions of an initial ph of 9 8 although the residual turbidities in the tc and ptc systems were low there were still a considerable amount of residual ti suggesting that the formation of precipitates from tc and ptc were not complete or there were colloidal particles that passed the filtration which was confirmed by the afm observation fig 2 and the ultrafiltration screening results fig s8 as shown in fig 4 txc is effective for turbidity removal in both acidic and basic solutions with a wide range of initial turbidity the coagulation results for the si suspensions further demonstrate the merits of txc workable at a low turbidity and low solution ph in a wide dose range and meanwhile with a low residual ti concentration and a mild ph change 3 3 removal of ha ha is a polyelectrolyte its removal was highly ph dependent gregor et al 1997 narkis and rebhun 1977 addition of tc and ptc to water immediately led to a dramatic decrease of the solution ph whereas txc resulted in a much milder reduction fig s9 to exclude the ph effect prior to the addition of ti coagulants ha solutions were adjusted to certain initial phs to make the three ti ha solutions reaching the same final ph as illustrated in fig 5 txc led to a lower turbidity a higher doc removal and a lower residual ti concentration in a broader ph range than tc and ptc there were sharp changes around the isoelectric points of the hydrolysates from the three coagulants fig 5 such a phenomenon has been observed in the interaction of ha with fe salts cheng 2002 in the presence of ha two reactions occurred competitively in the coagulation system a fast hydrolysis of the metal salt and a complexation between the metal salt and ha chekli et al 2017b once the solution ph was high enough the rapid hydrolysis of ti salts overwhelmed their complexation with ha leading to both a higher residual ha and a higher residual turbidity xu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 it should be noted that the residual turbidity in the ha solutions came from the colloidal precipitates mainly ti ha complexes su et al 2017 sillanpää et al 2018 the wider workable ph range of txc than those of tc and ptc could be attributed to the more controllable hydrolysis of ti in the presence of acac fig 2 the better performance of txc than tc and ptc in ha solutions demonstrate that the previously observed weak ability of txc in removal of ha from the ha kaolin suspensions wang et al 2016 was actually a result of ph effect complexation between ha molecules and ti hydrolysates was proposed as a major mechanism yan et al 2008 by excluding the ph effect the performance of txc in removal of ha was actually better than tc and ptc because the txc had a stronger complexation ability with ha than the other two which was evidenced by the stronger fluorescence quenching of ha by txc fig 6 and fig s10 the peak at 350 nm excitation 450 nm emission was a characteristic fluorescence of humic acid like matter wang et al 2009 at ph 3 5 almost all the functional groups in ha were protonated which were favorable to their binding with the o ti o skeletons as shown in fig 6 at ph 3 5 the addition of the three coagulants did lead to the disappearance of the 350 450 nm peak demonstrating that there was strong binding between the hydrolysates and ha the increase of solution ph greatly reduced the binding between the hydrolysates and ha because both the hydrolysates and ha became negatively charged fig 1d at ph 8 5 the phenolic groups in ha were protonated the ti hydrolysates could still combine with ha through the phenolic moieties which explained the weak but existed fluorescence quenching in the alkaline solutions the binding affinity of ha to the hydrolysates from the three coagulants followed in order of txc tc ptc the stronger binding of ha in the txc system might come from the anchored acac in the hydrolysates of txc fig 7 the complexation between ti hydrolysates and ha was further verified with the adsorption removal of ha by the pre generated hydrolysates as shown in fig 8 the adsorption removal of ha was almost the same as that in coagulation and txc showed the largest ha adsorption capacity this is consistent with a previous report that the removal of organic matter by coagulation was attributed primary to adsorption cheng 2002 since the hydrolysates used in the adsorption experiments were pre generated the residual ti concentrations in the adsorption experiments were much lower than those in coagulation the hydrolysis of txc in coagulation led to the release of the bonded acac at a concentration lower than 5 μmol acac mg ti wang et al 2018 when exposed to sunlight acac could be oxidized to volatile fatty acids that could be used in bio fermentation wu et al 2016b meanwhile the uv acac process was proved to be effective for the decomposition of toxic microcystins wang et al 2018 which would be an additional function in the treatment of algae containing waters with txc based on the tests with daphnia magna bok choy rice seed and arabidopsis thaliana the toxicity of acac and uv acac treated solutions was proved to be lower or comparable to that of the uv h2o2 counterparts yang et al 2018 suggesting that the released acac would not cause adverse environmental impacts 4 conclusions an in depth analysis was conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind the improved coagulation performance of txc over tc and ptc for waters of low turbidity and high organic matter the acac in txc skeleton plays a crucial role in improving the physicochemical properties of the hydrolysate products acac can control the hydrolysis pattern to form a large net work structure which is beneficial to form large floc size with low residual ti concentration acac also improves the surface charge density total surface site concentration and the binding affinity with organic matter these characteristics account for the merits of txc in water wastewater treatment and may broaden the practical application of titanium salt coagulants the strong chelation ability to various metals give acac a shot at regulating the hydrolysis of metal salts to build effective structures for practical application the outstanding merit of txc is the removal of turbidity in both acidic and basic solutions with a wide range of initial turbidity the strong complexation of txc with organic matter would deteriorate the removal of turbidity in organic matter coexisting water therefore more studies on the further modification of txc by composition with some polyelectrolytes or other inorganic metal salts are warranted for the development of more cost effective coagulants acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21522702 21677070 and the

19766,bioelectrochemical systems bes can accomplish simultaneous wastewater treatment and resource recovery via interactions between microbes and electrodes often deemed as energy efficient technologies bes have not been well evaluated for their energy performance such as energy production and consumption in this work we have conducted a review and analysis of energy balance in bes with parameters like normalized energy recovery specific energy consumption and net energy production several bes representatives based on their functions were selected for analysis including direct

analysis of energy performance of various bes and expected to encourage more thinking analysis and presentation of energy data towards appropriate research and development of bes technology for resource recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system energy production and consumption resource recovery wastewater treatment desalination 1 introduction rapid socio economic growth has created great challenges such as water scarcity larger nutrient demand for increasing food production and energy shortage mccarty et al 2011 wastewater is a key element in the water energy food nexus and may offer a promising solution for alleviating these emerging challenges through innovative recovery of value added resources mo and zhang 2013 extensive efforts have been invested to transform conventional energy intensive wastewater treatment to a resource recovery process for reclaiming valuable resources such as nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus bioenergy derived from organic wastes and high quality water towards wastewater reuse tong and elimelech 2016 complete oxidation of organics in municipal wastewater can generate a theoretical energy content of 1 93 kwh m 3 wastewater and direct nutrient recovery for fertilizer applications can save up to 0 79 kwh m 3 mccarty et al 2011 the prevailing trend of deeming wastewater as a resource rather than a waste urges the development of cost effective reclamation technologies among the newly developed treatment concepts bioelectrochemical systems bes have demonstrated a great potential with versatile applications to achieve specific resource recovery goals and broader flexibility in treating various types of wastewater logan and rabaey 2012 a typical bes employs exoelectrogens electrochemically active microorganisms donating electrons to electrode as anodic bio catalysts to anaerobically oxidize the organics in wastewater logan 2009 or electrotrophs electrochemically active microorganisms receiving electros from electrode as cathodic bio catalysts to achieve co2 hco3 reduction lovley 2011 the released electrons from anode are transferred through an external circuit to a terminal electron acceptor in its cathode thereby generating electric current bes can be generally categorized into several groups based on their functions 1 microbial fuel cells mfc focus on direct electricity generation with oxygen as a representative terminal electron acceptor 2 microbial electrolysis cells mec are able to accomplish hydrogen gas production and or nutrient enrichment with externally applied voltage 3 microbial electrosynthesis cell mes operated similarly to mecs can reduce carbon dioxide to various organics with microbial catalysts in their cathodes and 4 microbial desalination cells mdc can produce fresh water from seawater or brackish water driven by the self produced electric field or assisted by external power supply fig 1 wang and ren 2013 the research efforts in the past decade have greatly advanced the bes technology in the aspects of microbiological principle electrochemical mechanism and material science leading to enhanced understanding of microbial community analysis reactor design catalyst selection and membrane development and an increasing attempt of system scaling up for treating actual wastewater harnisch and schroder 2010 logan 2010 to identify suitable application niches that may guide bes research and development the presumably energy efficient bes must be evaluated in the energy scale to demonstrate its competitiveness against other wastewater resource recovery technologies the potential advantages of bes technology will lie in the minimum amount of energy investment in its operation and the maximum amount of recovery of energy and other value added resources such as nutrients and or high quality reusable water however the majority of bes studies have failed to report energy data production and or consumption when accomplishing resource recovery making it difficult to precisely understand the current status of this technology he 2013 for example numerous studies have reported direct electricity energy production in mfcs but the energy performance of those mfcs was described in power density with a unit w m 2 or w m 3 logan et al 2015 rabaey et al 2005 rather than actual energy unit such as joule or kilowatt hour 1 kwh 3 600 000 j he 2017 recently an alternative energy parameter normalized energy recovery ner was proposed to present mfc energy production in kwh m 3 treated wastewater or kwh kg 1 removed chemical oxygen demand cod ge et al 2013 independent from system dimension ner allows better comparisons among different bes or between bes and the existing wastewater treatment reclamation technologies energy consumption by bes operation has long been a missing puzzle piece in the bes energy balance and it is not reasonable to label bes as a labor free process by omitting any energy consumption data the major energy consumers in a typical bes include pumping systems for feeding and or recirculation aeration mixing and or external power supply the pumping systems contribute significantly to energy consumption dong et al 2015b and both feeding and recirculation pumps can also affect energy production through influencing exoelectrogens washout rate akman et al 2013 exoelectrogens feast famine condition kim et al 2015 mass ionic transfer at solution electrode interface shen et al 2013 and overall system internal resistance ieropoulos et al 2010 hence the pumping systems are strongly relevant to both specific energy consumption rate sec with units such as kwh m 3 treated wastewater or kwh kg 1 removed cod and net resource energy output this work aims to provide an in depth analysis of energy balance in various bes with respect to their major functions we focus on mfcs electricity generation mecs hydrogen production nitrogen recovery microbial electrosynthesis and mdcs desalination the kwh centered units are used to enable possible comparison across the various bes and between bes and existing water wastewater treatment systems plappally and lienhard 2012 due to a lack of sufficient literature data for energy analysis several functions such as recovery of sulfur metal and phosphorus were excluded despite various review papers about bes bajracharya et al 2016 2017a this review has a unique focus on and detailed analyses of energy production and consumption in various bes it is expected to provide valuable information for system optimization to truly realize energy efficient recovery of energy and other value added resource in bes and to encourage more thinking analysis and presentation of energy data 2 quantification of energy production and consumption 2 1 normalized energy recovery ner energy can be recovered as either direct electricity in mfcs or hydrogen gas in mecs in mfcs power production can be estimated

recirculation and feeding pumps aeration and or external power supply extensive aeration should be avoided or eliminated by using an air cathode configuration for example in a single chamber mfc liu and logan 2004 liu et al 2004 or a tubular mfc with a catholyte dripping system zhang et al 2010 thus aeration energy is not included in this paper the power consumption of a pump p pump kw is

the pump h m is the difference of water height before and after the pump d m is the diameter of the tube and v m s 1 is the water velocity the value of η varies in different types of pumps most of the current lab and liter scale bes used peristaltic pumps with relatively high efficiency and hence we assumed η 100 for the estimation purpose in this review it should be noted that centrifugal pumps could be more cost effective in scaled up systems with an average efficiency of 50 70 for smaller pumps and 75 90 efficiency for medium and large pumps the effects of bes scale on pumping and pump selection on energy performance were not included in this work due to a lack of relevant data in bes literature the total energy consumption of pumps p pump depends on the number of the pump used for

difference in reactor configuration operation substrates and materials ner was proposed as a unit to describe energy production in 2013 ge et al 2013 and its expression in kwh m 3 treated water or kwh kg 1 cod makes it possible to compare bes energy production to that of existing wastewater treatment technologies plappally and lienhard 2012 our previous ner analysis ge et al 2013 found that the highest ner could reach 2 2 kwh m 3 wen et al 2010 or around 2 0 kwh kg 1 cod tugtas et al 2011 independent of the mfc reactor size however most mfcs exhibited an nerv 0 1 kwh m 3 or an nercod 0 1 kwh kg 1 cod ge et al 2015 fig 2 a and b ner is governed by various factors substrate composition for instance can notably affect mfc energy output it was found that the average nerv of the acetate fed mfcs 0 25 kwh m 3 open square symbol in fig 2c was significantly higher than those fed with glucose p 0 03 sucrose p 0 01 and real wastewater both domestic and industrial p 0 01 other influence factors include mfc design configuration logan et al 2015 system hrt akman et al 2013 nutrient organic loading rate nlr and olr kim et al 2010 sevda et al 2013 bacteria growth condition famine feast

removal rate rcod zhang et al 2015 sec has not been widely reported in mfc literature sec of an mfc is mainly due to mixing using hydraulic recirculation by pumps or stirrers and substrate supply e g anode feeding and cathode oxygen aeration or supply quantifying sec in a bench scale mfc can be difficult due to the use of magnetic stirrers that cannot be effectively estimated for energy consumption several recent studies treating low strength wastewater cod 1000 mg l 1 table 1 have reported sec in continuously operated mfc systems for example a secv of 0 027 kwh m 3 was reported in a 90 l stacked mfc dong et al 2015b and up to 0 098 kwh kg 1 cod seccod table s1 was required to power the pumping system in a dual cathode tubular mfc zhang and he 2012 active aeration should be avoided due to the large energy consumption of air pump 37 76 of total energy recovery table 1 the energy consumption of low speed feeding pump is normally much lower than that of a high speed recirculation pump pfeeding precirculation zhang and he 2012 thus in the sec estimate energy consumption by feeding pumps becomes negligible and then eq 6 can be simplified to eq 11 where recirculation pumps control mfc energy consumption 11 p p u m p 2 p f e e d i n g p r e c i r c u l a t i o n p r e c i r c u l a t i o n although feeding pumps consume relatively low energy they could significantly affect ner sec by changing flow rate organic loading rate to better understand the effects of pumps e g feeding and recirculation on both ner and sec one continuously fed tubular mfc system from our previous study mfclab 1 in original study was selected for a more comprehensive analysis zhang et al 2013b under a fixed recirculation rate 300 ml min 1 fig 3 a the mfc power generation was in a positive correlation with the increase of feeding rate whereas a stable power consumption was observed fig 3a inset according to eqs 4 and 8 an elevated feeding rate q feeding could lead to notable drop of both nerv and secv consequently a relatively medium feeding rate resulted in a maximum nepv 1 2 ml min 1 fig 3a further evaluation of the effect of recirculation pumps was based on a fixed feeding rate of 1 2 ml min 1 fig 3b reducing recirculation resulted in a gradual decrease of mfc power generation but a more dramatic drop of power consumption eq 11 and fig 3b inset with a constant feeding rate q feeding both nerv and secv followed the trend of power generation and consumption leading to a maximum nepv 0 043 kwh m 3 under an intermediate recirculation rate of 150 ml min 1 fig 3b thus by adjusting both recirculation and feeding rates this tubular mfc system could generate 43 times more net energy i e nepv than that of the worst case i e a net output of 0 001 kwh m 3 under 300 ml min 1 recirculation and 0 6 ml min 1 feeding it should be noted that similar effects of pumps have been observed on nercod seccod and nepcod figs s1a and s1b supplementary materials the above pump nep analysis has provided solid evidence of the importance of pumping systems to energy performance of mfcs 4 hydrogen production an mec has the same anode mechanism as that of an mfc and is designed to produce value added products in its cathode through exerting a small external voltage zhang and angelidaki 2014 the exerted voltage 0 2 v serving as the bias between anode and cathode is significantly lower than the theoretical value for water splitting 1 23 v bockris et al 1985 hydrogen production is the major energy recovery approach in the mec cathode via continuous reduction of h electron acceptor specific hydrogen production rate in a unit of m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 has been adopted as an important performance parameter to evaluate mec hydrogen recovery capability we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 61 selected mec papers from 2005 to 2017 and found that the highest hydrogen production rate could reach 50 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 jeremiasse et al 2010 2011 although most mecs generated less than 5 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 fig 4 a no significant difference in hydrogen production p 0 10 was observed between bench scale mecs 3 03 8 84 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 vmec 1 l and liter scale mecs 0 94 2 32 h2 m 3 mec d 1 vmec 1 l however substrate composition was identified to be a key factor for hydrogen production short chain volatile fatty acids such as acetate could be easily utilized by exoelectrogens rendering a notably enhanced hydrogen yield of 3 71 9 42 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 higher than that from long chain organics e g glucose glycerol and sugar p 0 04 and low strength domestic wastewater p 0 01 fig 4b high strength industrial wastewaters from winery and food processing plants exhibited a comparable hydrogen yield to that of acetate 2 61 9 04 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 p 0 60 regarding the mec configuration single and double chamber mecs had similar hydrogen generation p 0 10 however double chamber mecs with membrane separation between the anode and the cathode are able to produce high purity hydrogen gas while the gas produced from single chamber mecs contains a significant portion of carbon dioxide and methane clauwaert and verstraete 2009 comparable hydrogen yield was obtained in double chamber mecs with anion exchange membrane aem as compared to that with cation exchange membrane cem p 0 12 or proton exchange membrane pem p 0 22 fig s2a cathode catalyst pt ni mo pd and carbon based catalysts can significantly boost hydrogen yield via lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction compared to non catalyzed electrodes fig s2b energy balance regarding hydrogen production in mecs has not been systematically evaluated in previous studies a few mec studies reported ner with a unit of kwh m 3 h2 or kwh kg 1 cod based on current literature bench scale mecs could achieve ner of 1 00 3 13 kwh kg 1 cod and require sec energy input of 0 80 2 83 kwh kg 1 cod to drive hydrogen evolution reaction table 2 treating high strength wastewater cod 1000 mg l 1 would have a large chance to render a positive nep and the highest nep of 3 80 kwh kg 1 cod was observed in an mec treating high strength industrial wastewater tenca et al 2013 although most mecs still require net energy input due to larger sec than ner table 2 this input is generally lower than that of conventional aerobic wastewater treatment 0 7 2 0 kwh kg 1 cod pant et al 2011 to achieve energy positive mecs ner must be enhanced with improved reactor design having a larger membrane surface area and an optimal anode to cathode ratio kim et al 2010 high performance catalyst to reduce reaction overpotential yuan and he 2017 and more reaction sites to lower activation and concentration overpotential e g porous or foam type of electrode with increased specific surface area rozendal et al 2010 reducing sec is equally important to overall nep enhancement for example via optimizing operational parameters such as external voltage and feeding recirculation pump it was reported that external power supply consumes a significant amount of energy on the system level 95 in the mec and the pumping system becomes a minor contributor to energy demand 5 zou et al 2017 utilizing alternative renewable power sources such as solar energy chae et al 2009 can be an attractive approach to reduce sec while driving hydrogen evolution reaction 5 nitrogen recovery nutrient recovery is deemed as a unique advantage of bes system comparing to other biological nutrient removal or membrane treatment processes colombo et al 2017 qin and he 2017 as the major form of nitrogen ammonium can reach several hundreds to thousands microgram per liter in high strength wastewater conventional biological nutrient removal e g nitrification denitrification and anammox focuses on eliminating ammonium from wastewater with consumption of a large amount of energy and chemicals and generation of excess biosolids recovery of ammonia from wastewater instead of removal has a potential to reduce energy consumption of the treatment processes and supply valuable nitrogen elements for agricultural or other practices kuntke et al 2012 ammonia loss was observed in a single chamber bes liu et al 2004 and this intrigued further investigation of ammonia recovery in double chamber bes which can separate ammonia from wastewater for further collection two major mechanisms has been revealed during ammonia separation in bes kim et al 2008 sleutels et al 2009 i e diffusion driven by concentration gradient across cem and migration induced by an electric field serving as proton shuttle cord ruwisch et al 2011 both of which are associated with current generation that creates an ph gradient ammonium diffusion was found to outcompete electrical migration in a bes under a moderate current density 1 a m 2 due to ph bias induced by electrochemical reactions liu et al 2016 to efficiently drive ammonia out of the catholyte i e a coupled stripping process use of the produced hydrogen gas or external aeration will be needed at a cost of energy consumption the ammonia recovery performance has been reported directly or indirectly in various parameters such as influent effluent ammonium concentrations and removal efficiency arredondo et al 2015 to better compare the performance among different studies specific ammonium recovery rate with a unit of kg n m 3 reactor d 1 was used in the present paper both mfcs and mecs have been employed to recover ammonia the mfc based recovery could achieve a recovery rate of 0 10 0 75 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 fig 5 a which is comparable to that of air stripping 0 10 0 76 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 maurer et al 2003 the mec based ammonia recovery exhibited a larger variation from 0 02 to 11 57 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 depending on applied voltage and wastewater type the highest ammonia recovery rate 11 57 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 was reported in a 140 ml mec system treating diluted urine which recovered 34 2 of the influent ammonia kuntke et al 2014 due to the limited number of selected studies and difference among those studies we cannot conclude any trend of recovery rate affected by either reactor size or initial ammonia concentration despite extensive studies of ammonia recovery in bes very few have constructed energy balance for ammonia recovery considering that gas stripping is widely used for ammonia separation from liquid phase in a catholyte a large portion of energy is invested to gas pump to facilitate this phase separation to balance energy investment and ammonia recovery rate an intermediate stripping rate i e cathode aeration rate should be preferred for example in a previous study over 90 of energy was consumed by external power supply and catholyte aeration qin et al 2017 fig 5b an optimized aeration rate of 100 ml min 1 could lower secnh4 n to 4 9 kwh kg 1 n with 41 energy to power air pump and 52 to drive external power supply further decrease in the catholyte aeration to 30 ml min 1 would lead to insufficient separation of ammonia from liquid phase rendering a much higher secnh4 n of 26 2 kwh kg 1 n fig 5b a moderate applied voltage would require less energy investment rendering a more energy efficient nitrogen recovery system in the abovementioned example secnh4 n was decreased from 6 7 kwh kg 1 at 0 8 v to 4 5 kwh kg 1 n at 0 5 v qin et al 2017 energy consumption may be compensated by using either direct electricity generation in mfcs or hydrogen biogas production in mecs for example the energy recovery of 13 7 kwh kg 1 n from the produced hydrogen gas could contribute to 94 5 of secnh4 n 14 5 kwh kg 1 n resulting in an nepnh4 n of 0 8 kwh kg 1 n wu and modin 2013 our literature review found that only six studies treating high strength wastewater cod 1000 mg l 1 table 3 reported nepnh4 n ranging from 0 8 to 8 5 kwh kg 1 n a negative nep indicated net energy investment to achieve ammonia reclamation in bes the average nepnh4 n of 3 6 2 8 kwh kg 1 n by bes is lower than that of haber bosch process 8 to 14 kwh kg 1 n erisman et al 2008 conventional nitrification denitrification 0 05 to 4 kwh kg 1 n or anammox process 6 to 12 kwh kg 1 n wang et al 2010 a trade off between elevated ammonia recovery rate and increased energy consumption in bes warrants further investigation 6 chemical production reducing carbon dioxide with the aid of bioelectricity generation to various value added organic chemicals such as formic acid acetate ethanol and butanol can be accomplished in microbial electrosynthesis system mes rabaey and rozendal 2010 nearly all of the current mes are bench scale proof of concept studies and have focused on biocathode design material bajracharya et al 2015 jourdin et al 2014 biofilm community dennis et al 2013 microbial pathway rosenbaum et al 2011 and initial economic analysis desloover et al 2012 elmekawy et al 2016 acetate was selected as a major end product in this review due to a larger number of literature available for energy analysis mes inoculated with acetogenic bacteria could have an acetate production rate normalized by cathode working volume ranging from 4 to 14632 g acetate m 3 cathode d 1 table 4 the highest acetate production was benefited from successful implementation of three dimensional hierarchical metal oxide carbon electrode cui et al 2017 thus far none of the mes studies has evaluated energy consumption external power supply is the sole energy consumer in bench scale mes while energy consumption by electrolyte mixing is hard to estimate at this moment to successfully convert co2 hco3 to acetate a theoretical cathode potential of 0 28 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she is required rabaey and rozendal 2010 and a practical cathode potential of 0 40 v vs she should be expected due to overpotential nevin et al 2010 the electric energy invested i e secacetate was estimated within the range of 2 5 7 0 kwh kg 1 acetate table 4 with a recent exception of less than 0 1 kwh kg 1 acetate cui et al 2017 if formic acid was selected as the end product comparable energy consumption could be expected 2 7 kwh kg 1 formic acid zhao et al 2012 meanwhile separation of these end products from the catholyte and operation of pumps both feeding and recirculation pumps would inevitably require extra energy investment in practical systems for example an energy input of 2 6 2 8 kwh kg 1 acetate or acetic acid could be expected by using conventional thermal driven separation process 10 35 wt acetate industrial data from de dietrich process systems the total secacetate in bench scale mes could be at least 3 0 kwh kg 1 acetate with over 85 energy consumed by separation much higher that required by industrial acetate production via carbonylation of methonal 1 65 kwh kg 1 acetate acetic acid neelis et al 2008 therefore chemical production via mes still requires substantial research effort on enhancing chemical production via optimizing microbial metabolism proposing better electrode design material to lower thermodynamic barrier and investigating desirable mes design towards enhanced overall process efficiency desloover et al 2012 7 water desalination since the first demonstration of microbial desalination in 2009 cao et al 2009 there has been much progress in researching and developing mdc technology saeed et al 2015 schroder et al 2015 recently european union horizon 2020 programme awarded 7 9 million euros to the microbial desalination mides project for examining the feasibility of mdcs while significantly lowering sec despite potentially good efficiency nearly 100 for seawater desalination 30 g l 1 nacl there still lack studies of using actual wastewater as an anode substrate jacobson et al 2011 in an effort of scaling up mdcs to a total volume of 105 l the total energy consumption secsalt for seawater desalination 35 g l 1 nacl was significantly reduced from 1 32 kwh kg 1 salt to 0 90 kwh kg 1 salt when an applied voltage increased from 0 v mfc mode to 1 2 v mec mode zhang and he 2015 this reduction was resulted from a much higher salt removal rate of 9 1 kg salt m 3 d 1 at 1 2 v compared to 3 7 kg salt m 3 d 1 at 0 v besides externally applied voltage pumping systems are a major energy consumer in mdcs the pumping related sec recirculation pump and brine feeding pump via desalination performance and general energy investment tendency were analyzed and discussed here recirculation pumps provide a mixing effect in mdc chambers and appropriate adjustment could significantly reduce energy consumption with minor influence on both desalination and energy generation performance in the abovementioned 105 l mdc system reducing cathode recirculation rate from 18 2 to 3 1 ml min 1 resulted in notable reduction of power consumption from 0 034 w to 0 012 w while maintaining a comparable salt removal rate of 0 031 0 034 kg salt h 1 rendering 62 reduction of secsalt from 1 0 kwh kg 1 to 0 38 kwh kg 1 fig 6 a zhang and he 2015 the salt loading rate in the desalination middle chamber of an mdc is affected by the feeding flow rate or hrt in a bench scale mdc treating brackish water a total dissolved solids of 1 6 g l 1 decreasing the salty water feeding rate from 0 13 ml min 1 0 8 d hrt to 0 015 ml min 1 6 9 d hrt boosted salt removal efficiency from 20 to 95 but this led to an increase of secsalt from 0 15 kwh kg 1 to 0 25 kwh kg 1 due to the decreased salt removal rate qsalt from 7 50 10 6 kg salt h 1 to 4 63 10 6 kg salt h 1 fig 6b ping et al 2015 this increase was due to a longer operating time to achieve target desalination efficiency at a lower qsalt while ptotal was relatively stable under different salty water feeding rates thus a higher feeding rate could be preferred due to a more desirable salt removal rate and less energy consumption i e secsalt to make mdc more energy efficient i e lower secsalt continuous desalination with enhanced hydrogen production may be considered it was reported in a previous study that 1 8 to 2 3 times more energy could be recovered as hydrogen gas than overall system consumption in an mdc fed with synthetic wastewater in anode acetate as carbon source luo et al 2010 mehanna et al 2010 despite relatively low energy consumption for desalination in mdcs the salt removal rate is also low taking both of those factors into consideration may help identify potential applications of mdcs for example desalination of brackish water or acting as a pre desalination unit for conventional desalination systems 8 conclusions in this review energy performance of bes with various functions was systematically analyzed and discussed with the following conclusions energy balance of mfcs is mostly negative due to more energy consumption than recovery the sec of an mfc is mainly due to mixing using hydraulic recirculation by pumps or stirrers and substrate supply e g anode feeding and cathode oxygen aeration or supply energy balance of mecs could be positive because of higher value of the produced hydrogen gas external power supply consumes a significant amount of energy on the system level 95 in an mec and the pumping system is a minor contributor 5 high strength wastewater such as food beverage wastewater benefits hydrogen production and can lead to an energy positive mec ammonia recovery via bes has a potential to be an energy efficient approach to produce nitrogen elements for agricultural or other practices a large amount of energy is invested to gas pump to facilitate phase separation net energy investment was required for ammonia with a nepnh4 n ranging from 0 8 to 8 5 kwh kg 1 n although microbial electrosynthesis could be attractive the total secacetate in bench scale mes would be at least 3 0 kwh kg 1 acetate with over 85 of energy consumed by separation higher than that required by industrial acetate production via carbonylation of methanol 1 65 kwh kg 1 acetate acetic acid mdcs with applied voltage can have better desalination performance and lower total energy consumption adjustment of recirculation pumps could significantly reduce energy consumption with minor influence on desalination a higher feeding rate of salty water to the desalination chamber results in a higher salt removal rate and less energy consumption although the data analysis here was limited by the availability of sufficient energy information in literature this work still represents an initial step forward to reveal a picture of energy performance of bes encouraging future exergy analysis to unveil net energy available to be used on the system level significant efforts are still required to improve net energy production in bes with respect to all functions and potential benefits of low energy consumption in bes should be recognized a more precise assessment of energy performance requires system scaling up which will also facilitate the analysis operating and capital cost

19766,bioelectrochemical systems bes can accomplish simultaneous wastewater treatment and resource recovery via interactions between microbes and electrodes often deemed as energy efficient technologies bes have not been well evaluated for their energy performance such as energy production and consumption in this work we have conducted a review and analysis of energy balance in bes with parameters like normalized energy recovery specific energy consumption and net energy production several bes representatives based on their functions were selected for analysis including direct electricity generation in microbial fuel cells hydrogen production in microbial electrolysis cells nitrogen recovery in bes chemical production in microbial electrosynthesis cells and desalination in microbial desalination cells energy performance was normalized to water volume kwh m 3 organic removal kwh kg cod 1 nitrogen recovery kwh kg n 1 chemical production kwh kg 1 or removed salt during desalination kwh kg 1 the key operating factors such as pumping system recirculation feeding pumps and external power supply were discussed for their effects on energy performance this is an in depth analysis of energy performance of various bes and expected to encourage more thinking analysis and presentation of energy data towards appropriate research and development of bes technology for resource recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system energy production and consumption resource recovery wastewater treatment desalination 1 introduction rapid socio economic growth has created great challenges such as water scarcity larger nutrient demand for increasing food production and energy shortage mccarty et al 2011 wastewater is a key element in the water energy food nexus and may offer a promising solution for alleviating these emerging challenges through innovative recovery of value added resources mo and zhang 2013 extensive efforts have been invested to transform conventional energy intensive wastewater treatment to a resource recovery process for reclaiming valuable resources such as nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus bioenergy derived from organic wastes and high quality water towards wastewater reuse tong and elimelech 2016 complete oxidation of organics in municipal wastewater can generate a theoretical energy content of 1 93 kwh m 3 wastewater and direct nutrient recovery for fertilizer applications can save up to 0 79 kwh m 3 mccarty et al 2011 the prevailing trend of deeming wastewater as a resource rather than a waste urges the development of cost effective reclamation technologies among the newly developed treatment concepts bioelectrochemical systems bes have demonstrated a great potential with versatile applications to achieve specific resource recovery goals and broader flexibility in treating various types of wastewater logan and rabaey 2012 a typical bes employs exoelectrogens electrochemically active microorganisms donating electrons to electrode as anodic bio catalysts to anaerobically oxidize the organics in wastewater logan 2009 or electrotrophs electrochemically active microorganisms receiving electros from electrode as cathodic bio catalysts to achieve co2 hco3 reduction lovley 2011 the released electrons from anode are transferred through an external circuit to a terminal electron acceptor in its cathode thereby generating electric current bes can be generally categorized into several groups based on their functions 1 microbial fuel cells mfc focus on direct electricity generation with oxygen as a representative terminal electron acceptor 2 microbial electrolysis cells mec are able to accomplish hydrogen gas production and or nutrient enrichment with externally applied voltage 3 microbial electrosynthesis cell mes operated similarly to mecs can reduce carbon dioxide to various organics with microbial catalysts in their cathodes and 4 microbial desalination cells mdc can produce fresh water from seawater or brackish water driven by the self produced electric field or assisted by external power supply fig 1 wang and ren 2013 the research efforts in the past decade have greatly advanced the bes technology in the aspects of microbiological principle electrochemical mechanism and material science leading to enhanced understanding of microbial community analysis reactor design catalyst selection and membrane development and an increasing attempt of system scaling up for treating actual wastewater harnisch and schroder 2010 logan 2010 to identify suitable application niches that may guide bes research and development the presumably energy efficient bes must be evaluated in the energy scale to demonstrate its competitiveness against other wastewater resource recovery technologies the potential advantages of bes technology will lie in the minimum amount of energy investment in its operation and the maximum amount of recovery of energy and other value added resources such as nutrients and or high quality reusable water however the majority of bes studies have failed to report energy data production and or consumption when accomplishing resource recovery making it difficult to precisely understand the current status of this technology he 2013 for example numerous studies have reported direct electricity energy production in mfcs but the energy performance of those mfcs was described in power density with a unit w m 2 or w m 3 logan et al 2015 rabaey et al 2005 rather than actual energy unit such as joule or kilowatt hour 1 kwh 3 600 000 j he 2017 recently an alternative energy parameter normalized energy recovery ner was proposed to present mfc energy production in kwh m 3 treated wastewater or kwh kg 1 removed chemical oxygen demand cod ge et al 2013 independent from system dimension ner allows better comparisons among different bes or between bes and the existing wastewater treatment reclamation technologies energy consumption by bes operation has long been a missing puzzle piece in the bes energy balance and it is not reasonable to label bes as a labor free process by omitting any energy consumption data the major energy consumers in a typical bes include pumping systems for feeding and or recirculation aeration mixing and or external power supply the pumping systems contribute significantly to energy consumption dong et al 2015b and both feeding and recirculation pumps can also affect energy production through influencing exoelectrogens washout rate akman et al 2013 exoelectrogens feast famine condition kim et al 2015 mass ionic transfer at solution electrode interface shen et al 2013 and overall system internal resistance ieropoulos et al 2010 hence the pumping systems are strongly relevant to both specific energy consumption rate sec with units such as kwh m 3 treated wastewater or kwh kg 1 removed cod and net resource energy output this work aims to provide an in depth analysis of energy balance in various bes with respect to their major functions we focus on mfcs electricity generation mecs hydrogen production nitrogen recovery microbial electrosynthesis and mdcs desalination the kwh centered units are used to enable possible comparison across the various bes and between bes and existing water wastewater treatment systems plappally and lienhard 2012 due to a lack of sufficient literature data for energy analysis several functions such as recovery of sulfur metal and phosphorus were excluded despite various review papers about bes bajracharya et al 2016 2017a this review has a unique focus on and detailed analyses of energy production and consumption in various bes it is expected to provide valuable information for system optimization to truly realize energy efficient recovery of energy and other value added resource in bes and to encourage more thinking analysis and presentation of energy data 2 quantification of energy production and consumption 2 1 normalized energy recovery ner energy can be recovered as either direct electricity in mfcs or hydrogen gas in mecs in mfcs power production can be estimated based on the maximum volumetric power density which is used to calculate the actual power production 1 p p r o d u c t i o n p max α power density max v a n o d e α where v anode is the anodic working

recirculation and feeding pumps aeration and or external power supply extensive aeration should be avoided or eliminated by using an air cathode configuration for example in a single chamber mfc liu and logan 2004 liu et al 2004 or a tubular mfc with a catholyte dripping system zhang et al 2010 thus aeration energy is not included in this paper the power consumption of a pump p pump kw is

the pump h m is the difference of water height before and after the pump d m is the diameter of the tube and v m s 1 is the water velocity the value of η varies in different types of pumps most of the current lab and liter scale bes used peristaltic pumps with relatively high efficiency and hence we assumed η 100 for the estimation purpose in this review it should be noted that centrifugal pumps could be more cost effective in scaled up systems with an average efficiency of 50 70 for smaller pumps and 75 90 efficiency for medium and large pumps the effects of bes scale on pumping and pump selection on energy performance were not included in this work due to a lack of relevant data in bes literature the total energy consumption of pumps p pump depends on the number of the pump used for

difference in reactor configuration operation substrates and materials ner was proposed as a unit to describe energy production in 2013 ge et al 2013 and its expression in kwh m 3 treated water or kwh kg 1 cod makes it possible to compare bes energy production to that of existing wastewater treatment technologies plappally and lienhard 2012 our previous ner analysis ge et al 2013 found that the highest ner could reach 2 2 kwh m 3 wen et al 2010 or around 2 0 kwh kg 1 cod tugtas et al 2011 independent of the mfc reactor size however most mfcs exhibited an nerv 0 1 kwh m 3 or an nercod 0 1 kwh

anode feeding and cathode oxygen aeration or supply quantifying sec in a bench scale mfc can be difficult due to the use of magnetic stirrers that cannot be effectively estimated for energy consumption several recent studies treating low strength wastewater cod 1000 mg l 1 table 1 have reported sec in continuously operated mfc systems for example a secv of 0 027 kwh m 3 was reported in a 90 l stacked mfc dong et al 2015b and up to 0 098 kwh kg 1 cod seccod table s1 was required to power the pumping system in a dual cathode tubular mfc zhang and he 2012 active aeration should be avoided due to the large energy consumption of air pump 37 76 of total energy recovery table 1 the energy consumption of low speed feeding pump is normally much lower than that of a high speed recirculation pump pfeeding precirculation zhang and he 2012 thus in the sec estimate energy consumption by feeding pumps becomes negligible and then eq 6 can be simplified to eq 11 where recirculation pumps control mfc energy consumption 11 p p u m p 2 p f e e d i n g p r e c i r c u l a t i o n p r e c i r c u l a t i o n although feeding pumps consume relatively low energy they could significantly affect ner sec by changing flow rate organic loading rate to better understand the effects of pumps e g feeding and recirculation on both ner and sec one continuously fed tubular mfc system from our previous study mfclab 1 in original study was selected for a more comprehensive analysis zhang et al 2013b under a fixed recirculation rate 300 ml min 1 fig 3 a the mfc power generation was in a positive correlation with the increase of feeding rate whereas a stable power consumption was observed fig 3a inset according to eqs 4 and 8 an elevated feeding rate q feeding could lead to notable drop of both nerv and secv consequently a relatively medium feeding rate resulted in a maximum nepv 1 2 ml min 1 fig 3a further evaluation of the effect of recirculation pumps was based on a fixed feeding rate of 1 2 ml min 1 fig 3b reducing recirculation resulted in a gradual decrease of mfc power generation but a more dramatic drop of power consumption eq 11 and fig 3b inset with a constant feeding rate q feeding both nerv and secv followed the trend of power generation and consumption leading to a maximum nepv 0 043 kwh m 3 under an intermediate recirculation rate of 150 ml min 1 fig 3b thus by adjusting both recirculation and feeding rates this tubular mfc system could generate 43 times more net energy i e nepv than that of the worst case i e a net output of 0 001 kwh m 3 under 300 ml min 1 recirculation and 0 6 ml min 1 feeding it should be noted that similar effects of pumps have been observed on nercod seccod and nepcod figs s1a and s1b supplementary materials the above pump nep analysis has provided solid evidence of the importance of pumping systems to energy performance of mfcs 4 hydrogen production an mec has the same anode mechanism as that of an mfc and is designed to produce value added products in its cathode through exerting a small external voltage zhang and angelidaki 2014 the exerted voltage 0 2 v serving as the bias between anode and cathode is significantly lower than the theoretical value for water splitting 1 23 v bockris et al 1985 hydrogen production is the major energy recovery approach in the mec cathode via continuous reduction of h electron acceptor specific hydrogen production rate in a unit of m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 has been adopted as an important performance parameter to evaluate mec hydrogen recovery capability we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 61 selected mec papers from 2005 to 2017 and found that the highest hydrogen production rate could reach 50 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 jeremiasse et al 2010 2011 although most mecs generated less than 5 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 fig 4 a no significant difference in hydrogen production p 0 10 was observed between bench scale mecs 3 03 8 84 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 vmec 1 l and liter scale mecs 0 94 2 32 h2 m 3 mec d 1 vmec 1 l however substrate composition was identified to be a key factor for hydrogen production short chain volatile fatty acids such as acetate could be easily utilized by exoelectrogens rendering a notably enhanced hydrogen yield of 3 71 9 42 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 higher than that from long chain organics e g glucose glycerol and sugar p 0 04 and low strength domestic wastewater p 0 01 fig 4b high strength industrial wastewaters from winery and food processing plants exhibited a comparable hydrogen yield to that of acetate 2 61 9 04 m3 h2 m 3 mec d 1 p 0 60 regarding the mec configuration single and double chamber mecs had similar hydrogen generation p 0 10 however double chamber mecs with membrane separation between the anode and the cathode are able to produce high purity hydrogen gas while the gas produced from single chamber mecs contains a significant portion of carbon dioxide and methane clauwaert and verstraete 2009 comparable hydrogen yield was obtained in double chamber mecs with anion exchange membrane aem as compared to that with cation exchange membrane cem p 0 12 or proton exchange membrane pem p 0 22 fig s2a cathode catalyst pt ni mo pd and carbon based catalysts can significantly boost hydrogen yield via lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction compared to non catalyzed electrodes fig s2b energy balance regarding hydrogen production in mecs has not been systematically evaluated in previous studies a few mec studies reported ner with a unit of kwh m 3 h2 or kwh kg 1 cod based on current literature bench scale mecs could achieve ner of 1 00 3 13 kwh kg 1 cod and require sec energy input of 0 80 2 83 kwh kg 1 cod to drive hydrogen evolution reaction table 2 treating high strength wastewater cod 1000 mg l 1 would have a large chance to render a positive nep and the highest nep of 3 80 kwh kg 1 cod was observed in an mec treating high strength industrial wastewater tenca et al 2013 although most mecs still require net energy input due to larger sec than ner table 2 this input is generally lower than that of conventional aerobic wastewater treatment 0 7 2 0 kwh kg 1 cod pant et al 2011 to achieve energy positive mecs ner must be enhanced with improved reactor design having a larger membrane surface area and an optimal anode to cathode ratio kim et al 2010 high performance catalyst to reduce reaction overpotential yuan and he 2017 and more reaction sites to lower activation and concentration overpotential e g porous or foam type of electrode with increased specific surface area rozendal et al 2010 reducing sec is equally important to overall nep enhancement for example via optimizing operational parameters such as external voltage and feeding recirculation pump it was reported that external power supply consumes a significant amount of energy on the system level 95 in the mec and the pumping system becomes a minor contributor to energy demand 5 zou et al 2017 utilizing alternative renewable power sources such as solar energy chae et al 2009 can be an attractive approach to reduce sec while driving hydrogen evolution reaction 5 nitrogen recovery nutrient recovery is deemed as a unique advantage of bes system comparing to other biological nutrient removal or membrane treatment processes colombo et al 2017 qin and he 2017 as the major form of nitrogen ammonium can reach several hundreds to thousands microgram per liter in high strength wastewater conventional biological nutrient removal e g nitrification denitrification and anammox focuses on eliminating ammonium from wastewater with consumption of a large amount of energy and chemicals and generation of excess biosolids recovery of ammonia from wastewater instead of removal has a potential to reduce energy consumption of the treatment processes and supply valuable nitrogen elements for agricultural or other practices kuntke et al 2012 ammonia loss was observed in a single chamber bes liu et al 2004 and this intrigued further investigation of ammonia recovery in double chamber bes which can separate ammonia from wastewater for further collection two major mechanisms has been revealed during ammonia separation in bes kim et al 2008 sleutels et al 2009 i e diffusion driven by concentration gradient across cem and migration induced by an electric field serving as proton shuttle cord ruwisch et al 2011 both of which are associated with current generation that creates an ph gradient ammonium diffusion was found to outcompete electrical migration in a bes under a moderate current density 1 a m 2 due to ph bias induced by electrochemical reactions liu et al 2016 to efficiently drive ammonia out of the catholyte i e a coupled stripping process use of the produced hydrogen gas or external aeration will be needed at a cost of energy consumption the ammonia recovery performance has been reported directly or indirectly in various parameters such as influent effluent ammonium concentrations and removal efficiency arredondo et al 2015 to better compare the performance among different studies specific ammonium recovery rate with a unit of kg n m 3 reactor d 1 was used in the present paper both mfcs and mecs have been employed to recover ammonia the mfc based recovery could achieve a recovery rate of 0 10 0 75 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 fig 5 a which is comparable to that of air stripping 0 10 0 76 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 maurer et al 2003 the mec based ammonia recovery exhibited a larger variation from 0 02 to 11 57 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 depending on applied voltage and wastewater type the highest ammonia recovery rate 11 57 kg n m 3 reactor d 1 was reported in a 140 ml mec system treating diluted urine which recovered 34 2 of the influent ammonia kuntke et al 2014 due to the limited number of selected studies and difference among those studies we cannot conclude any trend of recovery rate affected by either reactor size or initial ammonia concentration despite extensive studies of ammonia recovery in bes very few have constructed energy balance for ammonia recovery considering that gas stripping is widely used for ammonia separation from liquid phase in a catholyte a large portion of energy is invested to gas pump to facilitate this phase separation to balance energy investment and ammonia recovery rate an intermediate stripping rate i e cathode aeration rate should be preferred for example in a previous study over 90 of energy was consumed by external power supply and catholyte aeration qin et al 2017 fig 5b an optimized aeration rate of 100 ml min 1 could lower secnh4 n to 4 9 kwh kg 1 n with 41 energy to power air pump and 52 to drive external power supply further decrease in the catholyte aeration to 30 ml min 1 would lead to insufficient separation of ammonia from liquid phase rendering a much higher secnh4 n of 26 2 kwh kg 1 n fig 5b a moderate applied voltage would require less energy investment rendering a more energy efficient nitrogen recovery system in the abovementioned example secnh4 n was decreased from 6 7 kwh kg 1 at 0 8 v to 4 5 kwh kg 1 n at 0 5 v qin et al 2017 energy consumption may be compensated by using either direct electricity generation in mfcs or hydrogen biogas production in mecs for example the energy recovery of 13 7 kwh kg 1 n from the produced hydrogen gas could contribute to 94 5 of secnh4 n 14 5 kwh kg 1 n resulting in an nepnh4 n of 0 8 kwh kg 1 n wu and modin 2013 our literature review found that only six studies treating high strength wastewater cod 1000 mg l 1 table 3 reported nepnh4 n ranging from 0 8 to 8 5 kwh kg 1 n a negative nep indicated net energy investment to achieve ammonia reclamation in bes the average nepnh4 n of 3 6 2 8 kwh kg 1 n by bes is lower than that of haber bosch process 8 to 14 kwh kg 1 n erisman et al 2008 conventional nitrification denitrification 0 05 to 4 kwh kg 1 n or anammox process 6 to 12 kwh kg 1 n wang et al 2010 a trade off between elevated ammonia recovery rate and increased energy consumption in bes warrants further investigation 6 chemical production reducing carbon dioxide with the aid of bioelectricity generation to various value added organic chemicals such as formic acid acetate ethanol and butanol can be accomplished in microbial electrosynthesis system mes rabaey and rozendal 2010 nearly all of the current mes are bench scale proof of concept studies and have focused on biocathode design material bajracharya et al 2015 jourdin et al 2014 biofilm community dennis et al 2013 microbial pathway rosenbaum et al 2011 and initial economic analysis desloover et al 2012 elmekawy et al 2016 acetate was selected as a major end product in this review due to a larger number of literature available for energy analysis mes inoculated with acetogenic bacteria could have an acetate production rate normalized by cathode working volume ranging from 4 to 14632 g acetate m 3 cathode d 1 table 4 the highest acetate production was benefited from successful implementation of three dimensional hierarchical metal oxide carbon electrode cui et al 2017 thus far none of the mes studies has evaluated energy consumption external power supply is the sole energy consumer in bench scale mes while energy consumption by electrolyte mixing is hard to estimate at this moment to successfully convert co2 hco3 to acetate a theoretical cathode potential of 0 28 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she is required rabaey and rozendal 2010 and a practical cathode potential of 0 40 v vs she should be expected due to overpotential nevin et al 2010 the electric energy invested i e secacetate was estimated within the range of 2 5 7 0 kwh kg 1 acetate table 4 with a recent exception of less than 0 1 kwh kg 1 acetate cui et al 2017 if formic acid was selected as the end product comparable energy consumption could be expected 2 7 kwh kg 1 formic acid zhao et al 2012 meanwhile separation of these end products from the catholyte and operation of pumps both feeding and recirculation pumps would inevitably require extra energy investment in practical systems for example an energy input of 2 6 2 8 kwh kg 1 acetate or acetic acid could be expected by using conventional thermal driven separation process 10 35 wt acetate industrial data from de dietrich process systems the total secacetate in bench scale mes could be at least 3 0 kwh kg 1 acetate with over 85 energy consumed by separation much higher that required by industrial acetate production via carbonylation of methonal 1 65 kwh kg 1 acetate acetic acid neelis et al 2008 therefore chemical production via mes still requires substantial research effort on enhancing chemical production via optimizing microbial metabolism proposing better electrode design material to lower thermodynamic barrier and investigating desirable mes design towards enhanced overall process efficiency desloover et al 2012 7 water desalination since the first demonstration of microbial desalination in 2009 cao et al 2009 there has been much progress in researching and developing mdc technology saeed et al 2015 schroder et al 2015 recently european union horizon 2020 programme awarded 7 9 million euros to the microbial desalination mides project for examining the feasibility of mdcs while significantly lowering sec despite potentially good efficiency nearly 100 for seawater desalination 30 g l 1 nacl there still lack studies of using actual wastewater as an anode substrate jacobson et al 2011 in an effort of scaling up mdcs to a total volume of 105 l the total energy consumption secsalt for seawater desalination 35 g l 1 nacl was significantly reduced from 1 32 kwh kg 1 salt to 0 90 kwh kg 1 salt when an applied voltage increased from 0 v mfc mode to 1 2 v mec mode zhang and he 2015 this reduction was resulted from a much higher salt removal rate of 9 1 kg salt m 3 d 1 at 1 2 v compared to 3 7 kg salt m 3 d 1 at 0 v besides externally applied voltage pumping systems are a major energy consumer in mdcs the pumping related sec recirculation pump and brine feeding pump via desalination performance and general energy investment tendency were analyzed and discussed here recirculation pumps provide a mixing effect in mdc chambers and appropriate adjustment could significantly reduce energy consumption with minor influence on both desalination and energy generation performance in the abovementioned 105 l mdc system reducing cathode recirculation rate from 18 2 to 3 1 ml min 1 resulted in notable reduction of power consumption from 0 034 w to 0 012 w while maintaining a comparable salt removal rate of 0 031 0 034 kg salt h 1 rendering 62 reduction of secsalt from 1 0 kwh kg 1 to 0 38 kwh kg 1 fig 6 a zhang and he 2015 the salt loading rate in the desalination middle chamber of an mdc is affected by the feeding flow rate or hrt in a bench scale mdc treating brackish water a total dissolved solids of 1 6 g l 1 decreasing the salty water feeding rate from 0 13 ml min 1 0 8 d hrt to 0 015 ml min 1 6 9 d hrt boosted salt removal efficiency from 20 to 95 but this led to an increase of secsalt from 0 15 kwh kg 1 to 0 25 kwh kg 1 due to the decreased salt removal rate qsalt from 7 50 10 6 kg salt h 1 to 4 63 10 6 kg salt h 1 fig 6b ping et al 2015 this increase was due to a longer operating time to achieve target desalination efficiency at a lower qsalt while ptotal was relatively stable under different salty water feeding rates thus a higher feeding rate could be preferred due to a more desirable salt removal rate and less energy consumption i e secsalt to make mdc more energy efficient i e lower secsalt continuous desalination with enhanced hydrogen production may be considered it was reported in a previous study that 1 8 to 2 3 times more energy could be recovered as hydrogen gas than overall system consumption in an mdc fed with synthetic wastewater in anode acetate as carbon source luo et al 2010 mehanna et al 2010 despite relatively low energy consumption for desalination in mdcs the salt removal rate is also low taking both of those factors into consideration may help identify potential applications of mdcs for example desalination of brackish water or acting as a pre desalination unit for conventional desalination systems 8 conclusions in this review energy performance of bes with various functions was systematically analyzed and discussed with the following conclusions energy balance of mfcs is mostly negative due to more energy consumption than recovery the sec of an mfc is mainly due to mixing using hydraulic recirculation by pumps or stirrers and substrate supply e g anode feeding and cathode oxygen aeration or supply energy balance of mecs could be positive because of higher value of the produced hydrogen gas external power supply consumes a significant amount of energy on the system level 95 in an mec and the pumping system is a minor contributor 5 high strength wastewater such as food beverage wastewater benefits hydrogen production and can lead to an energy positive mec ammonia recovery via bes has a potential to be an energy efficient approach to produce nitrogen elements for agricultural or other practices a large amount of energy is invested to gas pump to facilitate phase separation net energy investment was required for ammonia with a nepnh4 n ranging from 0 8 to 8 5 kwh kg 1 n although microbial electrosynthesis could be attractive the total secacetate in bench scale mes would be at least 3 0 kwh kg 1 acetate with over 85 of energy consumed by separation higher than that required by industrial acetate production via carbonylation of methanol 1 65 kwh kg 1 acetate acetic acid mdcs with applied voltage can have better desalination performance and lower total energy consumption adjustment of recirculation pumps could significantly reduce energy consumption with minor influence on desalination a higher feeding rate of salty water to the desalination chamber results in a higher salt removal rate and less energy consumption although the data analysis here was limited by the availability of sufficient energy information in literature this work still represents an initial step forward to reveal a picture of energy performance of bes encouraging future exergy analysis to unveil net energy available to be used on the system level significant efforts are still required to improve net energy production in bes with respect to all functions and potential benefits of low energy consumption in bes should be recognized a more precise assessment of energy performance requires system scaling up which will also facilitate the analysis operating and capital cost

19767,lactic acid is one of the emerging top biomass derived platform chemicals that can be fermented from organic wastes this study evaluated the potential of cathodic electro fermentation cef as a novel approach to enhance the yield of high optical activity oa of l lactic acid from organic wastes using mixed microbial consortium the fermentation process was stimulated through the cathode applied with 100 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode she which contributed to 4 73 times higher lactic acid productivity 0 6578 g l 1 h 1 compared to that in the open circuit control 0 1392 g l 1 h 1 and an improved oa of l lactic acid was also observed 42 3 vs 3 6 of the open circuit control the study elucidated that the optimal voltage at 100 mv promoted the conversion of pyruvate to l lactate by 77 9 compared to the blank which triggered the generation of l lactic acid to occur rapidly even at low concentration of pyruvate the significant variation of microbial community in family and genus level distributions were observed in cef system furthermore the open circuit operation test demonstrated that the cathode providing in situ electron supply was essential to achieve high efficient bioconversion of organic wastes to lactic acid our work highlights the feasibility of cef to steer high value added fermentation products deriving from organic wastes by the mixed microbial consortium graphical abstract image 1 keywords cathodic electro fermentation lactic acid food waste waste activated sludge mixed microbial consortium 1 introduction to mitigate the global fossil fuel crisis and the unprecedented increase of organic waste pollution bio valorization organic waste stream to high value added chemicals have received significant attention due to the next generation of biofuels and bioplastics being developed in recent years angenent et al 2016 balch et al 2017 lin et al 2013 lactic acid as one of the versatile platform molecules is widely used in food industry medicine animal husbandry and global chemical industries especially high optical activity oa of l or d lactic acid plays a larger role in enhancing the intrinsic value for a better use lunt 1998 chemical synthesis of lactic acid only generates the racemic mixture whereas the microbial fermentation can be used to produce high oa isomers glaser and venus 2017 generally anaerobic fermentation of organic waste is composed of metabolic reactions and its product spectrum also varied tamis et al 2015 although inoculations of the specific or gene engineered lactic acid strain are the commonly strategy to obtain the optical pure isomer baek et al 2016 lee et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 they are nonetheless complex and economically unfavorable coming with maintenance and sterilization how to improve the yield and oa of lactic acid from organic wastes in relation to the mixed cultures is still a challenge at present the main efforts have focused on the control of fermentation parameters like ph akao et al 2007 koutinas et al 2014 li et al 2015 temperature zhang et al 2017 loading rate li et al 2016 microbial inoculums nakasaki et al 2009 and fermentation time li et al 2014 nevertheless despite of the above intense studies the electron flux involved in the metabolic shift to the intracellular redox balance is another poorly understood aspect of this emerging mixed culture biotechnology indeed lactic acid bio converted from organic wastes corresponds to a cascade of oxidation and reduction bioreaction our previous study enhanced the oa of d lactic acid by providing external zero valent iron zvi to the fermentation system and it indicated that the electron supplied from zvi resulted in the variation of extracellular oxidation reduction potential orp li et al 2017 it was reported that the extracellular orp could influence the crucial intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh nad redox balance choi et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 moreover nadh was prerequisite for the metabolism of pyruvate to lactate reaction due to pyruvate nadh h lactate nad thus it could be speculated that the electron supply to the mixed microbial consortium might influence the production of lactic acid from organic wastes recently electro fermentation ef as a novel bioelectrochemical system bes which controlled microbial fermentation with an electrode either electron sinks anode or sources cathode normally led to the stoichiometric conversion of pure substrates into 1 3 propanediol ethanol and i butyrate moscoviz et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2013 moreover the electrical current supply favored the reductive process by enhancing the ability of cells to regenerate nadh rabaey and rozendal 2010 therefore it is essential to identify how the electron sources cathode affects lactic acid fermentation system nevertheless little is known about the cathodic electro fermentation cef for high oa of lactate production from organic wastes by using the mixed culture biotechnology therefore in this study we aim to enhance the efficiency and yield of lactic acid with high oa of l isomer through cef the metabolic pathway in each step involved in lactic acid production was illuminated moreover the crucial conversion of lactate from pyruvate and isomerization was discussed finally the microbial community structure shift was investigated and the response of electron supply on lactic acid production was unclosed through the open circuit operation test 2 method and material 2 1 waste activated sludge and food waste the waste activated sludge was used in

graphite rods φ10 mm 100 mm the saturated salt bridge that filled with agar containing saturated potassium chloride solution was used to connect the fermentation reactor left and the buffer chamber right the buffer chamber contained potassium chloride solution corrected to ph 7 0 with hydrochloric acid the fermentation reactor could be supplied with either negative voltage by the cathode named as r nv fig 1 or positive voltage by the anode named as r pv fig s1 the fermentation reactor in the left was controlled with a saturated ag agcl reference electrode assumed 197 mv vs she at 25 c which

investigate the effect of fermentation temperature 25 c t25 35 c t35 and 50 c t50 on lactic acid production which were applied with 300 mv negative voltage without ph control meanwhile three corresponding blank groups without the external voltage were operated at 25 c bt25 35 c bt35 and 50 c bt50 without ph control likewise in table 1b four identical r nvs applied with 300 mv were used to optimize the fermentative ph no control phnc 7 ph7 9 ph9 and 11 ph11 at 50 c whereas the blank groups without the external voltage were conducted with ph control at 7 bp7 9 bp9 and 11 bp11 the ph

according to the optimal results from table 1a and 1b the supernatant of the fermentation mixture was obtained every 24 h by the centrifugation process and was stored at a temperature of 4 c after passing through the 22 μm pore filter the samples were taken to assay soluble carbohydrates pyruvate protein nh4 n volatile fatty acid vfa soluble orthophosphate sop l lactic acid and d lactic acid 2 4 mimic batch fermentation of lactic acid from external added pyruvate and isomerization test via electron supply the mimic batch fermentation was conducted to investigate the influence of cathode on the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and isomerization of lactate first two fermentation reactors were operated at the same process as described in v 100 r v and blank r b respectively after 48 h the wash procedure was applied as follow fermentation broths from r v and r b were centrifuged 6000 rpm 10 min and the supernatants containing soluble fermentative substrate were decanted the residual sediments were resuspended using tris hydrochloric acid 0 05 mol l ph 7 20 25 c and centrifuged again which were repeated three times to prevent the interference of indigenous fermentative substrate on the mimic batch fermentation after the wash procedure the sediments from r v and r b were resuspended and then provided with 10 g l pyruvic acid named as test p and ctrl p another sediment equivalent from r v and r b were provided with 10 g l d lactic acid and named as test d and ctrl d with 10 g l l lactic acid and named as test l and ctrl l respectively it should be noted that the test groups test p test d and test l were applied with 100 mv potential and the control groups ctrl p ctrl d and ctrl l were not supplied with the external voltage w blank without provision of the

ncbi short read archive sra database under the accession number srr599081 599085 2 6 lactic acid production driving by short term cef followed by the open circuit operation two fermentation reactors were operated in parallels as described in v 100 after 24 h one of the reactors r o opened the circuit to eliminate the stimuli of the external voltage i e open circuit operation another one r c was continuously supplied with 100 mv potential in a closed circuit two fermentation reactors were both conducted till to 120 h the supernatants were obtained accordingly every 24 h and stored as mentioned above the samples were taken to assay the contents of l lactic acid and d lactic acid 2 7 analytical techniques l and d lactic acids were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc ultimate 3000 with astec clc d 5 μm 15 cm 4 6 mm column at 25 c a 5 mm copper sulfate solution was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min and was detected at 254 nm uv wavelength the analyze method of vss tss nh4 n soluble orthophosphate sop pyruvic acid and vfa were detailed in supplementary information the analyses of scod soluble carbohydrate and protein were described in the previous publications li et al 2015 and the analyses of α glucosidase and protease were recorded in the literature goel et al 1998 2 8 calculation the optical activity oa of l lactic acid was defined as enantiomeric excess value according to the following equation eq 1 1 o a l d l d where l and d were the concentration of l and d lactic acid respectively the nernst equation for an electrochemical

temperature and ph are the crucial fermentative parameters fig 2 elaborated the optimization of temperature and ph for lactic acid production applied with cathode as shown in fig 2a the performance of r nvs operated without ph control was similar compared to that of blanks only a slight increase of lactic acid 9 57 g l was observed at t50 in r nv while lactic acid was rapidly consumed up at t35 time course was detailed in fig s2 however the oa of l lactic acid was the lowest at t50 and its ph was around 3 5 to 4 0 in the acid range fig s3 in the literature oa of l lactic acid was observed enhanced if ph was adjusted to alkaline condition li et al 2015 therefore fig 2b denoted the effect of ph adjustment on lactic acid production in r nvs the highest lactic acid production 21 63 g l was observed at ph7 in r nv with oa of 22 5 while the fermentative time required to reach the maximal concentration of lactic acid was 2 d earlier than that of ph9 time course was detailed in fig s4 although high optical activity of l lactic acid 95 could be achieved at bp9 the maximal concentration of lactic acid was only 8 59 g l obtained at 4 d this was due that l lactate producing enzymes showed higher adaptability to alkaline than those of d lactate li et al 2015 desguin et al 2014 however extremely alkaline fermentation ph11 totally suppressed lactic acid production which was in good agreement with the previous study zhang et al 2017 therefore the optimal fermentative parameters applied with the cathode for lactic acid production was ph 7 at 50 c 3 2 effects of different applied voltages on lactic acid production fig 3 a explained the maximal concentration of total lactic acid via applying different external voltages compared to blank 14 62 g l without voltage applied production of lactic acid was increased in v 800 20 67 g l v 600 31 20 g l v 0 29 84 g l v 100 32 70 g l and v 300 21 63 g l whereas v 100 showed the highest oa of 42 3 fig 3b exhibited the total lactic acid productivity g l 1 h 1 of v 0 0 4543 v 100 0 6578 v 300 0 4317 and v 500 0 2695 was significantly improved compared to that of blank 0 1392 fig 3c and k profiled the time course of lactic acid production indicating that the fermentation time to reach the maximal concentration was shortened in v 100 48 h compared to that of blank 96 h therefore the optimum voltage for total lactic acid generation with high oa of l isomer was 100 mv in the literature most of the electrically assisted digesters were conducted using bioanode at 800 1200 mv to produce methane and the cathode normally produced hydrogen asztalos and kim 2015 montpart et al 2015 villano et al 2017 however in the present study it was difficult to obtain a satisfying lactic acid productivity using anode electro fermentation r pv to date our study is the first attempt to achieve high efficient lactic acid production with low potential applied of cathode voltage with the mixed cultured fermentation the appropriate potential in negative was clearly beneficial to increase the production of lactic acid and further development is required to prevent the consumption of lactic acid in cef 3 3 metabolism pathway of lactic acid production intrinsically the generation of lactic acid from organic wastes fermentation consists of several microbial metabolism steps described in fig s5 including solubilization hydrolysis and acidification stage maspolim et al 2016 tamis et al 2015 first fermentative substrate could only be used by microorganism when the solid matter was solubilized to the liquid phase fig 4 a illuminated that the initial vss of all fermentation reactors were around 42 0 1 3 g l after 72 h of fermentation the remained vss g l were only 12 7 v 0 13 5 v 100 13 5 v 300 and 14 2 v 500 showing no significant difference table s2 p value 05 compared to that of blank 12 51 g l the similar scod concentration table s3 p value 05 was also observed which indicated the solubilization in all tests showed almost the same level in the hydrolysis stage polysaccharide and protein are converted to small molecules like monosaccharide and amino acid li et al 2015 it is worthwhile noting that in fig 4b the concentration of soluble carbohydrates increased rapidly to the maximal level in the first 24 h but decreased fast subsequently obviously the maximal concentration of soluble carbohydrates was 28 0 g l in the blank whereas in the reactors applied with negative voltage r nvs the maximal concentration of soluble carbohydrates g l was only 19 4 v 0 18 7 v 100 17 0 v 300 18 1 v 500 respectively in r nvs the activity of α glucosidase table s4 protease table s5 the variation of nh4 n fig s6 sop fig s7 and protein fig s8 all exhibited the similar concentration compare to those of blank indicating that the external voltage has no impact on the hydrolysis stage it could be thus speculated that a rapid consumption of soluble carbohydrate might occur in r nvs compared to the blank in the glycolysis stage monosaccharide was converted to a crucial intermediate metabolite pyruvate as seen in fig 4c the maximal concentration of pyruvic acid in the blank was still 77 6 higher than those of r nvs it might be due to that the pyruvate degradation normally occurred faster than pyruvate generation fernandez et al 2008 in the acidification stage pyruvate was converted to lactic acid and vfa meanwhile lactic acid could be further consumed to vfa via the reversed β oxidation during the organic waste fermentation li et al 2014 from fig 4d there was no significant difference in the concentration and composition of vfa from both r nvs and the blank table s6 p value 05 which ratified that the fermentation applied with the cathode could affect the metabolic step of pyruvate to lactic acid 3 4 lactate generation and isomerization catalyzed by electron supply since pathway of pyruvate to lactate was strengthened in cef it is essential to illustrate the impact of negative potential on pyruvate conversion to either l or d lactate fig 5 a showed that the mimic batch fermentation of lactic acid by externally providing pyruvate as the sole substrate in the w blank without provision of voltage and pyruvate no lactic acid was observed which indicated that the mimic batch fermentation test was acceptable without the interference of the indigenous substrate from the original organic wastes the concentration of l lactic acid from test p adding 10 g l pyruvate and potential 100 mv reached 453 9 mg l was 77 9 higher than that from ctrl p adding 10 g l pyruvate reached 255 1 mg l at 18 h whereas the concentrations of d lactic acid from test p and ctrl p were similar which led to a higher oa of l lactic acid test p 57 5 ctrl p 38 5 this mimic batch fermentation indicated that pyruvate was more likely to be converted to l lactic acid in the reducing environment alternatively isomerization pathway provides the mutual conversion of d lactate to l lactate and vice versa for example l lactate could be converted to d lactate using the anode electrochemical regeneration of nad but cathode reduction of pyruvate biade et al 1992 in the current study from fig 5b and c no additional l lactate nor d lactate was observed in the mimic batch fermentation which indicated that the isomerization of lactic acid might not be affected by the cathode from the literature although the isomerization process of l lactate to d lactate was observed in parallel with iron electron transfer φfe3 fe2 0 77 v through proper zvi dosage l lactate was dominant without any isomerization process to d lactate when zvi was overdosed li et al 2017 the above results indicated that conversion of pyruvate to l lactate was the essential metabolic step affected by cef system understanding the electron supply in catalyzing l lactate generation from pyruvate is imperative in this study thus table 2 exhibited the relationship between the maximal l lactate production velocity η lmax against substrate pyruvate concentration γ p and the corresponding fermentation time t which was depicted in fig s9 analogous to michaelis menten curves the highest η lmax 5 5 mmh 1 was observed in v 100 with the lowest γ p 0 2 mm and shortest fermentation time 24 h according to the enzyme inhibition theory noncompetitive inhibition eq s5 in supplementary information occurred in v 0 compared to v 100 due to the decline of η lmax to 4 0 mmh 1 competitive inhibition eq s4 was observed in v 500 compared to v 300 due to the similar η lmax 3 1 vs 3 4 mmh 1 but an increase of k m fig s9 anti competitive inhibition eq s6 might happen in the blank due to the increase of k m and decrease of η lmax the results suggested that the optimal voltage at 100 mv promoted the reaction activity and triggered the generation of l lactic acid to rapidly occur even at low concentration of pyruvate in the literature fermentation with open circuit condition showed catalytic limitations resulting from the cellular regulation occurred in the classical mixed culture fermentation moscoviz et al 2016 therefore proper supplementary of electron promoted the catalytic efficiency of metabolic steps 3 5 microbial community shifted by applied voltage the addition of electron through the cef brought about a reductive niche which possibly resulted in community shift and change of bacterial abundances it was elucidated through metagenomics sequencing via illumina miseq 16s rdna genes technology the sequencing depth was adequate to fully characterize the bacterial communities with infinite sampling at the distance of 3 when the number of bacterial sequence sample was up to 32 600 the richness estimators such as chao1 and ace table s7 revealed that the bacterial richness exhibited the greatest in v 500 whereas the highest bacterial diversity was observed in v 300 the selection of bacterial population could be affected by the negative voltage which was also demonstrated through the comparison of venn diagram fig s10 and heatmap fig s11 fig 6 elaborated the microbial distribution in 5 succeeding levels of classification from taxonomic hierarchy phylum class order family and genus obviously the distribution in phylum class and order in r nvs and the blank showed similar results detailed in table s8 for example the predominant phylum level distribution in firmicutes were 97 4 in blank 95 5 in v 0 93 6 in v 100 97 4 in v 300 and 95 5 in v 500 and proteobacteria were 2 2 in blank 3 0 in v 0 3 4 in v 100 1 9 in v 300 and 3 5 in v 500 variation of microbial communities in family and genus level distribution from r nvs and blank were observed for example caldicoprobacter 24 8 and clostridium 13 3 were the main genus that associated with lactic acid production in blank differences in genus level distribution related to lactic acid production were discovered in v 0 enterococcus 5 1 and caldicoprobacter 3 8 v 100 caldicoprobacter 7 0 and lactobacillus 6 8 v 300 caldicoprobacter 14 0 and clostridium 6 1 and v 500 sporanaerobacter 27 1 and tepidimicrobium 35 8 which were beneficial for lactic acid production kim et al 2016 tao et al 2014 although microbial structure in genus level shifted due to the cathode it is still unknown whether the change in cathodic electrode associated microbial communities lead to the differences in product outcomes in the literature it is possible that the in situ electron supply via cathode could directly accepted by microorganisms van eerten jansen et al 2013 therefore it might impact the redox pair homeostasis for lactic acid generation in the cellular metabolism to demonstrate this assumption the following open circuit operation test was carried out 3 6 open circuit operation test of lactic acid production driving by short term cef within the first 24 h both reactors were applied with cathode in parallel i e the close circuit operation fig 7 revealed that the fermentation results were similar at that time however after 24 h the stimuli of cathode were eliminated for open circuit operation in r o and the accumulation of lactic acid was ceased at 8 85 g l and started to decline at 96 h in contrast the concentration of lactic acid in r c continuously improved to 20 42 g l of l lactic acid at 48 h and 9 57 g l of d lactic acid at 72 h it seemed that the cathode offered an opportunity for in situ electron supply to guarantee the enhancement of lactate generation direct electron transfer from the cathode to microorganisms for fatty acids production had been demonstrated nevin et al 2010 also microorganism can use a wide range of electron donors and acceptors to generate energy for metabolism moscoviz et al 2016 lactic acid was likely accumulated due to the reaction pyruvate e lactate φ pyruvate lactate 0 19 v and nad 2h 2e nadh h φ nad nadh 0 32 v redox potentials are used to characterize the free energy cost and direction of reactions involving electron transfer in this study the employment of external cathode unbalanced the chemical equilibrium resulting in greater accumulation of nadh thus e red for redox pair of nad nadh was higher in r c than that in r o without external voltage supply which increased lactate production in this study moreover it was reported that the transcriptions of some metabolic enzymes were impacted by alteration of intracellular nadh nad ratio which led to the variation of product concentration villano et al 2017 wang et al 2008 similarly unbalanced nadh nad ratio resulting from electricity driven fermentation exerted a stronger impact on metabolic shift than merely dissipating the extra supply of electron donors choi et al 2014 it should be noted that the electricity driven fermentation of lactic acid from organic wastes had not been discovered until we demonstrated it in the current study however identifying the relationship between electrochemical and microbiological actions in cef and elucidating how cef in principle associated with the transformation of substrate into lactic acid would be an interesting topic for further work 4 conclusion cef from organic waste significantly improved lactic acid productivity and the oa of l lactic acid electron donation promoted the conversion from pyruvic acid to lactic acid especially l lactic acid differences of family and genus level in microbial community had been observed the cathode in the cef providing in situ electron supply guaranteed the enhancement of lactate generation from organic wastes acknowledgements this work was supported by

19767,lactic acid is one of the emerging top biomass derived platform chemicals that can be fermented from organic wastes this study evaluated the potential of cathodic electro fermentation cef as a novel approach to enhance the yield of high optical activity oa of l lactic acid from organic wastes using mixed microbial consortium the fermentation process was stimulated through the cathode applied with 100 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode she which contributed to 4 73 times higher lactic acid productivity 0 6578 g l 1 h 1 compared to that in the open circuit control 0 1392 g l 1 h 1 and an improved oa of l lactic acid was also observed 42 3 vs 3 6 of the open circuit control the study elucidated that the optimal voltage at 100 mv promoted the conversion of pyruvate to l lactate by 77 9 compared to the blank which triggered the generation of l lactic acid to occur rapidly even at low concentration of pyruvate the significant variation of microbial community in family and genus level distributions were observed in cef system furthermore the open circuit operation test demonstrated that the cathode providing in situ electron supply was essential to achieve high efficient bioconversion of organic wastes to lactic acid our work highlights the feasibility of cef to steer high value added fermentation products deriving from organic wastes by the mixed microbial consortium graphical abstract image 1 keywords cathodic electro fermentation lactic acid food waste waste activated sludge mixed microbial consortium 1 introduction to mitigate the global fossil fuel crisis and the unprecedented increase of organic waste pollution bio valorization organic waste stream to high value added chemicals have received significant attention due to the next generation of biofuels and bioplastics being developed in recent years angenent et al 2016 balch et al 2017 lin et al 2013 lactic acid as one of the versatile platform molecules is widely used in food industry medicine animal husbandry and global chemical industries especially high optical activity oa of l or d lactic acid plays a larger role in enhancing the intrinsic value for a better use lunt 1998 chemical synthesis of lactic acid only generates the racemic mixture whereas the microbial fermentation can be used to produce high oa isomers glaser and venus 2017 generally anaerobic fermentation of organic waste is composed of metabolic reactions and its product spectrum also varied tamis et al 2015 although inoculations of the specific or gene engineered lactic acid strain are the commonly strategy to obtain the optical pure isomer baek et al 2016 lee et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 they are nonetheless complex and economically unfavorable coming with maintenance and sterilization how to improve the yield and oa of lactic acid from organic wastes in relation to the mixed cultures is still a challenge at present the main efforts have focused on the control of fermentation parameters like ph akao et al 2007 koutinas et al 2014 li et al 2015 temperature zhang et al 2017 loading rate li et al 2016 microbial inoculums nakasaki et al 2009 and fermentation time li et al 2014 nevertheless despite of the above intense studies the electron flux involved in the metabolic shift to the intracellular redox balance is another poorly understood aspect of this emerging mixed culture biotechnology indeed lactic acid bio converted from organic wastes corresponds to a cascade of oxidation and reduction bioreaction our previous study enhanced the oa of d lactic acid by providing external zero valent iron zvi to the fermentation system and it indicated that the electron supplied from zvi resulted in the variation of extracellular oxidation reduction potential orp li et al 2017 it was reported that the extracellular orp could influence the crucial intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh nad redox balance choi et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 moreover nadh was prerequisite for the metabolism of pyruvate to lactate reaction due to pyruvate nadh h lactate nad thus it could be speculated that the electron supply to the mixed microbial consortium might influence the production of lactic acid from organic wastes recently electro fermentation ef as a novel bioelectrochemical system bes which controlled microbial fermentation with an electrode either electron sinks anode or sources cathode normally led to the stoichiometric conversion of pure substrates into 1 3 propanediol ethanol and i butyrate moscoviz et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2013 moreover the electrical current supply favored the reductive process by enhancing the ability of cells to regenerate nadh rabaey and rozendal 2010 therefore it is essential to identify how the electron sources cathode affects lactic acid fermentation system nevertheless little is known about the cathodic electro fermentation cef for high oa of lactate production from organic wastes by using the mixed culture biotechnology therefore in this study we aim to enhance the efficiency and yield of lactic acid with high oa of l isomer through cef the metabolic pathway in each step involved in lactic acid production was illuminated moreover the crucial conversion of lactate from pyruvate and isomerization was discussed finally the microbial community structure shift was investigated and the response of electron supply on lactic acid production was unclosed through the open circuit operation test 2 method and material 2 1 waste activated sludge and food waste the waste activated sludge was used in

working volume of 800 ml each were modified according to the literature asztalos and kim 2015 wagner et al 2009 zhang and angelidaki 2014 the anode and cathode electrodes were made from cylindrical graphite rods φ10 mm 100 mm the saturated salt bridge that filled with agar containing saturated potassium chloride solution was used to connect the fermentation reactor left and the buffer chamber right the buffer chamber contained potassium chloride solution corrected to ph 7 0 with hydrochloric acid the fermentation reactor could be supplied with either negative voltage by the cathode named as r nv fig 1 or positive voltage by the anode named as r pv fig s1 the fermentation reactor in the left was controlled with a saturated ag agcl reference electrode assumed 197 mv vs she at 25 c which was placed close to the cathode in r nv or the anode in r pv 2 3 optimization of lactic acid fermentation applied with the external voltage table 1 a shows three identical r nvs that were employed to investigate the effect of fermentation temperature 25 c t25 35 c t35 and 50 c t50 on lactic acid production which were applied with 300 mv negative voltage without ph control meanwhile three corresponding blank groups without the external voltage were operated at 25 c bt25 35 c bt35 and 50 c bt50 without ph control likewise in table 1b four identical r nvs applied with 300 mv were used to

wash procedure was applied as follow fermentation broths from r v and r b were centrifuged 6000 rpm 10 min and the supernatants containing soluble fermentative substrate were decanted the residual sediments were resuspended using tris hydrochloric acid 0 05 mol l ph 7 20 25 c and centrifuged again which were repeated three times to prevent the interference of indigenous fermentative substrate

time course was detailed in fig s2 however the oa of l lactic acid was the lowest at t50 and its ph was around 3 5 to 4 0 in the acid range fig s3 in the literature oa of l lactic acid was observed enhanced if ph was adjusted to alkaline condition li et al 2015 therefore fig 2b denoted the effect of ph adjustment on lactic acid production in r nvs the highest lactic acid production 21 63 g l was observed at ph7 in r nv with oa of 22 5 while the fermentative time required to reach the maximal concentration of lactic acid was 2 d earlier than that of ph9 time course was detailed in fig s4 although high optical activity of l lactic acid 95 could be achieved at bp9 the maximal concentration of lactic acid was only 8 59 g l obtained at 4 d this was due that l lactate producing enzymes showed higher adaptability to alkaline than those of d lactate li et al 2015 desguin et al 2014 however extremely alkaline fermentation ph11 totally suppressed lactic acid production which was in good agreement with the previous study zhang et al 2017 therefore the optimal fermentative parameters applied with the cathode for lactic acid production was ph 7 at 50 c 3 2 effects of different applied

generation with high oa of l isomer was 100 mv in the literature most of the electrically assisted digesters were conducted using bioanode at 800 1200 mv to produce methane and the cathode normally produced hydrogen asztalos and kim 2015 montpart et al 2015 villano et al 2017 however in the present study it was difficult to obtain a satisfying lactic acid productivity using anode electro fermentation r pv to date our study is the first attempt to achieve high efficient lactic acid production with low potential applied of cathode voltage with the mixed cultured fermentation the appropriate potential in negative was clearly beneficial to increase the production of lactic acid and further development is required to prevent the consumption of lactic acid in cef 3 3 metabolism pathway of lactic acid production intrinsically the generation of lactic acid from organic wastes fermentation consists of several microbial metabolism steps described in fig s5 including solubilization hydrolysis and acidification stage maspolim et al 2016 tamis et al 2015 first fermentative substrate could only be used by microorganism when the solid matter was solubilized to the liquid phase fig 4 a illuminated that the initial vss of all fermentation reactors were around 42 0 1 3 g l after 72 h of fermentation the remained vss g l were only 12 7 v 0 13 5 v 100 13 5 v 300 and 14 2 v 500 showing no significant difference table s2 p value 05 compared to that of blank 12 51 g l the similar scod concentration table s3 p value 05 was also observed which indicated the solubilization in all tests showed almost the same level in the hydrolysis stage polysaccharide and protein are converted to small molecules like monosaccharide and amino acid li et al 2015 it is worthwhile noting that in fig 4b the concentration of soluble carbohydrates increased rapidly to the maximal level in the first 24 h but decreased fast subsequently obviously the maximal concentration of soluble carbohydrates was 28 0 g l in the blank whereas in the reactors applied with negative voltage r nvs the maximal concentration of soluble carbohydrates g l was only 19 4 v 0 18 7 v 100 17 0 v 300 18 1 v 500 respectively in r nvs the activity of α glucosidase table s4 protease table s5 the variation of nh4 n fig s6 sop fig s7 and protein fig s8 all exhibited the similar concentration compare to those of blank indicating that the external voltage has no impact on the hydrolysis stage it could be thus speculated that a rapid consumption of soluble carbohydrate might occur in r nvs compared to the blank in the glycolysis stage monosaccharide was converted to a crucial intermediate metabolite pyruvate as seen in fig 4c the maximal concentration of pyruvic acid in the blank was still 77 6 higher than those of r nvs it might be due to that the pyruvate degradation normally occurred faster than pyruvate generation fernandez et al 2008 in the acidification stage pyruvate was converted to lactic acid and vfa meanwhile lactic acid could be further consumed to vfa via the reversed β oxidation during the organic waste fermentation li et al 2014 from fig 4d there was no significant difference in the concentration and composition of vfa from both r nvs and the blank table s6 p value 05 which ratified that the fermentation applied with the cathode could affect the metabolic step of pyruvate to lactic acid 3 4 lactate generation and isomerization catalyzed by electron supply since pathway of pyruvate to lactate was strengthened in cef it is essential to illustrate the impact of negative potential on pyruvate conversion to either l or d lactate fig 5 a showed that the mimic batch fermentation of lactic acid by externally providing pyruvate as the sole substrate in the w blank without provision of voltage and pyruvate no lactic acid was observed which indicated that the mimic batch fermentation test was acceptable without the interference of the indigenous substrate from the original organic wastes the concentration of l lactic acid from test p adding 10 g l pyruvate and potential 100 mv reached 453 9 mg l was 77 9 higher than that from ctrl p adding 10 g l pyruvate reached 255 1 mg l at 18 h whereas the concentrations of d lactic acid from test p and ctrl p were similar which led to a higher oa of l lactic acid test p 57 5 ctrl p 38 5 this mimic batch fermentation indicated that pyruvate was more likely to be converted to l lactic acid in the reducing environment alternatively isomerization pathway provides the mutual conversion of d lactate to l lactate and vice versa for example l lactate could be converted to d lactate using the anode electrochemical regeneration of nad but cathode reduction of pyruvate biade et al 1992 in the current study from fig 5b and c no additional l lactate nor d lactate was observed in the mimic batch fermentation which indicated that the isomerization of lactic acid might not be affected by the cathode from the literature although the isomerization process of l lactate to d lactate was observed in parallel with iron electron transfer φfe3 fe2 0 77 v through proper zvi dosage l lactate was dominant without any isomerization process to d lactate when zvi was overdosed li et al 2017 the above results indicated that conversion of pyruvate to l lactate was the essential metabolic step affected by cef system understanding the electron supply in catalyzing l lactate generation from pyruvate is imperative in this study thus table 2 exhibited the relationship between the maximal l lactate production velocity η lmax against substrate pyruvate concentration γ p and the corresponding fermentation time t which was depicted in fig s9 analogous to michaelis menten curves the highest η lmax 5 5 mmh 1 was observed in v 100 with the lowest γ p 0 2 mm and shortest fermentation time 24 h according to the enzyme inhibition theory noncompetitive inhibition eq s5 in supplementary information occurred in v 0 compared to v 100 due to the decline of η lmax to 4 0 mmh 1 competitive inhibition eq s4 was observed in v 500 compared to v 300 due to the similar η lmax 3 1 vs 3 4 mmh 1 but an increase of k m fig s9 anti competitive inhibition eq s6 might happen in the blank due to the increase of k m and decrease of η lmax the results suggested that the optimal voltage at 100 mv promoted the reaction activity and triggered the generation of l lactic acid to rapidly occur even at low concentration of pyruvate in the literature fermentation with open circuit condition showed catalytic limitations resulting from the cellular regulation occurred in the classical mixed culture fermentation moscoviz et al 2016 therefore proper supplementary of electron promoted the catalytic efficiency of metabolic steps 3 5 microbial community shifted by applied voltage the addition of electron through the cef brought about a reductive niche which possibly resulted in community shift and change of bacterial abundances it was elucidated through metagenomics sequencing via illumina miseq 16s rdna genes technology the sequencing depth was adequate to fully characterize the bacterial communities with infinite sampling at the distance of 3 when the number of bacterial sequence sample was up to 32 600 the richness estimators such as chao1 and ace table s7 revealed that the bacterial richness exhibited the greatest in v 500 whereas the highest bacterial diversity was observed in v 300 the selection of bacterial population could be affected by the negative voltage which was also demonstrated through the comparison of venn diagram fig s10 and heatmap fig s11 fig 6 elaborated the microbial distribution in 5 succeeding levels of classification from taxonomic hierarchy phylum class order family and genus obviously the distribution in phylum class and order in r nvs and the blank showed similar results detailed in table s8 for example the predominant phylum level distribution in firmicutes were 97 4 in blank 95 5 in v 0 93 6 in v 100 97 4 in v 300 and 95 5 in v 500 and proteobacteria were 2 2 in blank 3 0 in v 0 3 4 in v 100 1 9 in v 300 and 3 5 in v 500 variation of microbial communities in family and genus level distribution from r nvs and blank were observed for example caldicoprobacter 24 8 and clostridium 13 3 were the main genus that associated with lactic acid production in blank differences in genus level distribution related to lactic acid production were discovered in v 0 enterococcus 5 1 and caldicoprobacter 3 8 v 100 caldicoprobacter 7 0 and lactobacillus 6 8 v 300 caldicoprobacter 14 0 and clostridium 6 1 and v 500 sporanaerobacter 27 1 and tepidimicrobium 35 8 which were beneficial for lactic acid production kim et al 2016 tao et al 2014 although microbial structure in genus level shifted due to the cathode it is still unknown whether the change in cathodic electrode associated microbial communities lead to the differences in product outcomes in the literature it is possible that the in situ electron supply via cathode could directly accepted by microorganisms van eerten jansen et al 2013 therefore it might impact the redox pair homeostasis for lactic acid generation in the cellular metabolism to demonstrate this assumption the following open circuit operation test was carried out 3 6 open circuit operation test of lactic acid production driving by short term cef within the first 24 h both reactors were applied with cathode in parallel i e the close circuit operation fig 7 revealed that the fermentation results were similar at that time however after 24 h the stimuli of cathode were eliminated for open circuit operation in r o and the accumulation of lactic acid was ceased at 8 85 g l and started to decline at 96 h in contrast the concentration of lactic acid in r c continuously improved to 20 42 g l of l lactic acid at 48 h and 9 57 g l of d lactic acid at 72 h it seemed that the cathode offered an opportunity for in situ electron supply to guarantee the enhancement of lactate generation direct electron transfer from the cathode to microorganisms for fatty acids production had been demonstrated nevin et al 2010 also microorganism can use a wide range of electron donors and acceptors to generate energy for metabolism moscoviz et al 2016 lactic acid was likely accumulated due to the reaction pyruvate e lactate φ pyruvate lactate 0 19 v and nad 2h 2e nadh h φ nad nadh 0 32 v redox potentials are used to characterize the free energy cost and direction of reactions involving electron transfer in this study the employment of external cathode unbalanced the chemical equilibrium resulting in greater accumulation of nadh thus e red for redox pair of nad nadh was higher in r c than that in r o without external voltage supply which increased lactate production in this study moreover it was reported that the transcriptions of some metabolic enzymes were impacted by alteration of intracellular nadh nad ratio which led to the variation of product concentration villano et al 2017 wang et al 2008 similarly unbalanced nadh nad ratio resulting from electricity driven fermentation exerted a stronger impact on metabolic shift than merely dissipating the extra supply of electron donors choi et al 2014 it should be noted that the electricity driven fermentation of lactic acid from organic wastes had not been discovered until we demonstrated it in the current study however identifying the relationship between electrochemical and microbiological actions in cef and elucidating how cef in principle associated with the transformation of substrate into lactic acid would be an interesting topic for further work 4 conclusion cef from organic waste significantly improved lactic acid productivity and the oa of l lactic acid electron donation promoted the conversion from pyruvic acid to lactic acid especially l lactic acid differences of family and genus level in microbial community had been observed the cathode in the cef providing in situ electron supply guaranteed the enhancement of lactate generation from organic wastes acknowledgements this work was supported by

19768,taste odor t o problems in drinking water are always complained by customers recent studies have indicated biofilms in drinking water distribution system dwds are always ignored as potential sources of t o compounds in this paper the formation of 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca one of the dominant t o compounds was investigated in a pilot scale dwds the addition of precursor 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp of 0 2 mg l induced the formation of 2 4 6 tca with a maximum yield of 400 ng l and the formation kinetics can be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model effects of water distribution factors such as pipe material temperature flow velocity and residual chlorine on the formation of 2 4 6 tca were evaluated and the pipe material was found to have the most remarkable effect ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more 2 4 6 tca than polyethylene pe pipe the biofilm microbial communities on the three types of pipe walls were then comprehensively analyzed by heterotrophic plate count and 16s rrna its1 genes high throughput sequencing the links between the 2 4 6 tca formation potential and the microbial activity in genus and enzymatic levels in dwds have been revealed for the first time according to the characteristics of microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca quorum sensing qs bacterial signaling system and extracellular dna edna may be two promising targets for biofilm treatment and 2 4 6 tca control in dwds graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial o methylation 2 4 6 trichloroanisole drinking

directly sensory judgement malleret et al 2003 the earthy musty t o caused by several predominant compounds including geosmin gsm earthy 2 methyloisoborneol 2 mib musty and 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca musty moldy is the most frequently detected in drinking water supplies wang et al 2015 previous researches have focused on widely known gsm and 2 mib which are produced by many actinomycetes cyanobacteria and fungi jensen et al 1994 zhang et al 2016a while 2 4 6 tca has been less investigated in recent years zhang et al 2016c made a survey on the occurrence of the haloanisole odorous compounds in tap water of typical chinese cities and found 2 4 6 tca in all samples in both summer and winter urase and sasaki 2013 analyzed the 2 4 6 tca concentration in biologically treated water from large scale treatment plants finding that the 2 4 6 tca concentration 4 3 37 7 ng l was comparable with gsm 3 7 42 2 ng l due to the ubiquity and potential hazards to public health the formation kinetics mechanisms and condition effects of 2 4 6 tca in water treatment and distribution system are of great concerns yet the related information on 2 4 6 tca formation in drinking water are largely unknown typically 2 4 6 tca in drinking water has two origins the chlorination of natural organic compounds i e anisole in raw water zhang et al 2016b and the microbial o methylation of precursor 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp benanou et al 2003 chlorine origin mainly comes from chlorination reaction between sodium hypochlorite naclo and anisoles and the formed chloroanisoles include 2 4 dichloroanisole 2 4 dca and 2 6 chloroanisole 2 6 dca besides 2 4 6 tca lower ph e g ph 4 promotes the para position substitution and facilitates the production of 2 4 6 tca as the predominant chloroanisole species zhang et al 2016b the other origin from the microbial o methylation of precursor 2 4 6 tcp is the dominant pathway for biosynthesis of 2 4 6 tca fontana and altamirano 2010 which is considered as a detoxification mechanism in various microbial species due to the greatly reduced toxicity of 2 4 6 tca maggi et al 2008 2 4 6 tcp a widely used fungicide herbicide insecticide and antiseptic ogunniyi et al 2000 has been recognized as one of the greatest toxic environmental contaminants and frequently detected in surface ground and drinking waters halappa gowda et al 1985 many microorganisms have been reported to produce 2 4 6 tca including bacteria e g rhodococcus spp strains fungi trichoderma spp strains cyanobacteria anabaena flos aquae and algae chlorella vulgaris coque and larriba 2003 zhang et al 2016a the microbial o methylation process transfers a methyl group from donors to the hydroxyl group of 2 4 6 tcp via sn2 like nucleophilic substitution which is catalyzed by chlorophenol o methyltransferases cpomts the methyl donors have a wide range of sources such as methanol methylamines methanethiol and s adenosyl methionine sam zhang et al 2016a generally t o compounds generated in the source water or during the water treatment process can be effectively removed by conducting emergent process such as activated carbon adsorption fu et al 2017 and advanced oxidation processes aops comninellis et al 2008 in the water treatment plant however t o problems often still exist in tap water even though the finished effluent of water treatment plant is odorless therefore such t o issues must be arisen in the drinking water distribution system dwds wajon and heitz 1995 according to an american survey in 1989 corado et al 1996 67 of 377 water utilities reported the dwds as the main source of t o problems theoretically both chlorination and microbial o methylation can contribute the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds however the chemical formation of 2 4 6 tca by chlorination only significantly occurs under very acidic condition e g ph 4 zhang et al 2016b thus the microbial o methylation is the dominant mechanism for generation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds since most of the microorganisms that can produce 2 4 6 tca in dwds deposit on the pipe inner surface to grow biofilm zhou et al 2017 therefore biofilm can serve as an assignable source for 2 4 6 tca and also be the critical factor for solving the off flavor problem various water distribution factors including pipe material hydrodynamics water temperature and residual disinfectants have considerable impacts on the development of biofilms in dwds zhou et al 2017 and these factors can also influence the microbial formation of 2 4 6 tca however the effects of water distribution factors on the formation of 2 4 6 tca have not been addressed moreover the structure characteristics and cpomt activity of microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca in the biofilm of dwds remain unexplored in this paper the formation of 2 4 6 tca with addition of precursor 2 4 6 tcp of 0 2 mg l in pilot dwds under various conditions was investigated a kinetic model was established to describe the formation of 2 4 6 tca under different conditions the effects of pipe material flow velocity temperature and residual chlorine on 2 4 6 tca formation were evaluated the biomass in the biofilm was determined by heterotrophic plate counts hpc high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna its1 genes was applied to map the bacterial and fungal community composition to explore the contribution of specific microbial assemblages to the formation of 2 4 6 tca metagenomic data was predicted using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust to characterize cpomts activity of resident microbes the objectives of the study are to investigate the microbial formation of 2 4 6 tca in a pilot scale dwds evaluate effects of various condition factors reveal the underlying microbial mechanisms at community level and propose strategies on the control of 2 4 6 tca 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals precursor 2 4 6 tcp analyte standard 2 4 6 tca and internal

dwds was washed with fresh municipal drinking water for 40 min before experiments the stock solution of 2 4 6 tcp was prepared by dissolving 0 38 g of chemical into 1 l ultrapure water the solution of 2 4 6 tcp was pumped into the three pipes of pe stainless steel and ductile iron respectively with an ultimately concentration of 0 2 mg l which is the concentration limit in standard for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 the temperature was controlled equaling to the indoor temperature the flow velocity was adjusted within 0 1 1 4 m s the naclo was added in each loop with an ultimately concentration of 3 mg l to investigate the effect of residual chlorine on 2 4 6 tca formation a 100 ml water sample was collected by a volumetric flask for 2 4 6 tca analysis and 1 ml sample was collected by an amber sample bottle for 2 4 6 tcp analysis during the experiments samples were collected at pre determined time intervals and the residual chlorine in samples was measured at the same time when naclo was added into the pilot dwds after experiments duplicate biofilm samples were collected in each loop by swabbing the inside area of the pipe wall with a sterile cotton swab and

and the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database was employed to analyze the metabolic pathway 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation kinetics of 2 4 6 tca fig 1 presents the formation kinetic curve of 2 4 6 tca in dwds of pe pipe at a flow velocity of 1 0 m s and temperature of 20 c the concentration of 2 4 6 tca gradually increased from 0 ng l to the maximal value of 31 3 ng l with increasing the reaction time from 0 to 50 h yet no 2 4 6 tca was detected in a control test by incubating 0 2 mg l of precursor 2 4 6 tcp with tap water in a sterile container this indicates the microbes attached on the pipe wall of dwds are the dominant producers of 2 4 6 tca only 10 of 2 4 6 tcp was degraded or transformed to 2 4 6 tca after reacting for 50 h fig 1 suggesting a relatively low conversion ratio from 2 4 6 tcp to 2 4 6 tca since the concentration of the precursor 2 4 6 tcp was much excessive and can be regarded as a constant in the pilot experiments a pseudo first order kinetic model was established to describe the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds as follows 1 tca tca max 1 e k t where k h 1 is the rate constant of 2 4 6 tca formation tca ng l is the concentration of 2 4 6 tca at time t h and tca max ng l is the maximum formation concentration of 2 4 6 tca the formation kinetic curve of 2 4 6 tca in fig 1 was well fitted by the constructed model with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 9606 the calculated tca max and k were 32 51 ng l and 0 069 h 1 respectively 3 2 effects of water distribution factors 3 2 1 pipe material fig 2 shows the formation kinetic curves of 2 4 6 tca in dwds of different pipe materials at a flow velocity of 1 4 m s and temperature of 30 c and supporting information si table s1 summarizes the calculated pseudo first order rate constants and maximum formation concentrations the ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more 2 4 6 tca tca max 385 00 and 320 01 ng l respectively than pe pipe tca max 96 97 ng l though their pseudo first order rate constants were comparable k 0 047 0 053 h 1 it has been reported that the pipe material is the critical factor that influences the development of biofilms in dwds wang et al 2014 subsequently determining the formation level of 2 4 6 tca 3 2 2 temperature fig 3 compares the concentrations of generated 2 4 6 tca in dwds at a flow velocity of 1 4 m s reaction time of 52 h and temperature of 20 or 30 c the formation of 2 4 6 tca was promoted at a relatively higher temperature 30 c in all three types of pipes with a growth rate of 7 23 53 50 after fitting the formation kinetic curves it was found that the pseudo first order rate constants of 2 4 6 tca formation also increased with increasing temperature which agrees arrhenius law the formation curves tended to be steady more quickly at a higher temperature si fig s1 and table s2 in general the relatively higher temperature around 30 c will promote the growth of biomass in dwds liu et al 2013 and enhance the biological activity in the conversion of chloroanisoles from chlorophenols by cpomts zhang et al 2016a therefore this observation is consistent with the fact that t o problems often occur in the late summer or early fall when the temperature is high 3 2 3 flow velocity to estimate the effect of hydraulic changes in dwds on the formation of 2 4 6 tca the flow velocity was adjusted to 0 1 m s 0 6 m s and 1 4 m s which represents stagnant economic and high velocities respectively fig 4 shows the generated 2 4 6 tca concentrations in dwds at a reaction time of 52 h and temperature of 20 c the generated 2 4 6 tca concentrations increased with increasing the flow velocity in all three kinds of pipes the pseudo first order rate constants of 2 4 6 tca formation also increased with the increase of flow velocity si fig s2 and table s3 the actual full scale dwds has a long retention time when low flow velocity is employed which is beneficial for the microbial growth on the pipe wall liu et al 2013 alternatively due to the closed loop of the pilot dwds in this study there has no effect of retention time with the varied flow velocity the promotion of 2 4 6 tca formation by high flow velocity in this observation can be explained by the following reasons high velocity might contribute to increasing the contact area between precursor 2 4 6 tcp and biofilm by washing the biofilm on the pipe wall the water flow turned from steady flow to turbulent flow with the increase of flow velocity menaia et al 2003 which ultimately enhanced the water turbulence and improved the substance exchange between precursor 2 4 6 tcp and biofilm 3 2 4 residual chlorine drinking water disinfection is a process used to kill or irreversibly inactivate microorganisms that have passed through the treatment plant and ensure the water through the dwds has no health risk for customers chaves simoes and simoes 2013 this is commonly achieved by adding extra disinfectants such as chlorine or chloramine which will maintain a disinfectant concentration during water distribution in order to control microbial regrowth in pipes zhou et al 2017 to test the effect of residual chlorine on the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds 3 mg l of naclo was added to the pilot dwds and it was found that the generated 2 4 6 tca concentrations were decreased by 24 27 39 68 compared with that in the absence of naclo fig 5 chlorine has been reported to have contrary effects on the formation of 2 4 6 tca on the one hand chlorine can promote the formation of 2 4 6 tca by either directly reacting with anisole to form chloroanisole zhang et al 2016b or reacting with natural organic matter nom in water to produce precursor 2 4 6 tcp hodin et al 1991 however no 2 4 6 tca was detected in the formation potential test by chlorination of tap water indicating the minor role of chlorine for the generation of 2 4 6 tca at the investigated condition it has been reported that only very acidic condition e g ph 4 can trigger the formation of 2 4 6 tca during the chlorination process due to the catalytic effect of hydrogen ion zhang et al 2016b on the other hand chlorine can inhibit the formation of 2 4 6 tca by either suppressing the microbial activity of biofilm or oxidizing chlorinating the precursor 2 4 6 tcp zhou et al 2017 in this study the inhibitive effects were evident which also further suggests the bioconversion of 2 4 6 tca from 2 4 6 tcp is the dominant pathway for formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds 3 3 microbial mechanism of 2 4 6 tca formation the aforementioned results have demonstrated biofilms on the pipe wall are the dominant sources of 2 4 6 tca in dwds and pipe material is the critical factor that determines the formation level of 2 4 6 tca to explore the microbial mechanisms of 2 4 6 tca formation in biofilms of different types of pipe walls we have systematically investigated the bacterial quantity composition and diversity of microbial community and microbial metabolic profile in the biofilms on pipe walls of pe stainless steel and ductile iron 3 3 1 bacterial quantity the measure of hpc estimated the bacterial quantity was 3 74 0 65 104 2 22 0 41 105 and 3 50 0 51 105 cfu cm2 on pipe walls of pe stainless steel and ductile iron respectively the bacterial quantity order in the three pipe materials is in agreement with that of formed 2 4 6 tca concentration fig 2 indicating the microbial biomass may serve as a surrogate parameter for evaluating the 2 4 6 tca formation potential in dwds it is well known that pipe material influences biofilm development on pipe surfaces previous studies have reported that iron or steel pipes showed a much higher biofilm formation potential than plastic pipes niquette et al 2001 yu et al 2010 our results also observed the bacterial quantity on stainless steel or ductile iron pipe was an order of magnitude higher than that on pe pipes the rough surface of stainless steel or ductile iron pipes may offer more favorable conditions for biofilm formation compared with the smooth surface of pe pipes yu et al 2010 in addition the iron element of different valences in ductile iron or stainless steel can serve as the electron acceptor donor to promote the growth of iron reducing oxidizing microorganisms pan et al 2017 3 3 2 composition and diversity of microbial community the microbial community in biofilms on pe stainless steel and ductile iron pipe walls were analyzed by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing the identified otus of bacterial microbiome can be assigned to 40 phyla 112 classes 213 orders 356 families and 558 genera while otus of fungi can be assigned to 13 phyla 39 classes 101 orders 209 families and 368 genera fig 6 presents the circular taxonomic and phylogenetic trees and the top 20 dominant taxa are marked for bacterial microbiota phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant accounting for 53 97 66 35 si table s4 which was mainly comprised of classes alphaproteobacteria 39 07 47 08 betaproteobacteria 2 28 6 05 and gammaproteobacteria 9 42 10 17 the other three dominant phyla were actinobacteria 6 49 12 87 bacteroidetes 8 72 12 38 and firmicutes 5 05 15 19 ochrobactrum from alphaproteobacteria was the most dominant genus 30 78 34 94 for fungal microbiota ascomycota 54 80 84 11 and basidiomycota 10 59 27 50 were the dominant phyla si table s5 the former was mainly comprised of classes dothideomycetes 2 73 12 51 eurotiomycetes 17 73 55 98 leotiomycetes 1 05 11 88 saccharomycetes 3 19 7 61 and sordariomycetes 8 22 14 23 aspergillus 11 80 26 28 and thermoascus 1 85 25 54 from order eurotiales 17 21 55 61 were the dominant genera the microbial phylotype richness and diversity were reflected by using chao1 ace estimator and simpson shannon index respectively table 1 generally the bacterial microbiome showed a higher phylotype richness and diversity than fungi in terms of pipe material pe had a bacterial community with higher richness and diversity ductile iron had a more diverse fungal community whereas a relatively lower microbial diversity was found in stainless steel for both bacterial and fungal communities beta diversity analysis indicated the microbial communities of ductile iron and stainless steel had a relatively higher similarity compared with that of pe si fig s3 metastats analysis identified the phyla and genera with significant abundant differences among the microbial communities in biofilms on the three types of pipe walls it was found that 22 phyla and 233 genera showed a significantly different abundant distribution in bacterial microbiota which accounts for 55 and 42 of the total phyla and genera respectively the taxa of differential distribution in fungal microbiota were fewer and 2 phyla and 31 genera were found to have a large abundant variation accounting for 15 and 8 of the total phyla and genera respectively fig 7 presents the abundant distributions of phyla and genera with the most significant differences in the microbial communities which included most dominant phyla or genera in the phylogenetic trees fig 6 3 3 3 microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca a large number of bacteria and fungi have been isolated and verified their ability of producing 2 4 6 tca álvarezrodríguez et al 2002 coque and larriba 2003 si table s6 and s7 summarize the reported 2 4 6 tca producing bacterial and fungal species and the detected potential 2 4 6 tca producing microbes in biofilms of dwds by the high throughput sequencing were determined by alignment with si table s6 and s7 a total of 6 bacterial genera and 11 fungal genera of having potential 2 4 6 tca producing species were identified with the total relative abundance being 2 33 3 17 and 14 92 32 92 for bacteria and fungi respectively fig 8 in terms of phylotype these bacteria fungi were mainly from the bacterial phyla of actinobacteria 3 genera proteobacteria 2 genera bacteroidetes 1 genus and fungal phyla of ascomycota 8 genera zygomycota 3 genera most of 2 4 6 tca producing genera have a relative high abundance and a significantly different distribution on the three types of pipe walls fig 8 for instance aspergillus was the most abundant fungal genus with the abundance being 13 93 26 28 and 11 80 on pe stainless steel and ductile iron pipe walls respectively inspecting the knowledge on the reported microbial species si table s8 and s9 it was found that the microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca in the biofilms of pilot dwds had the strong abilities of surviving in variety of environmental conditions metabolizing various organic substances forming biofilms resisting antibiotics disinfectants and cellular communication of the 17 potential producing 2 4 6 tca genera except many mucor species are unable to grow in warm environments close to 37 c stout and shaw 1974 all the genera can thrive in a broad range of environments adapting the variations of temperature and moisture many of these genera are resistant to a variety of antibiotics such as acinetobacter doughari et al 2011 and pseudomonas haas and défago 2005 acinetobacter is even tolerant of various common disinfectants e g chlorine and chloramines doughari et al 2011 the formation of biofilms involved with pseudomonas haas and défago 2005 and aspergillus donlan and costerton 2002 can further enhance the ability of microbial assemblages to resist the residual chlorine and or condition variations moreover the cellular communication among these microbes through quorum sensing and natural transformation of extracellular dna edna can enhance the biofilm formation efficiency and promote the genetic exchange of antibiotic disinfectant resistant genes chaves simoes and simoes 2013 okshevsky and meyer 2015 as a result the control of microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca on pipes of dwds has always been a challenge even through changing the water distribution parameter and or increasing the residual chlorine concentration may inhibit the production of 2 4 6 tca to some extent the network analysis revealed many cooperative actions might exist among the potential producing 2 4 6 tca genera and other dominant genera fig 9 for example the potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacterial genus pseudomonas showed significantly positive correlations with four dominant bacterial genera including propionibacterium agrobacterium brevibacterium and methylobacterium potential 2 4 6 tca producing fungal genus aspergillus significantly correlated with trichosporon and thermoascus some of these cooperative actions may be beneficial for the production of 2 4 6 tca for example the cooperative bacteria from genus methylobacterium are methanotrophs or methane oxidizing bacteria eller and frenzel 2001 which can oxidize methane the end product of anaerobic degradation of organic matter to produce methanol providing the dissolved methyl donors for the microbial o methylation process all species of cooperative fungal genus trichosporon are yeasts middelhoven et al 2004 and can convert carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols by fermentation the produced alcohols are important methyl donors for the production of 2 4 6 tca zhang et al 2016a to compare the amount of potential 2 4 6 tca producing microbes on the three types of pipe walls the biomass of potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria was estimated using hpc bacterial quantity multiplied by specific bacterial abundance fig 10 the total quantity of six potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacterial genera was 1176 56 7040 10 and 8173 40 cfu cm2 on pipe walls of pe stainless steel and ductile iron respectively which agrees with the 2 4 6 tca formation potentials of the three pipe materials fig 2 3 3 4 microbial activity of cpomts the microbial production of 2 4 6 tca is catalyzed by cpomts zhang et al 2016a thus the microbial activity of cpomts directly determines the 2 4 6 tca formation potential from kegg orthologous groups ko database 21 potential cpomts were screened based on their phenol o methylation abilities si table s10 picrust analysis based on ko database discovered the expressions of two potential cpomts i e catechol o methyltransferase ko id k00545 and caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase ko id k00588 functional genes in the bacterial metagenome in biofilms of pilot dwds both of the identified o methyltransferases have strong phenol o methylation abilities bonifácio et al 2007 kühnl et al 1989 which can catalyze the bioconversion of 2 4 6 tca from precursor 2 4 6 tcp as cpomts fig 11 presents the activities of the two potential cpomts on the three types of pipe walls which were estimated by multiplying the functional gene abundance with bacterial biomass the total activities of the two potential cpomts on the three materials of pipes were in the order of ductile iron stainless steel pe and this observation is in accord with the 2 4 6 tca formation potentials of the three pipe materials as well as the distribution of potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria figs 2 and 10 thus the link between the 2 4 6 tca formation potential and the microbial activity in genus and enzymatic levels in dwds have been demonstrated in this study 3 4 discussion on control of 2 4 6 tca the t o problem of 2 4 6 tca in dwds caused by microorganisms is a thorny problem the mechanistic investigation on the microbial formation of 2 4 6 tca in this pilot study has provided some useful information to make strategies to control it first of all the pipe material is the most important factor to affect the formation of biofilm as well as the profiles of microbial structure and function roughness of pipe surface can markedly affect the microbial attachment on the surface studies indicated that biofilm regrowth on pipes made of rough surface materials such as cast iron concrete lined cast iron and galvanized steel was greater than that on smooth surface polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe chang et al 2003 yu et al 2010 our results also showed the pe pipe with relatively smoother surface had a much lower biomass in the biofilm compared with ductile iron or stainless steel pipe of rougher surface the chemical composition of pipe material has been observed to play an important role in shaping biofilm communities the present study found that the iron based pipes might stimulate the growth of potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria pseudomonas by providing the iron element fig 8 copper pipe however has been reported to inhibit the growth of some bacteria in dwds such as pseudomonas aeruginosa through an inhibitory effect of copper on microbial respiratory chain dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 therefore the selection of pipe materials could be vital for the 2 4 6 tca problem in dwds for practices the biofilm production potential and 2 4 6 tca formation potential of pipe products designed for dwds should be tested e g according to the german method dvgw w270 and the results can be included as important criteria for the evaluation and selection in addition the r d of some new pipe materials with antimicrobial properties is the promising method for solving t o problems especially the booming of nanoscience and nanotechnology has offered leapfrogging opportunities for developing innovative antimicrobial materials li et al 2008 that can be applied in pipes of dwds our results and many other studies chaves simoes and simoes 2013 zhou et al 2017 have shown that the conventional disinfectants e g chlorine and chloramines can not effective to remove or suppress the formation of biofilm in dwds as well as the formation of 2 4 6 tca due to the high resistance of microbial assemblages si table s8 and s9 the proposed alternative disinfection methods such as ozonation uv radiation aops have many disadvantages that make them difficult to apply in dwds chaves simoes and simoes 2013 recently an environmentally friendly biofilm control strategy has been reported which utilizes a diverse class of natural and synthetic compounds e g dihydropyrrolones to inhibit the quorum sensing qs bacterial signaling system ho et al 2014 thereby limiting biofilm formation the qs is an important mechanism for the communication and organization of bacterial community in biofilm for controlling unnecessary overpopulation and competition for nutrients via the secretion of signaling molecules feng et al 2013 in the present study many potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria with qs ability such as rhodococcus and acinetobacter si table s8 were identified which makes it possible to regulate the microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca by disrupting the qs mediated cell to cell communication another promising new target in biofilm treatment is extracellular dna edna which is produced by active secretion or controlled cell lysis it plays an important role in promoting biofilm formation and conveying antimicrobial disinfectant resistance okshevsky and meyer 2015 in this study the identified potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria acinetobacter and pseudomonas have been reported to develop competence by nature transformation in drinking water biofilms si table s8 lisle and rose 1995 and the took up edna may be used to repair dna damage or as a means to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene transfer palmen et al 1993 therefore the degradation of edna can weaken the ability of 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria to survive for the residual disinfectant and damage biofilm formation and stability the enzymatic disruption of edna e g using dnase has recently been proposed as a possible treatment method for the biofilm problem xiong and yu 2010 besides aiming at enzymatic inhibition of cpomts some other measures can also be applied to reduce the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds such as removal of precursor 2 4 6 tcp and methyl donors decrease of temperature temporarily lowering ph to acidic conditions and elimination of magnesium ions zhang et al 2016a zhou et al 2017 4 conclusion the formation of t o compound 2 4 6 tca in drinking water especially in distribution system has been rarely reported in literature this paper has demonstrated that with precursor 2 4 6 tcp of 0 2 mg l high concentration of 2 4 6 tca was generated in pilot dwds which can be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model many water distribution factors e g pipe material temperature flow velocity and residual chlorine can influence the formation of 2 4 6 tca and the pipe material showed the most significant effect ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more amount of 2 4 6 tca tca max 385 00 and 320 01 ng l respectively than pe pipe tca max 96 97 ng l after community analysis by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing it was found that microbial communities of ductile iron and stainless steel had a relatively higher similarity the biomass of potential 2 4 6 tca producing microbes and the enzymatic activity of cpomts in biofilms on the three types of pipe walls agreed with the 2 4 6 tca formation potential this suggests the dominant mechanism of 2 4 6 tca formation in dwds is the microbial o methylation of precursor 2 4 6 tcp in biofilms based on the provided information several promising strategies can be applied for biofilm treatment and 2 4 6 tca control in dwds such as including the criteria of 2 4 6 tca formation potential in the evaluation and selection of pipe material interfering the bacterial signaling system by specific chemical compound and suppressing the natural

19768,taste odor t o problems in drinking water are always complained by customers recent studies have indicated biofilms in drinking water distribution system dwds are always ignored as potential sources of t o compounds in this paper the formation of 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca one of the dominant t o compounds was investigated in a pilot scale dwds the addition of precursor 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp of 0 2 mg l induced the formation of 2 4 6 tca with a maximum yield of 400 ng l and the formation kinetics can be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model effects of water distribution factors such as pipe material temperature flow velocity and residual chlorine on the formation of 2 4 6 tca were evaluated and the pipe material was found to have the most remarkable effect ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more 2 4 6 tca than polyethylene pe pipe the biofilm microbial communities on the three types of pipe walls were then comprehensively analyzed by heterotrophic plate count and 16s rrna its1 genes high throughput sequencing the links between the 2 4 6 tca formation potential and the microbial activity in genus and enzymatic levels in dwds have been revealed for the first time according to the characteristics of microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca quorum sensing qs bacterial signaling system and extracellular dna edna may be two promising targets for biofilm treatment and 2 4 6 tca control in dwds graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial o methylation 2 4 6 trichloroanisole drinking

directly sensory judgement malleret et al 2003 the earthy musty t o caused by several predominant compounds including geosmin gsm earthy 2 methyloisoborneol 2 mib musty and 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca musty moldy is the most frequently detected in drinking water supplies wang et al 2015 previous researches have focused on widely known gsm and 2 mib which are produced by many actinomycetes cyanobacteria and fungi jensen et al 1994 zhang et al 2016a while 2 4 6 tca has been less investigated in recent years zhang et al 2016c made a survey on the occurrence of the haloanisole odorous compounds in tap water of typical chinese cities and found 2 4 6 tca in all samples in both summer and winter urase and sasaki 2013 analyzed the 2 4 6 tca concentration in biologically treated water from large scale treatment plants finding that the 2 4 6 tca concentration 4 3 37 7 ng l was comparable with gsm 3 7 42 2 ng l due to the ubiquity and potential hazards to public health the formation kinetics mechanisms and condition effects of 2 4 6 tca in water treatment and distribution system are of great concerns yet the related information on 2 4 6 tca formation in drinking water are largely unknown typically 2 4 6 tca in drinking water has two origins the chlorination of natural organic compounds i e anisole in raw water zhang et al 2016b and the microbial o methylation of precursor 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp benanou et al 2003 chlorine origin mainly comes from chlorination reaction between sodium hypochlorite naclo and anisoles and the formed chloroanisoles include 2 4 dichloroanisole 2 4 dca and 2 6 chloroanisole 2 6 dca besides 2 4 6 tca lower ph e g ph 4 promotes the para position substitution and facilitates the production of 2 4 6 tca as the predominant chloroanisole species zhang et al 2016b the other origin from the microbial o methylation of precursor 2 4 6 tcp is the dominant pathway for biosynthesis of 2 4 6 tca fontana and altamirano 2010 which is considered as a detoxification mechanism in various microbial species due to the greatly reduced toxicity of 2 4 6 tca maggi et al 2008 2 4 6 tcp a widely used fungicide herbicide insecticide and antiseptic ogunniyi et al 2000 has been recognized as one of the greatest toxic environmental contaminants and frequently detected in surface ground and drinking waters halappa gowda et al 1985 many microorganisms have been reported to produce 2 4 6 tca including bacteria e g rhodococcus spp strains fungi trichoderma spp strains cyanobacteria anabaena flos aquae and algae chlorella vulgaris coque and larriba 2003 zhang et al 2016a the microbial o methylation process transfers a methyl group from donors to the hydroxyl group of 2 4 6 tcp via sn2 like nucleophilic substitution which is catalyzed by chlorophenol o methyltransferases cpomts the methyl donors have a wide range of sources such as methanol methylamines methanethiol and s adenosyl methionine sam zhang et al 2016a generally t o compounds generated in the source water or during the water treatment process can be effectively removed by conducting emergent process such as activated carbon adsorption fu et al 2017 and advanced oxidation processes aops comninellis et al 2008 in the water treatment plant however t o problems often still exist in tap water even though the finished effluent of water treatment plant is odorless therefore such t o issues must be arisen in the drinking water distribution system dwds wajon and heitz 1995 according to an american survey in 1989 corado et al 1996 67 of 377 water utilities reported the dwds as the main source of t o problems theoretically both chlorination and microbial o methylation can contribute the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds however the chemical formation of 2 4 6 tca by chlorination only significantly occurs under very acidic condition e g ph 4 zhang et al 2016b thus the microbial o methylation is the dominant mechanism for generation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds since most of the microorganisms that can produce 2 4 6 tca in dwds deposit on the pipe inner surface to grow biofilm zhou et al 2017 therefore biofilm can serve as an assignable source for 2 4 6 tca and also be the critical factor for solving the off flavor problem various water distribution factors including pipe material hydrodynamics water temperature and residual disinfectants have considerable impacts on the development of biofilms in dwds zhou et al 2017 and these factors can also influence the microbial formation of 2 4 6 tca however the effects of water distribution factors on the formation of 2 4 6 tca have not been addressed moreover the structure characteristics and cpomt activity of microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca in the biofilm of dwds remain unexplored in this paper the formation of 2 4 6 tca with addition of precursor 2 4 6 tcp of 0 2 mg l in pilot dwds under various conditions was investigated a kinetic model was established to describe the formation of 2 4 6 tca under different conditions the effects of pipe material flow velocity temperature and residual chlorine on 2 4 6 tca formation were evaluated the biomass in the biofilm was determined by heterotrophic plate counts hpc high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna its1 genes was applied to map the bacterial and fungal community composition to explore the contribution of specific microbial assemblages to the formation of 2 4 6 tca metagenomic data was predicted using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust to characterize cpomts activity of resident microbes the objectives of the study are to investigate the microbial formation of 2 4 6 tca in a pilot scale dwds evaluate effects of various condition factors reveal the underlying microbial mechanisms at community level and propose strategies on the control of 2 4 6 tca 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals precursor 2 4 6 tcp analyte standard 2 4 6 tca and internal

collected by an amber sample bottle for 2 4 6 tcp analysis during the experiments samples were collected at pre determined time intervals and the residual chlorine in samples was measured at the same time when naclo was added into the pilot dwds after experiments duplicate biofilm samples were collected in each loop by swabbing the inside area of the pipe wall with a sterile cotton swab and

lengths 150 bp were discarded after being processed reads were assembled by flash v 1 2 7 magoč and salzberg 2011 with the overlap between r1 and r2 reads 10 bp high quality representative sequences for each operational taxonomic units otus were assigned using uclust edgar et al 2011 with 97 sequence identity taxonomic classification was carried out using greengenes 16s rrna gene database release 13 8 desantis et al 2006 and unite database release 5 0 kõljalg et al 2013 relative abundance of individual taxa within each community was calculated by comparing the number of sequences of a specific taxon versus the number of total sequences alpha diversity of each microbial community was estimated based on shannon index chao1 and number of observed species and the microbial community richness and diversity could be reflected by chao1 ace estimator and simpson shannon diversity index respectively metastats analysis http metastats cbcb umd edu was conducted using mothur white et al 2009 to explore the statistically significant differences between two samples at phylum and genus levels respectively graphlan asnicar et al 2015 was applied to develop the circular taxonomic and phylogenetic trees with marking dominant taxa beta diversity was estimated and principal component analysis pca ramette 2007 was employed to evaluate the differences of microbial community among samples using r 2 14 1 www r project org network analysis was carried out using the software cytoscape http www cytoscape org shannon et al 2003 with input spearman correlation coefficient calculated using mothur software to explore the correlations among dominant genera the functional profiles of microbial communities were predicted by using picrust langille et al 2013 from the otus of 16s rrna gene sequences and the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database was employed to analyze the metabolic pathway 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation kinetics of 2 4 6 tca fig 1 presents the formation kinetic curve of 2 4 6 tca in dwds of pe pipe at a flow velocity of 1 0 m s and temperature of 20 c the concentration of 2 4 6 tca gradually increased from 0 ng l to the maximal value of 31 3 ng l with increasing the reaction time from 0 to 50 h yet no 2 4 6 tca was detected in a control test by incubating 0 2 mg l of precursor 2 4 6 tcp with tap water in a sterile container this indicates the microbes attached on the pipe wall of dwds are the dominant producers of 2 4 6 tca only 10 of 2 4 6 tcp was degraded or transformed to 2 4 6 tca after reacting for 50 h fig 1 suggesting a relatively low conversion ratio from 2 4 6 tcp to 2 4 6 tca since the concentration of the precursor 2 4 6 tcp was much excessive and can be regarded as a constant in the pilot experiments a pseudo first order kinetic model was established to describe the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds as follows 1 tca tca max 1 e k t where k h 1 is the rate constant of 2 4 6 tca formation tca ng l is the concentration of 2 4 6 tca at time t h and tca max ng l is the maximum formation concentration of 2 4 6 tca the formation kinetic curve of 2 4 6 tca in fig 1 was well fitted by the constructed model with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 9606 the calculated tca max and k were 32 51 ng l and 0 069 h 1 respectively 3 2 effects of water distribution factors 3 2 1 pipe material fig 2 shows the formation kinetic curves of 2 4 6 tca in dwds of different pipe materials at a flow velocity of 1 4 m s and temperature of 30 c and supporting information si table s1 summarizes the calculated pseudo first order rate constants and maximum formation concentrations the ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more 2 4 6 tca tca max 385 00 and 320 01 ng l respectively than pe pipe tca max 96 97 ng l though their pseudo first order rate constants were comparable k 0 047 0 053 h 1 it has been reported that the pipe material is the critical factor that influences the development of biofilms in dwds wang et al 2014 subsequently determining the formation level of 2 4 6 tca 3 2 2 temperature fig 3 compares the concentrations of generated 2 4 6 tca in dwds at a flow velocity of 1 4 m s reaction time of 52 h and temperature of 20 or 30 c the formation of 2 4 6 tca was promoted at a relatively higher temperature 30 c in all three types of pipes with a growth rate of 7 23 53 50 after fitting the formation kinetic curves it was found that the pseudo first order rate constants of 2 4 6 tca formation also increased with increasing temperature which agrees arrhenius law the formation curves tended to be steady more quickly at a higher temperature si fig s1 and table s2 in general the relatively higher temperature around 30 c will promote the growth of biomass in dwds liu et al 2013 and enhance the biological activity in the conversion of chloroanisoles from chlorophenols by cpomts zhang et al 2016a therefore this observation is consistent with the fact that t o problems often occur in the late summer or early fall when the temperature is high 3 2 3 flow velocity to estimate the effect of hydraulic changes in dwds on the formation of 2 4 6 tca the flow velocity was adjusted to 0 1 m s 0 6 m s and 1 4 m s which represents stagnant economic and high velocities respectively fig 4 shows the generated 2 4 6 tca concentrations in dwds at a reaction time of 52 h and temperature of 20 c the generated 2 4 6 tca concentrations increased with increasing the flow velocity in all three kinds of pipes the pseudo first order rate constants of 2 4 6 tca formation also increased with the increase of flow velocity si fig s2 and table s3 the actual full scale dwds has a long retention time when low flow velocity is employed which is beneficial for the microbial growth on the pipe wall liu et al 2013 alternatively due to the closed loop of the pilot dwds in this study there has no effect of retention time with the varied flow velocity the promotion of 2 4 6 tca formation by high flow velocity in this observation can be explained by the following reasons high velocity might contribute to increasing the contact area between precursor 2 4 6 tcp and biofilm by washing the biofilm on the pipe wall the water flow turned from steady flow to turbulent flow with the increase of flow velocity menaia et al 2003 which ultimately enhanced the water turbulence and improved the substance exchange between precursor 2 4 6 tcp and biofilm 3 2 4 residual chlorine drinking water disinfection is a process used to kill or irreversibly inactivate microorganisms that have passed through the treatment plant and ensure the water through the dwds has no health risk for customers chaves simoes and simoes 2013 this is commonly achieved by adding extra disinfectants such as chlorine or chloramine which will maintain a disinfectant concentration during water distribution in order to control microbial regrowth in pipes zhou et al 2017 to test the effect of residual chlorine on the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds 3 mg l of naclo was added to the pilot dwds and it was found that the generated 2 4 6 tca concentrations were decreased by 24 27 39 68 compared with that in the absence of naclo fig 5 chlorine has been reported to have contrary effects on the formation of 2 4 6 tca on the one hand chlorine can promote the formation of 2 4 6 tca by either directly reacting with anisole to form chloroanisole zhang et al 2016b or reacting with natural organic matter nom in water to produce precursor 2 4 6 tcp hodin et al 1991 however no 2 4 6 tca was detected in the formation potential test by chlorination of tap water indicating the minor role of chlorine for the generation of 2 4 6 tca at the investigated condition it has been reported that only very acidic condition e g ph 4 can trigger the formation of 2 4 6 tca during the chlorination process due to the catalytic effect of hydrogen ion zhang et al 2016b on the other hand chlorine can inhibit the formation of 2 4 6 tca by either suppressing the microbial activity of biofilm or oxidizing chlorinating the precursor 2 4 6 tcp zhou et al 2017 in this study the inhibitive effects were evident which also further suggests the bioconversion of 2 4 6 tca from 2 4 6 tcp is the dominant pathway for formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds 3 3 microbial mechanism of 2 4 6 tca formation the aforementioned results have demonstrated biofilms on the pipe wall are the dominant sources of 2 4 6 tca in dwds and pipe material is the critical factor that determines the formation level of 2 4 6 tca to explore the microbial mechanisms of 2 4 6 tca formation in biofilms of different types of pipe walls we have systematically investigated the bacterial quantity composition and diversity of microbial community and microbial metabolic profile in the biofilms on pipe walls of pe stainless steel and ductile iron 3 3 1 bacterial quantity the measure of hpc estimated the bacterial quantity was 3 74 0 65 104 2 22 0 41 105 and 3 50 0 51 105 cfu cm2 on pipe walls of pe stainless steel and ductile iron respectively the bacterial quantity order in the three pipe materials is in agreement with that of formed 2 4 6 tca concentration fig 2 indicating the microbial biomass may serve as a surrogate parameter for evaluating the 2 4 6 tca formation potential in dwds it is well known that pipe material influences biofilm development on pipe surfaces previous studies have reported that iron or steel pipes showed a much higher biofilm formation potential than plastic pipes niquette et al 2001 yu et al 2010 our results also observed the bacterial quantity on stainless steel or ductile iron pipe was an order of magnitude higher than that on pe pipes the rough surface of stainless steel or ductile iron pipes may offer more favorable conditions for biofilm formation compared with the smooth surface of pe pipes yu et al 2010 in addition the iron element of different valences in ductile iron or stainless steel can serve as the electron acceptor donor to promote the growth of iron reducing oxidizing microorganisms pan et al 2017 3 3 2 composition and diversity of microbial community the microbial community in biofilms on pe stainless steel and ductile iron pipe walls were analyzed by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing the identified otus of bacterial microbiome can be assigned to 40 phyla 112 classes 213 orders 356 families and 558 genera while otus of fungi can be assigned to 13 phyla 39 classes 101 orders 209 families and 368 genera fig 6 presents the circular taxonomic and phylogenetic trees and the top 20 dominant taxa are marked for bacterial microbiota phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant accounting for 53 97 66 35 si table s4 which was mainly comprised of classes alphaproteobacteria 39 07 47 08 betaproteobacteria 2 28 6 05 and gammaproteobacteria 9 42 10 17 the other three dominant phyla were actinobacteria 6 49 12 87 bacteroidetes 8 72 12 38 and firmicutes 5 05 15 19 ochrobactrum from alphaproteobacteria was the most dominant genus 30 78 34 94 for fungal microbiota ascomycota 54 80 84 11 and basidiomycota 10 59 27 50 were the dominant phyla si table s5 the former was mainly comprised of classes dothideomycetes 2 73 12 51 eurotiomycetes 17 73 55 98 leotiomycetes 1 05 11 88 saccharomycetes 3 19 7 61 and sordariomycetes 8 22 14 23 aspergillus 11 80 26 28 and thermoascus 1 85 25 54 from order eurotiales 17 21 55 61 were the dominant genera the microbial phylotype richness and diversity were reflected by using chao1 ace estimator and simpson shannon index respectively table 1 generally the bacterial microbiome showed a higher phylotype richness and diversity than fungi in terms of pipe material pe had a bacterial community with higher richness and diversity ductile iron had a more diverse fungal community whereas a relatively lower microbial diversity was found in stainless steel for both bacterial and fungal communities beta diversity analysis indicated the microbial communities of ductile iron and stainless steel had a relatively higher similarity compared with that of pe si fig s3 metastats analysis identified the phyla and genera with significant abundant differences among the microbial communities in biofilms on the three types of pipe walls it was found that 22 phyla and 233 genera showed a significantly different abundant distribution in bacterial microbiota which accounts for 55 and 42 of the total phyla and genera respectively the taxa of differential distribution in fungal microbiota were fewer and 2 phyla and 31 genera were found to have a large abundant variation accounting for 15 and 8 of the total phyla and genera respectively fig 7 presents the abundant distributions of phyla and genera with the most significant differences in the microbial communities which included most dominant phyla or genera in the phylogenetic trees fig 6 3 3 3 microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca a large number of bacteria and fungi have been isolated and verified their ability of producing 2 4 6 tca álvarezrodríguez et al 2002 coque and larriba 2003 si table s6 and s7 summarize the reported 2 4 6 tca producing bacterial and fungal species and the detected potential 2 4 6 tca producing microbes in biofilms of dwds by the high throughput sequencing were determined by alignment with si table s6 and s7 a total of 6 bacterial genera and 11 fungal genera of having potential 2 4 6 tca producing species were identified with the total relative abundance being 2 33 3 17 and 14 92 32 92 for bacteria and fungi respectively fig 8 in terms of phylotype these bacteria fungi were mainly from the bacterial phyla of actinobacteria 3 genera proteobacteria 2 genera bacteroidetes 1 genus and fungal phyla of ascomycota 8 genera zygomycota 3 genera most of 2 4 6 tca producing genera have a relative high abundance and a significantly different distribution on the three types of pipe walls fig 8 for instance aspergillus was the most abundant fungal genus with the abundance being 13 93 26 28 and 11 80 on pe stainless steel and ductile iron pipe walls respectively inspecting the knowledge on the reported microbial species si table s8 and s9 it was found that the microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca in the biofilms of pilot dwds had the strong abilities of surviving in variety of environmental conditions metabolizing various organic substances forming biofilms resisting antibiotics disinfectants and cellular communication of the 17 potential producing 2 4 6 tca genera except many mucor species are unable to grow in warm environments close to 37 c stout and shaw 1974 all the genera can thrive in a broad range of environments adapting the variations of temperature and moisture many of these genera are resistant to a variety of antibiotics such as acinetobacter doughari et al 2011 and pseudomonas haas and défago 2005 acinetobacter is even tolerant of various common disinfectants e g chlorine and chloramines doughari et al 2011 the formation of biofilms involved with pseudomonas haas and défago 2005 and aspergillus donlan and costerton 2002 can further enhance the ability of microbial assemblages to resist the residual chlorine and or condition variations moreover the cellular communication among these microbes through quorum sensing and natural transformation of extracellular dna edna can enhance the biofilm formation efficiency and promote the genetic exchange of antibiotic disinfectant resistant genes chaves simoes and simoes 2013 okshevsky and meyer 2015 as a result the control of microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca on pipes of dwds has always been a challenge even through changing the water distribution parameter and or increasing the residual chlorine concentration may inhibit the production of 2 4 6 tca to some extent the network analysis revealed many cooperative actions might exist among the potential producing 2 4 6 tca genera and other dominant genera fig 9 for example the potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacterial genus pseudomonas showed significantly positive correlations with four dominant bacterial genera including propionibacterium agrobacterium brevibacterium and methylobacterium potential 2 4 6 tca producing fungal genus aspergillus significantly correlated with trichosporon and thermoascus some of these cooperative actions may be beneficial for the production of 2 4 6 tca for example the cooperative bacteria from genus methylobacterium are methanotrophs or methane oxidizing bacteria eller and frenzel 2001 which can oxidize methane the end product of anaerobic degradation of organic matter to produce methanol providing the dissolved methyl donors for the microbial o methylation process all species of cooperative fungal genus trichosporon are yeasts middelhoven et al 2004 and can convert carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols by fermentation the produced alcohols are important methyl donors for the production of 2 4 6 tca zhang et al 2016a to compare the amount of potential 2 4 6 tca producing microbes on the three types of pipe walls the biomass of potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria was estimated using hpc bacterial quantity multiplied by specific bacterial abundance fig 10 the total quantity of six potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacterial genera was 1176 56 7040 10 and 8173 40 cfu cm2 on pipe walls of pe stainless steel and ductile iron respectively which agrees with the 2 4 6 tca formation potentials of the three pipe materials fig 2 3 3 4 microbial activity of cpomts the microbial production of 2 4 6 tca is catalyzed by cpomts zhang et al 2016a thus the microbial activity of cpomts directly determines the 2 4 6 tca formation potential from kegg orthologous groups ko database 21 potential cpomts were screened based on their phenol o methylation abilities si table s10 picrust analysis based on ko database discovered the expressions of two potential cpomts i e catechol o methyltransferase ko id k00545 and caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase ko id k00588 functional genes in the bacterial metagenome in biofilms of pilot dwds both of the identified o methyltransferases have strong phenol o methylation abilities bonifácio et al 2007 kühnl et al 1989 which can catalyze the bioconversion of 2 4 6 tca from precursor 2 4 6 tcp as cpomts fig 11 presents the activities of the two potential cpomts on the three types of pipe walls which were estimated by multiplying the functional gene abundance with bacterial biomass the total activities of the two potential cpomts on the three materials of pipes were in the order of ductile iron stainless steel pe and this observation is in accord with the 2 4 6 tca formation potentials of the three pipe materials as well as the distribution of potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria figs 2 and 10 thus the link between the 2 4 6 tca formation potential and the microbial activity in genus and enzymatic levels in dwds have been demonstrated in this study 3 4 discussion on control of 2 4 6 tca the t o problem of 2 4 6 tca in dwds caused by microorganisms is a thorny problem the mechanistic investigation on the microbial formation of 2 4 6 tca in this pilot study has provided some useful information to make strategies to control it first of all the pipe material is the most important factor to affect the formation of biofilm as well as the profiles of microbial structure and function roughness of pipe surface can markedly affect the microbial attachment on the surface studies indicated that biofilm regrowth on pipes made of rough surface materials such as cast iron concrete lined cast iron and galvanized steel was greater than that on smooth surface polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe chang et al 2003 yu et al 2010 our results also showed the pe pipe with relatively smoother surface had a much lower biomass in the biofilm compared with ductile iron or stainless steel pipe of rougher surface the chemical composition of pipe material has been observed to play an important role in shaping biofilm communities the present study found that the iron based pipes might stimulate the growth of potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria pseudomonas by providing the iron element fig 8 copper pipe however has been reported to inhibit the growth of some bacteria in dwds such as pseudomonas aeruginosa through an inhibitory effect of copper on microbial respiratory chain dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 therefore the selection of pipe materials could be vital for the 2 4 6 tca problem in dwds for practices the biofilm production potential and 2 4 6 tca formation potential of pipe products designed for dwds should be tested e g according to the german method dvgw w270 and the results can be included as important criteria for the evaluation and selection in addition the r d of some new pipe materials with antimicrobial properties is the promising method for solving t o problems especially the booming of nanoscience and nanotechnology has offered leapfrogging opportunities for developing innovative antimicrobial materials li et al 2008 that can be applied in pipes of dwds our results and many other studies chaves simoes and simoes 2013 zhou et al 2017 have shown that the conventional disinfectants e g chlorine and chloramines can not effective to remove or suppress the formation of biofilm in dwds as well as the formation of 2 4 6 tca due to the high resistance of microbial assemblages si table s8 and s9 the proposed alternative disinfection methods such as ozonation uv radiation aops have many disadvantages that make them difficult to apply in dwds chaves simoes and simoes 2013 recently an environmentally friendly biofilm control strategy has been reported which utilizes a diverse class of natural and synthetic compounds e g dihydropyrrolones to inhibit the quorum sensing qs bacterial signaling system ho et al 2014 thereby limiting biofilm formation the qs is an important mechanism for the communication and organization of bacterial community in biofilm for controlling unnecessary overpopulation and competition for nutrients via the secretion of signaling molecules feng et al 2013 in the present study many potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria with qs ability such as rhodococcus and acinetobacter si table s8 were identified which makes it possible to regulate the microbial assemblages of producing 2 4 6 tca by disrupting the qs mediated cell to cell communication another promising new target in biofilm treatment is extracellular dna edna which is produced by active secretion or controlled cell lysis it plays an important role in promoting biofilm formation and conveying antimicrobial disinfectant resistance okshevsky and meyer 2015 in this study the identified potential 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria acinetobacter and pseudomonas have been reported to develop competence by nature transformation in drinking water biofilms si table s8 lisle and rose 1995 and the took up edna may be used to repair dna damage or as a means to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene transfer palmen et al 1993 therefore the degradation of edna can weaken the ability of 2 4 6 tca producing bacteria to survive for the residual disinfectant and damage biofilm formation and stability the enzymatic disruption of edna e g using dnase has recently been proposed as a possible treatment method for the biofilm problem xiong and yu 2010 besides aiming at enzymatic inhibition of cpomts some other measures can also be applied to reduce the formation of 2 4 6 tca in dwds such as removal of precursor 2 4 6 tcp and methyl donors decrease of temperature temporarily lowering ph to acidic conditions and elimination of magnesium ions zhang et al 2016a zhou et al 2017 4 conclusion the formation of t o compound 2 4 6 tca in drinking water especially in distribution system has been rarely reported in literature this paper has demonstrated that with precursor 2 4 6 tcp of 0 2 mg l high concentration of 2 4 6 tca was generated in pilot dwds which can be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model many water distribution factors e g pipe material temperature flow velocity and residual chlorine can influence the formation of 2 4 6 tca and the pipe material showed the most significant effect ductile iron and stainless steel pipes produced much more amount of 2 4 6 tca tca max 385 00 and 320 01 ng l respectively than pe pipe tca max 96 97 ng l after community analysis by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing it was found that microbial communities of ductile iron and stainless steel had a relatively higher similarity the biomass of potential 2 4 6 tca producing microbes and the enzymatic activity of cpomts in biofilms on the three types of pipe walls agreed with the 2 4 6 tca formation potential this suggests the dominant mechanism of 2 4 6 tca formation in dwds is the microbial o methylation of precursor 2 4 6 tcp in biofilms based on the provided information several promising strategies can be applied for biofilm treatment and 2 4 6 tca control in dwds such as including the criteria of 2 4 6 tca formation potential in the evaluation and selection of pipe material interfering the bacterial signaling system by specific chemical compound and suppressing the natural

19769,the growing medical and personal needs of human populations have escalated release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into our natural environment this work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular ppcp ibuprofen in the presence of a major mineral component of soil kaolinite clay as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation in the absence of solar radiation the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role in contrast under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions the decay rates were at least 6 fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions toxicity of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues were tested on three microorganisms bacillus megaterium pseudoaltermonas atlantica and algae from the chlorella genus the results from the biological assays show that primary ppcp is more toxic than the mixture of secondary products overall however biological assays carried out using only 4 acetylbenzoic acid the most abundant secondary product show a higher toxic effect on algae compared to its parent compound graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals photo enhanced toxicology abiotic transformation personal care products photo degradation secondary products 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are in general any product used for personal health or cosmetic reasons or used by agribusiness to enhance growth or health of livestock boxall et al 2012 majority of the ppcps emerge in the environment via medication residues that pass out of the body used or expired medications placed in the trash or personal care products washed down the shower drain overturf et al 2015 hundreds of individual ppcps have been detected at parts per billion and parts per trillion concentrations in wastewater and surface water deo 2014 in recent studies active pharmaceutical compounds phacs i e clofibric acid ibuprofen diclofenac and bisphenol a have been identified at concentrations up to 1 g l in affluent and effluent waters blair et al 2013 these studies also highlight the occurrence of phacs in drinking water at concentrations of ng l khan and nicell 2015 many of these compounds are not removed by wastewater treatment this has become a particular concern if drinking water sources include a substantial fraction of treated wastewater effluent kolpin et al 2002 pharmaceuticals as well as several chemicals used in personal care products are biologically active compounds which are designed to interact with particular biological pathways in target humans and animals at prescribed doses consequently some ppcps are well known endocrine disruptors and cause adverse effects in the reproductive system of humans and wildlife kortenkamp et al 2009 overturf et al 2015 in the environment some ppcps are quickly metabolized or degraded quickly while others persist and may also be mobile xu et al and others have reported limited breakdown of selected ppcps in the presence of agricultural soil and have attributed the differences in degradation to the differences in the indigenous microbial population of the soil xu et al 2009 however ternes and co workers have shown that biodegradation pathways of ppcps appear to be slow and persistent against bacterial degradation ternes et al 2004 yet secondary products of ppcps resulting from environmental processes have been found in water and soil li 2014 in a recent study jacobs et al highlights that breakdown of ibuprofen is 6 fold faster in the presence of organic matter e g fulvic acid jacobs et al 2011 however little is known about exact molecular level processes and the influence of environmental conditions on above degradation pathways perhaps even more importantly the toxicity of the secondary residues is unknown thus the current work attempts to fill this knowledge gap by a detail study to gain molecular level insights of fate transformation and log term health effects of ppcps and their secondary residues ppcps released to the environment are in constant interaction with soil particles a complex mixture of metals metal oxides and clay particles thus soil particles provide a reactive surface for heterogeneous chemical and photochemical reactions to occur the current study focuses on abiotic degradation pathways of a particular ppcp ibuprofen in the presence of a major mineral component of soil kaolinite clay ibuprofen was selected as a proxy for ppcps due to its high environmental abundance inherent toxicity and structural features similar to many ppcp compounds chemical and photochemical reactions of ibuprofen were also studied under light and dark conditions so as to simulate and differentiate between daytime and nighttime processing of ppcps the results of this study for the first time propose a detailed reaction mechanism for the abiotic degradation of ibuprofen starting from surface adsorption to the formation of particular secondary products further the current work evaluates the toxicity of ibuprofen and its degraded products on three microorganisms thus we provide a detailed report on potential toxic effects of degraded secondary residues a heretofore unexamined process the information will be used to interpret field observations of ppcp residues and their toxic effects on aquatic life and human health as they are transformed under various environmental conditions this work therefore contributes to our understanding of pharmaceutical mobilization in water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ibuprofen 99 5 sigma aldrich and 4 acetylbenzoic acid 98

solution was pipetted to the first well to attain the final drug concentration of 1 mm 150 μl was then transferred from the first well to the second well this 1 2 serial dilution process was repeated until the lowest test concentration 15 6 μm was obtained the effect of two solvents water and dmso was also studied to evaluate any effect on the growth of organisms additionally phenylarsine oxide pao was used as a positive control complete dead or complete killed and was tested at final concentration of about 67 μm the well plates containing b megaterium and p atlantica were incubated at 30 c with gentle shaking alternately the plate with chlorella cells was placed on a rotary shaker 72 rpm at room temperature underneath a 17 w fluorescent light on a 12 h light and dark cycle 2 4 2 toxicological assays cell densities for b megaterium p atlantica and chlorella cells were monitored through od measurements at 595 nm using microplate reader molecular devices viability of bacterial cells was further measured using standard mtt assay at 24 h 30 μl of 5 mg ml of mtt reagent was added to each well of the 96 well plate and incubated for 1 h at 30 c after the period of incubation they were solubilized in 200 μl of dmso od measurements were taken at 490 nm bd facscalibur flow cytometer was used to assess the comparative toxic effects between ibuprofen and its secondary products on algal cell size granularity shape and autofluorescence algal samples were collected at 0 24 and 48 h for flow cytometric analysis the bd cellquest pro software was used to collect the data while fcs express 5 de novo software was used for data analysis 2 5 statistical analysis all dark and light experiments were conducted in triplicate with average measurements reported reported errors represent one standard deviation variations among different treatments statistically significant at 95 confidence level were identified using the paired t test in minitab 17 results were considered significant when p value 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of kaolinite particles the surface area of the clay mineral kaolinite is 10 1 0 1 m2 g sem image of kaolinite clay sample is shown in fig 1 a it is apparent that the clays are highly irregular in shape as shown in fig 1b quartz a mineral commonly noted to be an impurity was not detected in the clay samples used in this study as determined from the crystal structure library atr ftir spectroscopy can also provide insights into the bulk and surface properties of clay minerals fig 1c displays the atr ftir spectra of clay mineral after overnight drying at 5 rh a magnified view of the spectral region from 3550 to 3750 cm 1 for kaolinite is also shown in fig 1c insert these absorptions are assigned to the characteristic peaks due to the oh stretching motion of interlayer hydroxyl groups in various positions within the clay structure schuttlefield et al 2007 these interlayer hydroxyl groups are structurally important for kaolinite reactivity because they actively participate in surface adsorption or surface catalyzed reactions schuttlefield et al 2007 in fig 1c the spectral region from 800 to 1600 cm 1 shows absorptions due to lattice vibrations such as the sio stretching motions 3 2 abiotic degradation of ibuprofen chemical and photochemical degradation of ibuprofen were investigated in the presence of kaolinite to simulate processing of ppcps under various light dependent environmental conditions to yield secondary residues due to the lower sensitivity of established toxicological assays the initial concentrations of ibp used in the current work are higher than the concentrations reported in previous environmental studies given the higher degradation rates of ibp as shown below it is expected that the amounts of ibp added to environment is even greater than that of reported and thus the amount of secondary residues generated it is also important to mention here that our preliminary studies performed with lower ibp concentrations 100 μm yielded degradation products similar to that found with starting 10 mm ibp concentration data not shown moreover these degraded products are expected to further accumulate in water bodies via biotic and abiotic mechanisms aceña et al 2017 thus the implications discussed in this work degradation and toxicological effects are transferable to the environmentally relevant conditions 3 2 1 role of clay particles the data presented in fig 2 shows kinetics of ibuprofen degradation determined from hplc analysis of remaining ibuprofen in degraded samples according to the comparison shown in fig 2a the degradation rates of ibuprofen significantly varies based on experimental conditions the degradation kinetics of ibuprofen assuming pseudo first order decay is shown in fig 2b the initial rates of degradation r determined from linear regression t 50 h rate constants k and correlation coefficients r 2 are given in table 1 in both mass normalized and surface area normalized data it can be clearly seen that the rate of ibuprofen decay in the presence of clay particles is faster and more extensive compared without clay under dark conditions the initial rate of ibuprofen decay was 0 24 0 02 10 4 m h 1 whereas no decay was observed without clay dark control at the end of 240 h the extent of ibuprofen removal was observed to be 11 however under dark conditions no secondary product formation was observed in hplc or lc ms analysis we therefore attribute the observed decay to the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay particle surfaces however based on the measured surface area of kaolinite 10 mm ibp is expected to yield a ppcp to solid ratio of 30 ibp molecules per å2 of solid where the adsorption is limited by the number of available surface sites khazri and co workers have recently showed that natural clay a mixture of smectite kaolinite and quartz can efficiently remove ibuprofen with a maximum adsorption capacity of 37 mg g 1 khazri et al 2016 based on their adsorption isotherm and ir data authors also suggest that anionic or neutral ppcps i e ibuprofen are adsorbed to the clay mineral surface via silanol groups at the sheet edges through interactional mechanisms involving van der waals interaction to gain additional molecular level insights into the behavior of ibuprofen in the presence of clay particles attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was used to investigate surface adsorption of ibuprofen on kaolinite details of solution phase atr ftir experiments are provided in supporting information fig 3 a shows several atr ftir spectra for ibuprofen adsorption on kaolinite as a function of time for comparison a solution phase spectrum of ibuprofen in the absence of kaolinite is also shown top spectrum it is important to highlight that based on the pka of ibuprofen 5 2 and measured ph of the medium 4 5 major fraction of ibuprofen 90 exist in its molecular form as a free molecule ibuprofen showed several characteristic peaks including the peak at 1719 cm 1 for the co stretching mode of the cooh group the absorption bands at 1462 and 1520 cm 1 are assigned to the quaternary carbon atom madieh et al 2007 the atr ftir surface spectra provide information on surface speciation the most prominent difference between the solution spectrum and surface adsorbed spectra is the bathochromic shift of above described vibrational modes of ibuprofen and the appearance of a new peak at 1240 cm 1 the co stretching mode is shifted by 22 cm 1 while the vibrational bands of quaternary carbon atom is shifted by 90 cm 1 similar chemical shifts have been observed in previous studies on adsorption of ibuprofen and other organic compounds on clays and aluminosilicates madieh et al 2007 siampiringue et al 2014 these vibrational shifts evidence the interactions between cooh group of ibuprofen and silanol groups on clay surface during the formation of adsorption complexes of ibuprofen on clay particles in a recent work kamarudin et al highlight that the interaction with silanol groups and cooh group occur by two different pathways kamarudin et al 2015 one pathway is via hydrogen bonding of silanol groups with the hydroxyl group of ibuprofen while the other is through ligand exchange adsorption the former pathway is favored due to the lower demand of activation energy and yields monodentate complexes kamarudin et al 2015 the interactions via ligand exchange can yield either monodentate or bidentate modes of coordination the new peak at 1240 cm 1 can be attributed to oco stretching of carboxylic acid group indicating the formation of bidentate complexes on the clay surface these different modes of coordination are illustrated in fig 3b based on an adsorption mechanism proposed by teresa and co workers benzylic carbon of the isobutyl residue may also interact with brønsted acid sites blasco 2010 3 2 2 role of sunlight the results shown in fig 2 clearly demonstrate that the degradation of ibuprofen is influenced by solar radiation the initial rate of ibuprofen degradation in the presence of only simulated sunlight uv vis is 0 34 0 03 10 4 m h 1 during the period of 240 h 38 of initial ibuprofen was degraded previous studies have highlighted photodegradation of ibuprofen via hydroxyl radicals oh iovino et al 2016 matamoros et al 2008 in the presence of a photocatalyst e g tio2 production of oh is enhanced by electron hole pairs formed on the catalyst surface georgaki et al 2014 without a catalyst oh radicals are directly produced by h2o homolysis promoted by uv light λ 185 nm iovino et al 2016 under the experimental conditions of the current work the intensity of uv c radiation of the simulated sunlight is expected to be low a more environmentally relevant condition thus the lower yield of oh radicals by h2o homolysis can partially account for the observed lower extent and degradation rates of ibuprofen compared to previous work however several recent studies have implicated the photodegradation of ibuprofen via self sensitization li et al 2015 here ibuprofen ibp transforms into excited ibuprofen ibp subsequent to absorbing photons λ 240 nm λ max 222 nm which then transfers its energy to dissolved oxygen or other oxygen rich species in the solution to generate reactive oxygen species ros i e oh h2o2 ros subsequently causes the photooxidation of ibuprofen even though these mechanisms contribute to the observed photodegradation poor overlap of emission spectrum of the simulated sunlight and absorption spectrum of free ibuprofen in solution may have yielded slower degradation rates as seen in fig 2 the photodegradation of ibuprofen is significantly enhanced in the presence of clay particles the initial rate of degradation is 1 40 0 1 10 4 m h 1 which is 4 fold higher compared to that in the absence of clay particles we observed 100 photodegradation within a period of 120 h further the decay rate of ibuprofen in the presence of clay surface is at least 6 fold higher for the irradiated sample compared to that of dark conditions here we propose that the observed enhancement in photodegradation is due to the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay particle surfaces as discussed earlier the irreversible uptake of ibuprofen results bathochromic shifts in π to π and n to π transitions these chemical shifts enhance the overlap of absorption bands of ibuprofen and emission profile of sunlight resulting higher quantum yields to produce more excited ibp and ros thus the surface adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface enhances the rate and extent of photodegradation several other studies on photodegradation have further proposed that the observed enhancement could be due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals from water adsorbed on kaolinite surface ahn et al 2006 given that the rates of surface catalyzed reactions may depend on the mass and the available surface area of the adsorbent georgaki et al 2014 both mass normalized and surface area normalized degradation rates are given in table 1 the mass normalized degradation rate 70 5 10 4 m h 1 g 1 is at least an order of magnitude higher compared to the rates reported by madhavan et al 5 10 4 m h 1 g 1 where the degradation was carried out via sonophotocatalytic mechanism madhavan et al 2010 however authors further discuss that the degradation rate increases with an increase of initial concentration thus the enhanced rates in the current study may be partly due to higher initial concentration of ibuprofen 3 2 3 formation of secondary products and possible reaction pathways formation of secondary products as a result of ibuprofen degradation in the presence of clay particles and simulated sunlight is shown in fig 4 hplc chromatograms given in fig 4a showed several new peaks in addition to the peak corresponding to ibuprofen tr 14 8 the change of relative amounts of these species as a function of reaction time is shown in fig 4b several secondary products indicated by peaks at tr 4 3 6 0 5 7 etc increase with reaction time where the product at tr 4 3 is the major species towards the end of the reaction period this was later identified as 4 acetylbenzoic acid in lc ms studies and conformed using relative retention time of the reference material further several reaction intermediates can be identified i e tr 13 5 3 6 based on their formation and consumption as a function of reaction time liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy lc ms was performed to identify these secondary products the lc ms chromatogram for the fully degraded sample after 240 h of irradiation is shown in fig 5 along with respective retention times black and m z values red under the same lc ms conditions the stock solution showed a peak at 8 13 min for ibuprofen which is absent in the degraded mixture here 4 acetylbenzoic acid tr 1 93 m z 164 was again identified as the major degradation compound followed by 4 1 carboxyethyl benzoic acid tr 4 98 m z 194 the details of identified major secondary residues are given in table 2 many of these secondary products have previously been confirmed as degradation products of ibuprofen in both direct photolysis and surface catalyzed photodegradation ding et al 2017 illés et al 2013 loaiza ambuludi et al 2013 sabri et al 2012 however little is known about the details of these reaction mechanisms in the current study three possible reaction pathways are proposed based on the identified secondary products and their variations during the reaction time these reaction pathways are illustrated in fig 6 as discussed above free ibuprofen molecule 1 is adsorbed from the aqueous medium onto the clay surface 2 and shifts its absorption profile λ max to lower wavenumbers upon exposure to solar radiation the surface adsorption complex 2 is transformed into excited ibuprofen 3 that undergoes direct and indirect degradation the photodegradation pathways described in this study involves hydroxylation oh decarboxylation co2 and demethylation ch3 one such possible route is shown by intermediates and products from 4 through 7 here the attack of oh on isobutyl substituent of adsorbed ibp structure that results in subsequent oxidation in similar studies li et al among several others also report that the hydroxylation of the benzylic carbon could be the first step of ibuprofen degradation li et al 2014 madhavan et al 2010 méndez arriaga et al 2010 in the second possible route oh attacks the benzyl carbon of the carboxylic acid residue of the adsorbed ibuprofen 3 to yield a hydroxylated compound 8 which is transformed to 4 acetlybenzoic acid 14 the most abundant secondary residue observed in this study we propose that this transformation occurs via a second hydroxylation at the benzyl carbon on the isobutyl residue of the ketone 10 to form 11 which may oxidize to isobutyrylbenzoic acid 12 though we did not observe 11 and 12 in our lc ms analysis xiang et al confirms the formation of hydroxylated benzyl ketone 11 in a similar study demethylation of compound 13 via retro aldol or a similar mechanism will yield 14 in several other studies it has also shown that oxidation of ketone group in compound 10 can occur prior to hydroxylation and form 4 isobutylbenzoic acid 15 caviglioli et al 2002 in lc ms analysis we observed several secondary residues with higher m z values i e 248 252 275 the proposed structure for m z 248 is shown as compound 16 products with such higher m z values have been observed in other ibuprofen degradation studies illés et al 2013 it is postulated that multi hydroxylation may initiate free radical reactions that could potentially grow the side chains to result secondary residues with higher m z values however it should be mentioned that future studies should be carried out on these secondary residues to further confirm their structures and formation mechanisms 3 3 toxicological studies toxicity of ibuprofen and its secondary residues were assessed on two bacterial species bacillus megaterium and pseudoaltermonas atlantica and one green algae chlorella sp it should be pointed out that these toxicological studies were mainly focused on evaluating relative health effects of primary ibp and its degraded products in this study growth rates and viability were measured using od measurements mtt assay and flow cytometry results for mtt assay were normalized using both the negative non treated and pao killed control absorbance signals from the non treated or pao treated cells were considered to be 100 viable or 100 dead respectively and used as a reference to calculate and compare the growth of bacteria undergoing treatment 3 3 1 growth inhibition of b megaterium and p atlantica at high concentrations exposure to primary ppcp ibuprofen resulted in significant reduction of viability of b megaterium and p atlantica in contrast treatment of both bacterial cells with a mixture of degraded secondary products generated from the same initial ibuprofen concentration had little impact on their viability the results of mtt viability assay are shown in fig 7 less than 50 of the b megaterium cells were viable after 1 mm ibuprofen treatment for 48 h fig 7a similarly the viability of p atlantica was reduced to about 80 when treated with 1 mm of ibuprofen fig 7b however at 0 5 mm viability decreased significantly for b megaterium p 0 007 whereas p atlantica remained unaffected p 0 106 conversely exposure of b megaterium and p atlantica to a mixture of secondary products produced little to no effect on viability of either of these bacterial species although toxicity of phototransformed ppcp mixtures has been rarely studied few studies have suggested synergistic or antagonistic effects due to pharmacokinetic interactions celander 2011 interestingly exposure to the mixture of secondary residues at a total concentration of 1 mm demonstrated a slight promotion of both b megaterium p 0 031 and p atlantica p 0 038 growth no inhibition or enhancement was observed for any lower concentrations of the secondary product mixture this could be due to a biological phenomenon called hormesis which represents a biphasic dose response promoting growth during mild chemical stress or low concentrations hashmi et al 2014 since secondary product mixture is a combination of a number of phototransformed products concentration of individual secondary residues in the mixture is much lower than that of the original primary compound ibuprofen thus the mixture of secondary residues might actually exhibit low dose bacterial growth stimulation additional biological assays were carried out using 4 acetylbenzoic acid the most abundant secondary residue no significant toxic effect was observed on either of the bacterial species nevertheless b megaterium exposed to 1 mm p 0 007 and 0 5 mm p 0 027 of 4 acetylbenzoic acid showed a small promotion of growth toxic effects of ibuprofen and its secondary products were further confirmed with growth rate analysis of both these species using od measurements si fig 2 the antibacterial property of ibuprofen has been previously discussed in several recent studies al janabi 2010 farre et al 2001 obad et al 2015 farre et al have reported the toxicity of ibuprofen on vibrio fischeri with ec50 values of 12 1 μg ml in toxalert 100 assay and 19 1 μg ml in microtox assay the mode of toxicological action of nsaids on bacteria is not fully understood however it has been suggested that the mode of action is similar to that on fungi al janabi 2010 in an earlier study it has been further shown that exposure of candida albicans to ibuprofen at a concentration of 10 mg ml results in complete dissolution of its cytoplasmic membrane pina vaz et al 2000 the non toxic effect of secondary product mixture on bacteria can be attributed to the degradation of ibuprofen to the less toxic secondary residues it can also be argued that the presence of various secondary products might give rise to an antagonistic effect which could result in no observable toxicity effect however the near absence of bacterial toxicity upon treatment to 4 acetylbenzoic acid supports the hypothesis of formation of significantly lesser toxic products 3 3 2 growth inhibition of chlorella sp given that chlorophyll a autofluorescence is a measure of algal photosynthetic activity change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the freshwater green algae was used as the indicator of ibuprofen toxicity since chlorophyll a fluorescence is usually a measure of photosystem ii psii activity the significant reduction in the fl3 signal can be attributed to the inactivation of psii reaction centers in the current study algae samples were excited at 488 nm and the fluorescence emission was determined in the red channel fl3 670 nm of the facscalibur flow cytometer fluorescence scatter plots insets in fig 8 a d were used to generate histogram plots consisting two regions of interest r1 and r2 these two regions represent negative shift inhibition of algae growth and control region normal growth respectively histograms of non treated and treated algae samples after 48 h of exposure are shown in fig 8a d number of algal cells in r1 region has increased and the number of cells in r2 region has decreased for 1 mm ibuprofen and 1 mm 4 acetylbenzoic acid treatments indicating a significant effect on algal growth in contrast 1 mm secondary products have a comparable to that of untreated control sample indicating no significant effect on algal growth quantitative analysis of fig 8e was conducted according to the following equation 1 n o n v i a b l e c e l l s n u m b e r o f c o u n t s i n r e g i o n r 1 t o t a l n u m b e r o f c o u n t s 100 exposure to ibuprofen at 0 5 mm or higher resulted in almost 100 dead cells while little or no toxicity was observed for the secondary mixture at all concentrations studied 1 mm secondary product mixture treatment of alga results no significant toxicity p 0 374 compared to the control more interestingly 4 acetylbenzoic acid showed significant toxic effects even at lower concentrations and nearly the entire algal population was killed at concentrations higher than 0 5 mm similar ibuprofen toxicity has been reported by moro et al who investigated the effect of ibuprofen on scenedesmus rubescens a freshwater green microalga moro et al 2014 algal cells demonstrated a growth inhibition and reduction in chlorophyll content upon exposure to 1 mg l of ibuprofen geiger et al 2016 in a related study jiao et al reported growth inhibition among chlorella vulgaris by 0 5 mg l of ethyl cinnamate a commonly used flavor ingredient jiao et al 2015 this study further revealed that ethyl cinnamate induces a photosynthetic toxic which significantly affect the chlorophyll fluorescence as for bacteria a decrease in toxicity would indeed due to degradation to less toxic and less abundant products indeed the variation in the effect posed by ibuprofen and its secondary products can arise from the formation of significantly less toxic metabolites however the significant toxicity due to single treatment of 4 acetylbenzoic acid could be due to the presence of the compound in high concentration compared to its relative low concentration when present in the mixture another possibility could be the significant difference in pka between the primary compound and its degraded products ibuprofen has higher reported pka value of 5 2 meloun et al 2007 whereas 4 acetylbenzoic acid has a pka value of 3 7 dewick 2006 thus based on the ph of the growth medium the distribution of neutral acid and anionic forms of ibuprofen and 4 actylebenzoic acid could show significant differences these variations can have a considerable impact in their toxic effects earlier studies conducted by franklin et al 2000 and wilde et al 2006 among others have also confirmed that toxicity in chlorella is highly ph dependent 4 conclusions this study investigated abiotic degradation pathways of ibuprofen an abundant ppcp in the presence of clay particles via chemical and photochemical reaction pathways in the absence of solar radiation the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the heterogeneous uptake of ibuprofen on to clay surface via surface silanol groups to form monodentate and bidentate modes of coordination in contrast upon irradiation ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions via clay catalyzed photoreactions the decay rates were at least 6 fold higher for irradiated samples compared to that of dark conditions the enhanced degradation rates and extent in presence of clay and solar radiation can be attributed to the bathochromic shift of absorption bands by the adsorbed ibuprofen here several reaction pathways were proposed for the abiotic degradation of ibuprofen via direct and self sensitized mechanisms that involves hydroxylation decarboxylation and demethylation the current study also evaluates the relative toxic effects of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues ibuprofen induced toxicity was far more significant than the toxicity of its secondary degraded products in all the three test organisms used in this study in general ibuprofen resulted in the reduction of growth survival rate and autofluorescence in contrast the degraded products resulted in little to no toxicity effect in all three organisms however varied degree of toxicity was observed among the test organisms when exposed to high concentrations of 4 acetylbenzoic acid the most abundant secondary compound formed in the mixture upon irradiation ppcps are considered to be a potential threat to the environment as well as human health due to their potential accumulation and magnification in aquatic systems several groups of ppcps i e disinfectants have been approved to be able to bioaccumulate and probably biomagnify and may finally cause adverse effects to human beings our current work clearly shows not only via food web but also on mineral particles phac such as ibuprofen accumulate with aquatic systems based on our findings and several others one could argue that in the past ppcp field and laboratory studies we have been looking for the wrong thing at the wrong place the reason is that we have been trying to quantify primary ppcp compounds not knowing they degrade at higher rate in the environmental time scale and if these ppcps and secondary residues partition into clay and sediments then we were looking at the wrong place thus the current study advances our knowledge and understanding in the fields of

19769,the growing medical and personal needs of human populations have escalated release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into our natural environment this work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular ppcp ibuprofen in the presence of a major mineral component of soil kaolinite clay as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation in the absence of solar radiation the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role in contrast under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions the decay rates were at least 6 fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions toxicity of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues were tested on three microorganisms bacillus megaterium pseudoaltermonas atlantica and algae from the chlorella genus the results from the biological assays show that primary ppcp is more toxic than the mixture of secondary products overall however biological assays carried out using only 4 acetylbenzoic acid the most abundant secondary product show a higher toxic effect on algae compared to its parent compound graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals photo enhanced toxicology abiotic transformation personal care products photo degradation secondary products 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are in general any product used for personal health or cosmetic reasons or used by agribusiness to enhance growth or health of livestock boxall et al 2012 majority of the ppcps emerge in the environment via medication residues that pass out of the body used or expired medications placed in the trash or personal care products washed down the shower drain overturf et al 2015 hundreds of individual ppcps have been detected at parts per billion and parts per trillion concentrations in wastewater and surface water deo 2014 in recent studies active pharmaceutical compounds phacs i e clofibric acid ibuprofen diclofenac and bisphenol a have been identified at concentrations up to 1 g l in affluent and effluent waters blair et al 2013 these studies also highlight the occurrence of phacs in drinking water at concentrations of ng l khan and nicell 2015 many of these compounds are not removed by wastewater treatment this has become a particular concern if drinking water sources include a substantial fraction of treated wastewater effluent kolpin et al 2002 pharmaceuticals as well as several chemicals used in personal care products are biologically active compounds which are designed to interact with particular biological pathways in target humans and animals at prescribed doses consequently some ppcps are well known endocrine disruptors and cause adverse effects in the reproductive system of humans and wildlife kortenkamp et al 2009 overturf et al 2015 in the environment some ppcps are quickly metabolized or degraded quickly while others persist and may also be mobile xu et al and others have reported limited breakdown of selected ppcps in the presence of agricultural soil and have attributed the differences in degradation to the differences in the indigenous microbial population of the soil xu et al 2009 however ternes and co workers have shown that biodegradation pathways of ppcps appear to be slow and persistent against bacterial degradation ternes et al 2004 yet secondary products of ppcps resulting from environmental processes have been found in water and soil li 2014 in a recent study jacobs et al highlights that breakdown of ibuprofen is 6 fold faster in the presence of organic matter e g fulvic acid jacobs et al 2011 however little is known about exact molecular level processes and the influence of environmental conditions on above degradation pathways perhaps even more importantly the toxicity of the secondary residues is unknown thus the current work attempts to fill this knowledge gap by a detail study to gain molecular level insights of fate transformation and log term health effects of ppcps and their secondary residues ppcps released to the environment are in constant interaction with soil particles a complex mixture of metals metal oxides and clay particles thus soil particles provide a reactive surface for heterogeneous chemical and photochemical reactions to occur the current study focuses on abiotic degradation pathways of a particular ppcp ibuprofen in the presence of a major mineral component of soil kaolinite clay ibuprofen was selected as a proxy for ppcps due to its high environmental abundance inherent toxicity and structural features similar to many ppcp compounds chemical and photochemical reactions of ibuprofen were also studied under light and dark conditions so as to simulate and differentiate between daytime and nighttime processing of ppcps the results of this study for the first time propose a detailed reaction mechanism for the abiotic degradation of ibuprofen starting from surface adsorption to the formation of particular secondary products further the current work evaluates the toxicity of ibuprofen and its degraded products on three microorganisms thus we provide a detailed report on potential toxic effects of degraded secondary residues a heretofore unexamined process the information will be used to interpret field observations of ppcp residues and their toxic effects on aquatic life and human health as they are transformed under various environmental conditions this work therefore contributes to our understanding of pharmaceutical mobilization in water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ibuprofen 99 5 sigma aldrich and 4 acetylbenzoic acid 98

toxicological assays cell densities for b megaterium p atlantica and chlorella cells were monitored through od measurements at 595 nm using microplate reader molecular devices viability of bacterial cells was further measured using standard mtt assay at 24 h 30 μl of 5 mg ml of mtt reagent was added to each well of the 96 well plate and incubated for 1 h at 30 c after the period of incubation they were solubilized in 200 μl of dmso od measurements were taken at 490 nm bd facscalibur flow cytometer was used to assess the comparative toxic effects between ibuprofen and its secondary products

significant when p value 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of kaolinite particles the surface area of the clay mineral kaolinite is 10 1 0 1 m2 g sem image of kaolinite clay sample is shown in fig 1 a it is apparent that the clays are highly irregular in shape as shown in fig 1b quartz a mineral commonly noted to be an impurity was not detected in the clay samples used in this study as determined from the crystal structure library atr ftir spectroscopy can also provide insights into the bulk and surface properties of clay minerals fig 1c displays the atr ftir spectra of clay mineral after overnight drying at 5 rh a magnified view of the spectral region from 3550 to 3750 cm 1 for kaolinite is also shown in fig 1c insert these absorptions are assigned to the characteristic peaks due to the oh stretching motion of interlayer hydroxyl groups in various positions within the clay structure schuttlefield et al 2007 these interlayer hydroxyl groups are structurally important for kaolinite reactivity because they actively participate in surface adsorption or surface catalyzed reactions schuttlefield et al 2007 in fig 1c the spectral region from 800 to 1600 cm 1 shows absorptions due to lattice vibrations such as the sio stretching motions 3 2 abiotic degradation of ibuprofen chemical and photochemical degradation of ibuprofen were investigated in the presence of kaolinite to simulate processing of ppcps under various light dependent environmental conditions to yield secondary residues due to the lower sensitivity of established toxicological assays the initial concentrations of ibp used in the current work are higher than the concentrations reported in previous environmental studies given the higher degradation rates of ibp as shown below it is expected that the amounts of ibp added to environment is even greater than that of reported and thus the amount of secondary residues generated it is also important to mention here that our preliminary studies performed with lower ibp concentrations 100 μm yielded degradation products similar to that found with starting 10 mm ibp concentration data not shown moreover these degraded products are expected to further accumulate in water bodies via biotic and abiotic mechanisms aceña et al 2017 thus the implications discussed in this work degradation and toxicological effects are transferable to the environmentally relevant conditions 3 2 1 role of clay particles the data presented in fig 2 shows kinetics of ibuprofen degradation determined from hplc analysis of remaining ibuprofen in degraded samples according to the comparison shown in fig 2a the degradation rates of ibuprofen significantly varies based on experimental conditions the degradation kinetics of ibuprofen assuming pseudo first order decay is shown in fig 2b the initial rates of degradation r determined from linear regression t 50 h rate constants k and correlation coefficients r 2 are given in table 1 in both mass normalized and surface area normalized data it can be clearly seen that the rate of ibuprofen decay in the presence of clay particles is faster and more extensive compared without clay under dark conditions the initial rate of ibuprofen decay was 0 24 0 02 10 4 m h 1 whereas no decay was observed without clay dark control at the end of 240 h the extent of ibuprofen removal was observed to be 11 however under dark conditions no secondary product formation was observed in hplc or lc ms analysis we therefore attribute the observed decay to the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay particle surfaces however based on the measured surface area of kaolinite 10 mm ibp is expected to yield a ppcp to solid ratio of 30 ibp molecules per å2 of solid where the adsorption is limited by the number of available surface sites khazri and co workers have recently showed that natural clay a mixture of smectite kaolinite and quartz can efficiently remove ibuprofen with a maximum adsorption capacity of 37 mg g 1 khazri et al 2016 based on their adsorption isotherm and ir data authors also suggest that anionic or neutral ppcps i e ibuprofen are adsorbed to the clay mineral surface via silanol groups at the sheet edges through interactional mechanisms involving van der waals interaction to gain additional molecular level insights into the behavior of ibuprofen in the presence of clay particles attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was used to investigate surface adsorption of ibuprofen on kaolinite details of solution phase atr ftir experiments are provided in supporting information fig 3 a shows several atr ftir spectra for ibuprofen adsorption on kaolinite as a function of time for comparison a solution phase spectrum of ibuprofen in the absence of kaolinite is also shown top spectrum it is important to highlight that based on the pka of ibuprofen 5 2 and measured ph of the medium 4 5 major fraction of ibuprofen 90 exist in its molecular form as a free molecule ibuprofen showed several characteristic peaks including the peak at 1719 cm 1 for the co stretching mode of the cooh group the absorption bands at 1462 and 1520 cm 1 are assigned to the quaternary carbon atom madieh et al 2007 the atr ftir surface spectra provide information on surface speciation the most prominent difference between the solution spectrum and surface adsorbed spectra is the bathochromic shift of above described vibrational modes of ibuprofen and the appearance of a new peak at 1240 cm 1 the co stretching mode is shifted by 22 cm 1 while the vibrational bands of quaternary carbon atom is shifted by 90 cm 1 similar chemical shifts have been observed in previous studies on adsorption of ibuprofen and other organic compounds on clays and aluminosilicates madieh et al 2007 siampiringue et al 2014 these vibrational shifts evidence the interactions between cooh group of ibuprofen and silanol groups on clay surface during the formation of adsorption complexes of ibuprofen on clay particles in a recent work kamarudin et al highlight that the interaction with silanol groups and cooh group occur by two different pathways kamarudin et al 2015 one pathway is via hydrogen bonding of silanol groups with the hydroxyl group of ibuprofen while the other is through ligand exchange adsorption the former pathway is favored due to the lower demand of activation energy and yields monodentate complexes kamarudin et al 2015 the interactions via ligand exchange can yield either monodentate or bidentate modes of coordination the new peak at 1240 cm 1 can be attributed to oco stretching of carboxylic acid group indicating the formation of bidentate complexes on the clay surface these different modes of coordination are illustrated in fig 3b based on an adsorption mechanism proposed by teresa and co workers benzylic carbon of the isobutyl residue may also interact with brønsted acid sites blasco 2010 3 2 2 role of sunlight the results shown in fig 2 clearly demonstrate that the degradation of ibuprofen is influenced by solar radiation the initial rate of ibuprofen degradation in the presence of only simulated sunlight uv vis is 0 34 0 03 10 4 m h 1 during the period of 240 h 38 of initial ibuprofen was degraded previous studies have highlighted photodegradation of ibuprofen via hydroxyl radicals oh iovino et al 2016 matamoros et al 2008 in the presence of a photocatalyst e g tio2 production of oh is enhanced by electron hole pairs formed on the catalyst surface georgaki et al 2014 without a catalyst oh radicals are directly produced by h2o homolysis promoted by uv light λ 185 nm iovino et al 2016 under the experimental conditions of the current work the intensity of uv c radiation of the simulated sunlight is expected to be low a more environmentally relevant condition thus the lower yield of oh radicals by h2o homolysis can partially account for the observed lower extent and degradation rates of ibuprofen compared to previous work however several recent studies have implicated the photodegradation of ibuprofen via self sensitization li et al 2015 here ibuprofen ibp transforms into excited ibuprofen ibp subsequent to absorbing photons λ 240 nm λ max 222 nm which then transfers its energy to dissolved oxygen or other oxygen rich species in the solution to generate reactive oxygen species ros i e oh h2o2 ros subsequently causes the photooxidation of ibuprofen even though these mechanisms contribute to the observed photodegradation poor overlap of emission spectrum of the simulated sunlight and absorption spectrum of free ibuprofen in solution may have yielded slower degradation rates as seen in fig 2 the photodegradation of ibuprofen is significantly enhanced in the presence of clay particles the initial rate of degradation is 1 40 0 1 10 4 m h 1 which is 4 fold higher compared to that in the absence of clay particles we observed 100 photodegradation within a period of 120 h further the decay rate of ibuprofen in the presence of clay surface is at least 6 fold higher for the irradiated sample compared to that of dark conditions here we propose that the observed enhancement in photodegradation is due to the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay particle surfaces as discussed earlier the irreversible uptake of ibuprofen results bathochromic shifts in π to π and n to π transitions these chemical shifts enhance the overlap of absorption bands of ibuprofen and emission profile of sunlight resulting higher quantum yields to produce more excited ibp and ros thus the surface adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface enhances the rate and extent of photodegradation several other studies on photodegradation have further proposed that the observed enhancement could be due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals from water adsorbed on kaolinite surface ahn et al 2006 given that the rates of surface catalyzed reactions may depend on the mass and the available surface area of the adsorbent georgaki et al 2014 both mass normalized and surface area normalized degradation rates are given in table 1 the mass normalized degradation rate 70 5 10 4 m h 1 g 1 is at least an order of magnitude higher compared to the rates reported by madhavan et al 5 10 4 m h 1 g 1 where the degradation was carried out via sonophotocatalytic mechanism madhavan et al 2010 however authors further discuss that the degradation rate increases with an increase of initial concentration thus the enhanced rates in the current study may be partly due to higher initial concentration of ibuprofen 3 2 3 formation of secondary products and possible reaction pathways formation of secondary products as a result of ibuprofen degradation in the presence of clay particles and simulated sunlight is shown in fig 4 hplc chromatograms given in fig 4a showed several new peaks in addition to the peak corresponding to ibuprofen tr 14 8 the change of relative amounts of these species as a function of reaction time is shown in fig 4b several secondary products indicated by peaks at tr 4 3 6 0 5 7 etc increase with reaction time where the product at tr 4 3 is the major species towards the end of the reaction period this was later identified as 4 acetylbenzoic acid in lc ms studies and conformed using relative retention time of the reference material further several reaction intermediates can be identified i e tr 13 5 3 6 based on their formation and consumption as a function of reaction time liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy lc ms was performed to identify these secondary products the lc ms chromatogram for the fully degraded sample after 240 h of irradiation is shown in fig 5 along with respective retention times black and m z values red under the same lc ms conditions the stock solution showed a peak at 8 13 min for ibuprofen which is absent in the degraded mixture here 4 acetylbenzoic acid tr 1 93 m z 164 was again identified as the major degradation compound followed by 4 1 carboxyethyl benzoic acid tr 4 98 m z 194 the details of identified major secondary residues are given in table 2 many of these secondary products have previously been confirmed as degradation products of ibuprofen in both direct photolysis and surface catalyzed photodegradation ding et al 2017 illés et al 2013 loaiza ambuludi et al 2013 sabri et al 2012 however little is known about the details of these reaction mechanisms in the current study three possible reaction pathways are proposed based on the identified secondary products and their variations during the reaction time these reaction pathways are illustrated in fig 6 as discussed above free ibuprofen molecule 1 is adsorbed from the aqueous medium onto the clay surface 2 and shifts its absorption profile λ max to lower wavenumbers upon exposure to solar radiation the surface adsorption complex 2 is transformed into excited ibuprofen 3 that undergoes direct and indirect degradation the photodegradation pathways described in this study involves hydroxylation oh decarboxylation co2 and demethylation ch3 one such possible route is shown by intermediates and products from 4 through 7 here the attack of oh on isobutyl substituent of adsorbed ibp structure that results in subsequent oxidation in similar studies li et al among several others also report that the hydroxylation of the benzylic carbon could be the first step of ibuprofen degradation li et al 2014 madhavan et al 2010 méndez arriaga et al 2010 in the second possible route oh attacks the benzyl carbon of the carboxylic acid residue of the adsorbed ibuprofen 3 to yield a hydroxylated compound 8 which is transformed to 4 acetlybenzoic acid 14 the most abundant secondary residue observed in this study we propose that this transformation occurs via a second hydroxylation at the benzyl carbon on the isobutyl residue of the ketone 10 to form 11 which may oxidize to isobutyrylbenzoic acid 12 though we did not observe 11 and 12 in our lc ms analysis xiang et al confirms the formation of hydroxylated benzyl ketone 11 in a similar study demethylation of compound 13 via retro aldol or a similar mechanism will yield 14 in several other studies it has also shown that oxidation of ketone group in compound 10 can occur prior to hydroxylation and form 4 isobutylbenzoic acid 15 caviglioli et al 2002 in lc ms analysis we observed several secondary residues with higher m z values i e 248 252 275 the proposed structure for m z 248 is shown as compound 16 products with such higher m z values have been observed in other ibuprofen degradation studies illés et al 2013 it is postulated that multi hydroxylation may initiate free radical reactions that could potentially grow the side chains to result secondary residues with higher m z values however it should be mentioned that future studies should be carried out on these secondary residues to further confirm their structures and formation mechanisms 3 3 toxicological studies toxicity of ibuprofen and its secondary residues were assessed on two bacterial species bacillus megaterium and pseudoaltermonas atlantica and one green algae chlorella sp it should be pointed out that these toxicological studies were mainly focused on evaluating relative health effects of primary ibp and its degraded products in this study growth rates and viability were measured using od measurements mtt assay and flow cytometry results for mtt assay were normalized using both the negative non treated and pao killed control absorbance signals from the non treated or pao treated cells were considered to be 100 viable or 100 dead respectively and used as a reference to calculate and compare the growth of bacteria undergoing treatment 3 3 1 growth inhibition of b megaterium and p atlantica at high concentrations exposure to primary ppcp ibuprofen resulted in significant reduction of viability of b megaterium and p atlantica in contrast treatment of both bacterial cells with a mixture of degraded secondary products generated from the same initial ibuprofen concentration had little impact on their viability the results of mtt viability assay are shown in fig 7 less than 50 of the b megaterium cells were viable after 1 mm ibuprofen treatment for 48 h fig 7a similarly the viability of p atlantica was reduced to about 80 when treated with 1 mm of ibuprofen fig 7b however at 0 5 mm viability decreased significantly for b megaterium p 0 007 whereas p atlantica remained unaffected p 0 106 conversely exposure of b megaterium and p atlantica to a mixture of secondary products produced little to no effect on viability of either of these bacterial species although toxicity of phototransformed ppcp mixtures has been rarely studied few studies have suggested synergistic or antagonistic effects due to pharmacokinetic interactions celander 2011 interestingly exposure to the mixture of secondary residues at a total concentration of 1 mm demonstrated a slight promotion of both b megaterium p 0 031 and p atlantica p 0 038 growth no inhibition or enhancement was observed for any lower concentrations of the secondary product mixture this could be due to a biological phenomenon called hormesis which represents a biphasic dose response promoting growth during mild chemical stress or low concentrations hashmi et al 2014 since secondary product mixture is a combination of a number of phototransformed products concentration of individual secondary residues in the mixture is much lower than that of the original primary compound ibuprofen thus the mixture of secondary residues might actually exhibit low dose bacterial growth stimulation additional biological assays were carried out using 4 acetylbenzoic acid the most abundant secondary residue no significant toxic effect was observed on either of the bacterial species nevertheless b megaterium exposed to 1 mm p 0 007 and 0 5 mm p 0 027 of 4 acetylbenzoic acid showed a small promotion of growth toxic effects of ibuprofen and its secondary products were further confirmed with growth rate analysis of both these species using od measurements si fig 2 the antibacterial property of ibuprofen has been previously discussed in several recent studies al janabi 2010 farre et al 2001 obad et al 2015 farre et al have reported the toxicity of ibuprofen on vibrio fischeri with ec50 values of 12 1 μg ml in toxalert 100 assay and 19 1 μg ml in microtox assay the mode of toxicological action of nsaids on bacteria is not fully understood however it has been suggested that the mode of action is similar to that on fungi al janabi 2010 in an earlier study it has been further shown that exposure of candida albicans to ibuprofen at a concentration of 10 mg ml results in complete dissolution of its cytoplasmic membrane pina vaz et al 2000 the non toxic effect of secondary product mixture on bacteria can be attributed to the degradation of ibuprofen to the less toxic secondary residues it can also be argued that the presence of various secondary products might give rise to an antagonistic effect which could result in no observable toxicity effect however the near absence of bacterial toxicity upon treatment to 4 acetylbenzoic acid supports the hypothesis of formation of significantly lesser toxic products 3 3 2 growth inhibition of chlorella sp given that chlorophyll a autofluorescence is a measure of algal photosynthetic activity change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the freshwater green algae was used as the indicator of ibuprofen toxicity since chlorophyll a fluorescence is usually a measure of photosystem ii psii activity the significant reduction in the fl3 signal can be attributed to the inactivation of psii reaction centers in the current study algae samples were excited at 488 nm and the fluorescence emission was determined in the red channel fl3 670 nm of the facscalibur flow cytometer fluorescence scatter plots insets in fig 8 a d were used to generate histogram plots consisting two regions of interest r1 and r2 these two regions represent negative shift inhibition of algae growth and control region normal growth respectively histograms of non treated and treated algae samples after 48 h of exposure are shown in fig 8a d number of algal cells in r1 region has increased and the number of cells in r2 region has decreased for 1 mm ibuprofen and 1 mm 4 acetylbenzoic acid treatments indicating a significant effect on algal growth in contrast 1 mm secondary products have a comparable to that of untreated control sample indicating no significant effect on algal growth quantitative analysis of fig 8e was conducted according to the following equation 1 n o n v i a b l e c e l l s n u m b e r o f c o u n t s i n r e g i o n r 1 t o t a l n u m b e r o f c o u n t s 100 exposure to ibuprofen at 0 5 mm or higher resulted in almost 100 dead cells while little or no toxicity was observed for the secondary mixture at all concentrations studied 1 mm secondary product mixture treatment of alga results no significant toxicity p 0 374 compared to the control more interestingly 4 acetylbenzoic acid showed significant toxic effects even at lower concentrations and nearly the entire algal population was killed at concentrations higher than 0 5 mm similar ibuprofen toxicity has been reported by moro et al who investigated the effect of ibuprofen on scenedesmus rubescens a freshwater green microalga moro et al 2014 algal cells demonstrated a growth inhibition and reduction in chlorophyll content upon exposure to 1 mg l of ibuprofen geiger et al 2016 in a related study jiao et al reported growth inhibition among chlorella vulgaris by 0 5 mg l of ethyl cinnamate a commonly used flavor ingredient jiao et al 2015 this study further revealed that ethyl cinnamate induces a photosynthetic toxic which significantly affect the chlorophyll fluorescence as for bacteria a decrease in toxicity would indeed due to degradation to less toxic and less abundant products indeed the variation in the effect posed by ibuprofen and its secondary products can arise from the formation of significantly less toxic metabolites however the significant toxicity due to single treatment of 4 acetylbenzoic acid could be due to the presence of the compound in high concentration compared to its relative low concentration when present in the mixture another possibility could be the significant difference in pka between the primary compound and its degraded products ibuprofen has higher reported pka value of 5 2 meloun et al 2007 whereas 4 acetylbenzoic acid has a pka value of 3 7 dewick 2006 thus based on the ph of the growth medium the distribution of neutral acid and anionic forms of ibuprofen and 4 actylebenzoic acid could show significant differences these variations can have a considerable impact in their toxic effects earlier studies conducted by franklin et al 2000 and wilde et al 2006 among others have also confirmed that toxicity in chlorella is highly ph dependent 4 conclusions this study investigated abiotic degradation pathways of ibuprofen an abundant ppcp in the presence of clay particles via chemical and photochemical reaction pathways in the absence of solar radiation the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the heterogeneous uptake of ibuprofen on to clay surface via surface silanol groups to form monodentate and bidentate modes of coordination in contrast upon irradiation ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions via clay catalyzed photoreactions the decay rates were at least 6 fold higher for irradiated samples compared to that of dark conditions the enhanced degradation rates and extent in presence of clay and solar radiation can be attributed to the bathochromic shift of absorption bands by the adsorbed ibuprofen here several reaction pathways were proposed for the abiotic degradation of ibuprofen via direct and self sensitized mechanisms that involves hydroxylation decarboxylation and demethylation the current study also evaluates the relative toxic effects of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues ibuprofen induced toxicity was far more significant than the toxicity of its secondary degraded products in all the three test organisms used in this study in general ibuprofen resulted in the reduction of growth survival rate and autofluorescence in contrast the degraded products resulted in little to no toxicity effect in all three organisms however varied degree of toxicity was observed among the test organisms when exposed to high concentrations of 4 acetylbenzoic acid the most abundant secondary compound formed in the mixture upon irradiation ppcps are considered to be a potential threat to the environment as well as human health due to their potential accumulation and magnification in aquatic systems several groups of ppcps i e disinfectants have been approved to be able to bioaccumulate and probably biomagnify and may finally cause adverse effects to human beings our current work clearly shows not only via food web but also on mineral particles phac such as ibuprofen accumulate with aquatic systems based on our findings and several others one could argue that in the past ppcp field and laboratory studies we have been looking for the wrong thing at the wrong place the reason is that we have been trying to quantify primary ppcp compounds not knowing they degrade at higher rate in the environmental time scale and if these ppcps and secondary residues partition into clay and sediments then we were looking at the wrong place thus the current study advances our knowledge and understanding in the fields of
