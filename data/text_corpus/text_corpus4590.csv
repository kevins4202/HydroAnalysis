22950,in the offshore oil industry fpso floating production storage and offloading units play a leading role for the production processing and storage of oil the hull girder strength of fpso which is related to the safety and economic aspects is usually designed based on engineers experience in this study a novel method is presented to optimize the fpso design parameters which mainly affect the hull girder strength the proposed method employs an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm ifoa and ifoa bp model which combines ifoa and back propagation bp neural network firstly the ifoa bp model maps the nonlinear relations between the input and output variables and then the reserved network can predict the stress value of critical position and the self weight of fpso for any set of design parameters the numerical results indicate that the ifoa bp model has a remarkable predication ability further the reserved ifoa bp model and the proposed ifoa is used to search for the optimal set of design parameters compared with the contrastive design the optimal set of design parameters obtained using the proposed method gives lower stress value of critical position and smaller self weight of fpso the optimization results show the advance and superiority of the proposed method keywords fpso parameter optimization fruit fly optimization algorithm back propagation neural network stress 1 introduction due to the limitation of oil exploration and exploitation on the land a great many efforts are made to develop the offshore oil and gas industry which needs many advanced technologies and installations nishimoto et al 2002 the two most common types of offshore oil production setups are classified as platform based and ship shaped installations generally the ship shaped floating units have the following advantages 1 large deck area 2 low cost sensitivity to variations in depth and 3 easy installation and relocation mespaque et al 2012 one of the representative ship shaped offshore installations is the fpso floating production storage and offloading units fpsos can store produced treated oil and transfer it to the shuttle tankers for shipment instead of a pipeline to transport to the shore due to the capability of economically producing oil in deep water and remote areas fpsos have opened the vast frontier of the world s oceans to oil production and many new fpsos will be designed and installed in the coming years therefore it is necessary to focus more on the study of fpso structural design in general it is unrealistic to move fpsos to avoid severe weather during their service life chen 2016 thus they are subjected to much harsher environmental loads as compared with trading tankers structural design is critical to ensure the fpso strength and the hull girder strength assessment is one of the most vital parts of fpso design and structural assessment especially under some severe loading conditions the safety and economic aspects require structural optimization actually many classification societies such as american bureau of shipping abs and det norske veritas ndv have their methods and software for the optimization of fpso design ma et al 2014 in these methods the design and optimization procedure generally includes 1 determining the dimensions 2 rule check and 3 direct strength calculations in the first step designer s experience plays a vital role when confirming preliminary dimensions for the designed structure rule check is carried out according to the special standards set out by the classification societies generally the third step is for the direct strength and fatigue life calculations based on three dimensional fea finite element analysis results and many other theories such as linear elastic analysis and nonlinear analysis wang et al 2011 the smith method smith 1977 smith 1975 the incremental iterative approach sun and wang 2005 the idealized structural unit method ueda and rashed 1984 and so on essentially the optimization of fpso design largely relies on human experience for a given set of design parameters the results can be obtained by following the previous procedure any changes in these parameters require to execute the whole procedure and the results may be very different by using the above method a better set of design parameters could be obtained however it is quite difficult to find a global optimal combination of design parameters it is even more difficult almost impossible if there exist more design parameters thus a more efficient and robust method is needed to optimize fpso design parameters in recent years due to the remarkable performance of robust and non linear mapping artificial neural network ann are frequently used to solve engineering optimization problems yu and xu 2014 in fact ann can build a mapping network with several layers to simulate the relations between the known inputs and outputs during training process ahmadizar et al 2015 the major advantage of ann is that it can predict the results with a high precision and a fast speed after a neural network is properly trained using some existing samples ganjefar and tofighi 2017 if there are enough mapping results of known parameter combinations it is possible to forecast the mapping results of any unknown parameter combinations therefore ann can be applied in many fields tsai et al used ann to build a data driven prediction model to forecast the wave heights along a ship s route during hurricanes tsai et al 2018 based on 14 groups of experimental data ma et al built an ann predictive model to determine the heat transfer coefficient of supercritical water ma et al 2017 shafabakhsh et al 2015 presented a method which employs ann to evaluate the final strain of hot mix asphalt mixtures in general ann model includes many control parameters which decide the performance of ann sanchez et al 2017 over the years researchers found that it can promote the performance of ann to combine it with intelligent algorithms in detail these algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso are used for optimizing the control parameters further to improve the prediction ability of ann when solving various optimization problems for example in order to predict the electrical energy demand in smart grid islam et al combined bp neural network with chaos search ga islam et al 2017 huang et al proposed another novel method which combines bp neural network with pod proper orthogonal decomposition to predict the wind pressure coefficients on building surface huang et al 2017 as a new evolutionary approach fruit fly optimization algorithm foa was presented in 2012 pan 2012 foa is abstracted from the foraging behavior of fruit flies shen et al 2016a generally foa and its variants have some advantages such as less parameters simpler structure and easier for understanding meng and pan 2017 yu et al 2016 therefore the variants of foa have been applied in many engineering and scientific fields kanarachos et al 2017 such as multi dimensional function optimization problem pan et al 2014 medical diagnosis shen et al 2016b and forecasting power loads li et al 2013 in foa the swarm would gather at the location with the best fitness in every iteration which means that foa can achieve a good solution in a fast speed on the other hand it makes the foa tend be trapped in a local extreme jiang and yang 2016 wu et al 2018 in fact the search scope of fruit fly swarm depends on the iteration step which is a fixed value in the original foa apparently a larger iteration step value can result in a faster convergence on the other hand a smaller iteration step value is more conducive to finding the global optimum in an exact range thus some researchers proposed new mechanisms to adjust the iteration step value pan et al 2014 proposed a variant called iffo in which a control parameter is used to tune the search scope from maximum to minimum along with the increase of iteration number zuo et al 2017 presented a novel strategy in which a standard deviation δ l o g m 1 m α x i x b is used to represent the search range m is the iteration number α 2 x i is the position of the i th individual and x b is the best location of the current population a variation coefficient and a disturbance coefficient were proposed by xu et al to change the search range xu et al 2017 according to this method an individual with lower fitness value will search for food in a bigger range and if the best location of the fruit fly swarm remains unchanged for several iterations the disturbance coefficient will take effect and the individual will search for optimum in a much bigger scope hu et al 2017 introduced a decreasing iteration step value r i r r 1 e 6 12 m m r is the initial step value m is maximum iteration number and m is the current iteration number in summary most of these mechanisms suggest that the search radius should become small along with the increase of iteration number and the iteration step value should increase if the swarm falls into a local extreme wu et al 2018 in this study a novel improved foa ifoa is proposed unlike the original foa and existing variants the proposed ifoa includes an adaptively changing iteration step value in detail the iteration step value decreases with the increasing iteration number at the beginning of the iteration process and further changes like a sinusoidal function during the second half of the iteration process the adaptively changing iteration step value ensures that ifoa draws close to global extreme with a fast speed and at the same time has the ability to search for global extreme in exact scope especially the alternant increase and decrease of iteration step value in the second half of the iteration process can keep balance between the optimization precision and ability of jumping out of local extreme for the purpose of optimizing the fpso design parameters the bp neural network is employed to combine with ifoa and then an ifoa bp model is formed the major contributions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 introducing an adaptively changing iteration step value for foa 2 proposing an ifoa bp model with a high prediction accuracy and 3 presenting a new method for the parameter optimization of fpso design further extending the way of design optimization for other offshore structures to verify the performance of ifoa bp model it is utilized to predict the stress value at the critical position and the self weight of fpso based on 144 sets of training data obtained by fea the numerical results show that ifoa bp model has better prediction ability as compared to the standard bp ga bp and foa bp models finally the reserved ifoa bp model and ifoa are used to search for the best set of fpso design parameters the subsequent sections are organized as follows section 2 defines the four design parameters of fpso section 3 describes the improved foa and the detailed ifoa bp neural network the predicted results of ifoa bp model and the discussion are shown in section 4 the results of parameter optimization for fpso design by using the ifoa bp model and the ifoa are presented in section 5 section 6 concludes the work 2 design parameters of fpso generally fpso unit involves hull structure oil and gas processing system mooring system offloading system etc the strength of hull structure is closely related to the safety of fpso the objective of this study is to find the best combination of fpso design parameters which can generate a higher hull girder strength and a smaller self weight during fpso s service life the hull girder is predominantly loaded by vertical wave induced bending moment vwbm and still water bending moment swbm the swbm is decided by the longitudinal distribution of the self weight the deadweight or the cargo the vwbm is a result of wave action sun and bai 2003 in fact the two kinds of peak values may not occur at the same time and many methods are proposed to combine them such as the turskra s rule ferry borges method and load coincidence method thus two extreme working conditions ballast draft working condition and full load working condition which cause the hogging and sagging conditions are shown in fig 1 usually the maximum bending moment in sagging condition is higher than that in hogging condition for fpso in this study the key parameters of the objective fpso are shown in table 1 and the maximum combined bending moment in sagging condition is set to 7 2 109 n m usually it is a reasonable way to check the stress value at the critical position to assess the hull girder strength of fpso as shown in fig 2 which is an abridged general section view previous researches have shown that the critical position of fpso hull girder is the connection of the transverse frame and the longitudinal keel chen et al 2014 actually the stress value at the critical position is related to many fpso design parameters the detailed structures of fpso are shown in fig 3 in this study four parameters which have significant impact on the hull girder strength of fpso are considered when optimizing the fpso structural design as shown in fig 3 the four parameters are x 1 the thickness of longitudinal bulkheads x 2 the thickness of stiffened panels in the center cargo oil tanks x 3 the thickness of stiffened panels in the larboard and starboard cargo oil tanks and x 4 the thickness of double bottom structures all the four parameters are related to the main structures of hull girder according to the current standards and engineering practice the ranges of the four design parameters are x 1 10 25 x 2 15 25 x 3 10 20 and x 4 10 25 unit mm a suitable set of design parameters must fall in these ranges besides the self weight which is related to the building costs of fpso should also be considered marino et al 2016 according to the abs guidance notes on safehull finite element analysis of hull structures abs 2004a a reasonable length section of the whole fpso can replace the target fpso in the middle and extend approximately the length of the adjacent holds fore and after and there should be a short extension beyond the transverse bulkheads at both ends abs 2004a therefore a 60 m length section of the whole fpso rather than the full length model is adopted when carrying out the simulation as shown in fig 4 in detail the fpso section with two fixed ends is loaded by the hydrostatic pressure of sea water the hydrostatic pressure of cargo oil the structural weight and the pressure force on the main deck as shown in fig 4 a further the model is meshed into fea elements finally the stress value at the critical position is obtained by operating the simulation in this study all the stress values are equivalent stress it is worth mentioning that the maximum bending moment which happens at the mid ship section of 60 m fpso section must be equal to the value of combined bending moment in order to generate the correct stress level as in the real condition 3 ifoa bp neural network 3 1 foa and its variant ifoa 3 1 1 original foa as an ordinary insect fruit fly has superior osphresis and vision than other species during hunting for food fruit flies firstly search for food by smelling the food scents after getting close to the food source flies will use the outstanding vision to find food and gather at the location of other individuals meng and pan 2017 inspired by this behavior foa is proposed by pan 2012 actually two steps are included in the optimization procedure in the original foa at the first step called osphresis foraging step fruit flies search for food in a randomly way around their locations at the second step called vision foraging step fruit flies find food and other individuals by sharp vision meng and pan 2017 the two steps are repeated until the swarm successfully find the food the detailed iteration procedure of original foa is illustrated in fig 5 3 1 2 an improved foa ifoa in foa the iteration step value isv denoted by r can be considered as the maximum radius of the search scope with a larger isv the optimization process is faster and individuals get close to the food source with a fast speed with a smaller isv the fruit fly swarm search for the food in an exact range especially in the second half of the optimization process besides it is hoped that isv will become bigger if the swarm falling into a local extreme therefore an adaptively changing isv which can become bigger or smaller is proposed given the initial isv r r m is the isv in the m th iteration it is calculated as follows 1 r m m m m 2 r r m i n r m i n m m r a s i n m m c π m m π 2 r m i n r a m m where m is a given iteration number r m i n is the minimum of isv r a is the changing amplitude of isv and c is a constant the explanations for these parameters can be refer to the changing curve of isv shown in fig 6 from fig 6 the following information and conclusions can be obtained 1 from the first iteration to the m th iteration r m will decrease as m increases especially at the beginning stage of the algorithm a larger r m can ensure the algorithm converges to a good solution with a faster speed then with the iterative number increasing r m becomes smaller so that the fruit flies search for the global optimal solution in an exact search scope which depends on the isv from formula 1 it is known that when m 0 r m r and when m m r m r m i n 2 in the second half of the algorithm r m is changing like a sinusoidal function such that it can become bigger and smaller alternately the changing amplitude is r a and the number of cycles is c since bigger isv brings faster search speed and smaller isv brings higher search accuracy the adaptively changing isv is beneficiary for balancing the search speed and search accuracy when searching for the best solution moreover as reported by many researchers yuan et al 2014 the original foa cannot solve the optimization problem in which the optimal solution is in negative domain thus for the purpose of overcoming this disadvantage of original foa pan et al 2014 and yuan et al 2014 advised that the fitness values of fruit flies can be calculated directly in the decision space of the function in this study similar method is adopted in detail assuming that f x a multidimensional optimization problem s m e l l i m which is the fitness value of individual x i m can be calculated as follows 2 s m e l l i m f x i m integrating the adaptively changing isv and the new calculation method of fitness value the ifoa is formed 3 2 bp neural network bp neural network is one of the most commonly used artificial neural networks rumelhart and mccelland 1986 its distinctive feature is that it is trained by error back propagation algorithm as shown in fig 7 a traditional bp neural network includes one input layer one or more hidden layers and one output layer the input variables can be considered as external stimuli which are perceived and transmitted by some neurons in the hidden layers and then respond in the output layer huang et al 2017 assuming that neuron h j is a neuron in the first hidden layer the input to neuron h j can be calculated as i 1 k w i j x i b j where k is the total number of input variables x i is the i th input variable and w i j and b j are the weight and bias of bp neural network then the input of neuron h j is passed through a transfer function f and the output of neuron h j can be written as 3 o u t f i 1 k w i j x i b j if there exists more than one hidden layer the output of neuron h j is considered as the input of the neurons in the next hidden layer by that analogy the final output is obtained then the final obtained output and the target output are compared and the difference between them is called network output error based on a back propagation learning algorithm the weights and biases of bp neural network w b bp are modified constantly by minimizing the errors until the stopping criterion is met silva et al 2017 3 3 ifoa bp model although the bp neural network can update the weights and biases by using the error back propagation algorithm during the training process the initial w b bp can still significantly influence the performance of bp model thus necessary optimization should be conducted when assigning the initial w b bp usually the total amount of w b bp is big especially for a complex model therefore it is quite challenging to find a good initial combination of w b bp due to its excellent optimization ability ifoa is used to search for an optimal set of weights and biases for bp model in this study in detail the process includes the following main parts huang et al 2017 1 confirm the structure and detailed parameters of bp model the number of hidden neurons n u m h is a vital parameter for bp neural network yet there is no explicit rule to determine it the most suitable bp neural network for different prediction problems may have different numbers of hidden neurons therefore sufficient experiments should be conducted to find out the appropriate n u m h for a particular problem 2 utilize ifoa to search for the best combination of w b bp first confirm the encoding method and the string length of individuals according to the total number of w b bp an individual represents a parameter combination second generate the initial position of fruit fly swarm and then individuals search for the optimal parameter combinations define the fitness function and calculate the fitness values of individuals finally finish the iteration process and find the best individual and the corresponding parameter combination 3 initialize the w b bp by using the best parameter combination then train the bp neural network and record the results the diagram of the combinational ifoa bp model is shown in fig 8 3 3 1 encoding method and string length of fruit fly in the ifoa bp model ifoa is used to search for the best combination of w b bp however fruit flies cannot directly act on the parameter combinations in the optimization process therefore the w b bp should be encoded to be a fruit fly so that they can be optimized by ifoa among all kinds of encoding methods the real encoding method is the most used one as it is easily understood and it can offer a large range and also the number system conversion is not necessary in this study the real encoding method is employed the string length of real coded combination of w b bp depends on the detailed structure of bp model assuming that the total numbers of neurons in the input layer and output layer are denoted by n u m i and n u m o respectively then the string length l can be calculated as 4 l n u m i n u m h n u m h n u m h n u m o n u m o further the i th individual in the m th iteration is expressed as x i m 1 x i m 2 x i m l 3 3 2 parameters of ifoa in the ifoa bp model the isv of ifoa should ensure that the search range of individuals can cover all the possible values of optimization variables thus for the ifoa bp model the parameters of adaptively changing isv are set as follows r 1 r m i n 0 2 r a 0 1 m 0 5 m and c 5 besides these p 50 and m 500 3 3 3 fitness function the overall error function of bp model is defined as 5 e r n 1 n t n o n 2 in which n is the total number of training samples t n is the target output and o n is the predicted result of bp neural network obviously a smaller error function means a more accurate neural network it is hoped that the minimum value of er and the corresponding combination of w b bp are found by using the ifoa therefore the individual fitness function f is the error function er 4 predicted results and discussion in this section the ifoa bp model is used to predict the stress value at the critical position and the self weight of the 60 m fpso section based on the different levels of the four design parameters x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 shown in table 2 144 4 3 3 4 sets of training data are generated by fea for each set of training data the input variables are the four parameters and the output variables include the stress value at the critical position and the self weigh of the 60 m fpso section besides another 20 sets of simulation data are considered to be the testing data to assess the prediction ability of neural network the input variables of the 20 sets of testing data are selected randomly from the value ranges of the four design parameters 4 1 performance indicators of neural network for the purpose of evaluating the performance of neural network several performance indicators are employed such as coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae in detail these performance indicators are calculated as follows 6 r 2 n 1 n t n o n 2 n 1 n o n o a v g 2 7 m a p e 1 n n 1 n t n o n t n 100 8 r m s e 1 n n 1 n t n o n 2 9 m a e 1 n n 1 n t n o n where o a v g is the average of n number of prediction outputs the value of r 2 lies in between 0 and 1 the bigger the value of r 2 is the better prediction accuracy the bp neural network has the mape is an indicator which can reflect the difference between the predicted result and the target output ghayekhloo et al 2015 besides the computing time is another performance indicator indicating the efficiency of neural network 4 2 parameters of ifoa bp model for the bp neural network and its variants the transfer function and back propagation algorithm are also very important in this study the sigmoid logarithmic function s type is adopted to be the transfer function and the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm is selected to be the back propagation algorithm to ensure the stability of ifoa bp model the learning rate of bp neural network is set to be a smaller value 0 1 as mentioned before n u m h has an important influence on the performance of bp model therefore a series of experiments are operated to select the best n u m h in detail n u m h is set to 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 under a certain n u m h the ifoa bp model is run 10 times and the average values of r 2 and rmse are recorded and shown in table 3 based on the mentioned 144 sets of training data and 20 sets of testing data as shown in table 3 the predicted results are quite different by using different n u m h obviously the closer to 1 the value of r 2 the better the ifoa bp is and the smaller the r m s e the more accurate the prediction values are the numerical results show that the ifoa bp model has the best performance when n u m h is set to 5 then all the parameters of ifoa bp model are listed in table 4 4 3 numerical results to verify the advantage of ifoa bp model three frequently used bp neural networks standard bp model ga bp model and foa bp model are adopted for comparison in addition for the ga bp model the parameters are given as follows p 50 m 500 cross probability 0 8 and mutation probability 0 1 all four models are coded in matlab 2012a and run on the personal computer with an interi7 6500u 8 gb ram windows 7 to get the statistical results each model is run 10 times based on the 144 sets of training data and 20 sets of testing data the output variables of neural network include a stress value and a weight value generally the prediction of the stress value is more difficult than that of the weight value therefore to save space we just show the predicted results of the stress value at the critical position in the following sections the actual stress means the stress value obtained by fea the predicted stress means the output stress of neural network the performance indicators of the best predicted results of the four models bp model ga bp model foa bp model and ifoa bp model are shown in table 5 figs 9 12 illustrate the best predicted stress values and the error percentage of the four models in the learning process figs 13 16 present the best predicted stress values and the error percentage of the four models in the testing process from these results the following conclusions can be made 1 in table 5 the performance indicators of ifoa bp model are much better than the bp ga bp and foa bp models the values of r 2 of ifoa bp model in both the learning and testing processes are higher than 0 99 indicating a remarkable agreement between the predicted and actual stress values besides the values of mape rmse and mae further confirm the more effective performance of ifoa bp model 2 the results shown in figs 9 12 demonstrate that the ifoa bp model has the best performance among the four models in the learning process the predicted stress values from ifoa bp model are closer to the actual values as compared with those form bp ga bp and foa bp models as shown in fig 12 b the biggest error percentage of ifoa bp model is only 1 218 in the learning process however the biggest error percentages of bp ga bp and foa bp models are 4 234 2 561 1 905 respectively 3 the results shown in figs 13 16 elaborate that the prediction precision of ifoa bp model is much higher than the bp ga bp and foa bp models in the testing process the ifoa bp model can generate the best predicted stress values which are very close to the actual values as compared with the other three models as shown in figs 13 b 14 b and 15 b the biggest error percentages of bp ga bp and foa bp models are about 6 920 4 515 2 931 respectively however the biggest error percentage of ifoa bp model is reduced to 0 592 as shown in fig 16 b 4 the major shortcoming of the ifoa bp model is that it is more time consuming than the bp model as shown in table 5 however it needs less computing time than the ga bp model considering the excellent performance of ifoa bp the computing time could be acceptable finally the ifoa bp model with the best performance and the corresponding parameters are reserved and will be used in the optimization process for the four fpso design parameters 5 parameter optimization for fpso design in this section the reserved best ifoa bp model and the proposed ifoa are employed to search for the optimal combination of the four fpso design parameters mentioned in section 2 in order to show the effect of parameter optimization in this study a contrastive design of fpso is adopted for comparison the contrastive design is based on an existing fpso named hai yang shi you 117 which serves in china due to the concern of confidentiality the detailed information has been modified befittingly in the contrastive design the four design parameters are x 1 17 50 the thickness of longitudinal bulkheads x 2 20 00 the thickness of stiffened panels in the center cargo oil tanks x 3 15 00 the thickness of stiffened panels in the larboard and starboard cargo oil tanks and x 4 17 50 the thickness of double bottoms the simulation results by using the contrastive design show that the stress value at the critical position is 2 7923 108pa and the self weight of 60 m fpso section is 4 7673 106kg 5 1 parameter setting in the optimization process an individual in the proposed ifoa should represent a combination of the four parameters x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 in this section fruit fly is also encoded by real encoding method and the string length is equal to 4 then an individual can be expressed as x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 in which x 1 yu and xu 2014 shen et al 2016b x 2 shafabakhsh et al 2015 shen et al 2016b x 3 yu and xu 2014 shen et al 2016a and x 4 yu and xu 2014 shen et al 2016b since the ranges of the four parameters are different the isv for each parameter is set to be different as mentioned before the isv should ensure that the search range of individuals can cover all the possible values of optimization variables in detail for x 1 and x 4 r 7 5 r m i n 1 5 and r a 1 for x 2 and x 3 r 5 r m i n 1 0 and r a 0 75 as for the common parameters m 0 5 m c 5 p 50 and m 500 based on the reserved ifoa bp model after giving a set of four design parameters a set of output variables including a stress value n e t s t r e s s and a weight value n e t w e i g h t can be obtained our final purpose is to find a better combination of the four design parameters as compared with the contrastive design the ideal set of design parameters should can generate smaller stress value at the critical position with a smaller self weight at the same time according the practical experience two weigh coefficients are employed and a combined objective function is introduced as follows 10 f 1 w s t r e s s n e t s t r e s s v a l u e s t r e s s w w e i g h t n e t w e i g h t v a l u e w e i g h t in formula 10 n e t s t r e s s is the stress value produced by the reserved ifoa bp model n e t w e i g h t is the self weight value produced by the reserved ifoa bp model v a l u e s t r e s s is set to 2 7923 108pa which is the stress value at the critical position by using the contrastive design v a l u e w e i g h t is set to 4 7673 106kg which is the self weight value of the 60 m fpso section by using the contrastive design the weigh coefficients w s t r e s s is set to 2 3 and w w e i g h t is set to 1 3 5 2 optimization results and discussion the proposed ifoa with the parameters mentioned in section 5 1 is coded in matlab 2012a and is implemented on the same computer after selecting formula 10 as the objective function the obtained optimization results are listed in table 6 by using the reserved best bp model and ifoa as shown in table 6 the obtained optimal set of design parameters 14 56 17 05 15 62 18 81 can generate a smaller self weight value 4 4409 106kg which is 6 85 less than that of the contrastive design 4 7673 106kg at the same time the stress value generated by the optimal set of design parameters is 2 6913 108pa which is also less than that of the contrastive design 2 7923 108pa as we know the stress value has direct influence to the fatigue life of structure according to the obtained stress value the fatigue life of the critical position can be calculated based on the s n curve palmgren miner ruler and cumulative fatigue damage cfd theory pinto et al 2014 the cfd theory hypothesizes that the fatigue damage accumulation d can be calculated as 11 d i 1 z n i n i where n i is the number of cycles of the i th stress range s i n i is the number of cycles to happen failure under the stress range s i and z is the number of considered stress range intervals pinto et al 2014 failure is expected to occur if d 1 in this study n i is confirmed by the s n curve class f2 of offshore s n curves for no tubular details in seawater with cathodic protection in the abs standard abs 2004b for the contrastive design the stress value at the critical position is 2 7923 108pa n i can be calculated as 12 n i a s m 1 72 10 11 279 23 3 7900 as shown in table 6 for the combination of optimization parameters 14 56 17 05 15 62 18 81 the stress value at the critical position is 2 6913 108pa according to the abs standard abs 2004b n i can be calculated as 13 n i a s m 1 72 10 11 269 13 3 8823 the results state that the obtained combination of fpso design parameters can extend the fatigue life by about 11 68 in summary the effect of parameter optimization for fpso design is very remarkable and the proposed method is highly effective the study presents a novel way of the parameter optimization for fpso design which can be extended for other offshore structures such as semi submersible platforms 6 conclusions this study proposes a new combinational ifoa bp neural network for parametric optimization of fpso design the ifoa bp model combines the bp neural network with a proposed ifoa which introduces an adaptively changing iteration step value in the ifoa bp model the ifoa is utilized to search for the best combination of weights and biases of the bp neural network further the ifoa bp model is used to construct the mapping network between the selected design parameters and the stress values of critical position of the fpso as compared with the bp ga bp and foa bp models the performance of ifoa bp model is superior then the reserved best ifoa bp network is considered as the fitness function of design parameter combination and ifoa plays the role of optimization tool the ifoa bp model and ifoa cooperate to find the best combination of design parameters as compared with a contrastive design the obtained optimization set of design parameters can reduce the self weight by about 6 85 while reduce the stress value to further extend the fatigue life of the critical position by about 11 68 the optimization results show that the proposed method is useful for fpso design furthermore the proposed method opens arena of

22950,in the offshore oil industry fpso floating production storage and offloading units play a leading role for the production processing and storage of oil the hull girder strength of fpso which is related to the safety and economic aspects is usually designed based on engineers experience in this study a novel method is presented to optimize the fpso design parameters which mainly affect the hull girder strength the proposed method employs an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm ifoa and ifoa bp model which combines ifoa and back propagation bp neural network firstly the ifoa bp model maps the nonlinear relations between the input and output variables and then the reserved network can predict the stress value of critical position and the self weight of fpso for any set of design parameters the numerical results indicate that the ifoa bp model has a remarkable predication ability further the reserved ifoa bp model and the proposed ifoa is used to search for the optimal set of design parameters compared with the contrastive design the optimal set of design parameters obtained using the proposed method gives lower stress value of critical position and smaller self weight of fpso the optimization results show the advance and superiority of the proposed method keywords fpso parameter optimization fruit fly optimization algorithm back propagation neural network stress 1 introduction due to the limitation of oil exploration and exploitation on the land a great many efforts are made to develop the offshore oil and gas industry which needs many advanced technologies and installations nishimoto et al 2002 the two most common types of offshore oil production setups are classified as platform based and ship shaped installations generally the ship shaped floating units have the following advantages 1 large deck area 2 low cost sensitivity to variations in depth and 3 easy installation and relocation mespaque et al 2012 one of the representative ship shaped offshore installations is the fpso floating production storage and offloading units fpsos can store produced treated oil and transfer it to the shuttle tankers for shipment instead of a pipeline to transport to the shore due to the capability of economically producing oil in deep water and remote areas fpsos have opened the vast frontier of the world s oceans to oil production and many new fpsos will be designed and installed in the coming years therefore it is necessary to focus more on the study of fpso structural design in general it is unrealistic to move fpsos to avoid severe weather during their service life chen 2016 thus they are subjected to much harsher environmental loads as compared with trading tankers structural design is critical to ensure the fpso strength and the hull girder strength assessment is one of the most vital parts of fpso design and structural assessment especially under some severe loading conditions the safety and economic aspects require structural optimization actually many classification societies such as american bureau of shipping abs and det norske veritas ndv have their methods and software for the optimization of fpso design ma et al 2014 in these methods the design and optimization procedure generally includes 1 determining the dimensions 2 rule check and 3 direct strength calculations in the first step designer s experience plays a vital role when confirming preliminary dimensions for the designed structure rule check is carried out according to the special standards set out by the classification societies generally the third step is for the direct strength and fatigue life calculations based on three dimensional fea finite element analysis results and many other theories such as linear elastic analysis and nonlinear analysis wang et al 2011 the smith method smith 1977 smith 1975 the incremental iterative approach sun and wang 2005 the idealized structural unit method ueda and rashed 1984 and so on essentially the optimization of fpso design largely relies on human experience for a given set of design parameters the results can be obtained by following the previous procedure any changes in these parameters require to execute the whole procedure and the results may be very different by using the above method a better set of design parameters could be obtained however it is quite difficult to find a global optimal combination of design parameters it is even more difficult almost impossible if there exist more design parameters thus a more efficient and robust method is needed to optimize fpso design parameters in recent years due to the remarkable performance of robust and non linear mapping artificial neural network ann are frequently used to solve engineering optimization problems yu and xu 2014 in fact ann can build a mapping network with several layers to simulate the relations between the known inputs and outputs during training process ahmadizar et al 2015 the major advantage of ann is that it can predict the results with a high precision and a fast speed after a neural network is properly trained using some existing samples ganjefar and tofighi 2017 if there are enough mapping results of known parameter combinations it is possible to forecast the mapping results of any unknown parameter combinations therefore ann can be applied in many fields tsai et al used ann to build a data driven prediction model to forecast the wave heights along a ship s route during hurricanes tsai et al 2018 based on 14 groups of experimental data ma et al built an ann predictive model to determine the heat transfer coefficient of supercritical water ma et al 2017 shafabakhsh et al 2015 presented a method which employs ann to evaluate the final strain of hot mix asphalt mixtures in general ann model includes many control parameters which decide the performance of ann sanchez et al 2017 over the years researchers found that it can promote the performance of ann to combine it with intelligent algorithms in detail these algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso are used for optimizing the control parameters further to improve the prediction ability of ann when solving various optimization problems for example in order to predict the electrical energy demand in smart grid islam et al combined bp neural network with chaos search ga islam et al 2017 huang et al proposed another novel method which combines bp neural network with pod proper orthogonal decomposition to predict the wind pressure coefficients on building surface huang et al 2017 as a new evolutionary approach fruit fly optimization algorithm foa was presented in 2012 pan 2012 foa is abstracted from the foraging behavior of fruit flies shen et al 2016a generally foa and its variants have some advantages such as less parameters simpler structure and easier for understanding meng and pan 2017 yu et al 2016 therefore the variants of foa have been applied in many engineering and scientific fields kanarachos et al 2017 such as multi dimensional function optimization problem pan et al 2014 medical diagnosis shen et al 2016b and forecasting power loads li et al 2013 in foa the swarm would gather at the location with the best fitness in every iteration which means that foa can achieve a good solution in a fast speed on the other hand it makes the foa tend be trapped in a local extreme jiang and yang 2016 wu et al 2018 in fact the search scope of fruit fly swarm depends on the iteration step which is a fixed value in the original foa apparently a larger iteration step value can result in a faster convergence on the other hand a smaller iteration step value is more conducive to finding the global optimum in an exact range thus some researchers proposed new mechanisms to adjust the iteration step value pan et al 2014 proposed a variant called iffo in which a control parameter is used to tune the search scope from maximum to minimum along with the increase of iteration number zuo et al 2017 presented a novel strategy in which a standard deviation δ l o g m 1 m α x i x b is used to represent the search range m is the iteration number α 2 x i is the position of the i th individual and x b is the best location of the current population a variation coefficient and a disturbance coefficient were proposed by xu et al to change the search range xu et al 2017 according to this method an individual with lower fitness value will search for food in a bigger range and if the best location of the fruit fly swarm remains unchanged for several iterations the disturbance coefficient will take effect and the individual will search for optimum in a much bigger scope hu et al 2017 introduced a decreasing iteration step value r i r r 1 e 6 12 m m r is the initial step value m is maximum iteration number and m is the current iteration number in summary most of these mechanisms suggest that the search radius should become small along with the increase of iteration number and the iteration step value should increase if the swarm falls into a local extreme wu et al 2018 in this study a novel improved foa ifoa is proposed unlike the original foa and existing variants the proposed ifoa includes an adaptively changing iteration step value in detail the iteration step value decreases with the increasing iteration number at the beginning of the iteration process and further changes like a sinusoidal function during the second half of the iteration process the adaptively changing iteration step value ensures that ifoa draws close to global extreme with a fast speed and at the same time has the ability to search for global extreme in exact scope especially the alternant increase and decrease of iteration step value in the second half of the iteration process can keep balance between the optimization precision and ability of jumping out of local extreme for the purpose of optimizing the fpso design parameters the bp neural network is employed to combine with ifoa and then an ifoa bp model is formed the major contributions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 introducing an adaptively changing iteration step value for foa 2 proposing an ifoa bp model with a high prediction accuracy and 3 presenting a new method for the parameter optimization of fpso design further extending the way of design optimization for other offshore structures to verify the performance of ifoa bp model it is utilized to predict the stress value at the critical position and the self weight of fpso based on 144 sets of training data obtained by fea the numerical results show that ifoa bp model has better prediction ability as compared to the standard bp ga bp and foa bp models finally the reserved ifoa bp model and ifoa are used to search for the best set of fpso design parameters the subsequent sections are organized as follows section 2 defines the four design parameters of fpso section 3 describes the improved foa and the detailed ifoa bp neural network the predicted results of ifoa bp model and the discussion are shown in section 4 the results of parameter optimization for fpso design by using the ifoa bp model and the ifoa are presented in section 5 section 6 concludes the work 2 design parameters of fpso generally fpso unit involves hull structure oil and gas processing system mooring system offloading system etc the strength of hull structure is closely related to the safety of fpso the objective of this study is to find the best combination of fpso design parameters which can generate a higher hull girder strength and a smaller self weight during fpso s service life the hull girder is predominantly loaded by vertical wave induced bending moment vwbm and still water bending moment swbm the swbm is decided by the longitudinal distribution of the self weight the deadweight or the cargo the vwbm is a result of wave action sun and bai 2003 in fact the two kinds of peak values may not occur at the same time and many methods are proposed to combine them such as the turskra s rule ferry borges method and load coincidence method thus two extreme working conditions ballast draft working condition and full load working condition which cause the hogging and sagging conditions are shown in fig 1 usually the maximum bending moment in sagging condition is higher than that in hogging condition for fpso in this study the key parameters of the objective fpso are shown in table 1 and the maximum combined bending moment in sagging condition is set to 7 2 109 n m usually it is a reasonable way to check the stress value at the critical position to assess the hull girder strength of fpso as shown in fig 2 which is an abridged general section view previous researches have shown that the critical position of fpso hull girder is the connection of the transverse frame and the longitudinal keel chen et al 2014 actually the stress value at the critical position is related to many fpso design parameters the detailed structures of fpso are shown in fig 3 in this study four parameters which have significant impact on the hull girder strength of fpso are considered when optimizing the fpso structural design as shown in fig 3 the four parameters are x 1 the thickness of longitudinal bulkheads x 2 the thickness of stiffened panels in the center cargo oil tanks x 3 the thickness of stiffened panels in the larboard and starboard cargo oil tanks and x 4 the thickness of double bottom structures all the four parameters are related to the main structures of hull girder according to the current standards and engineering practice the ranges of the four design parameters are x 1 10 25 x 2 15 25 x 3 10 20 and x 4 10 25 unit mm a suitable set of design parameters must fall in these ranges besides the self weight which is related to the building costs of fpso should also be considered marino et al 2016 according to the abs guidance notes on safehull finite element analysis of hull structures abs 2004a a reasonable length section of the whole fpso can replace the target fpso in the middle and extend approximately the length of the adjacent holds fore and after and there should be a short extension beyond the transverse bulkheads at both ends abs 2004a therefore a 60 m length section of the whole fpso rather than the full length model is adopted when carrying out the simulation as shown in fig 4 in detail the fpso section with two fixed ends is loaded by the hydrostatic pressure of sea water the hydrostatic pressure of cargo oil the structural weight and the pressure force on the main deck as shown in fig 4 a further the model is meshed into fea elements finally the stress value at the critical position is obtained by operating the simulation in this study all the stress values are equivalent stress it is worth mentioning that the maximum bending moment which happens at the mid ship section of 60 m fpso section must be equal to the value of combined bending moment in order to generate the correct stress level as in the real condition 3 ifoa bp neural network 3 1 foa and its variant ifoa 3 1 1 original foa as an ordinary insect fruit fly has superior osphresis and vision than other species during hunting for food fruit flies firstly search for food by smelling the food scents after getting close to the food source flies will use the outstanding vision to find food and gather at the location of other individuals meng and pan 2017 inspired by this behavior foa is proposed by pan 2012 actually two steps are included in the optimization procedure in the original foa at the first step called osphresis foraging step fruit flies search for food in a randomly way around their locations at the second step called vision foraging step fruit flies find food and other individuals by sharp vision meng and pan 2017 the two steps are repeated until the swarm successfully find the food the detailed iteration procedure of original foa is illustrated in fig 5 3 1 2 an improved foa ifoa in foa the iteration step value isv denoted by r can be considered as the maximum radius of the search scope with a larger isv the optimization process is faster and individuals get close to the food source with a fast speed with a smaller isv the fruit fly swarm search for the food in an exact range especially in the second half of the optimization process besides it is hoped that isv will become bigger if the swarm falling into a local extreme therefore an adaptively changing isv which can become bigger or smaller is proposed given the initial isv r r m is the isv in the m th iteration it is calculated as follows 1 r m m m m 2 r r m i n r m i n m m r a s i n m m c π m m π 2 r m i n r a m m where m is a given iteration number r m i n is the minimum of isv r a is the changing amplitude of isv and c is a constant the explanations for these parameters can be refer to the changing curve of isv shown in fig 6 from fig 6 the following information and conclusions can be obtained 1 from the first iteration to the m th iteration r m will decrease as m increases especially at the beginning stage of the algorithm a larger r m can ensure the algorithm converges to a good solution with a faster speed then with the iterative number increasing r m becomes smaller so that the fruit flies search for the global optimal solution in an exact search scope which depends on the isv from formula 1 it is known that when m 0 r m r and when m m r m r m i n 2 in the second half of the algorithm r m is changing like a sinusoidal function such that it can become bigger and smaller alternately the changing amplitude is r a and the number of cycles is c since bigger isv brings faster search speed and smaller isv brings higher search accuracy the adaptively changing isv is beneficiary for balancing the search speed and search accuracy when searching for the best solution moreover as reported by many researchers yuan et al 2014 the original foa cannot solve the optimization problem in which the optimal solution is in negative domain thus for the purpose of overcoming this disadvantage of original foa pan et al 2014 and yuan et al 2014 advised that the fitness values of fruit flies can be calculated directly in the decision space of the function in this study similar method is adopted in detail assuming that f x a multidimensional optimization problem s m e l l i m which is the fitness value of individual x i m can be calculated as follows 2 s m e l l i m f x i m integrating the adaptively changing isv and the new calculation method of fitness value the ifoa is formed 3 2 bp neural network bp neural network is one of the most commonly used artificial neural networks rumelhart and mccelland 1986 its distinctive feature is that it is trained by error back propagation algorithm as shown in fig 7 a traditional bp neural network includes one input layer one or more hidden layers and one output layer the input variables can be considered as external stimuli which are perceived and transmitted by some neurons in the hidden layers and then respond in the output layer huang et al 2017 assuming that neuron h j is a neuron in the first hidden layer the input to neuron h j can be calculated as i 1 k w i j x i b j where k is the total number of input variables x i is the i th input variable and w i j and b j are the weight and bias of bp neural network then the input of neuron h j is passed through a transfer function f and the output of neuron h j can be written as 3 o u t f i 1 k w i j x i b j if there exists more than one hidden layer the output of neuron h j is considered as the input of the neurons in the next hidden layer by that analogy the final output is obtained then the final obtained output and the target output are compared and the difference between them is called network output error based on a back propagation learning algorithm the weights and biases of bp neural network w b bp are modified constantly by minimizing the errors until the stopping criterion is met silva et al 2017 3 3 ifoa bp model although the bp neural network can update the weights and biases by using the error back propagation algorithm during the training process the initial w b bp can still significantly influence the performance of bp model thus necessary optimization should be conducted when assigning the initial w b bp usually the total amount of w b bp is big especially for a complex model therefore it is quite challenging to find a good initial combination of w b bp due to its excellent optimization ability ifoa is used to search for an optimal set of weights and biases for bp model in this study in detail the process includes the following main parts huang et al 2017 1 confirm the structure and detailed parameters of bp model the number of hidden neurons n u m h is a vital parameter for bp neural network yet there is no explicit rule to determine it the most suitable bp neural network for different prediction problems may have different numbers of hidden neurons therefore sufficient experiments should be conducted to find out the appropriate n u m h for a particular problem 2 utilize ifoa to search for the best combination of w b bp first confirm the encoding method and the string length of individuals according to the total number of w b bp an individual represents a parameter combination second generate the initial position of fruit fly swarm and then individuals search for the optimal parameter combinations define the fitness function and calculate the fitness values of individuals finally finish the iteration process and find the best individual and the corresponding parameter combination 3 initialize the w b bp by using the best parameter combination then train the bp neural network and record the results the diagram of the combinational ifoa bp model is shown in fig 8 3 3 1 encoding method and string length of fruit fly in the ifoa bp model ifoa is used to search for the best combination of w b bp however fruit flies cannot directly act on the parameter combinations in the optimization process therefore the w b bp should be encoded to be a fruit fly so that they can be optimized by ifoa among all kinds of encoding methods the real encoding method is the most used one as it is easily understood and it can offer a large range and also the number system conversion is not necessary in this study the real encoding method is employed the string length of real coded combination of w b bp depends on the detailed structure of bp model assuming that the total numbers of neurons in the input layer and output layer are denoted by n u m i and n u m o respectively then the string length l can be calculated as 4 l n u m i n u m h n u m h n u m h n u m o n u m o further the i th individual in the m th iteration is expressed as x i m 1 x i m 2 x i m l 3 3 2 parameters of ifoa in the ifoa bp model the isv of ifoa should ensure that the search range of individuals can cover all the possible values of optimization variables thus for the ifoa bp model the parameters of adaptively changing isv are set as follows r 1 r m i n 0 2 r a 0 1 m 0 5 m and c 5 besides these p 50 and m 500 3 3 3 fitness function the overall error function of bp model is defined as 5 e r n 1 n t n o n 2 in which n is the total number of training samples t n is the target output and o n is the predicted result of bp neural network obviously a smaller error function means a more accurate neural network it is hoped that the minimum value of er and the corresponding combination of w b bp are found by using the ifoa therefore the individual fitness function f is the error function er 4 predicted results and discussion in this section the ifoa bp model is used to predict the stress value at the critical position and the self weight of the 60 m fpso section based on the different levels of the four design parameters x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 shown in table 2 144 4 3 3 4 sets of training data are generated by fea for each set of training data the input variables are the four parameters and the output variables include the stress value at the critical position and the self weigh of the 60 m fpso section besides another 20 sets of simulation data are considered to be the testing data to assess the prediction ability of neural network the input variables of the 20 sets of testing data are selected randomly from the value ranges of the four design parameters 4 1 performance indicators of neural network for the purpose of evaluating the performance of neural network several performance indicators are employed such as coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae in detail these performance indicators are calculated as follows 6 r 2 n 1 n t n o n 2 n 1 n o n o a v g 2 7 m a p e 1 n n 1 n t n o n t n 100 8 r m s e 1 n n 1 n t n o n 2 9 m a e 1 n n 1 n t n o n where o a v g is the average of n number of prediction outputs the value of r 2 lies in between 0 and 1 the bigger the value of r 2 is the better prediction accuracy the bp neural network has the mape is an indicator which can reflect the difference between the predicted result and the target output ghayekhloo et al 2015 besides the computing time is another performance indicator indicating the efficiency of neural network 4 2 parameters of ifoa bp model for the bp neural network and its variants the transfer function and back propagation algorithm are also very important in this study the sigmoid logarithmic function s type is adopted to be the transfer function and the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm is selected to be the back propagation algorithm to ensure the stability of ifoa bp model the learning rate of bp neural network is set to be a smaller value 0 1 as mentioned before n u m h has an important influence on the performance of bp model therefore a series of experiments are operated to select the best n u m h in detail n u m h is set to 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 under a certain n u m h the ifoa bp model is run 10 times and the average values of r 2 and rmse are recorded and shown in table 3 based on the mentioned 144 sets of training data and 20 sets of testing data as shown in table 3 the predicted results are quite different by using different n u m h obviously the closer to 1 the value of r 2 the better the ifoa bp is and the smaller the r m s e the more accurate the prediction values are the numerical results show that the ifoa bp model has the best performance when n u m h is set to 5 then all the parameters of ifoa bp model are listed in table 4 4 3 numerical results to verify the advantage of ifoa bp model three frequently used bp neural networks standard bp model ga bp model and foa bp model are adopted for comparison in addition for the ga bp model the parameters are given as follows p 50 m 500 cross probability 0 8 and mutation probability 0 1 all four models are coded in matlab 2012a and run on the personal computer with an interi7 6500u 8 gb ram windows 7 to get the statistical results each model is run 10 times based on the 144 sets of training data and 20 sets of testing data the output variables of neural network include a stress value and a weight value generally the prediction of the stress value is more difficult than that of the weight value therefore to save space we just show the predicted results of the stress value at the critical position in the following sections the actual stress means the stress value obtained by fea the predicted stress means the output stress of neural network the performance indicators of the best predicted results of the four models bp model ga bp model foa bp model and ifoa bp model are shown in table 5 figs 9 12 illustrate the best predicted stress values and the error percentage of the four models in the learning process figs 13 16 present the best predicted stress values and the error percentage of the four models in the testing process from these results the following conclusions can be made 1 in table 5 the performance indicators of ifoa bp model are much better than the bp ga bp and foa bp models the values of r 2 of ifoa bp model in both the learning and testing processes are higher than 0 99 indicating a remarkable agreement between the predicted and actual stress values besides the values of mape rmse and mae further confirm the more effective performance of ifoa bp model 2 the results shown in figs 9 12 demonstrate that the ifoa bp model has the best performance among the four models in the learning process the predicted stress values from ifoa bp model are closer to the actual values as compared with those form bp ga bp and foa bp models as shown in fig 12 b the biggest error percentage of ifoa bp model is only 1 218 in the learning process however the biggest error percentages of bp ga bp and foa bp models are 4 234 2 561 1 905 respectively 3 the results shown in figs 13 16 elaborate that the prediction precision of ifoa bp model is much higher than the bp ga bp and foa bp models in the testing process the ifoa bp model can generate the best predicted stress values which are very close to the actual values as compared with the other three models as shown in figs 13 b 14 b and 15 b the biggest error percentages of bp ga bp and foa bp models are about 6 920 4 515 2 931 respectively however the biggest error percentage of ifoa bp model is reduced to 0 592 as shown in fig 16 b 4 the major shortcoming of the ifoa bp model is that it is more time consuming than the bp model as shown in table 5 however it needs less computing time than the ga bp model considering the excellent performance of ifoa bp the computing time could be acceptable finally the ifoa bp model with the best performance and the corresponding parameters are reserved and will be used in the optimization process for the four fpso design parameters 5 parameter optimization for fpso design in this section the reserved best ifoa bp model and the proposed ifoa are employed to search for the optimal combination of the four fpso design parameters mentioned in section 2 in order to show the effect of parameter optimization in this study a contrastive design of fpso is adopted for comparison the contrastive design is based on an existing fpso named hai yang shi you 117 which serves in china due to the concern of confidentiality the detailed information has been modified befittingly in the contrastive design the four design parameters are x 1 17 50 the thickness of longitudinal bulkheads x 2 20 00 the thickness of stiffened panels in the center cargo oil tanks x 3 15 00 the thickness of stiffened panels in the larboard and starboard cargo oil tanks and x 4 17 50 the thickness of double bottoms the simulation results by using the contrastive design show that the stress value at the critical position is 2 7923 108pa and the self weight of 60 m fpso section is 4 7673 106kg 5 1 parameter setting in the optimization process an individual in the proposed ifoa should represent a combination of the four parameters x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 in this section fruit fly is also encoded by real encoding method and the string length is equal to 4 then an individual can be expressed as x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 in which x 1 yu and xu 2014 shen et al 2016b x 2 shafabakhsh et al 2015 shen et al 2016b x 3 yu and xu 2014 shen et al 2016a and x 4 yu and xu 2014 shen et al 2016b since the ranges of the four parameters are different the isv for each parameter is set to be different as mentioned before the isv should ensure that the search range of individuals can cover all the possible values of optimization variables in detail for x 1 and x 4 r 7 5 r m i n 1 5 and r a 1 for x 2 and x 3 r 5 r m i n 1 0 and r a 0 75 as for the common parameters m 0 5 m c 5 p 50 and m 500 based on the reserved ifoa bp model after giving a set of four design parameters a set of output variables including a stress value n e t s t r e s s and a weight value n e t w e i g h t can be obtained our final purpose is to find a better combination of the four design parameters as compared with the contrastive design the ideal set of design parameters should can generate smaller stress value at the critical position with a smaller self weight at the same time according the practical experience two weigh coefficients are employed and a combined objective function is introduced as follows 10 f 1 w s t r e s s n e t s t r e s s v a l u e s t r e s s w w e i g h t n e t w e i g h t v a l u e w e i g h t in formula 10 n e t s t r e s s is the stress value produced by the reserved ifoa bp model n e t w e i g h t is the self weight value produced by the reserved ifoa bp model v a l u e s t r e s s is set to 2 7923 108pa which is the stress value at the critical position by using the contrastive design v a l u e w e i g h t is set to 4 7673 106kg which is the self weight value of the 60 m fpso section by using the contrastive design the weigh coefficients w s t r e s s is set to 2 3 and w w e i g h t is set to 1 3 5 2 optimization results and discussion the proposed ifoa with the parameters mentioned in section 5 1 is coded in matlab 2012a and is implemented on the same computer after selecting formula 10 as the objective function the obtained optimization results are listed in table 6 by using the reserved best bp model and ifoa as shown in table 6 the obtained optimal set of design parameters 14 56 17 05 15 62 18 81 can generate a smaller self weight value 4 4409 106kg which is 6 85 less than that of the contrastive design 4 7673 106kg at the same time the stress value generated by the optimal set of design parameters is 2 6913 108pa which is also less than that of the contrastive design 2 7923 108pa as we know the stress value has direct influence to the fatigue life of structure according to the obtained stress value the fatigue life of the critical position can be calculated based on the s n curve palmgren miner ruler and cumulative fatigue damage cfd theory pinto et al 2014 the cfd theory hypothesizes that the fatigue damage accumulation d can be calculated as 11 d i 1 z n i n i where n i is the number of cycles of the i th stress range s i n i is the number of cycles to happen failure under the stress range s i and z is the number of considered stress range intervals pinto et al 2014 failure is expected to occur if d 1 in this study n i is confirmed by

22951,hydrodynamics of an anti sloshing technique using floating foams in a rectangular liquid tank is investigated a series of experiments are conducted an analytical potential flow solution is derived to help explain the experimental observations effects of various layers of floating foams on both the wave profiles and dynamic pressure histories in sloshing tanks are analyzed it shows that even a single layer of floating foams can help reduce the sloshing amplitude due to energy dissipation if multiple layers of floating foams are further applied the sloshing amplitude can be further reduced the amplitude of dynamic pressure in the tank is also found to decrease as the number of foam layers increases besides anti sloshing effects of floating foams in tanks of different depths are discussed floating foams are found to work more efficiently for larger amplitude sloshing waves keywords anti sloshing sloshing floating foam potential flow liquid tank 1 introduction floating liquefied natural gas flng platforms have been developed for offshore gas exploitation an flng platform is designed to chill the extracted natural gas into liquid and store the liquefied natural gas lng in tanks below the deck during operation the motion of an flng can easily excite liquid sloshing in partly filled tanks a violent sloshing is often accompanied by a large hydrodynamic pressure that can threaten the structural safety of lng tanks thus developing effective sloshing mitigation or anti sloshing techniques are of great significance for the safety of an flng platform up to now various anti sloshing techniques have been investigated for liquid cargo tanks a great proportion of these techniques is based on energy dissipation effects of internal structures e g baffles screens blocks bulkheads etc in a liquid tank which has been comprehensively reviewed by ibrahim 2005 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 in recent years jung et al 2012 studied effects of the vertical baffle installed on the tank bottom on the liquid sloshing and discussed the vortex effects from the baffle tip wang et al 2013 analytically studied the sloshing response of liquid in a rigid cylindrical container with multiple annual rigid baffles jin et al 2014 conducted experiments on a rectangular liquid tank with an inner submerged horizontal perforated plate lu et al 2015 simulated the sloshing in a rectangular tank with two horizontal baffles using both viscous and potential flow numerical methods wei et al 2015 considered anti sloshing effects of the vertical screen structure on the bottom of the tank goudarzi and danesh 2016 simulated the liquid response in a rectangular tank with bottom baffles subjected to the seismic excitations using the commercial software ansys cfx wang et al 2016 studied effects of t shaped baffles on liquid sloshing in horizontal elliptical tanks using a semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method sbfem cho and kim 2016 derived the analytic solution for liquid sloshing in a swaying rectangular tank with dual porous baffles and conducted experiments for validation kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 analytically studied dynamic characteristics of fluid within a tank with vertical perforated baffle and screens of different solidity ratio hwang et al 2016 studied and demonstrated effects of elastic baffles on the sloshing phenomena through experimental and numerical methods xue et al 2017 carried out the experimental study on hydrodynamic characteristics of different anti sloshing baffles in the square tank the above baffle based anti sloshing techniques have been widely adopted by oil or chemical tankers however these techniques still require further verification for the special case of lng tanks because the internal surface of an lng tank is fully covered by thin invar membranes to prevent gas leakage at an extremely low temperature installing baffles through the membrane surface may affect mechanical properties of the membrane and bring safety risks thus alternative anti sloshing ideas keep emerging in the recent decade trying to avoid damaging the membrane surface anai et al 2010 suggested an anti sloshing method using the membrane material that can deform flexibly near the free surface to restrain the fluid motion hernández and santamarina 2012 introduced an active anti sloshing technique taking advantage of real time controlled dynamic baffles however for flammable and explosive lng cargo this electricity dependent approach inevitably has safety risks koh et al 2013 proposed an anti sloshing scheme based on the floating structure the floating structure changes position to dynamically adjust the natural sloshing frequency of the liquid in the tank so that the occurrence probability of liquid resonance in the tank can be reduced arai et al 2013 proposed a simple anti sloshing floating device at the still water to form sub tanks through model tests and numerical simulations the sloshing suppression effectiveness and further optimized the shape of the floating plate were discussed further yu et al 2017 experimentally studied sloshing with two floating plates in a rectangular tank at three different filling rates under roll excitation suppressing effects of the device on wave run up and pressure along the longitudinal bulkhead were observed zhang 2015 proposed a design of lng carrier with various wedged tanks from an overall perspective aiming to avoid the simultaneous occurrence of sloshing resonance in all tanks of an lng carrier and reduce the resultant sloshing dynamics from all tanks acting on the ship another interesting anti sloshing concept is based on a floater type blanket kim et al 2011 proposed by samsung heavy industry shi together with basf company ltd the blanket consists of foam cubes made from melamine resin see fig 1 it was claimed that this design can not only protect against sloshing but also lower the boil off rate bor a measurement of vaporization basf samsung heavy industries 2013 which can be very promising however this foam blanket must be designed carefully to satisfy contradictory physical requirements on the one hand it should be lightweight in order to float and avoid damaging tank walls but on the other hand it must be sufficiently heavy to influence the sloshing motion this requires an in depth understanding of hydrodynamics of floating foams in a sloshing tank at present studies on liquid sloshing with floating foams are still very limited a relevant study is sauret et al 2015 which carried out experiments for foam layers of liquid bubbles on the free surface in a sloshing tank it is observed that only a few layers of bubbles can significantly damp the liquid oscillations while bubbles close to the walls have a significant impact on the dissipation of energy however for a practical lng tank it may not be easy to controllably generate desired size and amount of lng bubble foams besides capillary effects that matter in their small scale sloshing cases can be insignificant for large scale lng tanks of our focus thus this study proposes an alternative idea by using solid foam spheres instead of liquid foam bubbles the solid foam spheres can also be considered as fragments of the above mentioned floater type blanket kim et al 2011 although the present idea has aborted linkages among fragments and applied multiple layers this design is expected to inherit advantages of the above two sloshing mitigation strategies with a simpler operational practice experiments are carried out at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology an analytical potential flow solution is derived to help explain the experimental observations section 2 describes the experimental set ups section 3 introduces the derivation of the analytical solution in section 4 experimental and analytical results are analyzed effects of various layers of floating foams on both the wave profiles and dynamic pressure in sloshing tanks are discussed tanks with three different liquid depths are considered finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 experiment set up the physical experiments are conducted on an oscillation test platform fig 2 a at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the platform can generate a harmonic oscillation with the amplitude ranging from 0 to 0 0254 m and frequency below 1000 hz more detailed technical parameters of the equipment are given in jiang 2014 a rectangular tank made from plexiglas is fixed on the oscillation platform the tank has the length of 0 5 m width of 0 1 m and height of 0 4 m which are measured from the internal tank surface the thickness of the tank wall is 0 02 m so that the tank can be considered rigid the tank is filled with dyed water during the experiment the platform oscillates harmonically along the length direction of the liquid tank so that the displacement of the fluid remains two dimensional in principle a video camera and a series of pressure sensors are used to record the liquid sloshing behaviour in the tank plastic foam spheres with the diameter of 0 02 m and density of 30 kg m3 are uniformly deployed on the free surface of the liquid fig 2 b up to four layers of spherical foams are considered in the experiments in the present experiments each case is repeated three times the wave amplitude is determined by the mean value of three repeats with an error of 0 4 1 24 the pressure sensor has the scale of 10 kpa and precision of 0 01 0 08 the diameter of plastic spheres has error of 1 5 mm due to the size limitation of the oscillation test platform only one tank scale has been considered in this study it must be pointed out that the scaling issue must be further investigated before applying the present experimental results to a full scale application although the scaling law for this multi physics problem is very complex for the simplest sloshing only with the liquid phase experimental modelling can be based on the froude scaling assumption for two phases with included gas compressibility effects the froude scaling is no longer satisfied even with the same the ratio of densities between gas and liquid braeunig et al 2009 the present model further includes elastic solid spheres for the froude scaling the principle sources of bias can at least be the gas liquid solid density ratio compressibility effects of gas hydro elastic effects of solid and phase transition of liquid thus the scaling law with and without spheres is expected to be different which surely requires further investigation in the future 3 mathematical model this section considers a two dimensional rectangular tank with the length of l on the free surface there are several layers of spherical plastic foams the height of the liquid at rest is h the liquid density is represented by ρ as in fig 3 a cartesian coordinate system o xy is defined with the origin o at the centre of undisturbed free surface y axis pointing vertically upwards and x axis pointing to the right the fluid domain is denoted by v the liquid dynamics is considered based on the potential flow theory by assuming the fluid to be inviscid incompressible and flow irrotational the velocity potential φ x y t whose gradient represents the fluid velocity is introduced if the wave amplitude is small and the tank is undergoing a small lateral excitation the velocity potential can be determined from a linearized boundary value problem in the fluid domain the velocity potential satisfies laplace s equation 1 2 φ 0 the pressure p can be expressed by bernoulli s equation 2 p ρ φ t g z the free surface is covered with small pieces of foams without restrains between each pair of neighbours consider a small piece of foam with the length of d x and let ρ 0 denote the mass of the foam per free surface area its vertical motion is governed by the following dynamic equation 3 ρ φ t g η ρ 0 2 η t 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration η x t is the vertical displacement of the foam besides eq 3 the following kinematic boundary condition should also be satisfied 4 φ y η t on l 2 x l 2 y 0 on the tank sides and bottom the following boundary conditions are satisfied 5 φ y 0 on l 2 x l 2 y h 6 φ x s 0 t on x l 2 h y 0 where s 0 is the displacement of the tank in this study we are interested in the steady sloshing state by assuming φ x y t re φ x y e i ω t s 0 t re s 0 e i ω t and η x t re η x e i ω t the boundary value problem can be written as 7 2 φ 0 in v 8 φ y 0 on l 2 x l 2 y h 9 φ y i ω η on l 2 x l 2 y 0 10 ρ 0 ρ ω 2 g η i ω φ x y 0 on l 2 x l 2 y 0 11 φ x i ω s 0 in x l 2 h y 0 eqs 10 and 11 can be combined by eliminating η 12 ρ 0 ρ ω 2 g φ y ω 2 φ 0 it has been known that the energy dissipation mainly caused by the viscosity is unneglectable in a resonant sloshing condition to approximate the viscous effect in the linear potential flow problem malenica et al 2003 modified the tank wall boundary condition while some other researchers e g kim 2003 modified the free surface boundary condition for small wave amplitude cases in this study the shear flow caused energy dissipation on the free surface is not expected to be dominant which is consistent with our experimental observation later that each foam sphere mainly moves vertically without evident relative slide along the free surface meanwhile the experiments show that the friction effect between the foam layer and tank boundary is evident thus we adopt malenica et al 2003 s approach and rewrite the boundary condition on the tank wall as 13 φ x i ν k φ i ω s 0 where ν is a damping coefficient to be confirmed through experimental calibration and k is the wave number compared with introduction of damping terms in free surface conditions this trick can also simplify the mathematical derivation if the resulted analytical solution predicts the experimental data well we can take this method as a pragmatic way of analysis wherever the energy is dissipated even so it must be admitted that this approximation is probably not exactly true for large amplitude sloshing cases damping terms are also expected to be introduced in free surface boundary conditions the method of separation of variables is used to give the analytical solution of φ having applied boundary conditions on the tank bottom and free surface we can obtain the general solution of φ 14 φ a 0 e i k 0 x b 0 e i k 0 x cosh k 0 y h n 1 a n e k n x b n e k n x cos k n y h where a and b as complex constants and k 0 and k n are determined by the following two equations 15 k n tan k n h ρ ω 2 ρ 0 ω 2 ρ g 16 k 0 tanh k 0 h ρ ω 2 ρ 0 ω 2 ρ g taking advantage of the asymmetric property of liquid sloshing in a swaying tank i e φ x y φ x y we have 17 φ x a 0 sin k x cosh k y h j 1 a j sinh κ j x cos κ j y h substituting eq 17 into boundary conditions on tank walls and applying the orthogonality relation lead to the following expression of coefficients 18 a 0 i ω s 0 h 0 cosh k y h dy k cos k l 2 i ν sin k l 2 h 0 cosh k y h 2 dy 4 i ω s 0 cos k l 2 i ν sin k l 2 sinh k h k cos

following cases physical parameters are determined according to the experimental set up as l 0 5 m g 9 81 m s 2 ρ 1000 k g m 3 and s 0 0 002 m the damping coefficient ν is to be determined from an experimental calibration the inertia effect of the floating foam is associated with the weight of the foam per area i e ρ 0 in eq 10 the density of the plastic foam is constant 30 k g m 3 the value of ρ 0 is approximated by multiplying the density by the total height of the foam layers in this subsection the liquid depth in the tank is h 0 1 m fig 4 firstly considers the case when floating foams are not put in the tank in experiments the tank is excited at frequencies of 0 7 ω 1 0 8 ω 1 0 9 ω 1 1 0 ω 1 1 1 ω 1 1 2 ω 1 and 1 3 ω 1 respectively the first natural sloshing frequency is denoted by ω 1 hereafter the response amplitude operators raos calculated by η s 0 with η as the wave amplitude at a steady stage of the wave elevation along the tank wall versus the excitation frequency are plotted in fig 4 to obtain the analytical solution we set ρ 0 0 and vary the damping coefficient ν from 0 to 0 03 the damping coefficient mainly works in a narrow frequency bandwidth around ω 1 within the bandwidth the peak of the rao curve can be suppressed as the value of ν increases otherwise the raos are not affected evidently by the viscous coefficient in the case of ν 0 the rao has an infinite value corresponding to the natural sloshing frequency which is not physically true using ν 0 025 the analytical solution can agree well with the experimental data thus the analytical solution is validated through a comparison with the experimental data then the contribution of ρ 0 is tested here by assuming the viscous effect in the tank as constant in fig 5 we fix the value ν 0 025 and vary the value of ρ 0 according to the number of layers it can be found that for the present set up increasing the number of foam layers equivalent to increasing the foam density can reduce the first natural sloshing frequency of the tank however this reduction is very slight and can be neglected in practice additionally changing ρ 0 does not affect the peak value of the rao curve it must be re stated here that this observation assumes that each foam element can move freely in a vertical direction without any linkage with its neighbours in fact increasing the number of foam layers can at the same time leads to the interaction of neighbouring foam elements and consequently an increase of the damping effect this can be further confirmed later in the experiments the sloshing tank with up to four layers of floating foams is further considered the liquid depth of the tank is 0 1 m and the excitation amplitude is 0 002 m from the experimental observation it can be told that the liquid motion can finally become steady after a transient stage in fig 6 raos obtained from analytical and experimental methods are compared the maximum wave amplitude at a steady sloshing stage occurs when the tank is excited at the first natural sloshing frequency the first natural sloshing frequency here is calculated according to eq 16 where the value of ρ 0 is set as 0 6 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 k g m 2 for cases of one to four layers respectively it should be noted that the calculated values of the first natural sloshing frequencies are almost identical for all these cases which is denoted by the same symbol ω 1 here it is also found that the peak value of the raos decreases as the number of foam layers increases for the considered cases the difference of analytical solutions is determined by two parameters i e ρ 0 and ν however as stated in fig 5 the ρ 0 indicating the inertia of floating foam elements can only affect the natural sloshing frequencies then the wave amplitude is affected by the damping coefficient ν fig 6 shows that from the 0 layer case to 1 and 2 layer cases the damping coefficient increases from 0 025 to 0 034 and 0 060 from a physical understanding increasing foams layers leads to an increase of interaction chances between neighbouring foam elements the mechanical energy dissipation of sloshing waves is associated with the thickness of foam elements fig 7 shows instants when the wave elevation reaches the largest height on the left tank wall during the steady state the tanks are excited at the first natural sloshing frequency subfigures a to e correspond to the cases when zero to four layers of foams are used respectively through a graphic comparison it can be evidently told that the wave amplitude decreases as the number of foam layers rises if we use η to denote the wave amplitude on the left tank wall and η 0 to indicate the zero layer case the ratio of wave amplitude reduction due to foam layers can be calculated using η 0 η η 0 fig 8 shows that ratio of wave amplitude reduction corresponding to the number of foam layers it can be told that even a single layer of floating foams can reduce the sloshing amplitude by 28 as the number of foam layers increases to 2 3 and 4 the sloshing amplitude can be sharply reduced by 62 73 and 85 respectively for the single layer case the energy dissipation can occur from the interaction of foam layer and tank wall for multiple layer cases this side to side interaction can further increase the energy dissipation at least two layers of floating foams is recommended when using this anti sloshing approach 4 2 effects of anti sloshing foams on pressure corresponding to the cases in subsection 4 1 histories of the dynamic pressure in sloshing tanks with and without floating foams are analyzed in this subsection consider three typical sensors marked by ch1 ch2 and ch3 located at 0 10 m 0 07 m and 0 04 m on the tank side above the tank bottom respectively the pressure sensor ch1 is just at the undisturbed free surface in fig 9 a 1 complete pressure histories are given when floating foams are not used the pressure amplitude at each sensor becomes steady after an initial stage before the oscillation platform begins cooling down a few periods from 100s to 104s of the steady stage are zoomed in for details as shown in figs 9 a 2 pressure signals at these three sensors are in phase from ch1 and ch2 to ch3 the peak value of the dynamic pressure decreases in sequence this is consistent with the fact that the velocity magnitude of fluid particles decreases from the free surface to the liquid bottom the lower half of the pressure history at ch1 is truncated when the sensor is beyond the free surface however from the signal at ch1 it is found that the recorded pressure is not exactly zero when the sensor is exposed to the air this may be because the pressure sensor is still wet with liquid drops attaching on it so that the detected pressure is not exactly the pressure of the atmosphere fig 9 b 1 c 1 d 1 and e 1 correspond to the recorded pressure histories in the sloshing tank with one to four layers of floating foams respectively like figs 9 a 2 fig 9 b 2 c 2 d 2 and e 2 zoom in the time histories between 100s and 104s correspondingly compared with figs 9 a 1 where an abrupt pressure jump exists during the transient stage the pressure amplitude gradually increases to a steady state when floating foams are used also the pressure amplitude decreases evidently as the number of foam layers increase from the experimental observation wet foam elements with capillary effects keep contacting the pressure sensor ch1 when the waterline is below ch1 which leads to a negative dynamic pressure at ch1 due to this reason the pressure signal at ch1 is not truncated as figs 9 e 2 shows in figs 9 e 2 when using four foam layers the measured dynamic pressure histories at three sensors are almost identical this is because the vertical liquid motion along the tank wall becomes very small so that the dynamic pressure is mainly from the inertia water impact in the horizontal direction in fig 10 a we compare the pressure signals in fig 9 after a proper phase shift it can be told that the pressure profiles have nonlinear features of second order stokes waves the profiles tend to be sinusoidal as the number of foam layers increases fig 10 b shows the relationship between the pressure amplitude and the number of foam layers it is evident that the pressure amplitude decreases almost linearly as the number of foam layers increases from 0 to 2 after that the decrease ratio slows down as the number of foam layers further increase from 3 to 4 in fig 11 an fft process is conducted on the steady stage of pressure histories in fig 9 fig 11 a and b correspond to the signal of ch1 and ch2 respectively for the 0 layer case besides the pressure component at the dominant frequency ω 1 higher order components 2 ω 1 and 3 ω 1 can also be identified the 2 ω 1 component in the experimental data is attributed to nonlinear interaction of linear components because from the linear mathematical model only odd modes e g ω 1 ω 3 ω 5 and so on can appear due to the antisymmetry property of this physical model for this specific case when the tank is excited at frequency ω 1 only the ω 1 component is expected to appear if a second order nonlinear perturbation analysis is further carried out for this problem it can be known that the 2 ω 1 component in the experimental data is attributed to the double frequency term of nonlinear solution therefore the 2 ω 1 component is due to the nonlinear effect which is beyond the present linear mathematical model the experimental data shows that as the number of foam layers increases the amplitude of the pressure components at ω 1 decreases evidently while the higher order components gradually vanish this indicates that the application of floating foams can reduce the nonlinear sloshing effects accompanied by the amplitude reduction of wave elevations and dynamic pressures fig 12 further compares the experimental and analytical results of the dynamic pressure amplitude for tanks with 0 layer 1 layer and 2 layer foams respectively only the steady stage of a measured pressure history at ch 2 is considered outside the resonance frequency region the analytical solutions agree well with the corresponding experimental measurements however at the resonance condition the measured dynamic pressure is evidently smaller than the analytical one this may be attributed to the assumption of slip boundary conditions in the analytical method in the physical experiments the boundary layer near the tank wall can play an important role to the dynamic pressure so that the actual dynamic pressure is lower than the analytical prediction 4 3 anti sloshing performance in tanks of different liquid depths in this section another two liquid depths of h 0 15 m and 0 20 m are considered the tanks are excited at the first natural sloshing frequencies of their own with the same excitation amplitude s 0 0 002 m fig 13 considers the tank of h 0 15 m with different layers of floating foams and shows the wave profiles when the wave elevation reaches the maxima along the left tank wall during a steady stage of the wave motion similarly fig 14 considers the case of h 0 20 m it is evident that for both liquid depths the maximum wave amplitude along the tank wall decreases as the number of foam layers increases from zero to four fig 15 a compares the wave amplitudes for sloshing tanks with different layers of floating foams for each liquid tank the maximum wave amplitude decreases as the number of foam layers increase from zero to four it is also noticed that among the three tank cases without floating foams the wave amplitude η 0 in the tank of h 0 15 m is the greatest followed by the tank of h 0 20 m and h 0 10 m successively this may be attributed to the fact that h 0 15 m is near the critical depth i e h l 0 337 faltinsen et al 2000 of the liquid the critical depth is associated with some nondeterministic phenomena e g an asymmetric behaviour of the wave elevation along the tank walls alternation of the breaking phenomenon at the two tank sides etc which is sensitive to the prior excitation situations colagrossi et al 2004 in the present experimental set up slight splashes on the tank wall can be observed in the tank of h 0 15 m fig 15 b specifically compares the decreasing extent of the wave amplitude by using floating foams relative to the wave amplitude in the same tank without floating foams the value of η 0 η s 0 for the tank of h 0 15 m is greater than that of h 0 20 m and successively that of h 0 10 m this suggests that the floating foams can work more efficient for tanks with larger amplitude sloshing waves from a physical point of view foam elements floating on larger amplitude waves can have stronger interactions leading to more energy dissipation fig 16 shows histories of the dynamic pressure in two depths of sloshing tanks with different layers of floating foams for each tank the signal phases are shifted for a better comparison for these two tanks all three pressure sensors ch1 ch2 and ch3 are always below the free surface for each test case similar observation as fig 10 can be obtained for each tank the pressure amplitude decreases with the number of foam layers increasing from 0 to 4 after that the decrease ratio slows down as the number of foam layers increases 5 conclusions in this study anti sloshing effects of floating solid foams in a rectangular tank are investigated experiments are carried out at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology an analytical potential flow solution is derived to help explain the experimental observations it is found that with a proper choice of the damping coefficient the analytical solution can agree well with the experiments increasing the number of foam layers equivalent to increasing the foam density can reduce the first natural sloshing frequency of the tank however this reduction is very slight and can be neglected in the present experiments as a result of the small density of plastic foams effects of various layers of floating foams on both the wave profiles and dynamic pressure in sloshing tanks are further discussed it shows that even a single layer of floating foams can reduce the sloshing amplitude due to the energy dissipation from the side to side interaction of neighbouring foam elements and tank wall if multiple layers of floating foams are further applied the sloshing amplitude can be sharply reduced due to greater energy dissipation at least two layers of floating foams are recommended to be applied when using this anti sloshing approach the amplitude of dynamic pressure in the tank is also found to decrease as the number of foam layers increases the dynamic pressure possesses not only a pressure component at the dominant frequency denoted by ω 1 but also higher order components e g 2 ω 1 and 3 ω 1 as the number of foam layers increases the higher order components gradually vanish indicating a reduction of the nonlinear sloshing effects anti sloshing effects of floating foams in tanks of different depths are further discussed it is confirmed in all these tanks that the maximum wave amplitude along the tank wall decreases as the number of foam layers increases from zero to four also the floating foams can work more efficiently for tanks with larger amplitude sloshing waves

2016 studied effects of t shaped baffles on liquid sloshing in horizontal elliptical tanks using a semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method sbfem cho and kim 2016 derived the analytic solution for liquid sloshing in a swaying rectangular tank with dual porous baffles and conducted experiments for validation kumar and sinhamahapatra 2016 analytically studied dynamic characteristics of fluid within a tank with vertical perforated baffle and screens of different solidity ratio hwang et al 2016 studied and demonstrated effects of elastic baffles on the sloshing phenomena through experimental and numerical methods xue et al 2017 carried out the experimental study on hydrodynamic characteristics of different anti sloshing baffles in the square tank the above baffle based anti sloshing techniques have been widely adopted by oil or chemical tankers however these techniques still require further verification for the special case of lng tanks because the internal surface of an lng tank is fully covered by thin invar membranes to prevent gas leakage at an extremely low temperature installing baffles through the membrane surface may affect mechanical properties of the membrane and bring safety risks thus alternative anti sloshing ideas keep emerging in the recent decade trying to avoid damaging the membrane surface anai et al 2010 suggested an anti sloshing method using the membrane material that can deform flexibly near the free surface to restrain the fluid motion hernández and santamarina 2012 introduced an active anti sloshing technique taking advantage of real time controlled dynamic baffles however for flammable and explosive lng cargo this electricity dependent approach inevitably has safety risks koh et al 2013 proposed an anti sloshing scheme based on the floating structure the floating structure changes position to dynamically adjust the natural sloshing frequency of the liquid in the tank so that the occurrence probability of liquid resonance in the tank can be reduced arai et al 2013 proposed a simple anti sloshing floating device at the still water to form sub tanks through model tests and numerical simulations the sloshing suppression effectiveness and further optimized the shape of the floating plate were discussed further yu et al 2017 experimentally studied sloshing with two floating plates in a rectangular tank at three different filling rates under roll excitation suppressing effects of the device on wave run up and pressure along the longitudinal bulkhead were observed zhang 2015 proposed a design of lng carrier with various wedged tanks from an overall perspective aiming to avoid the simultaneous occurrence of sloshing resonance in all tanks of an lng carrier and reduce the resultant sloshing dynamics from all tanks acting on the ship another interesting anti sloshing concept is based on a floater type blanket kim et al 2011 proposed by samsung heavy industry shi together with basf company ltd the blanket consists of foam cubes made from melamine resin see fig 1 it was claimed that this design can not only protect against sloshing but also lower the boil off rate bor a measurement of vaporization basf samsung heavy industries 2013 which can be very promising however this foam blanket must be designed carefully to satisfy contradictory physical requirements on the one hand it should be lightweight in order to float and avoid damaging tank walls but on the other hand it must be sufficiently heavy to influence the sloshing motion this requires an in depth understanding of hydrodynamics of floating foams in a sloshing tank at present studies on liquid sloshing with floating foams are still very limited a relevant study is sauret et al 2015 which carried out experiments for foam layers of liquid bubbles on the free surface in a sloshing tank it is observed that only a few layers of bubbles can significantly damp the liquid oscillations while bubbles close to the walls have a significant impact on the dissipation of energy however for a practical lng tank it may not be easy to controllably generate desired size and amount of lng bubble foams besides capillary effects that matter in their small scale sloshing cases can be insignificant for large scale lng tanks of our focus thus this study proposes an alternative idea by using solid foam spheres instead of liquid foam bubbles the solid foam spheres can also be considered as fragments of the above mentioned floater type blanket kim et al 2011 although the present idea has aborted linkages among fragments and applied multiple layers this design is expected to inherit advantages of the above two sloshing mitigation strategies with a simpler operational practice experiments are carried out at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology an analytical potential flow solution is derived to help explain the experimental observations section 2 describes the experimental set ups section 3 introduces the derivation of the analytical solution in section 4 experimental and analytical results are analyzed effects of various layers of floating foams on both the wave profiles and dynamic pressure in sloshing tanks are discussed tanks with three different liquid depths are considered finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 experiment set up the physical experiments are conducted on an oscillation test platform fig 2 a at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the platform can generate a harmonic oscillation with the amplitude ranging from 0 to 0 0254 m and frequency below 1000 hz more detailed technical parameters of the equipment are given in jiang 2014 a rectangular tank made from plexiglas is fixed on the oscillation platform the tank has the length of 0 5 m width of 0 1 m and height of 0 4 m which are measured from the internal tank surface the thickness of the tank wall is 0 02 m so that the tank can be considered rigid the tank is filled with dyed water during the experiment the platform oscillates harmonically along the length direction of the liquid tank so that the displacement of the fluid remains two dimensional in principle a video camera and a series of pressure sensors are used to record the liquid sloshing behaviour in the tank plastic foam spheres with the diameter of 0 02 m and density of 30 kg m3 are uniformly deployed on the free surface of the liquid fig 2 b up to four layers of spherical foams are considered in the experiments in the present experiments each case is repeated three times the wave amplitude is determined by the mean value of three repeats with an error of 0 4 1 24 the pressure sensor has the scale of 10 kpa and precision of 0 01 0 08 the diameter of plastic spheres has error of 1 5 mm due to the size limitation of the oscillation test platform only one tank scale has been considered in this study it must be pointed out that the scaling issue must be further investigated before applying the present experimental results to a full scale application although the scaling law for this multi physics problem is very complex for the simplest sloshing only with the liquid phase experimental modelling can be based on the froude scaling assumption for two phases with included gas compressibility effects the froude scaling is no longer satisfied even with the same the ratio of densities between gas and liquid braeunig et al 2009 the present model further includes elastic solid spheres for the froude scaling the principle sources of bias can at least be the gas liquid solid density ratio compressibility effects of gas hydro elastic effects of solid and phase transition of liquid thus the scaling law with and without spheres is expected to be different which surely requires further investigation in the future 3 mathematical model this section considers a two dimensional rectangular tank with the length of l on the free surface there are several layers of spherical plastic foams the height of the liquid at rest is h the liquid density is represented by ρ as in fig 3 a cartesian coordinate system o xy is defined with the origin o at the centre of undisturbed free surface y axis pointing vertically upwards and x axis pointing to the right the fluid domain is denoted by v the liquid dynamics is considered based on the potential flow theory by assuming the fluid to be inviscid incompressible and flow irrotational the velocity potential φ x y t whose gradient represents the fluid velocity is introduced if the wave amplitude is small and the tank is undergoing a small lateral excitation the velocity potential can be determined from a linearized boundary value problem in the fluid domain the velocity potential satisfies laplace s equation 1 2 φ 0 the pressure p can be expressed by bernoulli s equation 2 p ρ φ t g z the free surface is covered with small pieces of foams without restrains between each pair of neighbours consider a small piece of foam with the length of d x and let ρ 0 denote the mass of the foam per free surface area its vertical motion is governed by the following dynamic equation 3 ρ φ t g η ρ 0 2 η t 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration η x t is the vertical displacement of the foam besides eq 3 the following kinematic boundary condition should also be satisfied 4 φ y η t on l 2 x l 2 y 0 on the tank sides and bottom the following boundary conditions are satisfied 5 φ y 0 on l 2 x l 2 y h 6 φ x s 0 t on x l 2 h y 0 where s 0 is the displacement of the tank in this study we are interested in the steady sloshing state by assuming φ x y t re φ x y e i ω t s 0 t re s 0 e i ω t and η x t re η x e i ω t the boundary value problem can be written as 7 2 φ 0 in v 8 φ y 0 on l 2 x l 2 y h 9 φ y i ω η on l 2 x l 2 y 0 10 ρ 0 ρ ω 2 g η i ω φ x y 0 on l 2 x l 2 y 0 11 φ x i ω s 0 in x l 2 h y 0 eqs 10 and 11 can be combined by eliminating η 12 ρ 0 ρ ω 2 g φ y ω 2 φ 0 it has been known that the energy dissipation mainly caused by the viscosity is unneglectable in a resonant sloshing condition to approximate the viscous effect in the linear potential flow problem malenica et al 2003 modified the tank wall boundary condition while some other researchers e g kim 2003 modified the free surface boundary condition for small wave amplitude cases in this study the shear flow caused energy dissipation on the free surface is not expected to be dominant which is consistent with our experimental observation later that each foam sphere mainly moves vertically without evident relative slide along the free surface meanwhile the experiments show that the friction effect between the foam layer and tank boundary is evident thus we adopt malenica et al 2003 s approach and rewrite the boundary condition on the tank wall as 13 φ x i ν k φ i ω s 0 where ν is a damping coefficient to be confirmed through experimental calibration and k is the wave number compared with introduction of damping terms in free surface conditions this trick can also simplify the mathematical derivation if the resulted analytical solution predicts the experimental data well we can take this method as a pragmatic way of analysis wherever the energy is dissipated even so it must be admitted that this approximation is probably not exactly true for large amplitude sloshing cases damping terms are also expected to be introduced in free surface boundary conditions the method of separation of variables is used to give the analytical solution of φ having applied boundary conditions on the tank bottom and free surface we can obtain the general solution of φ 14 φ a 0 e i k 0 x b 0 e i k 0 x cosh k 0 y h n 1 a n e k n x b n e k n x cos k n y h where a and b as complex constants and k 0 and k n are determined by the following two equations 15 k n tan k n h ρ ω 2 ρ 0 ω 2 ρ g 16 k 0 tanh k 0 h ρ ω 2 ρ 0 ω 2 ρ g taking advantage of the asymmetric property of liquid sloshing in a swaying tank i e φ x y φ x y we have 17 φ x a 0 sin k x cosh k y h j 1 a j sinh κ j x cos κ j y h substituting eq 17 into boundary conditions on tank walls and applying the orthogonality relation lead to the following expression of coefficients 18 a 0 i ω s 0 h 0 cosh k y h dy k cos k l 2 i ν sin k l 2 h 0 cosh k y h 2 dy 4 i ω s 0 cos k l 2 i ν sin k l 2 sinh k h k cos

following cases physical parameters are determined according to the experimental set up as l 0 5 m g 9 81 m s 2 ρ 1000 k g m 3 and s 0 0 002 m the damping coefficient ν is to be determined from an experimental calibration the inertia effect of the floating foam is associated with the weight of the foam per area i e ρ 0 in eq 10 the density of the plastic foam is constant 30 k g m 3 the value of ρ 0 is approximated by multiplying the density by the total height of the foam layers in this subsection the liquid depth in the tank is h 0 1 m fig 4 firstly considers the case when floating foams are not put in the tank in experiments the tank is excited at frequencies of 0 7 ω 1 0 8 ω 1 0 9 ω 1 1 0 ω 1 1 1 ω 1 1 2 ω 1 and 1 3 ω 1 respectively the first natural sloshing frequency is denoted by ω 1 hereafter the response amplitude operators raos calculated by η s 0 with η as the wave amplitude at a steady stage of the wave elevation along the tank wall versus the excitation frequency are plotted in fig 4 to obtain the analytical solution we set ρ 0 0 and vary the damping coefficient ν from 0 to 0 03 the damping coefficient mainly works in a narrow frequency bandwidth around ω 1 within the bandwidth the peak of the rao curve can be suppressed as the value of ν increases otherwise the raos are not affected evidently by the viscous coefficient in the case of ν 0 the rao has an infinite value corresponding to the natural sloshing frequency which is not physically true using ν 0 025 the analytical solution can agree well with the experimental data thus the analytical solution is validated through a comparison with the experimental data then the contribution of ρ 0 is tested here by assuming the viscous effect in the tank as constant in fig 5 we fix the value ν 0 025 and vary the value of ρ 0 according to the number of layers it can be found that for the present set up increasing the number of foam layers equivalent to increasing the foam density can reduce the first natural sloshing frequency of the tank however this reduction is very slight and can be neglected in practice additionally changing ρ 0 does not affect the peak value of the rao curve it must be re stated here that this observation assumes that each foam element can move freely in a vertical direction without any linkage with its neighbours in fact increasing the number of foam layers can at the same time leads to the interaction of neighbouring foam elements and consequently an increase of the damping effect this can be further confirmed later in the experiments the sloshing tank with up to four layers of floating foams is further considered the liquid depth of the tank is 0 1 m and the excitation amplitude is 0 002 m from the experimental observation it can be told that the liquid motion can finally become steady after a transient stage in fig 6 raos obtained from analytical and experimental methods are compared the maximum wave amplitude at a steady sloshing stage occurs when the tank is excited at the first natural sloshing frequency the first natural sloshing frequency here is calculated according to eq 16 where the value of ρ 0 is set as 0 6 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 k g m 2 for cases of one to four layers respectively it should be noted that the calculated values of the first natural sloshing frequencies are almost identical for all these cases which is denoted by the same symbol ω 1 here it is also found that the peak value of the raos decreases as the number of foam layers increases for the considered cases the difference of analytical solutions is determined by two parameters i e ρ 0 and ν however as stated in fig 5 the ρ 0 indicating the inertia of floating foam elements can only affect the natural sloshing frequencies then the wave amplitude is affected by the damping coefficient ν fig 6 shows that from the 0 layer case to 1 and 2 layer cases the damping coefficient increases from 0 025 to 0 034 and 0 060 from a physical understanding increasing foams layers leads to an increase of interaction chances between neighbouring foam elements the mechanical energy dissipation of sloshing waves is associated with the thickness of foam elements fig 7 shows instants when the wave elevation reaches the largest height on the left tank wall during the steady state the tanks are excited at the first natural sloshing frequency subfigures a to e correspond to the cases when zero to four layers of foams are used respectively through a graphic comparison it can be evidently told that the wave amplitude decreases as the number of foam layers rises if we use η to denote the wave amplitude on the left tank wall and η 0 to indicate the zero layer case the ratio of wave amplitude reduction due to foam layers can be calculated using η 0 η η 0 fig 8 shows that ratio of wave amplitude reduction corresponding to the number of foam layers it can be told that even a single layer of floating foams can reduce the sloshing amplitude by 28 as the number of foam layers increases to 2 3 and 4 the sloshing amplitude can be sharply reduced by 62 73 and 85 respectively for the single layer case the energy dissipation can occur from the interaction of foam layer and tank wall for multiple layer cases this side to side interaction can further increase the energy dissipation at least two layers of floating foams is recommended when using this anti sloshing approach 4 2 effects of anti sloshing foams on pressure corresponding to the cases in subsection 4 1 histories of the dynamic pressure in sloshing tanks with and without floating foams are analyzed in this subsection consider three typical sensors marked by ch1 ch2 and ch3 located at 0 10 m 0 07 m and 0 04 m on the tank side above the tank bottom respectively the pressure sensor ch1 is just at the undisturbed free surface in fig 9 a 1 complete pressure histories are given when floating foams are not used the pressure amplitude at each sensor becomes steady after an initial stage before the oscillation platform begins cooling down a few periods from 100s to 104s of the steady stage are zoomed in for details as shown in figs 9 a 2 pressure signals at these three sensors are in phase from ch1 and ch2 to ch3 the peak value of the dynamic pressure decreases in sequence this is consistent with the fact that the velocity magnitude of fluid particles decreases from the free surface to the liquid bottom the lower half of the pressure history at ch1 is truncated when the sensor is beyond the free surface however from the signal at ch1 it is found that the recorded pressure is not exactly zero when the sensor is exposed to the air this may be because the pressure sensor is still wet with liquid drops attaching on it so that the detected pressure is not exactly the pressure of the atmosphere fig 9 b 1 c 1 d 1 and e 1 correspond to the recorded pressure histories in the sloshing tank with one to four layers of floating foams respectively like figs 9 a 2 fig 9 b 2 c 2 d 2 and e 2 zoom in the time histories between 100s and 104s correspondingly compared with figs 9 a 1 where an abrupt pressure jump exists during the transient stage the pressure amplitude gradually increases to a steady state when floating foams are used also the pressure amplitude decreases evidently as the number of foam layers increase from the experimental observation wet foam elements with capillary effects keep contacting the pressure sensor ch1 when the waterline is below ch1 which leads to a negative dynamic pressure at ch1 due to this reason the pressure signal at ch1 is not truncated as figs 9 e 2 shows in figs 9 e 2 when using four foam layers the measured dynamic pressure histories at three sensors are almost identical this is because the vertical liquid motion along the tank wall becomes very small so that the dynamic pressure is mainly from the inertia water impact in the horizontal direction in fig 10 a we compare the pressure signals in fig 9 after a proper phase shift it can be told that the pressure profiles have nonlinear features of second order stokes waves the profiles tend to be sinusoidal as the number of foam layers increases fig 10 b shows the relationship between the pressure amplitude and the number of foam layers it is evident that the pressure amplitude decreases almost linearly as the number of foam layers increases from 0 to 2 after that the decrease ratio slows down as the number of foam layers further increase from 3 to 4 in fig 11 an fft process is conducted on the steady stage of pressure histories in fig 9 fig 11 a and b correspond to the signal of ch1 and ch2 respectively for the 0 layer case besides the pressure component at the dominant frequency ω 1 higher order components 2 ω 1 and 3 ω 1 can also be identified the 2 ω 1 component in the experimental data is attributed to nonlinear interaction of linear components because from the linear mathematical model only odd modes e g ω 1 ω 3 ω 5 and so on can appear due to the antisymmetry property of this physical model for this specific case when the tank is excited at frequency ω 1 only the ω 1 component is expected to appear if a second order nonlinear perturbation analysis is further carried out for this problem it can be known that the 2 ω 1 component in the experimental data is attributed to the double frequency term of nonlinear solution therefore the 2 ω 1 component is due to the nonlinear effect which is beyond the present linear mathematical model the experimental data shows that as the number of foam layers increases the amplitude of the pressure components at ω 1 decreases evidently while the higher order components gradually vanish this indicates that the application of floating foams can reduce the nonlinear sloshing effects accompanied by the amplitude reduction of wave elevations and dynamic pressures fig 12 further compares the experimental and analytical results of the dynamic pressure amplitude for tanks with 0 layer 1 layer and 2 layer foams respectively only the steady stage of a measured pressure history at ch 2 is considered outside the resonance frequency region the analytical solutions agree well with the corresponding experimental measurements however at the resonance condition the measured dynamic pressure is evidently smaller than the analytical one this may be attributed to the assumption of slip boundary conditions in the analytical method in the physical experiments the boundary layer near the tank wall can play an important role to the dynamic pressure so that the actual dynamic pressure is lower than the analytical prediction 4 3 anti sloshing performance in tanks of different liquid depths in this section another two liquid depths of h 0 15 m and 0 20 m are considered the tanks are excited at the first natural sloshing frequencies of their own with the same excitation amplitude s 0 0 002 m fig 13 considers the tank of h 0 15 m with different layers of floating foams and shows the wave profiles when the wave elevation reaches the maxima along the left tank wall during a steady stage of the wave motion similarly fig 14 considers the case of h 0 20 m it is evident that for both liquid depths the maximum wave amplitude along the tank wall decreases as the number of foam layers increases from zero to four fig 15 a compares the wave amplitudes for sloshing tanks with different layers of floating foams for each liquid tank the maximum wave amplitude decreases as the number of foam layers increase from zero to four it is also noticed that among the three tank cases without floating foams the wave amplitude η 0 in the tank of h 0 15 m is the greatest followed by the tank of h 0 20 m and h 0 10 m successively this may be attributed to the fact that h 0 15 m is near the critical depth i e h l 0 337 faltinsen et al 2000 of the liquid the critical depth is associated with some nondeterministic phenomena e g an asymmetric behaviour of the wave elevation along the tank walls alternation of the breaking phenomenon at the two tank sides etc which is sensitive to the prior excitation situations colagrossi et al 2004 in the present experimental set up slight splashes on the tank wall can be observed in the tank of h 0 15 m fig 15 b specifically compares the decreasing extent of the wave amplitude by using floating foams relative to the wave amplitude in the same tank without floating foams the value of η 0 η s 0 for the tank of h 0 15 m is greater than that of h 0 20 m and successively that of h 0 10 m this suggests that the floating foams can work more efficient for tanks with larger amplitude sloshing waves from a physical point of view foam elements floating on larger amplitude waves can have stronger interactions leading to more energy dissipation fig 16 shows histories of the dynamic pressure in two depths of sloshing tanks with different layers of floating foams for each tank the signal phases are shifted for a better comparison for these two tanks all three pressure sensors ch1 ch2 and ch3 are always below the free surface for each test case similar observation as fig 10 can be obtained for each tank the pressure amplitude decreases with the number of foam layers increasing from 0 to 4 after that the decrease ratio slows down as the number of foam layers increases 5 conclusions in this study anti sloshing effects of floating solid foams in a rectangular tank are investigated experiments are carried out at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology an analytical potential flow solution is derived to help explain the experimental observations it is found that with a proper choice of the damping coefficient the analytical solution can agree well with the experiments increasing the number of foam layers equivalent to increasing the foam density can reduce the first natural sloshing frequency of the tank however this reduction is very slight and can be neglected in the present experiments as a result of the small density of plastic foams effects of various layers of floating foams on both the wave profiles and dynamic pressure in sloshing tanks are further discussed it shows that even a single layer of floating foams can reduce the sloshing amplitude due to the energy dissipation from the side to side interaction of neighbouring foam elements and tank wall if multiple layers of floating foams are further applied the sloshing amplitude can be sharply reduced due to greater energy dissipation at least two layers of floating foams are recommended to be applied when using this anti sloshing approach the amplitude of dynamic pressure in the tank is also found to decrease as the number of foam layers increases the dynamic pressure possesses not only a pressure component at the dominant frequency denoted by ω 1 but also higher order components e g 2 ω 1 and 3 ω 1 as the number of foam layers increases the higher order components gradually vanish indicating a reduction of the nonlinear sloshing effects anti sloshing effects of floating foams in tanks of different depths are further discussed it is confirmed in all these tanks that the maximum wave amplitude along the tank wall decreases as the number of foam layers increases from zero to four also the floating foams can work more efficiently for tanks with larger amplitude sloshing waves

22952,of the many factors that influence navigational safety navigable flow conditions are one of the most important therefore the development of a navigation risk assessment model based on flow conditions is of considerable importance for improving the safety of shipping in this paper the influence of flow on shipping is considered four determination indices for navigational safety including water surface slope backflow velocity and depth and a five level classification of navigation risk assessment are proposed to evaluate quantitatively the influence of flow conditions on shipping a navigation risk assessment model is established using gray relational analysis in a case study of navigation in the river between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam a two dimensional hydrodynamic model for the study reach is established to simulate four types of flow field i e under three gorges dam discharge of 7 000 10 000 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s shipping risk maps for specific ship types under different water regimes were drawn in accordance with the simulated results based on the navigation risk assessment model the research results not only promote effective precise management of navigation in the study reach but they also provide a reference for quantitative research of navigational safety keywords navigable flow conditions gray relational analysis navigation risk assessment shipping risk map three gorges dam gezhouba dam 1 introduction at the end of 2017 the total length of navigable inland waterways in china had reached 127 000 km ranking first in the world and providing the basis for an inland waterway transport network mot 2018 however heavy usage and complicated water regimes have caused considerable pressure on navigation management which has resulted in poor transport efficiency and the frequent occurrence of accidents although inland electronic navigational charts beacon systems gps ais and other aids systems are available to ensure navigational safety and efficiency the lack of real time and detailed knowledge regarding navigable flow conditions and waterway conditions poses a considerable potential safety hazard xiao et al 2015 during january august 2018 86 shipping accidents involving 135 vessels occurred in the yangtze river among them 68 accidents 79 were caused by collisions reefing and stranding cmsa 2018 on april 19 2018 the tanker xinhang 301 collided with the cargo ship suqilaizhou 900 on the yangtze river near the sutong bridge in the yangtze river the accident caused the suqilaizhou 900 to sink rapidly which resulted in two of the crew being reported missing investigation of the root causes of such accidents has revealed that inadequate understanding of the flow conditions in complex navigational sections such as bridge areas can lead the captain and or pilot to underestimate the navigational risks therefore it is very important to study the risk to navigation associated with flow conditions and to assess the available early warning technology to clarify the influence of flow conditions on navigation improve navigational safety and promote rigorous management of navigation channels regarding navigational risk and early warning technology a considerable amount of theoretical research has been undertaken globally and a series of achievements from initial qualitative and empirical evaluations to quantitative evaluations have been accomplished vander hoorn and knapp 2015 wang and xie 2013 li and xue 2009 analysis of maritime traffic accidents is an important basis for the identification assessment and early warning of navigational risks generally most models for evaluating the risk regarding maritime accidents are based on reports of maritime affairs and statistical theory and they provide statistical analyses of a certain range of maritime traffic accidents within a certain period from these the principal influencing factors of accidents can be obtained and appropriate mitigating measures proposed akyuz 2017 xiao et al 2015 toffoli et al 2005 li and wu 1997 to provide comprehensive assessment of maritime traffic safety and navigation environment risk lois et al 2004 analyzed cruise ship accident statistics using a formal safety assessment method based on which they proposed relevant risk control and accident prevention countermeasures zheng et al 1997 considered the navigational safety of coastal and port areas and they analyzed the main causes of ship accidents in harbors using gray relational analysis ronza et al 2003 applied the method of fault tree analysis to predict the frequency of port area accidents zhang and zhou 2007 studied the laws of inland water traffic safety and risk factors following which they established a safety evaluation model using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the safety status of inland waterway transport zhang et al 2013 undertook a comprehensive assessment of navigational risk using a bayesian network to study data of accidents on the yangtze river waterway the above research focused mainly on maritime traffic safety and research investigating inland navigational safety is scant many evaluation models have been used to consider the sequential state of safety in which factors such as the crew ship environment and management system including multiple evaluation indices such as crew age structure crew safety awareness crew culture level ship tonnage hull structure wind rain water depth and information management have been taken into account based on selected evaluation indices evaluation models have been established using formal safety assessment methods bayesian networks gray system theory and other methods to evaluate comprehensively the navigational safety of inland waterways ports or seas su et al 2012 vander hoorn and knapp 2015 mentes et al 2015 akyuz and celik 2016 baksh et al 2018 approaches such as these can provide an evaluation of navigation risk that is more comprehensive and better able to reflect the long term risk situation of the evaluation object however the refinement of an evaluation of navigation risk for a certain river reach over small spatial and temporal scales appears inadequate which makes it difficult to aid the navigation of a certain type of ship in different areas of a waterway furthermore current analyses and evaluations of safety are based mostly on accident statistics where the evaluation indices and weights are based on the subjective judgment of experts this makes the evaluation process slow and this lag impinges on real time navigational warning vander hoorn and knapp 2015 mentes et al 2015 li and zhang 2014 hu et al 2007 in a study of navigable flow conditions li et al 2008 investigated a port and the entrance area of the approach waterway and they provided a quantitative description of the navigable flow conditions within the entrance area zhang et al 2016a 2016b developed a three dimensional waterway system using a hydrodynamic model and flow field visualization technology for ship navigation and early warning heij and knapp 2015 studied the effect of wave height on navigation risk for different types of ship based on accident statistics and data from a large number of observation points akyildiz and mentes 2017 considered a variety of risk factors including wave height to analyze the uncertainty of cargo ship safety wang et al 2014 conducted a safety assessment of shipping routes in the south china sea based on water depth wave height and other navigation related conditions although the above studies have made some progress in the quantitative evaluation and early warning of navigable safety related to flow conditions their consideration of flow conditions was rather simple for example only wave height was considered in the navigation risk at sea and most inland navigation risk assessment considered only water depth and velocity li and zhang 2014 zhang and zhou 2007 zheng et al 1997 furthermore because of the lack of navigation risk assessment indices and a systematic evaluation method for flow conditions it is difficult to describe quantitatively the impact of navigable flow conditions on navigational safety in this paper the navigation risk based on flow conditions is studied 1 the influencing factors of navigable flow are analyzed and navigation risk evaluation indices based on flow conditions are proposed to establish a navigation risk assessment model 2 for the case of navigation between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam a two dimensional hydrodynamic model is established to simulate the flow field under different water regimes based on the simulated flow fields shipping risk maps for specific ship types under the different flow conditions are obtained using the ship risk assessment model and methods for precise navigation warnings are discussed 2 study area the river section between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam hereafter referred to as the study reach is known as the throat area along the golden waterway of the yangtze river and it has a very important position in yangtze river shipping the length of the study reach is about 38 km most of this river section is located within the xiling gorge and the length of the river between sandouping and letianxi is 9 6 km as shown in fig 1 the river section below letianxi comprising the gorge area has narrow width and a wide valley the river channel generally has a u or v shaped section and its width is mainly 300 800 m although it can extend up to 1400 m in the flood season furthermore the river incorporates many winding and narrow deep channels making it one of the most difficult sections for navigation zhao et al 2012 after the completion of the gezhouba project the riverbed of the study reach was within the reservoir backwater area throughout the year however because of the low water head of the gezhouba dam the river channel shows the dual characteristics of an artificial reservoir and a natural river reach at different times of the year shu et al 2005 the water flow of the study reach is gentle in the mid and low water periods furthermore the flow velocity and the slope are also small which are conducive to ship navigation however in the flood season the waterway of the study reach is restricted both by the water level in front of the gezhouba dam and by the riverbed topography with an increase of gezhouba reservoir inflow because of the restriction on the increase of the cross sectional area of the study reach the vertical and horizontal fluctuations can be large resulting in fast flowing natural river characteristics in combination with operations to reduce the reservoir water level in the flood season the water flow of some river reaches can be poor when the three gorges reservoir maintains a large discharge this can result in abrupt and chaotic increases in flow velocity and slope that can cause the navigability of the study reach to deteriorate rapidly the width of the study reach is small and there are many rapids and meanders in particular the flood rapids at shuitianjiao and xitan and the meander rapids at shipai constitute the sections of the study reach most difficult for navigation especially for large tonnage ships yuan et al 2012 in the context of enhanced navigational conditions in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the navigational capacity between the two dams has become a bottleneck restricting the development of yangtze river navigation and affecting the benefits of three gorges navigation 3 data 3 1 calculation of water flow data for inland waterways with complicated channel shapes and flow regimes a one dimensional hydrodynamic model cannot reflect fully the required navigable flow conditions therefore two or three dimensional hydrodynamic models are needed compared with two dimensional hydrodynamic models a three dimensional hydrodynamic model is very complex and it requires time consuming calculations the development of two dimensional hydrodynamic models is mature and they have been shown effective in simulating the flow distribution and variation characteristics of long rivers wang and xiang 2007 therefore this approach is selected here for the calculation of the flow fields of the channel under specific water regimes in modeling the waterway flow the horizontal scale is larger than the vertical depth scale therefore ignoring the impact of the coriolis force and wind the two dimensional shallow water equation is used as the control equation zhang et al 2018a the conservation of the two dimensional shallow water equation is shown in eqs 1 3 1 u t f u s 2 u h h u h v f f x f y f x h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v f y h v h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 3 s 0 g h s 0 x s f x g h s 0 y s f y where u and v represent the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively g represents gravitational acceleration s 0 x z b x and s 0 y z b y represent the bottom slope term of the x and y directions respectively z b represents the bottom elevation s f x n 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 and s f y n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 represent the friction slope of the x and y directions respectively and n is the manning coefficient 3 2 verification of calculation results taking the river section between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam as the case study reach a 30 m spatial step was used to segment the river from which 26 100 quadrilateral grids were generated the data of transverse velocity longitudinal velocity river bottom elevation water depth and water level at the grid nodes are obtained using the two dimensional hydrodynamic model in the setup phase of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model the data of river bottom elevation for the study reach were provided by the three gorges navigation authority using measurements obtained in october 2008 these data include elevations for more than 10 000 points along the study reach in the calibration and verification phase of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model the measured water level flow velocity and flow direction data of three key river reaches i e letianxi liantuo and shipai of the study reach provided by three gorges navigation measurement team are selected to verify the model the verification results are shown in table 1 the verification results show that the absolute deviation of the water level between the calculated and measured values is 0 05 m and that the relative deviation of flow velocity is between 3 1 and 1 9 the results of flow direction and the measured buoy line are similar it can be seen that the established two dimensional hydrodynamic model can simulate the flow state of the study reach with high accuracy and precision 4 methods 4 1 indices and criteria for navigation risk assessment to establish a navigation risk assessment model based on flow conditions we must first select the key factors of flow conditions as evaluation indices which should reflect fully the impact of flow conditions on navigational safety in the selection of evaluation indices and the determination of evaluation criteria this paper uses the chinese national navigation standard of inland waterways as the principal benchmark although it refers extensively to other relevant norms and international literature to determine the appropriate indices and criteria zhou 2004 yao 2006 mot 2010 mohurd 2014 mentes et al 2015 vander hoorn and knapp 2015 akyildiz and mentes 2017 baksh et al 2018 according to the navigation standard of inland waterways the flow conditions of inland waterways such as flow velocity flow regime water surface slope and water depth should meet the requirements for safe navigation of the designed ship or fleet mohurd 2014 the navigation depth of different levels of waterway is clearly stipulated and therefore four assessment indices i e water surface slope degree of backflow velocity and depth are selected in this paper the degree of backflow represents the angle of deviation between the flow direction at each node and the average flow direction over a certain spatial scale where the angle is used as the unit of measure with which to reflect the disorder of the flow field in terms of the safety thresholds of the indices only water depth has a clear threshold range in this paper the results of a number of previous works are summarized to determine the thresholds of the indices for water surface slope with reference to the maximum allowable velocity and slope for the 10 000 t fleet yao 2006 there is very small effect on ship safety when the water surface slope is 1 whereas it is considered very unfavorable for navigational safety when it is 4 for the degree of backflow according to the stipulation that the navigation angle of the ship fleet should be 10 and that the steering angle should be 20 in the entrance area of the approach channel zhou 2004 it is considered that a flow regime is sufficiently turbulent to seriously endanger navigational safety when the degree of backflow is 16 conversely when the degree of backflow is 4 there is almost no disorder for flow velocity with reference to the maximum allowable velocity and slope for the 10 000 t fleet the maximum allowable surface velocity with a surface slope of 0 5 is 2 6 m s therefore it is assumed that the maximum acceptable surface velocity for a typical 5000 t dry bulk ship is about 3 m s according to the main scale series of the standard ship type in the chuan river and three gorges reservoir revised in 2010 mot 2010 the standard draft of a typical 5000 t dry bulk ship is 4 3 m according to the navigation standard of inland waterways the surplus water depth of a level 1 waterway should be 0 5 m therefore a typical 5000 t dry bulk ship cannot sail when the water depth is 4 8 m mohurd 2014 in combination with the general thresholds of navigational safety the criteria for the classification of navigation risk based on flow conditions are established for classification of navigation risk levels most existing risk assessment standards and research divide navigation risk into 4 5 levels sahin and kum 2015 sun et al 2018 bye and aalberg 2018 if risk is divided into too many levels it is difficult to characterize effectively the difference between the navigation risks of each level moreover if the risk level is too small it is difficult to reflect fully the changes in the navigation risk of the river section under different water flow conditions therefore in this paper navigation risk is divided into five levels that can fully characterize the dynamic changes of navigation risk from level 1 at which the flow regime is considered to have no effect on navigational safety to level 5 at which the flow regime is considered a serious threat to navigational safety the safety thresholds of water surface slope degree of backflow flow velocity and water depth are divided into five levels and the corresponding criteria of risk assessment established the specific classification criteria for navigation risk are shown in table 2 4 2 calculation of the indices the water surface slope and backflow over the range of ship lengths have the greatest impact on navigational safety and the minimum length of ships of different tonnage is about 30 m in the provisions of the navigation standard of inland waterways li et al 2004 mohurd 2014 to ensure the evaluation indices reflect this influence on navigation safety in the calculation various types of ship of different tonnage must be taken into account and therefore a quadrilateral grid of 30 30 m is selected in the two dimensional hydrodynamic model shown in fig 2 in addition a total of 27 426 computational nodes with grid resolution of 30 30 m can constrain the calculation time to within a reasonable range to facilitate real time assessment of the navigational risks the grid nodes store the flow field data including transverse flow velocity longitudinal velocity river bottom elevation water depth and water level elevation the risk assessment indices are calculated based on the gridded flow field data the calculation rules of the indices are set based on the standard ship length of 105 110 m of a typical 5000 t ship in a level 1 inland waterway which makes the indices specific to the navigational situation of a certain type of ship as water surface slope and backflow over the range of ship lengths have the greatest impact on navigational safety li et al 2004 the water surface slope is calculated between the two sides of every 4 4 grid approximately 120 m thus thus the calculated results best reflect the effect of water surface slope on the navigational condition of the study reach for the calculation of the degree of backflow the flow direction of each node is calculated according to the horizontal and vertical flow velocities then the average angle of the flow velocity directions of the 25 nodes of every 4 4 grid approximately 120 120 m is calculated finally the absolute difference between the angle of each direction and the average direction is calculated and the mean value of the absolute differences is taken as the degree of backflow the vector sum of the horizontal and vertical flow velocities of each node is taken as the velocity index the water depth calculated at each node is taken as the water depth index the specific formulas for the water surface slope and the degree of backflow are shown in eqs 4 6 taking node 13 as an example 4 s l o p e 13 h 3 h 23 x 3 x 23 2 y 3 y 23 2 5 a v e 13 1 25 j 1 25 a n g l e j 6 b a c k f l o w 13 1 25 j 1 25 a n g l e j a v e 13 where h j x j y j and a n g l e j are the water level elevation abscissa ordinate and the angle between the direction of the velocity vector and north at node j respectively and s l o p e 13 and b a c k f l o w 13 are the water surface slope and degree of backflow at node 13 4 3 navigation risk assessment model in this paper the navigation risk of the channel is evaluated based on real time water flow conditions which can reflect the detailed navigation risk of a certain river section over small temporal and spatial scales in the evaluation affected by the randomness of upstream inflow and the uncertainty of downstream water level the water condition of the river section changes constantly resulting in the calculated navigation risk with significant dynamic characteristics in addition the intrinsic link between the various evaluation indicators water surface slope degree of backflow velocity and depth is unclear such that the final navigation risk shows obvious gray characteristics among the various evaluation methods available gray relational analysis can dynamically evaluate the trend of development of the evaluation object the essence is comparison with safety standards to obtain the degree of risk borne by the system at different times or under different conditions which can effectively solve the uncertainty of the correlation between the indicators and the dynamic change of navigation risk teng et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2018 in addition the gray relational analysis method involves a high rate of utilization of information and a reasonably small number of calculations which can meet the requirement for timeliness in navigation risk assessment the calculated evaluation results which are in accord with the actual situation of navigation risk are convenient for the navigation management department to take timely and effective measures under various risk situations therefore the gray relational analysis method is considered suitable for evaluation of navigation risk in this paper in regional navigation risk assessment because of the multiple indices involved and because the calculated values of the various indices at each node are located in different risk levels it is necessary to analyze the correlation or subordinate relationship between the actual index sequence and the navigation risk criteria sequence in the gray relational analysis method it is used to analyze the degree of closeness between the actual index sequence of each node and the five level sequence of navigation risk criteria the correlation degree is determined and sorted based on the degree of geometric similarity between the discrete series the closer the geometric curve of the space is to the criteria sequence the higher the degree of correlation the level of the risk criteria sequence that has the highest degree of correlation with the actual indices sequence is taken as the level of navigation risk at the node finally the risk level at each node on the grid is interpolated and a shipping risk map under different water regimes is plotted the method of gray relational analysis adopted in the navigation risk assessment is as follows 4 3 1 determine the classification criteria sequence of navigation risk and the actual indices sequences the navigation risk criteria are divided into five levels incorporating four indices because the water depth index specifies the limit of navigation it is suitable as the final limiting condition of risk assessment to reflect fully the influence of the other indices on navigation the water depth index is not considered in the gray relational analysis the criteria matrix x 5 3 for navigation risk assessment is obtained based on the average of the risk classification criteria shown in table 2 to facilitate the calculation and matrix y n 3 consists of the actual indices of n computing nodes in all grids x 5 3 w a t e r s u r f a c e s l o p e d e g r e e o f b a c k f l o w f l o w v e l o c i t y 1 0 4 0 1 2 1 5 6 0 1 5 2 5 10 0 2 1 3 5 14 0 2

index are not identical therefore it is necessary to normalize the x 5 3 and y n 3 matrices before the correlation analysis there are two purposes behind the normalization treatment one is to make each index dimensionless and the other is to transform the index value into a number in the range 0 1 the normalized value corresponding to the risk criteria of level 1 is 1 and the normalized value corresponding to the risk criteria of level 5 is 0 i e the greater the normalized value the lower the navigation risk for the water surface slope degree of backflow and flow velocity indices the greater the value the poorer the navigational safety the transformation method for normalization is as follows 7 a i k x 5 k x i k x 5 k x 1 k i 1 2 5 k 1 2 3 8 b j k 1 y j k x 1 k x 5 k y j k x 5 k x

value of the index of item k at node j after normalization the matrix a 5 3 of the navigation risk criteria and the matrix b n 3 of the actual indices are as follows x 5 3 w a t e r s u r f a c e s l

of matrix a 5 3 is taken as the subsequence and the absolute difference δ j i k and the associated discrete function ξ j i for each k index are calculated as follows 9 δ j i k b j k a i k 10 ξ j i k 1 δ j i k 1 δ j i k here δ j i k reflects the difference between the k index of node j and the navigation risk criteria of level i when δ j i k 0 it indicates that the k index is the same as the navigation risk criteria of level i corresponding to ξ j i k 1 and the relevance is greatest when δ j i k 1 it indicates that the k index is alien to the navigation risk criteria of level i corresponding to ξ j i k 0 and the relevance is smallest as for 0 δ j i k 1 there is some relevance between the k index of node j and the navigation risk criteria of level i the smaller the value of δ j i k the greater the relevance to synthesize the k indices of each node we need to calculate all ξ j i k as the associated discrete function ξ j i ξ j i ξ j i 1 ξ j i 2 ξ j i 3 4 3 4 determine the weight ω j k of the indices in the assessment model the weight of each index is very important to the result of the assessment in most other navigation risk assessments the weights of the indices are determined based on subjective approaches such as questionnaires and expert scoring here the weight of each index at the different nodes is determined dynamically based on the actual value of each index and the weighted value is calculated using the method of overweighting the weight is taken as the overweighting value of the specific value between the actual value and the average allowable value of a navigation risk criterion following which it is normalized whereby larger values of the indices obtain relatively larger weights the level 3 navigation risk criteria are most in accord with the actual situation of inland navigation and therefore these are set as the average allowable values on the one hand the overweighting method can fully reflect the impact of a single high risk indicator on the overall safety of navigation such that it will not be overwhelmed in the navigation risk assessment on the other hand the overweighting method calculates the weight based on the measured data compared with other calculation methods the subjectivity of experts participating in the evaluation is avoided and the speed of calculation and the objectivity of the evaluation are guaranteed 11 ω j k y j k x 3 k y j 1 x 3 1 y j 2 x 3 2 y j 3 x 3 3 in the formula above ω j k is the weighted value of the k index at node j 4 3 5 calculate the weighted correlation degree the

node j based on r j max r j i the corresponding i is taken as the navigation risk level of the node from which we can obtain the corresponding navigation risk level at each node on the quadrilateral grid finally taking the allowable 4 8 m water depth of the typical 5000 t cargo ship as the limiting condition the risk level at those nodes where the water depth is 4 8 m is defined as a level 5 navigation risk and that of the other nodes is left unchanged which comprises the final assessment result for each node 5 results 5 1 shipping risk map in the calculation of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir and the upstream water level of the gezhouba dam are required as the input conditions of the model the measured discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir and the upstream water level data of the gezhouba dam during 2013 2015 provided by the china three gorges corporation were used to derive typical hydrological scenarios required for navigation risk assessment according to statistical results the measured discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir is mainly between 5000 and 30 000 m3 s to ensure optimal representativeness of the calculation scheme the discharge is divided into four typical hydrological scenarios of 7 000 10 000 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s and the corresponding water level is selected in the measured data finally the four typical hydrological scenarios are shown in table 3 based on the established two dimensional hydrodynamic model a detailed calculation of the water level water depth and flow velocity of the study reach under different water regimes can be obtained by solving the four hydrological scenarios for the 26 100 quadrilateral grids with 30 30 m resolution and the 27 426 computational nodes the index values under different water regimes are calculated and the distribution of each index of the study reach is obtained the calculated results for each index are classified and displayed according to the navigation risk criteria figs 3 6 the risk level at each node is calculated based on the indices of the study reach using the navigation risk assessment model the shipping risk maps under the different water regimes are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 fig 7 reflects the detailed distribution of risk of the study reach under the different water regimes the navigation risk of the study reach under each water regime is analyzed and three statistical parameters of minimum navigable width average navigable width and navigable mileage proportion are proposed if the risk level of a certain calculation node reaches 5 it is considered highly unfavorable for navigation and it is recommended that the ship stop sailing at that point the navigable width is the actual width of the continuous node on the cross section of the river with a risk level 5 according to the divided quadrilateral mesh 1305 cross sections section spacing of about 30 m on the study reach were counted to obtain the minimum and average navigable widths as the width of a 5000 t cargo ship is 19 2 m mot 2010 when the navigable width of a cross section is much larger than 19 2 m it is considered that the section could be navigated safely i e it is called a navigable section then the proportion of navigable sections to all cross sections is considered the proportion of the navigable mileage when the proportion of the navigable mileage does not reach 100 it means that a ship cannot navigate the entire study reach safely thus it is recommended that the ship be prohibited from navigating the section under that water regime from the statistical results shown in table 4 it can be seen that when the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir gradually increases the minimum and average navigable widths of the study reach gradually decrease when the discharge of the three gorges dam is 20 000 m3 s the minimum navigable width 330 and 120 m for discharge of 10 000 and 20 000 m3 s respectively is much larger than the design width of the 5000 t cargo ship 19 2 m which ensures safe navigation of the ship when the discharge flow reaches 30 000 m3 s the minimum navigable width is zero and the navigable mileage ratio is 100 which is inadequate to support safe navigation of the ship in the study reach thus it is recommended that a 5000 t cargo ship stop sailing under the discharge flow of 30 000 m3 s in addition figs 7 and 8 show that even when the discharge volume of the three gorges reservoir is small the navigation risk remains high in the river reaches of liantuo and shipai 5 2 verification of the model first the calculation results show that when the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir reaches 30 000 m3 s the navigation risk is very high and it is recommended that a 5000 t cargo ship stop sailing under such conditions in the three gorges gezhouba water control project navigation regulation issued by the yangtze river administration of navigational affairs 2018 the navigation flow of the study reach is specified clearly i e when the discharge flow of the three gorges dam is between 25 000 m3 s and 45 000 m3 s restrictive navigation is carried out for ships according to relevant regulations and standards this regulation is in accord with the evaluation results of this paper second it can be seen from the navigation risk maps under the different water regimes that even when the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir is small the navigation risk remains high in the river reaches of liantuo and shipai primarily because of the topographic conditions the yangtze river maritime safety administration has also issued early warning notices highlighting that increased discharge from the three gorges dam makes the liantuo and shipai reaches areas with high navigation risk in addition a number of studies have shown that the navigational risk of the liantuo and shipai reaches is higher than other stretches of the river and that engineering remediation work should be undertaken cai and li 2008 zhao et al 2012 based on the above it is considered that the model calculation results are consistent with the actual situation of navigation management of the study reach 6 discussion the quantitative method for the assessment of navigational risk for a particular ship based on flow conditions is the most important innovation in this paper currently most assessments of navigation risk provide an overview of the risk situation within a certain navigable area however the navigation risk within an area differs for different types of ship the level of difference in the navigation risk for different ship types is low in current navigation risk assessments in this paper appropriate ship specific risk assessment criteria are set for specific ship types and the navigation risk caused by the flow conditions is quantified to obtain ship specific risk assessment results in addition the navigation risk to a particular type of ship differs in different navigable areas of the channel the navigation risk assessment model used here is based on detailed flow field data which allow the navigation risk at a large number of computing nodes over a small spatial scale to be quantified thus the problem of evaluating separately the different navigable areas of a channel is overcome and the spatial resolution of the navigation risk distribution is greatly improved to sum up the pertinence of navigation risk assessment as described here is enhanced effectively from two aspects i e ship type and navigable area the quantitative navigation risk for different ship types in different navigable areas of the same waterway is achieved allowing refined navigation management and improved ship safety in the application of assessment results current navigation risk assessment is intended mainly to provide long term assessment of the risk situation of an object which is less time dependent on smaller temporal scales the model in this paper not only realizes the real time evaluation of given water flow conditions but it also provides dynamic visualization of the navigation risk a shipping risk map can quickly alert a captain to dangerous areas ahead of time ensuring ship safety and allow the maritime department to issue rapid and effective warnings of risk which have practical value regarding improved navigational safety in addition because of differences in flow conditions and ships the navigation risk for different ships under differing water regimes should be taken into account in terms of waterway regulation for example although the liantuo reach was repaired to meet the navigation requirements of large flow and large ships the navigation risk is not necessarily low for all ships and all flow states if the navigation risk assessment model were used to simulate and calculate the navigation risk of various typical flow levels and various typical ships an engineering scheme for navigable risks that meets all ship and flow conditions could be selected the would effectively avoid omissions caused by a remediation program that considers only specific ships and flow conditions as well as control the implementation risk of the remediation plan although this paper explores the quantitative assessment of navigable risk based on flow conditions some problems require further study because of the complexity of the research first because of the complicated mechanism of the interaction between a ship and the flow the rationality behind the selection of the indices depends on the study of the hydrodynamic mechanisms a large number of actual ship tests will be required to determine the decomposition thresholds of the indices the current research analogy draws on the results of a single index study thus it lacks the systematic authority of experimental verification and further study will be required in addition the calculation of navigational risk is based on the spatial distribution of the flow index therefore the calculation accuracy of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model is very important for navigation risk and the real time accuracy of the calculation will be crucial for determining whether the risk maps could be applied in real time warnings the hydrodynamic model used in the early warning of navigational risk requires a large amount of measured data for debugging and verification in addition to the computational results of the hydrodynamic model a large data set of channel flow observations should be used to improve the accuracy of the navigation risk simulation 7 conclusions flow condition is one of the important indices that affect navigational safety in this paper a model for navigation risk assessment based on flow conditions is established and the influence of flow conditions on navigation is studied the principal conclusions are as follows 1 four indices of water surface slope degree of backflow flow velocity and water depth and a five level classification of criteria for navigation risk are proposed to determine navigational safety the model of navigation risk assessment based on flow conditions is established using gray relational analysis and the influence of the spatial current elements on navigational safety is evaluated quantitatively the model has good applicability for the evaluation of the safety of inland river navigation the derived shipping risk maps are intuitive and they can be used to provide navigation guidance quickly and conveniently such that the timeliness of early warning of navigation risk can be improved this research has advanced the quantitative assessment of navigational safety 2 the derived shipping risk maps are intuitive in their reflection of the navigation risk of the study reach under different flow regimes and they can promote precise navigation management furthermore they also reflect the influence of the discharge of the three gorges reservoir on the navigation of the study reach it can be seen that with an increase in the discharge volume from the three gorges reservoir the navigation risk also increases ships in the navigable area of the study reach have greater safety when the discharge is less than the flow level of 20 000 m3 s when the discharge increases to a flow level of 30 000 m3 s it has considerable impact on the navigation of the study reach making it very unfavorable for navigation therefore when the discharge of the three gorges reservoir is 30 000 m3 s it is recommended that 5000 t cargo ships be prohibited from sailing even when the discharge is small the navigation risk can remain high in the region of the sharp bends in the liantuo and shipai reaches this is primarily because of the effects of terrain which make these sections the most dangerous within the study reach acknowledgments this study was supported by the tianjin port science and technology project and national key research and development program

22952,of the many factors that influence navigational safety navigable flow conditions are one of the most important therefore the development of a navigation risk assessment model based on flow conditions is of considerable importance for improving the safety of shipping in this paper the influence of flow on shipping is considered four determination indices for navigational safety including water surface slope backflow velocity and depth and a five level classification of navigation risk assessment are proposed to evaluate quantitatively the influence of flow conditions on shipping a

ship types under different water regimes were drawn in accordance with the simulated results based on the navigation risk assessment model the research results not only promote effective precise management of navigation in the study reach but they also provide a reference for quantitative research of navigational safety keywords navigable flow conditions gray relational analysis navigation

world and providing the basis for an inland waterway transport network mot 2018 however heavy usage and complicated water regimes have caused considerable pressure on navigation management which has resulted in poor transport efficiency and the frequent occurrence of accidents although inland electronic navigational charts beacon systems gps ais and other aids systems are available to ensure navigational safety and efficiency the lack of real time and detailed knowledge regarding navigable flow conditions and waterway conditions poses a considerable potential safety hazard xiao et al 2015 during january august 2018 86 shipping accidents involving 135 vessels occurred in the yangtze river among them 68 accidents 79 were caused by collisions reefing and stranding cmsa 2018 on april 19 2018 the tanker xinhang 301 collided with the cargo ship suqilaizhou 900 on the yangtze river near the sutong bridge in the yangtze river the accident caused the suqilaizhou 900 to sink rapidly which resulted in two of the crew being reported missing investigation of the root causes of such accidents has revealed that inadequate understanding of the flow conditions in complex navigational sections such as bridge areas can lead the captain and or pilot to underestimate the navigational risks therefore it is very important to study the risk to navigation associated with flow conditions and to assess the available early warning technology to clarify the influence of flow conditions on navigation improve navigational safety and promote rigorous management of navigation channels regarding navigational risk and early warning technology a considerable amount of theoretical research has been undertaken globally and a series of achievements from initial qualitative and empirical evaluations to quantitative evaluations have been accomplished vander hoorn and knapp 2015 wang and xie 2013 li and xue 2009 analysis of maritime traffic accidents is an important basis for the identification assessment and early warning of navigational risks generally most models for evaluating the risk regarding maritime accidents are based on reports of maritime affairs and statistical theory and they provide statistical analyses of a certain range of maritime traffic accidents within a certain period from these the principal influencing factors of accidents can be obtained and appropriate mitigating measures proposed akyuz 2017 xiao et al 2015 toffoli et al 2005 li and wu 1997 to provide comprehensive assessment of maritime traffic safety and navigation environment risk lois et al 2004 analyzed cruise ship accident statistics using a formal safety assessment method based on which they proposed relevant risk control and accident prevention countermeasures zheng et al 1997 considered the navigational safety of coastal and port areas and they analyzed the main causes of ship accidents in harbors using gray relational analysis ronza et al 2003 applied the method of fault tree analysis to predict the frequency of port area accidents zhang and zhou 2007 studied the laws of inland water traffic safety and risk factors following which they established a safety evaluation model using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the safety status of inland waterway transport zhang et al 2013 undertook a comprehensive assessment of navigational risk using a bayesian network to study data of accidents on the yangtze river waterway the above research focused mainly on maritime traffic safety and research investigating inland navigational safety is scant many evaluation models have been used to consider the sequential state of safety in which factors such as the crew ship environment and management system including multiple evaluation indices such as crew age structure crew safety awareness crew culture level ship tonnage hull structure wind rain water depth and information management have been taken into account based on selected evaluation indices evaluation models have been established using formal safety assessment methods bayesian networks gray system theory and other methods to evaluate comprehensively the navigational safety of inland waterways ports or seas su et al 2012 vander hoorn and knapp 2015 mentes et al 2015 akyuz and celik 2016 baksh et al 2018 approaches such as these can provide an evaluation of navigation risk that is more comprehensive and better able to reflect the long term risk situation of the evaluation object however the refinement of an evaluation of navigation risk for a certain river reach over small spatial and temporal scales appears inadequate which makes it difficult to aid the navigation of a certain type of ship in different areas of a waterway furthermore current analyses and evaluations of safety are based mostly on accident statistics where the evaluation indices and weights are based on the subjective judgment of experts this makes the evaluation process slow and this lag impinges on real time navigational warning vander hoorn and knapp 2015 mentes et al 2015 li and zhang 2014 hu et al 2007 in a study of navigable flow conditions li et al 2008 investigated a port and the entrance area of the approach waterway and they provided a quantitative description of the navigable flow conditions within the entrance area zhang et al 2016a 2016b developed a three dimensional waterway system using a hydrodynamic model and flow field visualization technology for ship navigation and early warning heij and knapp 2015 studied the effect of wave height on navigation risk for different types of ship based on accident statistics and data from a large number of observation points akyildiz and mentes 2017 considered a variety of risk factors including wave height to analyze the uncertainty of cargo ship safety wang et al 2014 conducted a safety assessment of shipping routes in the south china sea based on water depth wave height and other navigation related conditions although the above studies have made some progress in the quantitative evaluation and early warning of navigable safety related to flow conditions their consideration of flow conditions was rather simple for example only wave height was considered in the navigation risk at sea and most inland navigation risk assessment considered only water depth and velocity li and zhang 2014 zhang and zhou 2007 zheng et al 1997 furthermore because of the lack of navigation risk assessment indices and a systematic evaluation method for flow conditions it is difficult to describe quantitatively the impact of navigable flow conditions on navigational safety in this paper the navigation risk based on flow conditions is studied 1 the influencing factors of navigable flow are analyzed and navigation risk evaluation indices based on flow conditions are proposed to establish a navigation risk assessment model 2 for the case of navigation between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam a two dimensional hydrodynamic model is established to simulate the flow field under different water regimes based on the simulated flow fields shipping risk maps for specific ship types under the different flow conditions are obtained using the ship risk assessment model and methods for precise navigation warnings are discussed 2 study area the river section between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam hereafter referred to as the study reach is known as the throat area along the golden waterway of the yangtze river and it has a very important position in yangtze river shipping the length of the study reach is about 38 km most of this river section is located within the xiling gorge and the length of the river between sandouping and letianxi is 9 6 km as shown in fig 1 the river section below letianxi comprising the gorge area has narrow width and a wide valley the river channel generally has a u or v shaped section and its width is mainly 300 800 m although it can extend up to 1400 m in the flood season furthermore the river incorporates many winding and narrow deep channels making it one of the most difficult sections for navigation zhao et al 2012 after the completion of the gezhouba project the riverbed of the study reach was within the reservoir backwater area throughout the year however because of the low water head of the gezhouba dam the river channel shows the dual characteristics of an artificial reservoir and a natural river reach at different times of the year shu et al 2005 the water flow of the study reach is gentle in the mid and low water periods furthermore the flow velocity and the slope are also small which are conducive to ship navigation however in the flood season the waterway of the study reach is restricted both by the water level in front of the gezhouba dam and by the riverbed topography with an increase of gezhouba reservoir inflow because of the restriction on the increase of the cross sectional area of the study reach the vertical and horizontal fluctuations can be large resulting in fast flowing natural river characteristics in combination with operations to reduce the reservoir water level in the flood season the water flow of some river reaches can be poor when the three gorges reservoir maintains a large discharge this can result in abrupt and chaotic increases in flow velocity and slope that can cause the navigability of the study reach to deteriorate rapidly the width of the study reach is small and there are many rapids and meanders in particular the flood rapids at shuitianjiao and xitan and the meander rapids at shipai constitute the sections of the study reach most difficult for navigation especially for large tonnage ships yuan et al 2012 in the context of enhanced navigational conditions in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the navigational capacity between the two dams has become a bottleneck restricting the development of yangtze river navigation and affecting the benefits of three gorges navigation 3 data 3 1 calculation of water flow data for inland waterways with complicated channel shapes and flow regimes a one dimensional hydrodynamic model cannot reflect fully the required navigable flow conditions therefore two or three dimensional hydrodynamic models are needed compared with two dimensional hydrodynamic models a three dimensional hydrodynamic model is very complex and it requires time consuming calculations the development of two dimensional hydrodynamic models is mature and they have been shown effective in simulating the flow distribution and variation characteristics of long rivers wang and xiang 2007 therefore this approach is selected here for the calculation of the flow fields of the channel under specific water regimes in modeling the waterway flow the horizontal scale is larger than the vertical depth scale therefore ignoring the impact of the coriolis force and wind the two dimensional shallow water equation is used as the control equation zhang et al 2018a the conservation of the two dimensional shallow water equation is shown in eqs 1 3 1 u t f u s 2 u h h u h v f f x f y f x h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v f y h v h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 3 s 0 g h s 0 x s f x g h s 0 y s f y where u and v represent the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively g represents gravitational acceleration s 0 x z b x and s 0 y z b y represent the bottom slope term of the x and y directions respectively z b represents the bottom elevation s f x n 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 and s f y n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 represent the friction slope of the x and y directions respectively and n is the manning coefficient 3 2 verification of calculation results taking the river section between the three gorges dam and the gezhouba dam as the case study reach a 30 m spatial step was used to segment the river from which 26 100 quadrilateral grids were generated the data of transverse velocity longitudinal velocity river bottom elevation water depth and water level at the grid nodes are obtained using the two dimensional hydrodynamic model in the setup phase of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model the data of river bottom elevation for the study reach were provided by the three gorges navigation authority using measurements obtained in october 2008 these data include elevations for more than 10 000 points along the study reach in the calibration and verification phase of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model the measured water level flow velocity and flow direction data of three key river reaches i e letianxi liantuo and shipai of the study reach provided by three gorges navigation measurement team are selected to verify the model the verification results are shown in table 1 the verification results show that the absolute deviation of the water level between the calculated and measured values is 0 05 m and that the relative deviation of flow velocity is between 3 1 and 1 9 the results of flow direction and the measured buoy line are similar it can be seen that the established two dimensional hydrodynamic model can simulate the flow state of the study reach with high accuracy and precision 4 methods 4 1 indices and criteria for navigation risk assessment to establish a navigation risk assessment model based on flow conditions we must first select the key factors of flow conditions as evaluation indices which should reflect fully the impact of flow conditions on navigational safety in the selection of evaluation indices and the determination of evaluation criteria this paper uses the chinese national navigation standard of inland waterways as the principal benchmark although it refers extensively to other relevant norms and international literature to determine the appropriate indices and criteria zhou 2004 yao 2006 mot 2010 mohurd 2014 mentes et al 2015 vander hoorn and knapp 2015 akyildiz and mentes 2017 baksh et al 2018 according to the navigation standard of inland waterways the flow conditions of inland waterways such as flow velocity flow regime water surface slope and water depth should meet the requirements for safe navigation of the designed ship or fleet mohurd 2014 the navigation depth of different levels of waterway is clearly stipulated and therefore four assessment indices i e water surface slope degree of backflow velocity and depth are selected in this paper the degree of backflow represents the angle of deviation between the flow direction at each node and the average flow direction over a certain spatial scale where the angle is used as the unit of measure with which to reflect the disorder of the flow field in terms of the safety thresholds of the indices only water depth has a clear threshold range in this paper the results of a number of previous works are summarized to determine the thresholds of the indices for water surface slope with reference to the maximum allowable velocity and slope for the 10 000 t fleet yao 2006 there is very small effect on ship safety when the water surface slope is 1 whereas it is considered very unfavorable for navigational safety when it is 4 for the degree of backflow according to the stipulation that the navigation angle of the ship fleet should be 10 and that the steering angle should be 20 in the entrance area of the approach channel zhou 2004 it is considered that a flow regime is sufficiently turbulent to seriously endanger navigational safety when the degree of backflow is 16 conversely when the degree of backflow is 4 there is almost no disorder for flow velocity with reference to the maximum allowable velocity and slope for the 10 000 t fleet the maximum allowable surface velocity with a surface slope of 0 5 is 2 6 m s therefore it is assumed that the maximum acceptable surface velocity for a typical 5000 t dry bulk ship is about 3 m s according to the main scale series of the standard ship type in the chuan river and three gorges reservoir revised in 2010 mot 2010 the standard draft of a typical 5000 t dry bulk ship is 4 3 m according to the navigation standard of inland waterways the surplus water depth of a level 1 waterway should be 0 5 m therefore a typical 5000 t dry bulk ship cannot sail when the water depth is 4 8 m mohurd 2014 in combination with the general thresholds of navigational safety the criteria for the classification of navigation risk based on flow conditions are established for classification of navigation risk levels most existing risk assessment standards and research divide navigation risk into 4 5 levels sahin and kum 2015 sun et al 2018 bye and aalberg 2018 if risk is divided into too many levels it is difficult to characterize effectively the difference between the navigation risks of each level moreover if the risk level is too small it is difficult to reflect fully the changes in the navigation risk of the river section under different water flow conditions therefore in this paper navigation risk is divided into five levels that can fully characterize the dynamic changes of navigation risk from level 1 at which the flow regime is considered to have no effect on navigational safety to level 5 at which the flow regime is considered a serious threat to navigational safety the safety thresholds of water surface slope degree of backflow flow velocity and water depth are divided into five levels and the corresponding criteria of risk assessment established the specific classification criteria for navigation risk are shown in table 2 4 2 calculation of the indices the water surface slope and backflow over the range of ship lengths have the greatest impact on navigational safety and the minimum length of ships of different tonnage is about 30 m in the provisions of the navigation standard of inland waterways li et al 2004 mohurd 2014 to ensure the evaluation indices reflect this influence on navigation safety in the calculation various types of ship of different tonnage must be taken into account and therefore a quadrilateral grid of 30 30 m is selected in the two dimensional hydrodynamic model shown in fig 2 in addition a total of 27 426 computational nodes with grid resolution of 30 30 m can constrain the calculation time to within a reasonable range to facilitate real time assessment of the navigational risks the grid nodes store the flow field data including transverse flow velocity longitudinal velocity river bottom elevation water depth and water level elevation the risk assessment indices are calculated based on the gridded flow field data the calculation rules of the indices are set based on the standard ship length of 105 110 m of a typical 5000 t ship in a level 1 inland waterway which makes the indices specific to the navigational situation of a certain type of ship as water surface slope and backflow over the range of ship lengths have the greatest impact on navigational safety li et al 2004 the water surface slope is calculated between the two sides of every 4 4 grid approximately 120 m thus thus the calculated results best reflect the effect of water surface slope on the navigational condition of the study reach for the calculation of the degree of backflow the flow direction of each node is calculated according to the horizontal and vertical flow velocities then the average angle of the flow velocity directions of the 25 nodes of every 4 4 grid approximately 120 120 m is calculated finally the absolute difference between the angle of each direction and the average direction is calculated and the mean value of the absolute differences is taken as the degree of backflow the vector sum of the horizontal and vertical flow velocities of each node is taken as the velocity index the water depth calculated at each node is taken as the water depth index the specific formulas for the water surface slope and the degree of backflow are shown in eqs 4 6 taking node 13 as an example 4 s l o p e 13 h 3 h 23 x 3 x 23 2 y 3 y 23 2 5 a v e 13 1 25 j 1 25 a n g l e j 6 b a c k f l o w 13 1 25 j 1 25 a n g l e j a v e 13 where h j x j y j and a n g l e j are the water level elevation abscissa ordinate and the angle between the direction of the velocity vector and north at node j respectively and s l o p e 13 and b a c k f l o w 13 are the water surface slope and degree of backflow at node 13 4 3 navigation risk assessment model in this paper the navigation risk of the channel is evaluated based on real time water flow conditions which can reflect the detailed navigation risk of a certain river section over small temporal and spatial scales in the evaluation affected by the randomness of upstream inflow and the uncertainty of downstream water level the water condition of the river section changes constantly resulting in the calculated navigation risk with significant dynamic characteristics in addition the intrinsic link between the various evaluation indicators water surface slope degree of backflow velocity and depth is unclear such that the final navigation risk shows obvious gray characteristics among the various evaluation methods available gray relational analysis can dynamically evaluate the trend of development of the evaluation object the essence is comparison with safety standards to obtain the degree of risk borne by the system at different times or under different conditions which can effectively solve the uncertainty of the correlation between the indicators and the dynamic change of navigation risk teng et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2018 in addition the gray relational analysis method involves a high rate of utilization of information and a reasonably small number of calculations which can meet the requirement for timeliness in navigation risk assessment the calculated evaluation results which are in accord with the actual situation of navigation risk are convenient for the navigation management department to take timely and effective measures under various risk situations therefore the gray relational analysis method is considered suitable for evaluation of navigation risk in this paper in regional navigation risk assessment because of the multiple indices involved and because the calculated values of the various indices at each node are located in different risk levels it is necessary to analyze the correlation or subordinate relationship between the actual index sequence and the navigation risk criteria sequence in the gray relational analysis method it is used to analyze the degree of closeness between the actual index sequence of each node and the five level sequence of navigation risk criteria the correlation degree is determined and sorted based on the degree of geometric similarity between the discrete series the closer the geometric curve of the space is to the criteria sequence the higher the degree of correlation the level of the risk criteria sequence that has the highest degree of correlation with the actual indices sequence is taken as the level of navigation risk at the node finally the risk level at each node on the grid is interpolated and a shipping risk map under different water regimes is plotted the method of gray relational analysis adopted in the navigation risk assessment is as follows 4 3 1 determine the classification criteria sequence of navigation risk and the actual indices sequences the navigation risk criteria are divided into five levels incorporating four indices because the water depth index specifies the limit of navigation it is suitable as the final limiting condition of risk assessment to reflect fully the influence of the other indices on navigation the water depth index is not considered in the gray relational analysis the criteria matrix x 5 3 for navigation risk assessment is obtained based on the average of the risk classification criteria shown in table 2 to facilitate the calculation and matrix y n 3 consists of the actual indices of n computing nodes in all grids x 5 3 w a t e r s u r f a c e s l o p e d e g r e e o f b a c k f l o w f l o w v e l o c i t y 1 0 4 0 1 2 1 5 6 0 1 5 2 5 10 0 2 1 3 5 14 0 2

index are not identical therefore it is necessary to normalize the x 5 3 and y n 3 matrices before the correlation analysis there are two purposes behind the normalization treatment one is to make each index dimensionless and the other is to transform the index value into a number in the range 0 1 the normalized value corresponding to the risk criteria of level 1 is 1 and the normalized value corresponding to the risk criteria of level 5 is 0 i e the greater the normalized value the lower the navigation risk for the water surface slope degree of backflow and flow velocity indices the greater the value the poorer the navigational safety the transformation method for normalization is as follows 7 a i k x 5 k x i k x 5 k x 1 k i 1 2 5 k 1 2 3 8 b j k 1 y j k x 1 k x 5 k y j k x 5 k x

value of the index of item k at node j after normalization the matrix a 5 3 of the navigation risk criteria and the matrix b n 3 of the actual indices are as follows x 5 3 w a t e r s u r f a c e s l

of matrix a 5 3 is taken as the subsequence and the absolute difference δ j i k and the associated discrete function ξ j i for each k index are calculated as follows 9 δ j i k b j k a i k 10 ξ j i k 1 δ j i k 1 δ j i k here δ j i k reflects the difference between the k index of node j and the navigation risk criteria of level i when δ j i k 0 it indicates that the k index is the same as the navigation risk criteria of level i corresponding to ξ j i k 1 and the relevance is greatest when δ j i k 1 it indicates that the k index is alien to the navigation risk criteria of level i corresponding to ξ j i k 0 and the relevance is smallest as for 0 δ j i k 1 there is some relevance between the k index of node j and the navigation risk criteria of level i the smaller the value of δ j i k the greater the relevance to synthesize the k indices of each node we need to calculate all ξ j i k as the associated discrete function ξ j i ξ j i ξ j i 1 ξ j i 2 ξ j i 3 4 3 4 determine the weight ω j k of the indices in the assessment model the weight of each index is very important to the result of the assessment in most other navigation risk assessments the weights of the indices are determined based on subjective approaches such as questionnaires and expert scoring here the weight of each index at the different nodes is determined dynamically based on the actual value of each index and the weighted value is calculated using the method of overweighting the weight is taken as the overweighting value of the specific value between the actual value and the average allowable value of a navigation risk criterion following which it is normalized whereby larger values of the indices obtain relatively larger weights the level 3 navigation risk criteria are most in accord with the actual situation of inland navigation and therefore these are set as the average allowable values on the one hand the overweighting method can fully reflect the impact of a single high risk indicator on the overall safety of navigation such that it will not be overwhelmed in the navigation risk assessment on the other hand the overweighting method calculates the weight based on the measured data compared with other calculation methods the subjectivity of experts participating in the evaluation is avoided and the speed of calculation and the objectivity of the evaluation are guaranteed 11 ω j k y j k x 3 k y j 1 x 3 1 y j 2 x 3 2 y j 3 x 3 3 in the formula above ω j k is the weighted value of the k index at node j 4 3 5 calculate the weighted correlation degree the correlation between the mother sequence b j and the subsequence a i is the correlation r j i between the actual value at each node and the risk criteria of each level 12 r j i k 1 3 ω j k ξ j i k for node j based on r j max r j i the corresponding i is taken as the navigation risk level of the node from which we can obtain the corresponding navigation risk level at each node on the quadrilateral grid finally taking the allowable 4 8 m water depth of the typical 5000 t cargo ship as the limiting condition the risk level at those nodes where the water depth is 4 8 m is defined as a level 5 navigation risk and that of the other nodes is left unchanged which comprises the final assessment result for each node 5 results 5 1 shipping risk map in the calculation of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir and the upstream water level of the gezhouba dam are required as the input conditions of the model the measured discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir and the upstream water level data of the gezhouba dam during 2013 2015 provided by the china three gorges corporation were used to derive typical hydrological scenarios required for navigation risk assessment according to statistical results the measured discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir is mainly between 5000 and 30 000 m3 s to ensure optimal representativeness of the calculation scheme the discharge is divided into four typical hydrological scenarios of 7 000 10 000 20 000 and 30 000 m3 s and the corresponding water level is selected in the measured data finally the four typical hydrological scenarios are shown in table 3 based on the established two dimensional hydrodynamic model a detailed calculation of the water level water depth and flow velocity of the study reach under different water regimes can be obtained by solving the four hydrological scenarios for the 26 100 quadrilateral grids with 30 30 m resolution and the 27 426 computational nodes the index values under different water regimes are calculated and the distribution of each index of the study reach is obtained the calculated results for each index are classified and displayed according to the navigation risk criteria figs 3 6 the risk level at each node is calculated based on the indices of the study reach using the navigation risk assessment model the shipping risk maps under the different water regimes are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 fig 7 reflects the detailed distribution of risk of the study reach under the different water regimes the navigation risk of the study reach under each water regime is analyzed and three statistical parameters of minimum navigable width average navigable width and navigable mileage proportion are proposed if the risk level of a certain calculation node reaches 5 it is considered highly unfavorable for navigation and it is recommended that the ship stop sailing at that point the navigable width is the actual width of the continuous node on the cross section of the river with a risk level 5 according to the divided quadrilateral mesh 1305 cross sections section spacing of about 30 m on the study reach were counted to obtain the minimum and average navigable widths as the width of a 5000 t cargo ship is 19 2 m mot 2010 when the navigable width of a cross section is much larger than 19 2 m it is considered that the section could be navigated safely i e it is called a navigable section then the proportion of navigable sections to all cross sections is considered the proportion of the navigable mileage when the proportion of the navigable mileage does not reach 100 it means that a ship cannot navigate the entire study reach safely thus it is recommended that the ship be prohibited from navigating the section under that water regime from the statistical results shown in table 4 it can be seen that when the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir gradually increases the minimum and average navigable widths of the study reach gradually decrease when the discharge of the three gorges dam is 20 000 m3 s the minimum navigable width 330 and 120 m for discharge of 10 000 and 20 000 m3 s respectively is much larger than the design width of the 5000 t cargo ship 19 2 m which ensures safe navigation of the ship when the discharge flow reaches 30 000 m3 s the minimum navigable width is zero and the navigable mileage ratio is 100 which is inadequate to support safe navigation of the ship in the study reach thus it is recommended that a 5000 t cargo ship stop sailing under the discharge flow of 30 000 m3 s in addition figs 7 and 8 show that even when the discharge volume of the three gorges reservoir is small the navigation risk remains high in the river reaches of liantuo and shipai 5 2 verification of the model first the calculation results show that when the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir reaches 30 000 m3 s the navigation risk is very high and it is recommended that a 5000 t cargo ship stop sailing under such conditions in the three gorges gezhouba water control project navigation regulation issued by the yangtze river administration of navigational affairs 2018 the navigation flow of the study reach is specified clearly i e when the discharge flow of the three gorges dam is between 25 000 m3 s and 45 000 m3 s restrictive navigation is carried out for ships according to relevant regulations and standards this regulation is in accord with the evaluation results of this paper second it can be seen from the navigation risk maps under the different water regimes that even when the discharge flow of the three gorges reservoir is small the navigation risk remains high in the river reaches of liantuo and shipai primarily because of the topographic conditions the yangtze river maritime safety administration has also issued early warning notices highlighting that increased discharge from the three gorges dam makes the liantuo and shipai reaches areas with high navigation risk in addition a number of studies have shown that the navigational risk of the liantuo and shipai reaches is higher than other stretches of the river and that engineering remediation work should be undertaken cai and li 2008 zhao et al 2012 based on the above it is considered that the model calculation results are consistent with the actual situation of navigation management of the study reach 6 discussion the quantitative method for the assessment of navigational risk for a particular ship based on flow conditions is the most important innovation in this paper currently most assessments of navigation risk provide an overview of the risk situation within a certain navigable area however the navigation risk within an area differs for different types of ship the level of difference in the navigation risk for different ship types is low in current navigation risk assessments in this paper appropriate ship specific risk assessment criteria are set for specific ship types and the navigation risk caused by the flow conditions is quantified to obtain ship specific risk assessment results in addition the navigation risk to a particular type of ship differs in different navigable areas of the channel the navigation risk assessment model used here is based on detailed flow field data which allow the navigation risk at a large number of computing nodes over a small spatial scale to be quantified thus the problem of evaluating separately the different navigable areas of a channel is overcome and the spatial resolution of the navigation risk distribution is greatly improved to sum up the pertinence of navigation risk assessment as described here is enhanced effectively from two aspects i e ship type and navigable area the quantitative navigation risk for different ship types in different navigable areas of the same waterway is achieved allowing refined navigation management and improved ship safety in the application of assessment results current navigation risk assessment is intended mainly to provide long term assessment of the risk situation of an object which is less time dependent on smaller temporal scales the model in this paper not only realizes the real time evaluation of given water flow conditions but it also provides dynamic visualization of the navigation risk a shipping risk map can quickly alert a captain to dangerous areas ahead of time ensuring ship safety and allow the maritime department to issue rapid and effective warnings of risk which have practical value regarding improved navigational safety in addition because of differences in flow conditions and ships the navigation risk for different ships under differing water regimes should be taken into account in terms of waterway regulation for example although the liantuo reach was repaired to meet the navigation requirements of large flow and large ships the navigation risk is not necessarily low for all ships and all flow states if the navigation risk assessment model were used to simulate and calculate the navigation risk of various typical flow levels and various typical ships an engineering scheme for navigable risks that meets all ship and flow conditions could be selected the would effectively avoid omissions caused by a remediation program that considers only specific ships and flow conditions as well as control the implementation risk of the remediation plan although this paper explores the quantitative assessment of navigable risk based on flow conditions some problems require further study because of the complexity of the research first because of the complicated mechanism of the interaction between a ship and the flow the rationality behind the selection of the indices depends on the study of the hydrodynamic mechanisms a large number of actual ship tests will be required to determine the decomposition thresholds of the indices the current research analogy draws on the results of a single index study thus it lacks the systematic authority of experimental verification and further study will be required in addition the calculation of navigational risk is based on the spatial distribution of the flow index therefore the calculation accuracy of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model is very important for navigation risk and the real time accuracy of the calculation will be crucial for determining whether the risk maps could be applied in real time warnings the hydrodynamic model used in the early warning of navigational risk requires a large amount of measured data for debugging and verification in addition to the computational results of the hydrodynamic model a large data set of channel flow observations should be used to improve the accuracy of the navigation risk simulation 7 conclusions flow condition is one of the important indices that affect navigational safety in this paper a model for navigation risk assessment based on flow conditions is established and the influence of flow conditions on navigation is studied the principal conclusions are as follows 1 four indices of water surface slope degree of backflow flow velocity and water depth and a five level classification of criteria for navigation risk are proposed to determine navigational safety the model of navigation risk assessment based on flow conditions is established using gray relational analysis and the influence of the spatial current elements on navigational safety is evaluated quantitatively the model has good applicability for the evaluation of the safety of inland river navigation the derived shipping risk maps are intuitive and they can be used to provide navigation guidance quickly and conveniently such that the timeliness of early warning of navigation risk can be improved this research has advanced the quantitative assessment of navigational safety 2 the derived shipping risk maps are intuitive in their reflection of the navigation risk of the study reach under different flow regimes and they can promote precise navigation management furthermore they also reflect the influence of the discharge of the three gorges reservoir on the navigation of the study reach it can be seen that with an increase in the discharge volume from the three gorges reservoir the navigation risk also increases ships in the navigable area of the study reach have greater safety when the discharge is less than the flow level of 20 000 m3 s when the discharge increases to a flow level of 30 000 m3 s it has considerable impact on the navigation of the study reach making it very unfavorable for navigation therefore when the discharge of the three gorges reservoir is 30 000 m3 s it is recommended that 5000 t cargo ships be prohibited from sailing even when the discharge is small the navigation risk can remain high in the region of the sharp bends in the liantuo and shipai reaches this is primarily because of the effects of terrain which make these sections the most dangerous within the study reach acknowledgments this study was supported by the tianjin port science and technology project and national key research and development program

22953,when transmitting highly corrosive offshore hydrocarbons one economical approach is lining internally a thin corrosion resistance alloy cra layer within an ordinary carbon steel pipe most commonly the liner is mechanically bonded to the outer pipe by mechanical expansion the lined pipe is expected to make optimize usage of the two types of materials providing significant corrosion and structural resistance this study investigates full history interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and liner and the structural behaviors of the lined pipe under axial compression through finite element analysis fea comprehensive finite element fe models are developed where the manufacturing process the non linear material properties of stainless steel and the interactions between the constituent components are considered the numerically determined failure modes load deformation histories and ultimate strengths are compared with those from tests the interaction stress and axial loading histories of the specimen under axial compressions are studied where the internal content pressure and external hydrostatic pressures are considered simultaneously confinement factor is

other highly corrosive contents different approaches exist to deal with potential corrosion threats one is to reserve a certain amount of thickness for corrosion named corrosion allowance and another one is to slow the corrosion rate by adopting inhibitors a third one is to employ corrosion resistant alloy cra according to cost and product availability lining ordinary carbon steel pipes with thin layers of cra may be a highly competitive approach the liners are typically 2 3 mm thick mechanically bonded to the outer pipes through either thermally or mechanically induced initial compressive hoop stress and the lined pipes are metallurgically bonded to the outer pipes by circumferential welding approaches at joint ends generally at an interval of 12 2 m vedeld et al 2012a the production processes and the according lined pipe properties may vary between suppliers typical production processes and mechanical properties of the lined pipes have been investigated by researchers chen and petersen 1992 focke et al 2011 guo et al 2017 hilberink et al 2011a vedeld et al 2012b 2012a yuan and kyriakides 2014 lined pipes become increasingly applied in the offshore industry for hydrocarbons transmission in practical applications the lined pipes may be exposed to significant plastic strains the liner may subsequently depart from the outer pipe and develop distinct winkle and local buckles that affect the transmissions lined pipes may be subject to variant loading combinations from the installation to the in place stages in case of s lay wang et al 2017a reel lay yuan and kyriakides 2014 or lowering installation activities wang et al 2017b lined pipes may subject to combined bending tension and torsion during in service conditions lined pipes are under combined internal content and external hydrostatic pressures and thermal induced compression wang 2018 when being laid on an uneven seabed lined pipes may be under combined hydrostatic and content pressure thermal compression and free spanning induced bending in addition to the static loading the structural integrity of lined pipe may be threatened by vortex induced vibration viv occurrence in case of the long free span and fatigue performances need according assessments the flexural behaviors of lined pipes have been investigated motivated by their application in the submarine pipeline installations large scale reeling experiments focke et al 2007 tkaczyk et al 2011 toguyeni and banse 2012 four point bending tests hilberink et al 2011a tkaczyk et al 2011 wilmot and montague 2011 and numerical investigations sriskandarajah et al 2013 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 yuan and kyriakides 2015a 2014 have been conducted to study the limits on plastic bending of the liners the cross sections of both the outer pipe and the liner deform plastically and elliptically due to bending during flexural loading the liner tends to partially separate from the outer pipe the separated liner in the compression side develops axisymmetric wrinkles which are similar to the patterns observed in the single wall pipe under bending corona et al 2006 and the inner stainless tube of carbon steel concrete stainless steel double skin tubes dst under compression wang and han 2019 the compressive behaviors of axially loaded lined pipes have received much less attention yuan and kyriakides 2015b in recent developments the temperatures of the fluids transmitted by lined pipes have been increased to over 150 c gil et al 2014 temperature differences from as laid conditions coupled with the effects of the seabed soil that restricts free expansions of the pipes can introduce significant axial compressions chee et al 2018 there are other factors inducing compressions include ground subsidence fault movement etc kyriakides and corona 2007 there are limited experimental studies on lined pipes under axial compressions in the existing literature this may be attributed to the high loading equipment requirement and the high cost of lined specimens to authors best knowledge the only existing axial compression test on lined pipe was carried out by focke et al 2011 where two lined pipes were tested only one 10 75 in specimen with 9 3 mm thick x65 seamless outer pipe and 2 45 mm thick 304l liner was successfully conducted while the other 12 75 in specimen with 14 3 mm thick x65 electric resistance welded outer pipe and 3 0 mm thick 316l liner was not owing to the limited capacity of the compression facility yuan and kyriakides 2015a b and hilberink et al 2010 conducts numerical investigations on the wrinkling of lined pipes subjected to axial compressions the developments from the initial axisymmetric wrinkling to the non axisymmetric mode and the collapse of the liners have been observed the sensitivities of the key parameters of lined pipes including initial geometric imperfections manufacture process cross section geometries and internal pressure on the collapse strain have been studied analytical studies conducted by vedeld et al 2012a 2012b identify that api 5ld api specification 5ld 2009 is not sufficiently accurate to predict axial stress and initial hoop stress in the liners since the effects of the boundaries need to be considered an analytical formula for axial stress and contact pressure distribution in a liner subjected to axial compression or close to free boundaries has been suggested accordingly existing literature indicates that the existence of the outer pipe significantly enhance the ultimate strength of the liner due to the radial supports from the outer pipe which may delay the local buckling occurrence and changing failure modes of the liner into periodic axisymmetric patterns however the systematic studies on such interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner under axial compression is somehow limited only by doing so one can rationally understand the interaction properties of contact surface within mechanically bonded pipes and the mechanical properties of lined specimen under practical loading combinations accordingly this paper presents finite element analysis fea of lined pipes under axial compressions using abaqus where non linear stress strain models of both the outer pipe carbon steel and linear stainless steel are adopted the fe models are validated through the comparisons between the numerical results and the experimental data reported by focke et al 2011 the full history of the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner have been carefully studied through the verified fe simulations the confinement factor which has been widely used in concrete filled steel tubular structures han et al 2014 is introduced to ensure the outer pipe fails distinctly before the liner as required a parametric study is conducted to study the effects of key parameters including the outer pipe strength the liner strength the outer pipe thickness and the liner thickness on the pipe compressive behaviors 2 brief introduction of the manufacturing process it is beneficial for a better understanding of the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner under axial loading to briefly know the manufacturing process of the lined pipes since the interaction behaviors initiate in this process the processes are generally pipe mill specific focke et al 2006 a typical hydro expansion process is illustrated in fig 1 by the following steps the outer pipe and the liner are produced separately the former is generally seamless and the latter is commonly formed into a continuous longitudinally welded pipe from cra coil the liner is made slightly smaller than the outer pipe the liner is inserted into the outer pipe where an initial gap exists as shown in fig 1 the liner is compressed axially and expanded radially by applying hydraulic pressure inside the liner other processes including means of mechanical expansion or temperature expansion exist vedeld et al 2012a the hydraulic pressure in the liner is increased and the liner is expanded in the radial direction first elastically and then plastically before contacting the outer pipe further increase of the hydraulic pressure causes the outer pipe expanding elastically while the liner is still in plastic deformation the pressure is released and both the outer pipe and liner shrink elastically due to the remaining plastic deformation in the liner the outer pipe grips the liner this induces the initial compressive and the tensile hoop stress in the liner and the outer pipe respectively at the end of the process 3 finite element modelling the general purpose fe package abaqus which has been widely employed for the analysis of lined pipes hilberink et al 2010 sriskandarajah et al 2013 tkaczyk et al 2011 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 yuan and kyriakides 2015b is adapted to perform numerical investigations the developed fe models are initially employed to replicate the experimental studies on the lined pipe under axial compression focke et al 2011 incorporating the measured residual hoop stress and material properties the verified models are used to study the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner and the structural behavior of the specimen supplement results are also generated for parametric studies thereafter 3 1 material modelling to accurately represent the structural response of the lined pipe the material properties of the outer pipe api 5l x65 and the liner aisi 304l must be properly determined and incorporated into the fe simulations 3 1 1 outer pipe the outer pipe is made of carbon steel api 5l grade x65 and an elastic perfectly plastic material model suggested by en 1993 1 5 en 1993 1 5 2006 is adapted to simulate the constitutive behavior of the outer pipe yield stress f yo young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν are taken as 552 mpa 200 000 n mm2 and 0 3 respectively as reported focke 2007 and stress strain models are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 2 liner the liner is made of stainless steel aisi 304l which exhibits a rounded stress strain relationship and is associated with a significant strain hardening property this behavior has been commonly either determined experimentally by performing tensile coupon tests or analytically by ramberg osgood formulations and extensions thereof due to the absence of the tensile tests focke 2007 a ramberg osgood based model proposed by gardner and ashraf 2006 is adopted in this study the model specifically concerns compressive material response and has been extensively used in both academia and industry arrayago et al 2015 wang and han 2018 the expression of the model is given in eq 1 and illustrated in table 1 1 ε f f 0 2 e 0 2 0 008 f 1 0 f 0 2 e 0 2 f f 0 2 f 1 0 f 0 2 n 0 2 1 0 ε 0 2 for f f 0 2 where f 0 2 was the 0 2 proof stress e 0 2 was the tangent stiffness at f 0 2 f 1 0 was the 1 proof stress n 0 2 1 0 was the strain hardening coefficient characterizing the degree of nonlinearity of the stress strain response beyond f 0 2 ε 0 2 was the strain at f 0 2 3 2 elements and method of loading shell elements are generally used to model structures where two dimensions are significantly greater than the third one usually the thickness the local instabilities including local buckling can be accurately captured by these elements and this renders them an ideal option for modelling thin walled structures kyvelou et al 2018 wang et al 2018 four noded s4r shell elements with reduced integration are subsequently selected to model both the outer pipes and liners in this study where the least pipe diameter to thickness ratio d t is approximately 30 convergence study has been conducted to determine mesh size and the results show that defining finer fe mesh than 200 elements in the circumferential direction has a negligible effect on the simulation results the determined mesh size is consistent with simulations conducted by hilberink 2011 the ends at one side of both outer pipe and liner are fixed with all degrees of freedoms and the ends at the other side are applied by displacement to simulate axial compressions the internal content pressure and external hydrostatic pressure are applied directly at the inside surface of the liner and the outside surface of the outer pipe respectively 3 3 modelling of outer pipe liner interface surface to surface interaction models with hard contact and isotropic coulomb friction are used to define the contact response between the outer pipe and liner the existing literature indicates that there is a minor influence of friction on the initial stiffness of the load deformation response and ultimate strength of the lined pipe where friction coefficients μ of 0 0 3 and 0 7 are considered hilberink 2011 in the past studies friction coefficients of the tangential responses have been given values of 0 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 yuan and kyriakides 2015b 0 3 hilberink et al 2011b and 1 0 obeid et al 2018 due to the limited tests studying the friction behavior and the minor influence of friction on the structural behavior of lined pipe under compression yuan and kyriakides 2015b the tangent behavior at the interface is simulated by the isotropic coulomb friction model with μ taken as null 3 4 initial geometric imperfections initial imperfections have been shown to have the influence on the local instabilities of the confined liners in lined pipes motivated by the wrinkling and diamond like buckling patterns of the liner observed in tests two types of initial geometric imperfections axisymmetric and non axisymmetric may be incorporated effects of the imperfection shapes on the load deformation relationship have been numerically studied the results show a minor influence of the incorporated imperfection pattern on the ultimate strengths and this is consistent with the previous studies yuan and kyriakides 2015b however the studies show that the failure mode is directly associated with the imperfection pattern in this study to be in line with test failure modes the diamond like imperfection patterns as determined from the linear eigenvalue analysis are incorporated initial geometric imperfection amplitude of 0 1 mm is selected as it has been found with the best agreement with test results in terms of the failure mode and ultimate strength focke et al 2011 the amplitude is consistent with the one used by yuan and kyriakides 2015b 2014 3 5 modelling of residual hoop stress the radially mechanical expansion which brings the two pipes in contact changes the mechanical properties of the outer pipe and liner and leaves behind residual hoop stresses as well as certain interaction stress at the interface as shown in fig 1 the initial stress conditions of the liner and the outer pipe as shown in fig 2 may affect the interaction behaviors between the components and the mechanical behavior of the lined pipe and need to be subsequently considered in the fe model although directly simulating the manufacturing effects through fe models being mostly used the requirements to incorporate initial geometric imperfections with certain shapes and amplitudes require an alternative approach being introduced by manufacture process the residual hoop stress can be adopted in the outer pipe and the liner through the predefined file module available in abaqus the residual hoop stress due to the radial expansion process can be determined either from full manufacture process fe models yuan and kyriakides 2014 analytical methods studying the manufacture process liu et al 2004 or ring split tests focke et al 2011 suggested by api 5ld american petroleum institute 2015 in this study the experimental measurements are used in the initial step in the simulation the outer pipe and the liner deform slightly interaction stress develops and the imperfection amplitude is subsequently reduced this approach has been found to provide consistent results with those from full manufacture process fe models yuan and kyriakides 2014 the residual compressive hoop stress of 187 mpa on the liner as reported by focke et al 2011 and the accordingly calculated residual tensile hoop stress on the outer pipe and liner are adopted in the model before axial compression being applied 3 6 validation the accuracies of the fe simulations are assessed by comparing the numerically determined failure modes ultimate loads and the axial strain at ultimate loads with those from the collected experimental data focke et al 2007 as table 2 shows the fe model achieves less than 1 and 5 variations in prediction accuracies on the ultimate strength and the corresponding strain respectively against the test results fig 4 depicts the numerical and experimental failure modes where both failure modes show diamond like local buckling in the liner good agreements between numerical and experimental results can be seen in terms of the failure mode the ultimate strength and the strain at the ultimate strength 4 analysis and discussion to have better understanding of the interaction behavior between the outer pipe and liner and the structural behavior of the lined pipe under axial compression the interaction stress p axial strain ε response between the constituent components and the axial compression n axial strain ε relationships during the full loading histories are analyzed through the verified fe models the specimen with d o t o of 273 05 9 3 and d i t i of 254 45 2 45 as presented in table 1 is employed in this analysis 4 1 load deformation the n ε curves of the lined pipe under axial compression are given in fig 5 where the corresponding loads carried by the outer pipe and the liner are also presented respectively the n ε curve can be divided into four stages elastic elastic plastic plastic and declining from the perspective of the stiffness the stiffness of the n ε curve may be associated with the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner the interaction stress p at the interface between the outer pipe and liner as shown in fig 2 is recorded throughout the loading history the full histories of p ε curves are presented in fig 6 accordingly to consider the uneven interaction stress p distribution around the perimeter of the specimen due to the initial geometric imperfection averaged value of the p along the perimeter are used in this study step 1 elastic point o a in this stage n increases linearly and sharply with ε the interaction between the outer pipe and liner is being strengthened as shown in fig 3 compared with the outer pipe stainless steel liner has more rounded material behavior which results in a gradual reduction on the liner s stiffness while the carbon steel outer pipe has linear stiffness at the elastic stage both components have the same poisson s ratio this leads to increasingly larger circumferential expansions by the liner than the outer pipe as shown in fig 6 there is initial interaction stress between the outer pipe and the liner due to the existence of the residual hoop stress induced by the manufacturing process the outer pipe confines the further lateral expansion by the liner and the p continue to increase as shown in the p ε curve before point a in fig 6 this trend is maintained until the shapely defined yielding point of the outer pipe being attained as shown in fig 3 where the yield strain of the outer pipe ε yo 2760 με which is consistent with the axial strain of point a step 2 elastic plastic point a b the stiffness of n ε curve gradually decreases owing to the yielding of the outer pipe the outer pipe becomes perfectly plastic in the stress strain response and the liner behaves in a rounded stress strain manner as shown in fig 3 the outer pipe subsequently has a greater circumferential expanding trend than that of the liner this leads to the reduction on the interaction stress p as shown in the p ε curve point a b in fig 6 at the end of this stage outer pipe and liner bear axial compression independently and interaction stress p is reduced to zero step 3 plastic point b c the stiffness of n ε curve significantly degrades in this stage due to the existence of the outer pipe the local buckling of the liner is delayed due to the provided confinement effects as can be seen in fig 6 after point b where both components work independently the outer pipe provides external support preventing the liner from buckling outwards and the interaction stress p arises again as shown in the p ε curve point b c in fig 6 with the further increase on the axial strain minor enhancement on the load since the outer pipe maintains in perfectly plastic stress strain behavior and the liner has significantly reduced stiffness on the stress strain curves as shown in fig 3 step 4 decline point c d the load generally starts decreasing as increasing axial strain the decline is commonly associated with the local buckling of the liner where the diamond like buckles are observed in this study 4 2 interaction behavior between outer pipe and liner to clarify the interaction behavior between the outer pipe and the liner three types of axial compression simulations are conducted as illustrated in fig 7 a ①only liner under axial compression ②for a lined pipe axial compression only applies on the liner ③lined pipe under axial compression the failure modes and liner axial load n liner axial strain ε curves from the simulations are presented in fig 7 b and fig 8 respectively it can be seen in figs 7 and 8 the liners in the cases ② and ③ where the liners are confined by the outer pipes have significantly higher loading carrying capacities than that in case ① where the only liner exists this may be attributed to the fact that the interaction stresses induced by the confinement effects can prevent or delay the local buckling of the liner as shown in fig 8 b due to the existence of the outer pipe the liner can only buckles inwards as case ③ shown in fig 7 the ultimate strength of the liner in case ③ lined pipe under axial compression is lower than that of case ② axially compressed liner fitting inside the outer pipe as shown in fig 8 a this is due to the fact that the outer pipe in case ③ is buckled as well reducing the support provided by the outer pipe to prevent local buckling of the liner as can be seen in fig 8 since having higher interaction stress than the liner in case ③ the liner in case ② undergoes greater strain hardening without the occurrence of local buckling and achieves higher ultimate strength in case ③ when the interaction stress starts dropping at axial strain ε 13000με liner local buckling occurs simultaneously and the ultimate strength of liner is attained as shown in fig 8 a the buckled lined pipe outer pipe and liner can be seen in fig 7 b the liner has non axisymmetric diamond like buckling shape while the outer pipe buckles in axisymmetric sharp 4 3 pressure containment to study the influence of the pressure on the interaction behaviors between the constituent components three types of pressure loading conditions and one type of combined pressure and axial compression are simulated 1 internal pressure only 2 external pressure only 3 internal and external pressure and axial compression as shown in fig 9 a fig 9 b and fig 10 a respectively for the first two cases practical internal and external pressures are selected considering burst and collapse conditions suggested by dnv os f101 det norske veritas 2010 where 30 mpa and 10 mpa are used as external and internal pressures respectively for the other one with combined pressure and axial compression typical multiphase submarine pipeline project in the east china sea wang et al 2019 with a water depth of approximately 100 m and content pressure of 10 mpa are considered to clarify the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and liner the corresponding single pipe is analyzed as illustrated in fig 9 a and b as can be seen in fig 9 c the maximum von mises stress f mises of the outer pipe within the lined pipe case ① under external pressure decrease at the initial stage and then maintains lower values than the those from the single outer pipe case ② the initial decreasing is attributed to the residual hoop tensile stress induced by the manufacturing process as presented in fig 2 the consistent reduction on f mises of the lined pipe may be owing to the pressure resistance provided by the liner through the interaction behavior as shown in fig 9 e in case of internal pressure as shown in fig 9 d the pressure has a minor influence on the f mises of the liner from the lined pipe but significant effect on that from the specimen with the liner only the existence of the outer pipe provides remarkable further resistance to the internal pressure to the liner inside through the dramatically increased interaction stress p as shown in fig 9 e fig 10 presents loading illustrations and n ε and p ε curves for the axially loaded lined pipes with and without pressures as shown in fig 10 b the ultimate strengths of the lined pipe specimen and the outer pipe component in case of under pressure are both lower than those without pressure this is due to the fact that both external and internal pressure significantly increases the hoop stress of the outer pipe through the interaction behaviors as shown in fig 10 c and the von mises yield criterion is employed although slightly reducing the ultimate strength of the lined pipe by approximately 10 the existence of the external and internal pressures may enhance the ductility and delay the local buckling occurrence of the constituent components 4 4 confinement factor the existence of the outer pipe provides confinement effect on the liner which may delay or prevent the local buckling occurrence of the liner focke et al 2011 confinement factor ξ has been widely used by concrete filled steel tubular cfst structures han et al 2014 uy 1998 wang and han 2018 to study the confinement effect provided by the outer steel tube on the confined concrete ξ is used in this study to perform quantitative evaluations on the confinements of the outer pipe to the liner and can be expressed in eq 2 2 ξ a o f y o a i f y i where a o and a yo are the cross sectional areas of the outer pipe and the liner respectively f yo and f yi are the yield strengths of the outer pipe and the liner by varying the thickness of the liner from 4 0 mm to 1 0 mm a series of specimens are simulated and the strains at the ultimate strengths ε us are plotted against the corresponding confinement factors ξ ε us ξ response of the specimen liner and outer pipe are presented in fig 11 it shows that the larger the ξ the less the ε us difference between the specimen and the liner the liner is generally designed to fail after the ultimate strength of the outer pipe being attained and limitation on ξ is subsequently suggested by assuming 2000με as the minimum difference of ε us between the outer pipe and the liner ξ is suggested less than 6 0 as shown in fig 11 the suggested ξ 6 0 is applicable provided with 2 5 mm minimum thickness of stainless steel liner and 45 maximum d t ratio according to api 5ld american petroleum institute 2015 and dnv os f101 det norske veritas 2010 respectively where the applicable grades of both carbon steel outer pipe and stainless steel liner are also specified 4 5 parametric studies n ε response of the lined pipe under axial compression may be affected by parameters of outer pipe strength f yo liner strength f yi outer pipe thickness t o and liner thickness t i to study the effects of the parameters on the structural behaviors of the axially loaded lined pipes a series of parametric studies are carried out the lined pipe the geometric and material properties of which are given in table 1 is used in this analysis the results of the studies are presented in figs 12 15 as can be seen in figs 12 15 the general shapes of the n ε curves including the initial stiffness and the declining regions are not clearly associated with the material parameters of f yo and f yi the geometric parameters of t o and t i have positive correlations with initial stiffness of the n ε curves owing to the variations on the cross sectional areas of the corresponding components the ultimate strengths n u are linearly correlated with all the parameters of f yo f yi t o and t i since n u is generally determined by the component material strength and the corresponding cross section areas fig 16 show that the rate of increase on n u to 100 increasing of f yo f yi t o and t i are 82 3 10 0 7 2 and 88 9 respectively by considering the typical lined pipes being analyzed it is subsequently suggested for engineers to increase either outer pipe thickness f yo or strength t o for increasing the ultimate strengths owing to the high cost of upgrading the liner made by stainless steel 5 conclusions the interaction behaviors between the offshore lined pipe subjected to axial compressions are investigated in this paper through finite element analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the comprehensive fe models to investigate the interaction behaviors between outer pipe and liner within offshore lined pipeline under axial compression are developed the comparisons between the numerical and experimental results in terms of the failure modes n ε responses and the ultimate strengths show good agreements between the simulations and tests 2 the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and liner are analyzed in detail through the full histories of the outer pipe liner interaction stress and the failure modes for three loading cases only liner load only on the liner lined pipe and load on the specimen lined pipe the existence of the outer pipe prevents or delays the local buckling occurrences of the confined liner the effect of which may be further enhanced by applying the internal or external pressures due to the corresponding enhanced interaction stress the existence of the pressure may reduce the ultimate strength owing to the mises yield criterion and the tri axial stress conditions a range of confinement factor ξ is suggested to ensure the outer pipe attains the ultimate strength evidently before the liner 3 important parameters influencing the n ε curves are studied and the ultimate strengths are associated with f yo f yi t o and t i the investigations on the rates of increases to the parameters advise using upgrading outer pipe strength or thickness due to structural and economic efficiency acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by national natural

hoop stress and the lined pipes are metallurgically bonded to the outer pipes by circumferential welding approaches at joint ends generally at an interval of 12 2 m vedeld et al 2012a the production processes and the according lined pipe properties may vary between suppliers typical production processes and mechanical properties of the lined pipes have been investigated by researchers chen and petersen 1992 focke et al 2011 guo et al 2017 hilberink et al 2011a vedeld et al 2012b 2012a yuan and kyriakides 2014 lined pipes become increasingly applied in the offshore industry for hydrocarbons transmission in practical applications the lined pipes may be exposed to significant plastic strains the liner may subsequently depart from the outer pipe and develop distinct winkle and local buckles that affect the transmissions lined pipes may be subject to variant loading combinations from the installation to the in place stages in case of s lay wang et al 2017a reel lay yuan and kyriakides 2014 or lowering installation activities wang et al 2017b lined pipes may subject to combined bending tension and torsion during in service conditions lined pipes are under combined internal content and external hydrostatic pressures and thermal induced compression wang 2018 when being laid on an uneven seabed lined pipes may be under combined hydrostatic and content pressure thermal compression and free spanning induced bending in addition to the static loading the structural integrity of lined pipe may be threatened by vortex induced vibration viv occurrence in case of the long free span and fatigue performances need according assessments the flexural behaviors of lined pipes have been investigated motivated by their application in the submarine pipeline installations large scale reeling experiments focke et al 2007 tkaczyk et al 2011 toguyeni and banse 2012 four point bending tests hilberink et al 2011a tkaczyk et al 2011 wilmot and montague 2011 and numerical investigations sriskandarajah et al 2013 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 yuan and kyriakides 2015a 2014 have been conducted to study the limits on plastic bending of the liners the cross sections of both the outer pipe and the liner deform plastically and elliptically due to bending during flexural loading the liner tends to partially separate from the outer pipe the separated liner in the compression side develops axisymmetric wrinkles which are similar to the patterns observed in the single wall pipe under bending corona et al 2006 and the inner stainless tube of carbon steel concrete stainless steel double skin tubes dst under compression wang and han 2019 the compressive behaviors of axially loaded lined pipes have received much less attention yuan and kyriakides 2015b in recent developments the temperatures of the fluids transmitted by lined pipes have been increased to over 150 c gil et al 2014 temperature differences from as laid conditions coupled with the effects of the seabed soil that restricts free expansions of the pipes can introduce significant axial compressions chee et al 2018 there are other factors inducing compressions include ground subsidence fault movement etc kyriakides and corona 2007 there are limited experimental studies on lined pipes under axial compressions in the existing literature this may be attributed to the high loading equipment requirement and the high cost of lined specimens to authors best knowledge the only existing axial compression test on lined pipe was carried out by focke et al 2011 where two lined pipes were tested only one 10 75 in specimen with 9 3 mm thick x65 seamless outer pipe and 2 45 mm thick 304l liner was successfully conducted while the other 12 75 in specimen with 14 3 mm thick x65 electric resistance welded outer pipe and 3 0 mm thick 316l liner was not owing to the limited capacity of the compression facility yuan and kyriakides 2015a b and hilberink et al 2010 conducts numerical investigations on the wrinkling of lined pipes subjected to axial compressions the developments from the initial axisymmetric wrinkling to the non axisymmetric mode and the collapse of the liners have been observed the sensitivities of the key parameters of lined pipes including initial geometric imperfections manufacture process cross section geometries and internal pressure on the collapse strain have been studied analytical studies conducted by vedeld et al 2012a 2012b identify that api 5ld api specification 5ld 2009 is not sufficiently accurate to predict axial stress and initial hoop stress in the liners since the effects of the boundaries need to be considered an analytical formula for axial stress and contact pressure distribution in a liner subjected to axial compression or close to free boundaries has been suggested accordingly existing literature indicates that the existence of the outer pipe significantly enhance the ultimate strength of the liner due to the radial supports from the outer pipe which may delay the local buckling occurrence and changing failure modes of the liner into periodic axisymmetric patterns however the systematic studies on such interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner under axial compression is somehow limited only by doing so one can rationally understand the interaction properties of contact surface within mechanically bonded pipes and the mechanical properties of lined specimen under practical loading combinations accordingly this paper presents finite element analysis fea of lined pipes under axial compressions using abaqus where non linear stress strain models of both the outer pipe carbon steel and linear stainless steel are adopted the fe models are validated through the comparisons between the numerical results and the experimental data reported by focke et al 2011 the full history of the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner have been carefully studied through the verified fe simulations the confinement factor which has been widely used in concrete filled steel tubular structures han et al 2014 is introduced to ensure the outer pipe fails distinctly before the liner as required a parametric study is conducted to study the effects of key parameters including the outer pipe strength the liner strength the outer pipe thickness and the liner thickness on the pipe compressive behaviors 2 brief introduction of the manufacturing process it is beneficial for a better understanding of the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner under axial loading to briefly know the manufacturing process of the lined pipes since the interaction behaviors initiate in this process the processes are generally pipe mill specific focke et al 2006 a typical hydro expansion process is illustrated in fig 1 by the following steps the outer pipe and the liner are produced separately the former is generally seamless and the latter is commonly formed into a continuous longitudinally welded pipe from cra coil the liner is made slightly smaller than the outer pipe the liner is inserted into the outer pipe where an initial gap exists as shown in fig 1 the liner is compressed axially and expanded radially by applying hydraulic pressure inside the liner other processes including means of mechanical expansion or temperature expansion exist vedeld et al 2012a the hydraulic pressure in the liner is increased and the liner is expanded in the radial direction first elastically and then plastically before contacting the outer pipe further increase of the hydraulic pressure causes the outer pipe expanding elastically while the liner is still in plastic deformation the pressure is released and both the outer pipe and liner shrink elastically due to the remaining plastic deformation in the liner the outer pipe grips the liner this induces the initial compressive and the tensile hoop stress in the liner and the outer pipe respectively at the end of the process 3 finite element modelling the general purpose fe package abaqus which has been widely employed for the analysis of lined pipes hilberink et al 2010 sriskandarajah et al 2013 tkaczyk et al 2011 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 yuan and kyriakides 2015b is adapted to perform numerical investigations the developed fe models are initially employed to replicate the experimental studies on the lined pipe under axial compression focke et al 2011 incorporating the measured residual hoop stress and material properties the verified models are used to study the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner and the structural behavior of the specimen supplement results are also generated for parametric studies thereafter 3 1 material modelling to accurately represent the structural response of the lined pipe the material properties of the outer pipe api 5l x65 and the liner aisi 304l must be properly determined and incorporated into the fe simulations 3 1 1 outer pipe the outer pipe is made of carbon steel api 5l grade x65 and an elastic perfectly plastic material model suggested by en 1993 1 5 en 1993 1 5 2006 is adapted to simulate the constitutive behavior of the outer pipe yield stress f yo young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν are taken as 552 mpa 200 000 n mm2 and 0 3 respectively as reported focke 2007 and stress strain models are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 2 liner the liner is made of stainless steel aisi 304l which exhibits a rounded stress strain relationship and is associated with a significant strain hardening property this behavior has been commonly either determined experimentally by performing tensile coupon tests or analytically by ramberg osgood formulations and extensions thereof due to the absence of the tensile tests focke 2007 a ramberg osgood based model proposed by gardner and ashraf 2006 is adopted in this study the model specifically concerns compressive material response and has been extensively used in both academia and industry arrayago et al 2015 wang and han 2018 the expression of the model is given in eq 1 and illustrated in table 1 1 ε f f 0 2 e 0 2 0 008 f 1 0 f 0 2 e 0 2 f f 0 2 f 1 0 f 0 2 n 0 2 1 0 ε 0 2 for f f 0 2 where f 0 2 was the 0 2 proof stress e 0 2 was the tangent stiffness at f 0 2 f 1 0 was the 1 proof stress n 0 2 1 0 was the strain hardening coefficient characterizing the degree of nonlinearity of the stress strain response beyond f 0 2 ε 0 2 was the strain at f 0 2 3 2 elements and method of loading shell elements are generally used to model structures where two dimensions are significantly greater than the third one usually the thickness the local instabilities including local buckling can be accurately captured by these elements and this renders them an ideal option for modelling thin walled structures kyvelou et al 2018 wang et al 2018 four noded s4r shell elements with reduced integration are subsequently selected to model both the outer pipes and liners in this study where the least pipe diameter to thickness ratio d t is approximately 30 convergence study has been conducted to determine mesh size and the results show that defining finer fe mesh than 200 elements in the circumferential direction has a negligible effect on the simulation results the determined mesh size is consistent with simulations conducted by hilberink 2011 the ends at one side of both outer pipe and liner are fixed with all degrees of freedoms and the ends at the other side are applied by displacement to simulate axial compressions the internal content pressure and external hydrostatic pressure are applied directly at the inside surface of the liner and the outside surface of the outer pipe respectively 3 3 modelling of outer pipe liner interface surface to surface interaction models with hard contact and isotropic coulomb friction are used to define the contact response between the outer pipe and liner the existing literature indicates that there is a minor influence of friction on the initial stiffness of the load deformation response and ultimate strength of the lined pipe where friction coefficients μ of 0 0 3 and 0 7 are considered hilberink 2011 in the past studies friction coefficients of the tangential responses have been given values of 0 vasilikis and karamanos 2012 yuan and kyriakides 2015b 0 3 hilberink et al 2011b and 1 0 obeid et al 2018 due to the limited tests studying the friction behavior and the minor influence of friction on the structural behavior of lined pipe under compression yuan and kyriakides 2015b the tangent behavior at the interface is simulated by the isotropic coulomb friction model with μ taken as null 3 4 initial geometric imperfections initial imperfections have been shown to have the influence on the local instabilities of the confined liners in lined pipes motivated by the wrinkling and diamond like buckling patterns of the liner observed in tests two types of initial geometric imperfections axisymmetric and non axisymmetric may be incorporated effects of the imperfection shapes on the load deformation relationship have been numerically studied the results show a minor influence of the incorporated imperfection pattern on the ultimate strengths and this is consistent with the previous studies yuan and kyriakides 2015b however the studies show that the failure mode is directly associated with the imperfection pattern in this study to be in line with test failure modes the diamond like imperfection patterns as determined from the linear eigenvalue analysis are incorporated initial geometric imperfection amplitude of 0 1 mm is selected as it has been found with the best agreement with test results in terms of the failure mode and ultimate strength focke et al 2011 the amplitude is consistent with the one used by yuan and kyriakides 2015b 2014 3 5 modelling of residual hoop stress the radially mechanical expansion which brings the two pipes in contact changes the mechanical properties of the outer pipe and liner and leaves behind residual hoop stresses as well as certain interaction stress at the interface as shown in fig 1 the initial stress conditions of the liner and the outer pipe as shown in fig 2 may affect the interaction behaviors between the components and the mechanical behavior of the lined pipe and need to be subsequently considered in the fe model although directly simulating the manufacturing effects through fe models being mostly used the requirements to incorporate initial geometric imperfections with certain shapes and amplitudes require an alternative approach being introduced by manufacture process the residual hoop stress can be adopted in the outer pipe and the liner through the predefined file module available in abaqus the residual hoop stress due to the radial expansion process can be determined either from full manufacture process fe models yuan and kyriakides 2014 analytical methods studying the manufacture process liu et al 2004 or ring split tests focke et al 2011 suggested by api 5ld american petroleum institute 2015 in this study the experimental measurements are used in the initial step in the simulation the outer pipe and the liner deform slightly interaction stress develops and the imperfection amplitude is subsequently reduced this approach has been found to provide consistent results with those from full manufacture process fe models yuan and kyriakides 2014 the residual compressive hoop stress of 187 mpa on the liner as reported by focke et al 2011 and the accordingly calculated residual tensile hoop stress on the outer pipe and liner are adopted in the model before axial compression being applied 3 6 validation the accuracies of the fe simulations are assessed by comparing the numerically determined failure modes ultimate loads and the axial strain at ultimate loads with those from the collected experimental data focke et al 2007 as table 2 shows the fe model achieves less than 1 and 5 variations in prediction accuracies on the ultimate strength and the corresponding strain respectively against the test results fig 4 depicts the numerical and experimental failure modes where both failure modes show diamond like local buckling in the liner good agreements between numerical and experimental results can be seen in terms of the failure mode the ultimate strength and the strain at the ultimate strength 4 analysis and discussion to have better understanding of the interaction behavior between the outer pipe and liner and the structural behavior of the lined pipe under axial compression the interaction stress p axial strain ε response between the constituent components and the axial compression n axial strain ε relationships during the full loading histories are analyzed through the verified fe models the specimen with d o t o of 273 05 9 3 and d i t i of 254 45 2 45 as presented in table 1 is employed in this analysis 4 1 load deformation the n ε curves of the lined pipe under axial compression are given in fig 5 where the corresponding loads carried by the outer pipe and the liner are also presented respectively the n ε curve can be divided into four stages elastic elastic plastic plastic and declining from the perspective of the stiffness the stiffness of the n ε curve may be associated with the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and the liner the interaction stress p at the interface between the outer pipe and liner as shown in fig 2 is recorded throughout the loading history the full histories of p ε curves are presented in fig 6 accordingly to consider the uneven interaction stress p distribution around the perimeter of the specimen due to the initial geometric imperfection averaged value of the p along the perimeter are used in this study step 1 elastic point o a in this stage n increases linearly and sharply with ε the interaction between the outer pipe and liner is being strengthened as shown in fig 3 compared with the outer pipe stainless steel liner has more rounded material behavior which results in a gradual reduction on the liner s stiffness while the carbon steel outer pipe has linear stiffness at the elastic stage both components have the same poisson s ratio this leads to increasingly larger circumferential expansions by the liner than the outer pipe as shown in fig 6 there is initial interaction stress between the outer pipe and the liner due to the existence of the residual hoop stress induced by the manufacturing process the outer pipe confines the further lateral expansion by the liner and the p continue to increase as shown in the p ε curve before point a in fig 6 this trend is maintained until the shapely defined yielding point of the outer pipe being attained as shown in fig 3 where the yield strain of the outer pipe ε yo 2760 με which is consistent with the axial strain of point a step 2 elastic plastic point a b the stiffness of n ε curve gradually decreases owing to the yielding of the outer pipe the outer pipe becomes perfectly plastic in the stress strain response and the liner behaves in a rounded stress strain manner as shown in fig 3 the outer pipe subsequently has a greater circumferential expanding trend than that of the liner this leads to the reduction on the interaction stress p as shown in the p ε curve point a b in fig 6 at the end of this stage outer pipe and liner bear axial compression independently and interaction stress p is reduced to zero step 3 plastic point b c the stiffness of n ε curve significantly degrades in this stage due to the existence of the outer pipe the local buckling of the liner is delayed due to the provided confinement effects as can be seen in fig 6 after point b where both components work independently the outer pipe provides external support preventing the liner from buckling outwards and the interaction stress p arises again as shown in the p ε curve point b c in fig 6 with the further increase on the axial strain minor enhancement on the load since the outer pipe maintains in perfectly plastic stress strain behavior and the liner has significantly reduced stiffness on the stress strain curves as shown in fig 3 step 4 decline point c d the load generally starts decreasing as increasing axial strain the decline is commonly associated with the local buckling of the liner where the diamond like buckles are observed in this study 4 2 interaction behavior between outer pipe and liner to clarify the interaction behavior between the outer pipe and the liner three types of axial compression simulations are conducted as illustrated in fig 7 a ①only liner under axial compression ②for a lined pipe axial compression only applies on the liner ③lined pipe under axial compression the failure modes and liner axial load n liner axial strain ε curves from the simulations are presented in fig 7 b and fig 8 respectively it can be seen in figs 7 and 8 the liners in the cases ② and ③ where the liners are confined by the outer pipes have significantly higher loading carrying capacities than that in case ① where the only liner exists this may be attributed to the fact that the interaction stresses induced by the confinement effects can prevent or delay the local buckling of the liner as shown in fig 8 b due to the existence of the outer pipe the liner can only buckles inwards as case ③ shown in fig 7 the ultimate strength of the liner in case ③ lined pipe under axial compression is lower than that of case ② axially compressed liner fitting inside the outer pipe as shown in fig 8 a this is due to the fact that the outer pipe in case ③ is buckled as well reducing the support provided by the outer pipe to prevent local buckling of the liner as can be seen in fig 8 since having higher interaction stress than the liner in case ③ the liner in case ② undergoes greater strain hardening without the occurrence of local buckling and achieves higher ultimate strength in case ③ when the interaction stress starts dropping at axial strain ε 13000με liner local buckling occurs simultaneously and the ultimate strength of liner is attained as shown in fig 8 a the buckled lined pipe outer pipe and liner can be seen in fig 7 b the liner has non axisymmetric diamond like buckling shape while the outer pipe buckles in axisymmetric sharp 4 3 pressure containment to study the influence of the pressure on the interaction behaviors between the constituent components three types of pressure loading conditions and one type of combined pressure and axial compression are simulated 1 internal pressure only 2 external pressure only 3 internal and external pressure and axial compression as shown in fig 9 a fig 9 b and fig 10 a respectively for the first two cases practical internal and external pressures are selected considering burst and collapse conditions suggested by dnv os f101 det norske veritas 2010 where 30 mpa and 10 mpa are used as external and internal pressures respectively for the other one with combined pressure and axial compression typical multiphase submarine pipeline project in the east china sea wang et al 2019 with a water depth of approximately 100 m and content pressure of 10 mpa are considered to clarify the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and liner the corresponding single pipe is analyzed as illustrated in fig 9 a and b as can be seen in fig 9 c the maximum von mises stress f mises of the outer pipe within the lined pipe case ① under external pressure decrease at the initial stage and then maintains lower values than the those from the single outer pipe case ② the initial decreasing is attributed to the residual hoop tensile stress induced by the manufacturing process as presented in fig 2 the consistent reduction on f mises of the lined pipe may be owing to the pressure resistance provided by the liner through the interaction behavior as shown in fig 9 e in case of internal pressure as shown in fig 9 d the pressure has a minor influence on the f mises of the liner from the lined pipe but significant effect on that from the specimen with the liner only the existence of the outer pipe provides remarkable further resistance to the internal pressure to the liner inside through the dramatically increased interaction stress p as shown in fig 9 e fig 10 presents loading illustrations and n ε and p ε curves for the axially loaded lined pipes with and without pressures as shown in fig 10 b the ultimate strengths of the lined pipe specimen and the outer pipe component in case of under pressure are both lower than those without pressure this is due to the fact that both external and internal pressure significantly increases the hoop stress of the outer pipe through the interaction behaviors as shown in fig 10 c and the von mises yield criterion is employed although slightly reducing the ultimate strength of the lined pipe by approximately 10 the existence of the external and internal pressures may enhance the ductility and delay the local buckling occurrence of the constituent components 4 4 confinement factor the existence of the outer pipe provides confinement effect on the liner which may delay or prevent the local buckling occurrence of the liner focke et al 2011 confinement factor ξ has been widely used by concrete filled steel tubular cfst structures han et al 2014 uy 1998 wang and han 2018 to study the confinement effect provided by the outer steel tube on the confined concrete ξ is used in this study to perform quantitative evaluations on the confinements of the outer pipe to the liner and can be expressed in eq 2 2 ξ a o f y o a i f y i where a o and a yo are the cross sectional areas of the outer pipe and the liner respectively f yo and f yi are the yield strengths of the outer pipe and the liner by varying the thickness of the liner from 4 0 mm to 1 0 mm a series of specimens are simulated and the strains at the ultimate strengths ε us are plotted against the corresponding confinement factors ξ ε us ξ response of the specimen liner and outer pipe are presented in fig 11 it shows that the larger the ξ the less the ε us difference between the specimen and the liner the liner is generally designed to fail after the ultimate strength of the outer pipe being attained and limitation on ξ is subsequently suggested by assuming 2000με as the minimum difference of ε us between the outer pipe and the liner ξ is suggested less than 6 0 as shown in fig 11 the suggested ξ 6 0 is applicable provided with 2 5 mm minimum thickness of stainless steel liner and 45 maximum d t ratio according to api 5ld american petroleum institute 2015 and dnv os f101 det norske veritas 2010 respectively where the applicable grades of both carbon steel outer pipe and stainless steel liner are also specified 4 5 parametric studies n ε response of the lined pipe under axial compression may be affected by parameters of outer pipe strength f yo liner strength f yi outer pipe thickness t o and liner thickness t i to study the effects of the parameters on the structural behaviors of the axially loaded lined pipes a series of parametric studies are carried out the lined pipe the geometric and material properties of which are given in table 1 is used in this analysis the results of the studies are presented in figs 12 15 as can be seen in figs 12 15 the general shapes of the n ε curves including the initial stiffness and the declining regions are not clearly associated with the material parameters of f yo and f yi the geometric parameters of t o and t i have positive correlations with initial stiffness of the n ε curves owing to the variations on the cross sectional areas of the corresponding components the ultimate strengths n u are linearly correlated with all the parameters of f yo f yi t o and t i since n u is generally determined by the component material strength and the corresponding cross section areas fig 16 show that the rate of increase on n u to 100 increasing of f yo f yi t o and t i are 82 3 10 0 7 2 and 88 9 respectively by considering the typical lined pipes being analyzed it is subsequently suggested for engineers to increase either outer pipe thickness f yo or strength t o for increasing the ultimate strengths owing to the high cost of upgrading the liner made by stainless steel 5 conclusions the interaction behaviors between the offshore lined pipe subjected to axial compressions are investigated in this paper through finite element analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the comprehensive fe models to investigate the interaction behaviors between outer pipe and liner within offshore lined pipeline under axial compression are developed the comparisons between the numerical and experimental results in terms of the failure modes n ε responses and the ultimate strengths show good agreements between the simulations and tests 2 the interaction behaviors between the outer pipe and liner are analyzed in detail through the full histories of the outer pipe liner interaction stress and the failure modes for three loading cases only liner load only on the liner lined pipe and load on the specimen lined pipe the existence of the outer pipe prevents or delays the local buckling occurrences of the confined liner the effect of which may be further enhanced by applying the internal or external pressures due to the corresponding enhanced interaction stress the existence of the pressure may reduce the ultimate strength owing to the mises yield criterion and the tri axial stress conditions a range of confinement factor ξ is suggested to ensure the outer pipe attains the ultimate strength evidently before the liner 3 important parameters influencing the n ε curves are studied and the ultimate strengths are associated with f yo f yi t o and t i the investigations on the rates of increases to the parameters advise using upgrading outer pipe strength or thickness due to structural and economic efficiency acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by national natural

22954,the 2016 mw 7 8 kaikoura earthquake and consequent tsunami have been controversial because of uncertainty over whether and where the plate interface ruptured and the incapability of the proposed source models to reproduce the near field runup of 7 m existing models identify a wide range of locations for the interface rupture from on land to offshore and fail to reproduce runup of 7 m near kaikoura to generate the large tsunami peak in kaikoura tide gauge record and the observed runup height offshore seafloor movement is necessary but the offshore extension of the plate interface rupture and its type either seismic rupture or a landslide is uncertain here we propose a submarine landslide in addition to the earthquake source with the landslide delayed 10 20 min after the earthquake rupture the landslide volume is 4 5 5 2 km3 located within 173 7 174 3oe longitude and 42 6 42 15os latitude our proposed dual tsunami source successfully reproduces near field tide gauge records as well as observed near field runup height of 7 m we showed that more accurate source models of earthquakes can be achieved by considering observed runup data through runup inversions in addition to waveform inversions keywords new zealand 2016 kaikoura earthquake submarine landslide tsunami numerical simulations dual tsunami source 1 introduction and background a few years after the november 2016 kaikoura earthquake and tsunami fig 1 a the debate about the source of the earthquake and the characteristics of the resulting tsunami continues the kaikoura earthquake with moment magnitude mw of 7 8 struck on the 13 november 2016 at 11 02 56 utc fig 1a usgs us geological survey it generated a tsunami with maximum runups of up to 7 m lane et al 2017 power et al 2017 a large concentrated coastal runup was observed along a narrow segment of the coast close to kaikoura fig 1c latitude of 42 5os the mainshock s focal mechanism is complicated with oblique thrust faulting initiating strike slip movement followed by both strike slip and thrust faulting duputel and rivera 2017 hollinsworth et al 2017 one commonality of the different proposed source mechanisms duputel and rivera 2017 hollinsworth et al 2017 is the occurrence of reverse faulting at the plate interface major uncertainties however are whether the plate interface ruptured or not and if ruptured whether the plate interface rupture was offshore or on land some models confine the plate interface rupture to on land others extend it offshore and some models lack any plate interface rupture earthquake rupture location has major implications on seismic hazard in the region e g furlong and herman 2017 but also on tsunami generation several source models have been proposed following the kaikoura event but none of them was able to reproduce the large concentrated runup of 7 m observed in kaikoura simulations from two state of the art source models for the kaikoura event generates up to 4 m of runup pink and green lines fig 1c which is much smaller than observations blue circles fig 1c the kaikoura runup case reminds the challenge of the 1998 papua new guinea png tsunami whose observed concentrated runup of 15 m was only reproduced by a combined earthquake and a submarine landslide source okal 1999 tappin et al 2001 synolakis et al 2002 the study by okal and synolakis 2004 revealed that unusually large and concentrated runups are most likely the results of contribution of an additional co seismic landslide source to the tsunami such combined earthquake landslide sources are known as dual tsunami sources dual source earthquake and submarine landslide tsunamis are a poorly understood hazard because there are too few well studied examples the most notable dual events include messina 1908 billi et al 2008 fu et al 2017 makran 1945 heidarzadeh and satake 2017a alaska 1946 okal et al 2002 2003 java 2006 fritz et al 2007 and japan 2011 tappin et al 2014 here we review the source models for the 2016 kaikoura tsunami based on the preliminary results of heidarzadeh and satake 2017b rather than an offshore plate interface rupture we present supporting numerical models for an additional submarine landslide which is able to successfully reproduce the near field observed runup of 7 m the location of the submarine landslide source is determined based on the iterative numerical tsunami modeling of various scenarios of dual earthquake landslide sources the dual source model presented here for the 2016 kaikoura tsunami is the only source model that reproduces both tide gauge records and the observed near field runup heights 2 kaikoura tsunami source models co seismic deformation of the kaikoura earthquake includes rupture of at least 12 major faults hamling et

et al 2017 fig 2 b from geodetic and coastal uplift inversion proposed two tectonic mechanisms one with and one without slip on the plate interface fault both slip models are located mainly on land where the plate interface movement is also located neither reproduces the near field tsunami observation at the kaikoura tide gauge pink lines fig 1b and the observed runup pink lines fig 1c bai et al 2017 based on teleseismic inversion and forward tsunami simulations proposed a three segment offset fault rupture comprising two crustal and one plate interface faults fig 2c these faults are located mainly on land but with a plate interface fault extended 40 km offshore of kaikoura the model by bai et al 2017 successfully reproduced near field tide gauge records but the authors did not investigate if their source model is able to reproduce the near field runup of 7 m heidarzadeh and satake 2017b based on short period waves recorded at local tide gauges proposed an alternative solution to the problem of the source location fig s1 to explain the recorded tsunami they suggested the addition to the earthquake of a submarine landslide the possibility of a submarine landslide is supported by the near field narrow peak tsunami recorded at the kaikoura tide gauge fig 1b support for the landslide hypothesis has been provided by gusman et al 2018 these authors based on the inversion of the recorded tsunami waves identified a tsunami related sea surface disturbance fig 2d they speculated that the disturbance was from either an offshore plate interface rupture or alternatively a submarine landslide although the model by gusman et al 2018 reproduces the kaikoura tide gauge record green lines fig 1b it cannot reproduce the near field runup of 7 m green lines fig 1c although some source models successfully reproduced the kaikoura tide gauge record gusman et al 2018 bai et al 2017 none of them reproduces the near field runup of 7 m fig 1c this has been the major challenge associated with the 2016 kaikoura tsunami spectral analysis of tide gauge data heidarzadeh and satake 2017b showed a dual peak spectrum for the tsunami fig s1 which is unusual for a purely tectonic event and is more suggestive of a confined secondary mechanism such as a submarine landslide a submarine landslide mechanism is also supported by the numerical simulations of heidarzadeh and satake 2017b which based on the purely earthquake source model revealed an energy deficit compared to the tide gauge observations for the short period band of 7 min in this context to explain the observed near field runup of 7 m we examine the possibility of the contribution of a submarine landslide to the 2016 kaikoura tsunami 3 data and methods we used three near field tsunami observations from tide gauges at kaikoura sumner and wellington fig 1 provided by the gns science new zealand and land information new zealand we applied welch algorithm of mathworks 2017 for fourier analysis following the procedure described in rabinovich 1997 numerical modeling of tsunami was performed using combined earthquake landslide sources the earthquake source model was based on that of

the short period large peak tsunami wave at kaikoura for ls 3 and ls 4 figs 1b and 6c we found that the landslide required triggering 10 and 20 min after the earthquake respectively based on the timing of the narrow peak in the kaikoura record the wavelet analysis by heidarzadeh and satake 2017b also revealed an approximately 20 min delay in the arrival of the short period waves of the 2016 kaikoura tsunami a delay in landslide triggering has been found at other dual tsunami source events such as the well documented 13 15 min delay for the landslide part of the 1998 papua new guinea

numerical simulations of the various dual source scenarios we consider the most likely location of the submarine landslide source is at a water depth of 1000 m on the slope of the kaikoura canyon within the area of intense aftershock activity offshore kaikoura ls 3 and ls 4 in fig 6b and circle b in fig 4a based on the numerical results we identify the zone shown by box a in fig 6b longitude 173 7 174 3oe latitude 42 6 42 15os as the most likely landslide zone the dimensions of this landslide source are length 10 km width 10 km and thickness 150 175 m resulting in a slide volume of 4 5 5 2 km3 fig 6c and table 1 the landslide generated waveforms fig 5 b show typical behavior generally expected from confined landslide sources first they are large in the near field i e large amplitudes at kaikoura and rapidly lose amplitude farther from the source region i e small amplitudes in sumner and wellington and second the landslide waveforms contain few large peaks which disappear rapidly as seen in the simulated waveforms at kaikoura fig 5b comparison of observed and simulated runup heights fig 7 supports that a narrow focused landslide source can successfully reproduce the peak tsunami runup of 7 m observed in kaikoura the two purely tectonic sources of hamling et al 2017 and gusman et al 2018 were unable to reproduce such large runup heights in kaiokoura fig 1c fourier analyses of the various waveforms i e observations purely tectonic purely landslide and combined sources are shown in fig 8 as expected landslide generated waves mainly contribute to spectral energy at periods 7 min due to their confined source dimensions the spectral energy for the combined source is noticeably increased at periods 7 min while it is almost same as that of the purely tectonic source for periods 7 min fig 8 such effects are not seen at the wellington station as it is located within a semi enclosed bay where bathymetric features mostly filter the landslide generated short period waves before reaching there heidarzadeh and satake 2017b 6 discussions although the occurrence of a plate interface rupture is likely during the kaikoura event duputel and rivera 2017 hollinsworth et al 2017 the state of the art knowledge on earthquake source process does not allow such a plate interface rupture to be precisely located the plate interface rupture components of hamling et al 2017 and bai et al 2017 are distanced 50 km with the former located fully on land while the latter is partly offshore several authors e g heidarzadeh et al 2016b 2017a b gusman et al 2015 lay et al 2014 have shown that seismic inversions are sensitive to the choice of rupture velocity vr because of this rupture location can vary up to tens of kilometers in addition to large and concentrated runup height of 7 m in kaikoura another patch of concentrated measured runup of 4 m is observed around the latitude of 43 66 os while simulations result in a runup value of 0 5 m fig 7 black line it is possible that another submarine landslide has contributed to the elevated runup here as intensive landslide activities were reported following the kaikoura earthquake with thousands of landslides mapped in post event field surveys such a scenario looks possible we note that based on the modeling results from 18 landslide scenarios fig 3 fig s3 it is clear that the landslide scenario proposed offshore kaikoura ls 3 fig 6c cannot be extended to cover the latitude of 43 66 os because if we expand it the resulting waveforms will not match the observed waveforms fig s3 in other words to reproduce the runup of 4 m around the latitude of 43 66 os another isolated landslide scenario is required with dimensions potentially smaller than our ls 3 therefore two isolated landslide sources will be required to match the observed runup distribution an example for occurrences of several isolated submarine landslides following an earthquake which contributed to elevated runup heights in several locations is the 1956 amorgos greece event okal et al 2009 the elevated runup heights at several locations following the 1956 tsunami were explained by addition of several isolated landslide sources to the tectonic source of the earthquake by okal et al 2009 the novelty of our dual model over published source model e g gusman et al 2018 hamling et al 2017 is that it reproduces the observed runup data whereas other source models failed the other studies are based on the common practice and well established method of seismic tsunami waveform inversions which matches the observed point waveforms using a least square or similar optimization techniques this technique is very strong but it needs a suitable number of observation points to accurately map the earthquake source characteristics especially this method may not result in accurate enough source models if a landslide is involved because landslide generated water waves travel short distances and thus a scattered observation network may miss them and landsides produce almost trivial seismic waves and hence there will be almost no trace of them on the seismic observation network in fact this study highlights the importance of considering observed runup data for earthquake source studies through runup inversions 7 conclusions to explain the large and concentrated runup height of 7 m near kaikoura following the 2016 tsunami we propose a dual submarine landslide earthquake mechanism rather than a previously proposed offshore plate interface rupture our dual tsunami source consists of the earthquake source of hamling et al 2017 and a theoretical landslide source located offshore kaikoura the main findings are 1 notwithstanding the uncertainty over an offshore plate interface rupture and its location a submarine landslide offers a viable alternative by numerical simulations of dual sources the earthquake model of hamling et al 2017 and a submarine landslide we successfully reproduced the near field tsunami tide gauge record in kaikoura as well as the observed runup height of 7 m 2 landslide dimensions and locations are length 10 km width 10 km thickness 150 175 m and location 173 7 174 3oe longitude 42 6 42 15os latitude the volume of the landslide is 4 5 5 2 km3 the landslide source is delayed 10 20 min compared to the earthquake origin time the volume of the landslide agrees to first order with eroded sediment volumes calculated for landslides triggered by the earthquake from before and after field surveys where these are available 3 our dual source proposed here is consistent with tsunami waveforms and field runup data our dual model reproduces the seismic observations too because the earthquake component of the dual source was validated with these data and the landslide component does not produce significant seismic signature on the seismic network the novelty of our dual model over published source model is that it reproduces the field runup data whereas other source models fail 4 this study highlights the importance of considering observed runup data for earthquake tsunami source studies through runup inversions while seismic tsunami waveform inversions are commonly used for earthquake source studies we showed that accurate source models can be achieved by both runup inversion and seismic tsunami waveform inversions

22954,the 2016 mw 7 8 kaikoura earthquake and consequent tsunami have been controversial because of uncertainty over whether and where the plate interface ruptured and the incapability of the proposed source models to reproduce the near field runup of 7 m existing models identify a wide range of locations for the interface rupture from on land to offshore and fail to reproduce runup of 7 m near kaikoura to generate the large tsunami peak in kaikoura tide gauge record and the observed runup height offshore seafloor movement is necessary but the offshore extension of the plate interface rupture and its type either seismic rupture or a landslide is uncertain here we propose a submarine landslide in addition to the earthquake source with the landslide delayed 10 20 min after the earthquake rupture the landslide volume is 4 5 5 2 km3 located within 173 7 174 3oe longitude and 42 6 42 15os latitude our proposed dual tsunami source successfully reproduces near field tide gauge records as well as observed near field runup height of 7 m we showed that more accurate source models of earthquakes can be achieved by considering observed runup data through runup inversions in addition to waveform inversions keywords new zealand 2016 kaikoura earthquake submarine landslide tsunami numerical simulations dual tsunami source 1 introduction and background a few years after the november 2016 kaikoura earthquake and tsunami fig 1 a the debate about the source of the earthquake and the characteristics of the resulting tsunami continues the kaikoura earthquake with moment magnitude mw of 7 8 struck on the 13 november 2016 at 11 02 56 utc fig 1a usgs us geological survey it generated a tsunami with maximum runups of up to 7 m lane et al 2017 power et al 2017 a large concentrated coastal runup was observed along a narrow segment of the coast close to kaikoura fig 1c latitude of 42 5os the mainshock s focal mechanism is complicated with oblique thrust faulting initiating strike slip movement followed by both strike slip and thrust faulting duputel and rivera 2017 hollinsworth et al 2017 one commonality of the different proposed source mechanisms duputel and rivera 2017 hollinsworth et al 2017 is the occurrence of reverse faulting at the plate interface major uncertainties however are whether the plate interface ruptured or not and if ruptured whether the plate interface rupture was offshore or on land some models confine the plate interface rupture to on land others extend it offshore and some models lack any plate interface rupture earthquake rupture location has major implications on seismic hazard in the region e g furlong and herman 2017 but also on tsunami generation several source models have been proposed following the kaikoura event but none of them was able to reproduce the large concentrated runup of 7 m observed in kaikoura simulations from two state of the art source models for the kaikoura event generates up to 4 m of runup pink and green lines fig 1c which is much smaller than observations blue circles fig 1c the kaikoura runup case reminds the challenge of the 1998 papua new guinea png tsunami whose observed concentrated runup of 15 m was only reproduced by a combined earthquake and a submarine landslide source okal 1999 tappin et al 2001 synolakis et al 2002 the study by okal and synolakis 2004 revealed that unusually large and concentrated runups are most likely the results of contribution of an additional co seismic landslide source to the tsunami such combined earthquake landslide sources are known as dual tsunami sources dual source earthquake and submarine landslide tsunamis are a poorly understood hazard because there are too few well studied examples the most notable dual events include messina 1908 billi et al 2008 fu et al 2017 makran 1945 heidarzadeh and satake 2017a alaska 1946 okal et al 2002 2003 java 2006 fritz et al 2007 and japan 2011 tappin et al 2014 here we review the source models for the 2016 kaikoura tsunami based on the preliminary results of heidarzadeh and satake 2017b rather than an offshore plate interface rupture we present supporting numerical models for an additional submarine landslide which is able to successfully reproduce the near field observed runup of 7 m the location of the submarine landslide source is determined based on the iterative numerical tsunami modeling of various scenarios of dual earthquake landslide sources the dual source model presented here for the 2016 kaikoura tsunami is the only source model that reproduces both tide gauge records and the observed near field runup heights 2 kaikoura tsunami source models co seismic deformation of the kaikoura earthquake includes rupture of at least 12 major faults hamling et al 2017 the aftershocks are a mix of thrust and strike slip faulting identification of the rupture location varies with the data sets and the methods used for analysis furlong and herman 2017 hamling et al 2017 fig 2 b from geodetic and coastal uplift inversion proposed two tectonic mechanisms one with and one without slip on the plate interface fault both slip models are located mainly on land where the plate interface movement is also located neither reproduces the near field tsunami observation at the kaikoura tide gauge pink lines fig 1b and the observed runup pink lines fig 1c bai et al 2017 based on teleseismic inversion and forward tsunami simulations proposed a three segment offset fault rupture comprising two crustal and one plate interface faults fig 2c these faults are located mainly on land but with a plate interface fault extended 40 km offshore of kaikoura the model by bai et al 2017 successfully reproduced near field tide gauge records but the authors did not investigate if their source model is able to reproduce the near field runup of 7 m heidarzadeh and satake 2017b based on short period waves recorded at local tide gauges proposed an alternative solution to the problem of the source location fig s1 to explain the recorded tsunami they suggested the addition to the earthquake of a submarine landslide the possibility of a submarine landslide is supported by the near field narrow peak tsunami recorded at the kaikoura tide gauge fig 1b support for the landslide hypothesis has been provided by gusman et al 2018 these authors based on the inversion of the recorded tsunami waves identified a tsunami related sea surface disturbance fig 2d they speculated that the disturbance was from either an offshore plate interface rupture or alternatively a submarine landslide although the model by gusman et al 2018 reproduces the kaikoura tide gauge record green lines fig 1b it cannot reproduce the near field runup of 7 m green lines fig 1c although some source models successfully reproduced the kaikoura tide gauge record gusman et al 2018 bai et al 2017 none of them reproduces the near field runup of 7 m fig 1c this has been the major challenge associated with the 2016 kaikoura tsunami spectral analysis of tide gauge data heidarzadeh and satake 2017b showed a dual peak spectrum for the tsunami fig s1 which is unusual for a purely tectonic event and is more suggestive of a confined secondary mechanism such as a submarine landslide a submarine landslide mechanism is also supported by the numerical simulations of heidarzadeh and satake 2017b which based on the purely earthquake source model revealed an energy deficit compared to the tide gauge observations for the short period band of 7 min in this context to explain the observed near field runup of 7 m we examine the possibility of the contribution of a submarine landslide to the 2016 kaikoura tsunami 3 data and methods we used three near field tsunami observations from tide gauges at kaikoura sumner and wellington fig 1 provided by the gns science new zealand and land information new zealand we applied welch algorithm of mathworks 2017 for fourier

kaikoura tsunami a delay in landslide triggering has been found at other dual tsunami source events such as the well documented 13 15 min delay for the landslide part of the 1998 papua new guinea tsunami okal 1999 tappin et al 2001 synolakis et al 2002 heidarzadeh and satake 2015a the occurrence of several medium size magnitude aftershocks m 5 6 within 30 min of the 2016 kaikoura main shock fig 4b supports these as a potential triggering mechanism the plot of nrms misfits for various landslide scenarios fig 6d yields minimum misfits of 1 01 and 1 03 for ls 3 and ls 4 respectively the nrms misfits from our final landslide source scenarios ls 3 and ls 4 in fig 6c are close to that from the inversion based tsunami source model of gusman et al 2018 green line in fig 6c and d from our numerical simulations of the various dual source scenarios we consider the most likely location of the submarine landslide source is at a water depth of 1000 m on the slope of the kaikoura canyon within the area of intense aftershock activity offshore kaikoura ls 3 and ls 4 in fig 6b and circle b in fig 4a based on the numerical results we identify the zone shown by box a in fig 6b longitude 173 7 174 3oe latitude 42 6 42 15os as the most likely landslide zone the dimensions of this landslide source are length 10 km width 10 km and thickness 150 175 m resulting in a slide volume of 4 5 5 2 km3 fig 6c and table 1 the landslide generated waveforms fig 5 b show typical behavior generally expected from confined landslide sources first they are large in the near field i e large amplitudes at kaikoura and rapidly lose amplitude farther from the source region i e small amplitudes in sumner and wellington and second the landslide waveforms contain few large peaks which disappear rapidly as seen in the simulated waveforms at kaikoura fig 5b comparison of observed and simulated runup heights fig 7 supports that a narrow focused landslide source can successfully reproduce the peak tsunami runup of 7 m observed in kaikoura the two purely tectonic sources of hamling et al 2017 and gusman et al 2018 were unable to reproduce such large runup heights in kaiokoura fig 1c fourier analyses of the various waveforms i e observations purely tectonic purely landslide and combined sources are shown in fig 8 as expected landslide generated waves mainly contribute to spectral energy at periods 7 min due to their confined source dimensions the spectral energy for the combined source is noticeably increased at periods 7 min while it is almost same as that of the purely tectonic source for periods 7 min fig 8 such effects are not seen at the wellington station as it is located within a semi enclosed bay where bathymetric features mostly filter the landslide generated short period waves before reaching there heidarzadeh and satake 2017b 6 discussions although the occurrence of a plate interface rupture is likely during the kaikoura event duputel and rivera 2017 hollinsworth et al 2017 the state of the art knowledge on earthquake source process does not allow such a plate interface rupture to be precisely located the plate interface rupture components of hamling et al 2017 and bai et al 2017 are distanced 50 km with the former located fully on land while the latter is partly offshore several authors e g heidarzadeh et al 2016b 2017a b gusman et al 2015 lay et al 2014 have shown that seismic inversions are sensitive to the choice of rupture velocity vr because of this rupture location can vary up to tens of kilometers in addition to large and concentrated runup height of 7 m in kaikoura another patch of concentrated measured runup of 4 m is observed around the latitude of 43 66 os while simulations result in a runup value of 0 5 m fig 7 black line it is possible that another submarine landslide has contributed to the elevated runup here as intensive landslide activities were reported following the kaikoura earthquake with thousands of landslides mapped in post event field surveys such a scenario looks possible we note that based on the modeling results from 18 landslide scenarios fig 3 fig s3 it is clear that the landslide scenario proposed offshore kaikoura ls 3 fig 6c cannot be extended to cover the latitude of 43 66 os because if we expand it the resulting waveforms will not match the observed waveforms fig s3 in other words to reproduce the runup of 4 m around the latitude of 43 66 os another isolated landslide scenario is required with dimensions potentially smaller than our ls 3 therefore two isolated landslide sources will be required to match the observed runup distribution an example for occurrences of several isolated submarine landslides following an earthquake which contributed to elevated runup heights in several locations is the 1956 amorgos greece event okal et al 2009 the elevated runup heights at several locations following the 1956 tsunami were explained by addition of several isolated landslide sources to the tectonic source of the earthquake by okal et al 2009 the novelty of our dual model over published source model e g gusman et al 2018 hamling et al 2017 is that it reproduces the observed runup data whereas other source models failed the other studies are based on the common practice and well established method of seismic tsunami waveform inversions which matches the observed point waveforms using a least square or similar optimization techniques this technique is very strong but it needs a suitable number of observation points to accurately map the earthquake source characteristics especially this method may not result in accurate enough source models if a landslide is involved because landslide generated water waves travel short distances and thus a scattered observation network may miss them and landsides produce almost trivial seismic waves and hence there will be almost no trace of them on the seismic observation network in fact this study highlights the importance of considering observed runup data for earthquake source studies through runup inversions 7 conclusions to explain the large and concentrated runup height of 7 m near kaikoura following the 2016 tsunami we propose a dual submarine landslide earthquake mechanism rather than a previously proposed offshore plate interface rupture our dual tsunami source consists of the earthquake source of hamling et al 2017 and a theoretical landslide source located offshore kaikoura the main findings are 1 notwithstanding the uncertainty over an offshore plate interface rupture and its location a submarine landslide offers a viable alternative by numerical simulations of dual sources the earthquake model of hamling et al 2017 and a submarine landslide we successfully reproduced the near field tsunami tide gauge record in kaikoura as well as the observed runup height of 7 m 2 landslide dimensions and locations are length 10 km width 10 km thickness 150 175 m and location 173 7 174 3oe longitude 42 6 42 15os latitude the volume of the landslide is 4 5 5 2 km3 the landslide source is delayed 10 20 min compared to the earthquake origin time the volume of the landslide agrees to first order with eroded sediment volumes calculated for landslides triggered by the earthquake from before and after field surveys where these are available 3 our dual source proposed here is consistent with tsunami waveforms and field runup data our dual model reproduces the seismic observations too because the earthquake component of the dual source was validated with these data and the landslide component does not produce significant seismic signature on the seismic network the novelty of our dual model over published source model is that it reproduces the field runup data whereas other source models fail 4 this study highlights the importance of considering observed runup data for earthquake tsunami source studies through runup inversions while seismic tsunami waveform inversions are commonly used for earthquake source studies we showed that accurate source models can be achieved by both runup inversion and seismic tsunami waveform inversions
