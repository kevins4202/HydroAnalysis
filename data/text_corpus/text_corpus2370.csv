11850,provision of safe drinking water is critical for human health and survival indicator bacteria i e total coliforms and fecal coliforms are typical indicators of microbial water quality in north carolina nc new private drinking water wells are required for total coliform and e coli testing such wells are typically only tested once before use in nc so consistent and accurate testing is critical herein we analyzed a large data set n 32 839 of water samples collected from private drinking water wells representing 80 of north carolina s 100 counties and analyzed for significant differences in e coli and total coliform positive rates depending on county and region of collection transport method sampling collection point day of week month year season treatment method time elapsed between collection and incubation method used for detection and the personnel reporting sample results our results showed that 34 1 of samples tested positive for total coliform while 1 38 tested positive for e coli the total coliform positive rate ranged from 16 4 to 60 0 among the 80 counties while nine counties reported no positive e coli samples positive e coli rates for the remaining counties ranged from 0 17 to 12 7 samples from the inner coastal plain were more likely to be positive for total coliforms while samples from the outer coastal plain were more likely to be positive for both the e coli and total coliforms delivery method sampling site month year and season of collection treatment type elapsed time between collection and analysis and person reporting sample results were correlated with positive total coliform results similarly sampling point month treatment type test type and the person reporting the results were correlated with positive e coli results these results can be used to prioritize limited public health resources for maximum impact on new private well drinking water safety further providing clear and complete information by the sample collector could improve future research to better inform well water sampling practices graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater microbe sampling north carolina coliform e coli water quality 1 introduction the availability of safe drinking water is one of the most fundamental requirements for human health globally approximately 2 2 billion people consume groundwater daily murphy et al 2017 in the united states more than 41 million people are supplied with water by private wells or small non community non public groundwater systems less than 15 connections serving less than 25 people dieter et al 2018 there is a variety of human pathogens transmitted through drinking water most commonly due to fecal contamination and microbial hazards pose the most widespread risk associated with drinking water world health organization 2017 untreated groundwater consumption is recognized as a significant cause of enteric disease globally with estimates of as many as 59 4 million cases of acute gastroenteritis linked to untreated groundwater murphy et al 2017 meta analysis of outbreaks associated with groundwater consumption spanning 1948 to 2015 found 17 pathogens associated with groundwater outbreaks the most common were norovirus campylobacter spp and shigella spp murphy et al 2017 groundwater use has also been associated with increased likelihood of illnesses in canada germany and ireland uhlmann et al 2009 dangendorf et al 2002 ohaiseadha et al 2017 the number of groundwater users is estimated to exceed two million in north carolina nc which is approximately 24 of the population dieter et al 2018 in nc reliance on private drinking water wells is associated with an elevated risk of gastroenteritis and an increased number of emergency room visits compared to people who consume water from community water systems defelice et al 2016 while many methods are available for evaluating drinking water for potential pathogens coliform bacteria testing is simple and widespread rompré et al 2002 in the united states and canada the term coliform bacteria is applied to bacteria that share certain physiological and biochemical characteristics such as being aerobic or facultative anaerobic and being capable of fermenting lactose at 35 c american public health association and american water works association 2018 fecal coliform bacteria belong to a thermotolerant subgroup of coliform bacteria that ferment lactose at 44 c and are a subset of total coliforms coliform bacteria are widely used as an indicator of potential microbial contamination in water supplies and distribution systems rompré et al 2002 the united states environmental protection agency usepa establishes the maximum contaminant levels mcls for contaminants in the public drinking water systems which are then enforced by state public drinking water agencies npdwr 2012 a state may adopt more stringent water quality standards but cannot adopt standards less stringent than federal mcls the usepa considers coliform bacteria to be a useful indicator for potential pathogens and public water supply systems are required to routinely collect bacteriological water samples to test for coliform bacteria with large public water supply systems requiring hundreds of routine samples per month usepa 2010 2017 these requirements are set forth in the total coliform rule which also requires water system operators to notify regulatory authorities and water system customers when multiple coliform positive sample results occur national primary drinking water regulations 2013 beginning july 1 2008 coliform sampling was also required for all private drinking wells constructed in nc pdwws 2008 private drinking water wells serve 14 or fewer connections or that serve or proposed to serve 24 or fewer individuals ncwca 2015 thus new private drinking water wells are wells constructed after july 1 2008 that are intended to serve fewer than 15 connections or 25 people coliform water sampling results are typically reported as binary outcome present or absent if a sample is positive for total coliform it is then analyzed for escherichia coli a species of fecal coliform bacteria sample results are then reported to the well owner or lessee along with information concerning potential health effects remediation options and or resampling recommendations as required by nc private drinking water well sampling rules pdwws 2008 unlike the multiple samples required for public water supplies the initial bacteriological water quality of a private drinking water well in nc is often judged based on a single bacteriological sample as only one sample is required by nc private drinking water well sampling rules pdwws 2008 previous water quality studies have used logistic regression to predict the presence of contaminants in groundwater in long island new york eckhardt and stackelberg 1995 the study compared land usage categories population density unsaturated zone thickness and specific conductance of well water to predict the presence of boron volatile organic chemicals nitrate and insecticides the authors found that population density and land use were predictive for all contaminants of interest logistic regression was also used to predict the presence of several groundwater contaminants in hawaii based on current or former agricultural land use mair and el kadi 2013 likewise scheili et al 2016 used logistic regression to determine that the absorption of 254 nm uv light in incoming water and 15 day average air temperature were useful in predicting water quality in a small canadian community water system scheili et al 2016 hynds et al 2012 used logistic regression to create a susceptibility model for predicting the presence of fecal coliform bacteria in private wells in ireland approximately 55 variables were assessed for each of 262 wells and each well was sampled for fecal coliform bacteria tests chi square mann whitney u and independent samples t were performed on each of the measured variables to determine if the variable had a significant correlation with the presence of bacteria of the measured variables 12 were found to be significant hierarchical logistic regression was then employed to assess the magnitude of each variable the authors found four key categories of variables in building their model the first category was well construction casing height above grade well cover ground condition around well and wellhead grout and casing conditions second was the distance to septic tanks and the elevation of the septic tank compared to the well up gradient down gradient or level third was bedrock type and subsoil depth the fourth category was the amount of precipitation in the 120 h preceding sampling the model developed was able to predict the outcome of water sampling with a 80 accuracy in a validation group of 51 wells correlating bacteriological water sampling results with water treatment type could better inform sampling collection point selection depending upon the difference between pretreatment and post treatment positive rates another controllable factor is the time delay between collection and sample processing delays between sample collection and incubation may cause significant changes in bacterial density aulenbach 2010 some less controllable factors may also influence coliform water sample results such as season when the sample is collected procopio et al 2017 geology and land use pattern may also contribute to water quality differences between the regions embrey and runkle 2006 eckhardt and stackelberg 1995 findings from studies assessing these and other factors can be used to target public health interventions in areas with higher incidences of coliform and or e coli positive water samples such interventions would include verifying proper disinfection of newly drilled wells verifying disinfection after submersible pump installation and justification for increased drinking water quality monitoring in private wells among others the main objective of this study was to examine the potential factors impacting bacteriological sample results for new private drinking water wells in the state of nc focusing on differences in the positive total coliform and or e coli results based on selected parameters we also compared the total coliform and e coli positive rates of new private wells in nc to the rates in other states specifically we examined the dataset for significant differences between sample positive rates for e coli and or total coliform depending on the county and region of collection transport method sampling collection point day of the week month year season treatment method the time elapsed between collection and incubation the test used for detection and the person reporting the sample results best practices derived from this study could guide determination of sample collection practices or sampling locations that may impact sample results which would reduce the financial burden and workload from follow up well disinfection and additional sampling 2 methods mandated sample analysis for private drinking water wells in nc typically occurs at either the north carolina state laboratory of public health ncslph the local health department health district laboratory or other laboratories certified by the ncslph bacteriological water sample results were obtained from the ncslph for 90 counties in nc data were available for samples received by the ncslph between july 1 2009 and december 31 2019 a total of 96 517 water samples results were recorded these results included the following information name of well owner location of well date and time of sample collection date and time of sample is received at the ncslph sample number county of origin sample collector s name sample collection point type of water treatment if any presence absence of total coliform bacteria presence absence of e coli and sample analyst s name for each sample collected the results are made available by the ncslph in the pdf format these pdf files are obtainable from the ncslph environmental lab results portal based on the county from which the sample originated ncslph 2019b sample was excluded from analysis if the sample was not a coliform presence absence sample if the sample source was blank if the sample source was anything other than new well if the sample was a duplicate based on sample number or if there was any other issue with the sample that prevented testing such as the sample being too old 30 h when it arrived at the ncslph usepa 2014 63 678 samples were excluded from consideration due to these criteria leaving 32 839 samples that met inclusion criteria representing 80 of nc s 100 counties we analyzed this large data set for correlation between water sampling outcomes and individual sample data location sampling point etc available from the ncslph descriptive statistics for the state as a whole and each county and region were calculated the chi square test was used to determine the significance of county region sampling point day of the week month year season testing method and person reporting the test results fisher s exact test was used when 20 of the expected outcomes had counts of five or less these variables were delivery method and treatment method stepwise logistic regression was used to model the impact of each independent variable singularly on the presence of total coliform and e coli sample collection points were categorized as well head other outside tap inside tap other and unknown well head means the sampling tap at the well head required by north carolina well construction standards et al 2019 other outside tap means a hose bibb or other sample site that was not identifiable as the wellhead sampling tap inside tap was used for collection points in a building s interior e g kitchen sink bathroom sink other designates a sample collection point that does not fit into the previous three categories while unknown was used for samples with no defined sampling point for testing the impact of the elapsed time between collection and sample receipt on the likelihood of total coliform or e coli positive results the number of hours from sample collection to sample receipt was rounded to the nearest hour the wald test was used to determine statistical significance of the independent variables because water quality standards rely on whether water exceeded the maximum contaminant level mcl the binary prediction by logistic regression is frequently used in studies of water quality helsel and hirsch 1992 similar to hynds et al 2012 logistic regression is used in this study to examine the data collected from the ncslph a stepwise variable selection approach was employed to select the variables for the final model statistical significance was established at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted using jmp pro 14 sas institute inc 2018 while stepwise logistic regression was performed using r r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 chi square and fisher s exact test for single variables of the 32 839 samples that met the inclusion criteria 11 202 34 11 were positive for total coliform while 454 1 38 were positive for e coli for counties the total coliform positive rate ranged from 16 4 hertford county to 60 bertie county while nine counties reported no positive e coli samples alexander alleghany anson davidson graham harnett robeson swain and warren counties positive e coli rates for the remaining counties ranged from 0 17 franklin county to 12 7 bertie county table 1 fig 1 likelihood of total and e coli positives differed significantly between counties p 0 0001 table 2 other factors correlated with total and e coli sampling results physiographic regions differed p 0 0001 with samples from the inner and outer coastal plains being more likely to be positive for total coliforms 39 1 and 47 5 respectively than samples from the blue ridge 31 7 total coliform positive and piedmont 31 0 total coliform positive regions samples from outer coastal plains were also more likely to be positive for e coli 2 9 positive than samples from the inner coastal plains 1 4 positive blue ridge 1 3 positive and piedmont 1 2 positive regions table 3 fig 2 delivery method also had a significant effect on total coliform sample results p 0 0001 with samples hand delivered and delivered via nc courier having lower total coliform positive rates 33 4 and 21

and fecal coliform positive rates sample collection during the period june through november was associated with increased likelihood p 0 0001 of total coliform positive 34 9 39 7 total coliform

coli positive fig 4 positive total coliform and e coli results also differed significantly p 0 0001 between year of collection with total coliform positives ranging from 41 5 in 2009 to a low of 30 8 in 2016 fig 5 for positive e coli sampling the range was from 1 9 in 2013 to a low of 1 0 in 2016 fig 5 samples collected in the fall and summer were more likely to be positive for total coliforms 37 5 and 38 3 respectively while only samples collected in the summer were more susceptible to e coli positives 2 0 table 6 treatment type affected both total coliform and e coli sampling outcomes samples from systems that were chlorinated 38 2 or softened 60 0 were more likely to be positive for total coliforms than samples from systems that were filtered 33 3 or had other treatment types 20 0 samples without a specified treatment method were more likely to be positive for e coli 1 4 than samples that had a known treatment method as no treated e coli positive samples were observed table 7 the amount of time that elapsed between sample collection and sample reception also influenced total coliform sampling outcomes for time blocks that had more than 30 total samples 16 h 28 h total coliform positive rates ranged from 31 4 16 h to 43 4 27 h in general there was an inverse linear relationship between elapsed time and total coliform positive rates for these samples p 0 0148 r 2 0 0001 table 8 fig 6 similar correlation was not observed for e coli results p 0 4492 no significant difference was observed between types of detection test and total coliform and e coli positive rates table 9 a significant difference was observed for total coliform and e coli positive rates based upon the person reporting the results p 0 0001 these rates ranged from 29 5 to 37 5 for total coliform samples and 0 2 4 for e coli samples table 10 3 2 stepwise logistic regression modeling stepwise logistic regression showed that physiographic region p 0 02 and month of collection p 0 01 were associated with total coliform in new private well water however the results showed only month of collection associated with positive e coli samples 4 discussion overall the total coliform positivity rate for samples in this study 34 1 was comparable to the national rate of 34 reported by desimone and hamilton 2009 for existing wells and slightly higher than 29 2 of existing wake county nc private wells that were total coliform positive stillo and macdonald gibson 2017 the e coli positivity rate for samples in this study 1 41 was much less than the 7 9 nationwide rate n 397 reported by desimone and hamilton 2009 and the 6 43 positivity rate from 171 samples from 57 wells reported by stillo and macdonald gibson 2017 as a whole the bacteriological water quality from the new private water wells examined in this study was better than results reported from all states bordering nc with nc having lower rates of both total and e coli positive samples than georgia south carolina tennessee and virginia table 1 the increased rate of total coliform positive samples in the inner coastal plain region and the increased rate of both total coliform and e coli positive samples in the outer coastal plain region are expected given that the coastal plain of nc is typified by sandier soils with greater hydraulic conductivities than the piedmont and blue ridge regions eimers et al 2001 coastal plain aquifers are potentially more vulnerable to pollution since sandy soils infiltrate groundwater more rapidly relative to the clayey soils like those found in central and western nc eimers et al 2001 the relatively low total coliform and e coli rates observed in the blue ridge region were unexpected given that aquifers in this region may also be vulnerable to rapid groundwater movement through fractured rocks wells constructed in such aquifers may be associated with higher rates of total coliforms embrey and runkle 2006 well construction practices vary between the blue ridge and inner and outer coastal plains regions which may be responsible for some of this variation of the 20 counties with the highest rates of positive total coliform samples 45 60 18 were in the inner coastal or outer coastal plains the likelihood of e coli positivity was also higher for counties in the inner and outer coastal plains of the 20 counties highest in e coli positivity rate 13 were in the inner and outer coastal plains the data collected in this research would have greatly benefited from the inclusion of exact location information i e latitude and longitude for each sample unfortunately while there is space on the bacteriological water sample submission form for latitude and longitude it is rarely provided with only 18 7 of samples having any information in this field documentation of well latitude and longitude by the sample collector would allow researchers to better determine which aquifers lie under each well and to better map areas of particularly poor water quality precipitation increases opportunities for groundwater contamination in several ways flooding resuspends fecal bacteria stored in stream sediment and increases the concentration of e coli in stream water muirhead et al 2004 this precipitation induced mobility of microbial contaminants coupled with rapid movement of surface water to groundwater and increased movement of potentially contaminated subsurface water could influence the risk of microbial contamination even properly constructed wells i e adequately cased grouted and sealed with a sanitary seal can be vulnerable to the contaminated surface waters as borchardt et al 2004 procopio et al 2017 found that the presence of both total coliforms and fecal coliforms in domestic water wells sampled for real estate transactions could be reliably predicted based on the timing and amount of precipitation preceding sampling for example one or more days of precipitation in the 30 days preceding sample collection increased the likelihood of collecting samples that were positive for total coliform and samples that were positive for fecal coliform procopio et al 2017 observed that the mean total coliform positive rate for domestic wells with no recorded precipitation in the 30 days preceding sampling was 19 5 9 2 sd while the rate for wells receiving the most precipitation in the preceding 30 days 54 01 377 5 mm was 25 4 0 9 sd increased positivity rate was also observed for fecal coliforms from domestic wells with no precipitation and maximum precipitation 4 0 2 2 sd and 5 6 0 4 sd respectively given the impact of precipitation described in prior research procopio et al 2017 it is to be expected that the probability of collecting total coliform and e coli positive samples varies between months and seasons according to 2009 2019 raleigh area climate data national weather service forecast office 2020 the months of april to september averaged more rainfall than october to march for both total coliform and e coli positivity rates samples collected during the period june to november are more likely to be positive than samples collected december to may this is notable for two reasons first there is a significant overlap four months out of six between months with above average precipitation and above average rates of total coliform and e coli positive water samples second visual representation of these data makes it apparent that there is a two to three month offset between the months with the most precipitation and the months with both the highest total coliform positive rates and the highest e coli positive rates fig 4 this observation is consistent with curriero et al 2001 that groundwater outbreaks lagged behind precipitation events by two months seasonal observations matched those of procopio et al 2017 samples collected during the summer were more likely to be positive for e coli while total coliform positives occurred more often during the summer and fall as with the other results discussed above a more granular regional or county based examination of these data both bacteriological and meteorological would be a logical next step for research delivery method was found to have an impact on total and e coli sampling outcomes delivery method is not a factor directly examined in the literature that has informed this research however there are plausible reasons that delivery method could influence sample results some methods of transport are climate controlled while others such as ups often are not in contrast the nc courier service is used for mail and parcels between state agencies city local and county governments across nc ncdoa n d and transported via climate controlled vehicles given that the usepa recommends temperature control 0 10 c for drinking water samples usepa 2016 it is possible that the temperature control in handling might account for the observed difference another possible explanation for this observation is that the method of transport is not distributed randomly between counties and counties using non nc courier service means of transport may have other factors that influence water sampling outcomes some counties rely on the nc courier service to transport water samples while other health departments employ package delivery companies because the nc courier service schedule is not convenient to their environmental health program for counties close to the state lab sample collectors may opt to hand deliver critical samples for previously positive wells additionally 84 8 n 27 853 of the samples in the dataset did not have a specified method of transport taking steps to ensure that this information is provided for all samples sent to the ncslph will help determine if transportation method plays a role in bacteriological results independent of factors like county or region of origin samples collected from outside taps at a location other than the wellhead and samples collected from taps inside the home were less likely to be positive for total coliform this observation was unexpected the thread less sample tap at the wellhead is the default sampling point preferred by the rules concerning sampling of new private drinking water wells pdwws 2008 but the somewhat increased likelihood of total coliforms from these sampling sites may bear future investigation this is complicated by the fact that samples from the wellhead are less likely to be positive for fecal coliform one potential explanation for this observation is that the wellhead sample taps are rarely used and may not be adequately flushed or disinfected before sampling despite guidance to do so research has shown that point of use samples can have higher rates of contamination that the groundwater itself saha et al 2019 again future research would benefit from focusing on the differences between samples collected within the same county or region to control for county or regional collection practices additionally standardizing nomenclature for describing sample collection points would reduce uncertainty for future analyses as is this information is simply fill in the blank with no suggested format or level of detail the analysis of water sample results on an annual basis reveals that the years 2009 2013 are five of the six years with the highest rates of positive total coliform results the remaining year is 2017 mandatory well permitting and inspection was instituted for all new private drinking water wells constructed after july 1 2008 permitting and inspection of private drinking water wells 2019 only one year before the data used in this research the observed improvement in total coliform rates over time could represent continuing improvement in new well construction practices grouting disinfection etc in nc a similar trend was not apparent for e coli results explaining why total coliform positivity probability decreased over time while e coli detection did not would be an interesting direction for future research again uncertainty could be reduced by examining these observations on a county by county or regional basis similar to data about method of transport treatment method was largely not disclosed for the sample data used in this research 99 8 of samples did not have a specified treatment method taking steps to gather this information for all samples submitted to the ncslph will increase research avenues into this aspect of private drinking water well sampling one easy step to assist with gathering this information would be to give sample collectors the option of none when submitting water sample collection information this would potentially reduce the frequency of the treatment type information being simply left blank it is interesting that samples with an unspecified treatment system were less likely to be positive for total coliform 34 1 than wells with chlorination systems 38 2 this could be attributed to wells requiring continuous chlorinators because of previously positive total and or fecal water samples as follow up samples of a new well may be recorded as new well samples the observed increased positivity rate may be an indication of an improperly functioning or ineffective chlorinator future research into this area would depend upon improving the treatment information currently being submitted to the ncslph the inverse relationship between transit time and probability of total coliform positive conforms with long established knowledge concerning the effects of holding time on coliform populations mcdaniels and bordner 1983 which is the basis of the 30 h maximum hold time set forth in the rtcr 2013 and employed by the ncslph some studies have found that the impact of hold time on e coli concentrations is similar to the impact on total coliform concentrations aulenbach 2010 but this was not supported by our data additional examination of these data could again seek to minimize the influence of county and region by analyzing samples on a county or regional basis the person collecting reading and or reporting the water samples could also impact the results reported sample collection protocols could vary between sample collectors which may affect contamination potential the color comparison process used for determining whether a sample is positive for total coliform bacteria is subjective requiring the tester to determine if the yellow of the sample is yellow equal to or greater than the comparator idexx laboratories and inc 2019 the process for e coli determination uses fluorescent comparator which is also an inherently subjective process it is natural and expected that there would be variation between readers in determining the color or fluorescence of a sample this study revealed significant water quality differences between counties and regions this information can be used to target public health interventions in counties or regions with higher incidences of coliform and or e coli positive water samples such as verifying proper disinfection of newly drilled wells verifying disinfection after submersible pump installation and justification for increased drinking water quality monitoring in private wells although region and precipitation are uncontrollable we recommend that the counties within regions that have higher rates of tc ec positives should work on mitigation measures such as more frequent testing free testing education of the public on the importance of water sampling and programs to assist with the installation costs of disinfection systems 5 conclusions the bacteriological water quality of nc s new private drinking water wells compares favorably to other states in the region table 11 however water quality across the state is highly variable with wells in the inner and outer coastal plains being particularly prone to bacteriological contamination in addition to well location county and region analysis of the water sample results gathered from the ncslph showed that several factors influence water sample outcomes transport method sample collection site month year season treatment method transit time and reporter however many of these factors are outside the control of the sample collector or their environmental health program the initial goal of this research was to develop best practices for sample collectors but it was imprudent to attempt to ascertain this from samples across the state as variations between the hundreds of sample collectors represented in this dataset was difficult to analyze due the number of other variables in many ways future research would benefit from examining variation at the county level which would reduce the interference from extrinsic factors the only factor easily controlled by environmental health practitioners is sample collection point but no single sampling point stood out as the preferred collection point the one overarching issue observed in this study that is controllable by the sample collector is the frequent lack of information provided to the ncslph many of the variables we investigated suffered from a less than desirable number of observations such as transport method and treatment type future efforts should be made to collect detailed information for all variables reported to the ncslph additionally collection of latitude and longitude information was infrequent though this information could lead to better understanding of geospatial impacts on sampling outcomes finally the lack of a standardized nomenclature for sample site reduced the usefulness of this information by providing clear and complete information for each sample collected the sample collector can improve future research into water sampling outcomes credit author

11850,provision of safe drinking water is critical for human health and survival indicator bacteria i e total coliforms and fecal coliforms are typical indicators of microbial water quality in north carolina nc new private drinking water wells are required for total coliform and e coli testing such wells are typically only tested once before use in nc so consistent and accurate testing is critical herein we analyzed a large data set n 32 839 of water samples collected from private drinking water wells representing 80 of north carolina s 100 counties and analyzed for significant differences in e coli and total coliform positive rates depending on county and region of collection transport method sampling collection point day of week month year season treatment method time elapsed between collection and incubation method used for detection and the personnel reporting sample results our results showed that 34 1 of samples tested positive for total coliform while 1 38 tested positive for e coli the total coliform positive rate ranged from 16 4 to 60 0 among the 80 counties while nine counties reported no positive e coli samples positive e coli rates for the remaining counties ranged from 0 17 to 12 7 samples from the inner coastal plain were more likely to be positive for total coliforms while samples from the outer coastal plain were more likely to be positive for both the e coli and total coliforms delivery method sampling site month year and season of collection treatment type elapsed time between collection and analysis and person reporting sample results were correlated with positive total coliform results similarly sampling point month treatment type test type and the person reporting the results were correlated with positive e coli results these results can be used to prioritize limited public health resources for maximum impact on new private well drinking water safety further providing clear and complete information by the

stringent than federal mcls the usepa considers coliform bacteria to be a useful indicator for potential pathogens and public water supply systems are required to routinely collect bacteriological water samples to test for coliform bacteria with large public water supply systems requiring hundreds of routine samples per month usepa 2010 2017 these requirements are set forth in the total coliform rule which also requires water system operators to notify regulatory authorities and water system customers when multiple coliform positive sample results occur national primary drinking water regulations 2013 beginning july 1 2008 coliform sampling was also required for all private drinking wells constructed in nc pdwws 2008 private drinking water wells serve 14 or fewer connections or that serve or proposed to serve 24 or fewer individuals ncwca 2015 thus new private drinking water wells are wells constructed after july 1 2008 that are intended to serve fewer than 15 connections or 25 people coliform water sampling results are typically reported as binary outcome present or absent if a sample is positive for total coliform it is then analyzed for escherichia coli a species of fecal coliform bacteria sample results are then reported to the well owner or lessee along with information concerning potential health effects remediation options and or resampling recommendations as required by nc private drinking water well sampling rules pdwws 2008 unlike the multiple samples required for public water supplies the initial bacteriological water quality of a private drinking water well in nc is often judged based on a single bacteriological sample as only one sample is required by nc private drinking water well sampling rules pdwws 2008 previous water quality studies have used logistic regression to predict the presence of contaminants in groundwater in long island new york eckhardt and stackelberg 1995 the study compared land usage categories population density unsaturated zone thickness and specific conductance of well water to predict the presence of boron volatile organic chemicals nitrate and insecticides the authors found that population density and land use were predictive for all contaminants of interest logistic regression was also used to predict the presence of several groundwater contaminants in hawaii based on current or former agricultural land use mair and el kadi 2013 likewise scheili et al 2016 used logistic regression to determine that the absorption of 254 nm uv light in incoming water and 15 day average air temperature were useful in predicting water quality in a small canadian community water system scheili et al 2016 hynds et al 2012 used logistic regression to create a susceptibility model for predicting the presence of fecal coliform bacteria in private wells in ireland approximately 55 variables were assessed for each of 262 wells and each well was sampled for fecal coliform bacteria tests chi square mann whitney u and independent samples t were performed on each of the measured variables to determine if the variable had a significant correlation with the presence of bacteria of the measured variables 12 were found to be significant hierarchical logistic regression was then employed to assess the magnitude of each variable the authors found four key categories of variables in building their model the first category was well construction casing height above grade well cover ground condition around well and wellhead grout and casing conditions second was the distance to septic tanks and the elevation of the septic tank compared to the well up gradient down gradient or level third was bedrock type and subsoil depth the fourth category was the amount of precipitation in the 120 h preceding sampling the model developed was able to predict the outcome of water sampling with a 80 accuracy in a validation group of 51 wells correlating bacteriological water sampling results with water treatment type could better inform sampling collection point selection depending upon the difference between pretreatment and post treatment positive rates another controllable factor is the time delay between collection and sample processing delays between sample collection and incubation may cause significant changes in bacterial density aulenbach 2010 some less controllable factors may also influence coliform water sample results such as season when the sample is collected procopio et al 2017 geology and land use pattern may also contribute to water quality differences between the regions embrey and runkle 2006 eckhardt and stackelberg 1995 findings from studies assessing these and other factors can be used to target public health interventions in areas with higher incidences of coliform and or e coli positive water samples such interventions would include verifying proper disinfection of newly drilled wells verifying disinfection after submersible pump installation and justification for increased drinking water quality monitoring in private wells among others the main objective of this study was to examine the potential factors impacting bacteriological sample results for new private drinking water wells in the state of nc focusing on differences in the positive total coliform and or e coli results based on selected parameters we also compared the total coliform and e coli positive rates of new private wells in nc to the rates in other states specifically we examined the dataset for significant differences between sample positive rates for e coli and or total coliform depending on the county and region of collection transport method sampling collection point day of the week month year season treatment method the time elapsed between collection and incubation the test used for detection and the person reporting the sample results best practices derived from this study could guide determination of sample collection practices or sampling locations that may impact sample results which would reduce the financial burden and workload from follow up well disinfection and additional sampling 2 methods mandated sample analysis for private drinking water wells in nc typically occurs at either the north carolina state laboratory of public health ncslph the local health department health district laboratory or other laboratories certified by the ncslph bacteriological water sample results were obtained from the ncslph for 90 counties in nc data were available for samples received by the ncslph between july 1 2009 and december 31 2019 a total of 96 517 water samples results were recorded these results included the following information name of well owner location of well date and time of sample collection date and time of sample is received at the ncslph sample number county of origin sample collector s name sample collection point type of water treatment if any presence absence of total coliform bacteria presence absence of e coli and sample analyst s name for each sample collected the results are made available by the ncslph in the pdf format these pdf files are obtainable from the ncslph environmental lab results portal based on the county from which the sample originated ncslph 2019b sample was excluded from analysis if the sample was not a coliform presence absence sample if the sample source was blank if the sample source was anything other than new well if the sample was a duplicate based on sample number or if there was any other issue with the sample that prevented testing such as the sample being too old 30 h when it arrived at the ncslph usepa 2014 63 678 samples were excluded from consideration due to these criteria leaving 32 839 samples that met inclusion criteria representing 80 of nc s 100 counties we analyzed this large data set for correlation between water sampling outcomes and individual sample data location sampling point etc available from the ncslph descriptive statistics for the state as a whole and each county and region were calculated the chi square test was used to determine the significance of county region sampling point day of the week month year season testing method and person reporting the test results fisher s exact test was used when 20 of the expected outcomes had counts of five or less these variables were delivery method and treatment method stepwise logistic regression was used to model the impact of each independent variable singularly on the presence of total coliform and e coli sample collection points were categorized as well head other outside tap inside tap other and unknown well head means the sampling tap at the well head required by north carolina well construction standards et al 2019 other outside tap means a hose bibb or other sample site that was not identifiable as the wellhead sampling tap inside tap was used for collection points in a building s interior e g kitchen sink bathroom sink other designates a sample collection point that does not fit into the previous three categories while unknown was used for samples with no defined sampling point for testing the impact of the elapsed time between collection and sample receipt on the likelihood of total coliform or e coli positive results the number of hours from sample collection to sample receipt was rounded to the nearest hour the wald test was used to determine statistical significance of the independent variables because water quality standards rely on whether water exceeded the maximum contaminant level mcl the binary prediction by logistic regression is frequently used in studies of water quality helsel and hirsch 1992 similar to hynds et al 2012 logistic regression is used in this study to examine the data collected from the ncslph a stepwise variable selection approach was employed to select the variables for the final model statistical significance was established at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted using jmp pro 14 sas institute inc 2018 while stepwise logistic regression was performed using r r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 chi square and fisher s exact test for single variables of the 32 839 samples that met the inclusion criteria 11 202 34 11 were positive for total coliform while 454 1 38 were positive for e coli for counties the total coliform positive rate ranged from 16 4 hertford county to 60 bertie county while nine counties reported no positive e coli samples alexander alleghany anson davidson graham harnett robeson swain and warren counties positive e coli rates for the remaining counties ranged from 0 17 franklin county to 12 7 bertie county table 1 fig 1 likelihood of total and e coli positives differed significantly between counties p 0 0001 table 2 other factors correlated with total and e coli sampling results physiographic regions differed p 0 0001 with samples from the inner and outer coastal plains being more likely to be positive for total coliforms 39 1 and 47 5 respectively than samples from the blue ridge 31 7 total coliform positive and piedmont 31 0 total coliform positive regions samples from outer coastal plains were also more likely to be positive for e coli 2 9 positive than samples from the inner coastal plains 1 4 positive blue ridge 1 3 positive and piedmont 1 2 positive regions table 3 fig 2 delivery method also had a significant effect on total coliform sample results p 0 0001 with samples hand delivered and delivered via nc courier having lower total coliform positive rates 33 4 and 21

and fecal coliform positive rates sample collection during the period june through november was associated with increased likelihood p 0 0001 of total coliform positive 34 9 39 7 total coliform

in 2016 fig 5 for positive e coli sampling the range was from 1 9 in 2013 to a low of 1 0 in 2016 fig 5 samples collected in the fall and summer were more likely to be positive for total coliforms 37 5 and 38 3 respectively while only samples collected in the summer were more susceptible to e coli positives 2 0 table 6 treatment type affected both total coliform and e coli sampling outcomes samples from systems that were chlorinated 38 2 or softened 60 0 were more likely to be positive for total coliforms than samples from systems that were filtered 33 3 or had other treatment types 20 0 samples without a specified treatment method were more likely to be positive for e coli 1 4 than samples that had a known treatment method as no treated e coli positive samples were observed table 7 the amount of time that elapsed between sample collection and sample reception also influenced total coliform sampling outcomes for time blocks that had more than 30 total samples 16 h 28 h total coliform positive rates ranged from 31 4 16 h to 43 4 27 h in general there was an inverse linear relationship between elapsed time and total coliform positive rates for these samples p 0 0148 r 2 0 0001 table 8 fig 6 similar correlation was not observed for e coli results p 0 4492 no significant difference was observed between types of detection test and total coliform and e coli positive rates table 9 a significant difference was observed for total coliform and e coli positive rates based upon the person reporting the results p 0 0001 these rates ranged from 29 5 to 37 5 for total coliform samples and 0 2 4 for e coli samples table 10 3 2 stepwise logistic regression modeling stepwise logistic regression showed that physiographic region p 0 02 and month of collection p 0 01 were associated with total coliform in new private well water however the results showed only month of collection associated with positive e coli samples 4 discussion overall the total coliform positivity rate for samples in this study 34 1 was comparable to the national rate of 34 reported by desimone and hamilton 2009 for existing wells and slightly higher than 29 2 of existing wake county nc private wells that were total coliform positive stillo and macdonald gibson 2017 the e coli positivity rate for samples in this study 1 41 was much less than the 7 9 nationwide rate n 397 reported by desimone and hamilton 2009 and the 6 43 positivity rate from 171 samples from 57 wells reported by stillo and macdonald gibson 2017 as a whole the bacteriological water quality from the new private water wells examined in this study was better than results reported from all states bordering nc with nc having lower rates of both total and e coli positive samples than georgia south carolina tennessee and virginia table 1 the increased rate of total coliform positive samples in the inner coastal plain region and the increased rate of both total coliform and e coli positive samples in the outer coastal plain region are expected given that the coastal plain of nc is typified by sandier soils with greater hydraulic conductivities than the piedmont and blue ridge regions eimers et al 2001 coastal plain aquifers are potentially more vulnerable to pollution since sandy soils infiltrate groundwater more rapidly relative to the clayey soils like those found in central and western nc eimers et al 2001 the relatively low total coliform and e coli rates observed in the blue ridge region were unexpected given that aquifers in this region may also be vulnerable to rapid groundwater movement through fractured rocks wells constructed in such aquifers may be associated with higher rates of total coliforms embrey and runkle 2006 well construction practices vary between the blue ridge and inner and outer coastal plains regions which may be responsible for some of this variation of the 20 counties with the highest rates of positive total coliform samples 45 60 18 were in the inner coastal or outer coastal plains the likelihood of e coli positivity was also higher for counties in the inner and outer coastal plains of the 20 counties highest in e coli positivity rate 13 were in the inner and outer coastal plains the data collected in this research would have greatly benefited from the inclusion of exact location information i e latitude and longitude for each sample unfortunately while there is space on the bacteriological water sample submission form for latitude and longitude it is rarely provided with only 18 7 of samples having any information in this field documentation of well latitude and longitude by the sample collector would allow researchers to better determine which aquifers lie under each well and to better map areas of particularly poor water quality precipitation increases opportunities for groundwater contamination in several ways flooding resuspends fecal bacteria stored in stream sediment and increases the concentration of e coli in stream water muirhead et al 2004 this precipitation induced mobility of microbial contaminants coupled with rapid movement of surface water to groundwater and increased movement of potentially contaminated subsurface water could influence the risk of microbial contamination even properly constructed wells i e adequately cased grouted and sealed with a sanitary seal can be vulnerable to the contaminated surface waters as borchardt et al 2004 procopio et al 2017 found that the presence of both total coliforms and fecal coliforms in domestic water wells sampled for real estate transactions could be reliably predicted based on the timing and amount of precipitation preceding sampling for example one or more days of precipitation in the 30 days preceding sample collection increased the likelihood of collecting samples that were positive for total coliform and samples that were positive for fecal coliform procopio et al 2017 observed that the mean total coliform positive rate for domestic wells with no recorded precipitation in the 30 days preceding sampling was 19 5 9 2 sd while the rate for wells receiving the most precipitation in the preceding 30 days 54 01 377 5 mm was 25 4 0 9 sd increased positivity rate was also observed for fecal coliforms from domestic wells with no precipitation and maximum precipitation 4 0 2 2 sd and 5 6 0 4 sd respectively given the impact of precipitation described in prior research procopio et al 2017 it is to be expected that the probability of collecting total coliform and e coli positive samples varies between months and seasons according to 2009 2019 raleigh area climate data national weather service forecast office 2020 the months of april to september averaged more rainfall than october to march for both total coliform and e coli positivity rates samples collected during the period june to november are more likely to be positive than samples collected december to may this is notable for two reasons first there is a significant overlap four months out of six between months with above average precipitation and above average rates of total coliform and e coli positive water samples second visual representation of these data makes it apparent that there is a two to three month offset between the months with the most precipitation and the months with both the highest total coliform positive rates and the highest e coli positive rates fig 4 this observation is consistent with curriero et al 2001 that groundwater outbreaks lagged behind precipitation events by two months seasonal observations matched those of procopio et al 2017 samples collected during the summer were more likely to be positive for e coli while total coliform positives occurred more often during the summer and fall as with the other results discussed above a more granular regional or county based examination of these data both bacteriological and meteorological would be a logical next step for research delivery method was found to have an impact on total and e coli sampling outcomes delivery method is not a factor directly examined in the literature that has informed this research however there are plausible reasons that delivery method could influence sample results some methods of transport are climate controlled while others such as ups often are not in contrast the nc courier service is used for mail and parcels between state agencies city local and county governments across nc ncdoa n d and transported via climate controlled vehicles given that the usepa recommends temperature control 0 10 c for drinking water samples usepa 2016 it is possible that the temperature control in handling might account for the observed difference another possible explanation for this observation is that the method of transport is not distributed randomly between counties and counties using non nc courier service means of transport may have other factors that influence water sampling outcomes some counties rely on the nc courier service to transport water samples while other health departments employ package delivery companies because the nc courier service schedule is not convenient to their environmental health program for counties close to the state lab sample collectors may opt to hand deliver critical samples for previously positive wells additionally 84 8 n 27 853 of the samples in the dataset did not have a specified method of transport taking steps to ensure that this information is provided for all samples sent to the ncslph will help determine if transportation method plays a role in bacteriological results independent of factors like county or region of origin samples collected from outside taps at a location other than the wellhead and samples collected from taps inside the home were less likely to be positive for total coliform this observation was unexpected the thread less sample tap at the wellhead is the default sampling point preferred by the rules concerning sampling of new private drinking water wells pdwws 2008 but the somewhat increased likelihood of total coliforms from these sampling sites may bear future investigation this is complicated by the fact that samples from the wellhead are less likely to be positive for fecal coliform one potential explanation for this observation is that the wellhead sample taps are rarely used and may not be adequately flushed or disinfected before sampling despite guidance to do so research has shown that point of use samples can have higher rates of contamination that the groundwater itself saha et al 2019 again future research would benefit from focusing on the differences between samples collected within the same county or region to control for county or regional collection practices additionally standardizing nomenclature for describing sample collection points would reduce uncertainty for future analyses as is this information is simply fill in the blank with no suggested format or level of detail the analysis of water sample results on an annual basis reveals that the years 2009 2013 are five of the six years with the highest rates of positive total coliform results the remaining year is 2017 mandatory well permitting and inspection was instituted for all new private drinking water wells constructed after july 1 2008 permitting and inspection of private drinking water wells 2019 only one year before the data used in this research the observed improvement in total coliform rates over time could represent continuing improvement in new well construction practices grouting disinfection etc in nc a similar trend was not apparent for e coli results explaining why total coliform positivity probability decreased over time while e coli detection did not would be an interesting direction for future research again uncertainty could be reduced by examining these observations on a county by county or regional basis similar to data about method of transport treatment method was largely not disclosed for the sample data used in this research 99 8 of samples did not have a specified treatment method taking steps to gather this information for all samples submitted to the ncslph will increase research avenues into this aspect of private drinking water well sampling one easy step to assist with gathering this information would be to give sample collectors the option of none when submitting water sample collection information this would potentially reduce the frequency of the treatment type information being simply left blank it is interesting that samples with an unspecified treatment system were less likely to be positive for total coliform 34 1 than wells with chlorination systems 38 2 this could be attributed to wells requiring continuous chlorinators because of previously positive total and or fecal water samples as follow up samples of a new well may be recorded as new well samples the observed increased positivity rate may be an indication of an improperly functioning or ineffective chlorinator future research into this area would depend upon improving the treatment information currently being submitted to the ncslph the inverse relationship between transit time and probability of total coliform positive conforms with long established knowledge concerning the effects of holding time on coliform populations mcdaniels and bordner 1983 which is the basis of the 30 h maximum hold time set forth in the rtcr 2013 and employed by the ncslph some studies have found that the impact of hold time on e coli concentrations is similar to the impact on total coliform concentrations aulenbach 2010 but this was not supported by our data additional examination of these data could again seek to minimize the influence of county and region by analyzing samples on a county or regional basis the person collecting reading and or reporting the water samples could also impact the results reported sample collection protocols could vary between sample collectors which may affect contamination potential the color comparison process used for determining whether a sample is positive for total coliform bacteria is subjective requiring the tester to determine if the yellow of the sample is yellow equal to or greater than the comparator idexx laboratories and inc 2019 the process for e coli determination uses fluorescent comparator which is also an inherently subjective process it is natural and expected that there would be variation between readers in determining the color or fluorescence of a sample this study revealed significant water quality differences between counties and regions this information can be used to target public health interventions in counties or regions with higher incidences of coliform and or e coli positive water samples such as verifying proper disinfection of newly drilled wells verifying disinfection after submersible pump installation and justification for increased drinking water quality monitoring in private wells although region and precipitation are uncontrollable we recommend that the counties within regions that have higher rates of tc ec positives should work on mitigation measures such as more frequent testing free testing education of the public on the importance of water sampling and programs to assist with the installation costs of disinfection systems 5 conclusions the bacteriological water quality of nc s new private drinking water wells compares favorably to other states in the region table 11 however water quality across the state is highly variable with wells in the inner and outer coastal plains being particularly prone to bacteriological contamination in addition to well location county and region analysis of the water sample results gathered from the ncslph showed that several factors influence water sample outcomes transport method sample collection site month year season treatment method transit time and reporter however many of these factors are outside the control of the sample collector or their environmental health program the initial goal of this research was to develop best practices for sample collectors but it was imprudent to attempt to ascertain this from samples across the state as variations between the hundreds of sample collectors represented in this dataset was difficult to analyze due the number of other variables in many ways future research would benefit from examining variation at the county level which would reduce the interference from extrinsic factors the only factor easily controlled by environmental health practitioners is sample collection point but no single sampling point stood out as the preferred collection point the one overarching issue observed in this study that is controllable by the sample collector is the frequent lack of information provided to the ncslph many of the variables we investigated suffered from a less than desirable number of observations such as transport method and treatment type future efforts should be made to collect detailed information for all variables reported to the ncslph additionally collection of latitude and longitude information was infrequent though this information could lead to better understanding of geospatial impacts on sampling outcomes finally the lack of a standardized nomenclature for sample site reduced the usefulness of this information by providing clear and complete information for each sample collected the sample collector can improve future research into water sampling outcomes credit author

of materials the sludge can be used as an alternative economic mineral resource and can be employed in drinking water collection treatment and distribution services physical and chemical characterization of the wtp sludge was performed via the brunauer emmett teller bet method x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir differential thermal and thermogravimetric analysis dta tga and particle size analysis the structural characterization indicated that the dominant phases of wtp sludge were quartz kaolinite and illite chemical analysis demonstrated that the distributions of elements such as aluminum iron and silicon in the wtp sludge were identical to those in a clayey residue thermal analysis revealed a mass loss of approximately 30 in the sample the wtp sludge exhibited a fluoride removal ability of approximately 28 as determined by adsorption assays the langmuir and freundlich models were both adequate for representing the removal particularly the langmuir model the pseudo second order kinetic model represented the results well with r2 0 9986 and an experimental adsorption capacity q e of 0 206 mg g the experimental design was based on three factors ph initial fluorine concentration and initial ion concentration and showed 95 confidence α 0 05 that the interaction between the three factors was significant in the response variable

systemic proposal for the analysis of solid waste discharged from a surface drinking water treatment plant as a functional fluoride adsorbing material for the treatment of water collected from underground sources thereby to establish a circular relationship of valorization for this waste and to simultaneously provide a diversification of the source for drinking water treatment 2

the investigation of the material through the study of adsorption kinetics and equilibrium onyango and matsuda 2006 the adsorption equilibrium provides relevant information about the design and analysis of an adsorption separation process where the adsorption capacity is determined from the adsorption isotherms the process of obtaining an adsorption isotherm consists of adding a mass of adsorbent to a series of solutions of a given volume but different and known initial concentrations when the adsorption equilibrium is reached the final concentration of solute in the equilibrium solution gives the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent do nascimento et al 2014 many isotherm equations with two or more parameters have been proposed to fit the experimental data employing the langmuir freundlich redlich peterson temkin and dubinin radushkevich models among which the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are most commonly used in adsorption studies of liquid solid systems kul and koyuncu 2010 mckay 1995 sousa neto et al 2011 the langmuir isotherm is considered to be the simplest and is based on the following hypotheses adsorption occurs in a monolayer all adsorption sites are equivalent to each other the surface is uniform and the ability of a molecule to be adsorbed at a certain position is independent of the occupation of neighboring positions olsen and watanabe 1957 the freundlich isotherm was one of the first equations proposed to establish a relationship between the amount of material adsorbed and the concentration of material in the solution this model does not consider the energy equivalence of the adsorption sites and assumes that the adsorption process presents an exponential distribution of adsorption heat from the adsorbed monolayer fitter and sutton 1975 2 5 1 adsorption balance to study the adsorption equilibrium by construction of isotherms the samples were agitated in an orbital shaker novatécnica nt 145 at a controlled rotation speed of 500 rpm five solutions were prepared by varying the fluorine concentration as 2 4 6 8 and 10 mg l the adsorbent concentration was 6 g l for all samples the specified fluorine concentrations were in accordance with the concentrations found in the region and it was ensured that the initial concentration was higher than those already found respecting the maximum limit double the solution was agitated for 3 h at a temperature of 25 c subsequently 50 ml aliquots were collected filtered and analyzed to determine the fluoride concentration f adsorption isotherms were defined by the langmuir and freundlich models jeppu and clement 2012 reed and matsumoto 1993 the langmuir isotherm is defined by equation 1 and the linearization is given by equation 2 1 q e q m k c e 1 k c e

the adsorption intensity if n 1 n 1 and n 1 the sorption process would be linear physical or chemical respectively aragaw 2020 defluoridation adsorption varies with temperature thermodynamic studies have shown that adsorption decreases with increasing temperature pillai et al 2020 2 5 2 reaction kinetics the study of adsorption kinetics aids in determining the equilibrium time and adsorption rate in addition to providing information for comprehending the adsorption mechanisms yuh shan 2004 kinetic experiments were performed on a bench with 600 ml fluorine solution with the aid of a mechanical shaker at 400 rpm and the concentrations of the fluorine solution and adsorbent were 0 005 and 6 g l respectively with the system under agitation 50 ml aliquots were collected at time periods of 10 20 30 40 60 120 180 and 240 min the aliquots were then filtered using slow pass filter paper 85 g and the fluoride concentration was determined using the ion chromatography technique fluorides epa 300 1 usepa 1997 smeww method 4110 b smeww 1992 the adsorption efficiency was calculated using equation 5 5 r 100 c 0 c f c 0 where r is the adsorption efficiency c 0 is the initial fluoride concentration

interference in the fluoride adsorption of the wtp sludge a factorial statistical design considering factors such as ph ion concentration in the solution and initial fluorine concentration f was implemented statistical planning 23 with the central point executed in triplicate resulted in the adoption of different levels of analysis for the independent variables the experimental planning data matrix is presented in table 1 the ph affects adsorption as it determines the degree of distribution of the chemical species the intensity of this effect can vary depending on the adsorbent because the surface charge of the adsorbent depends on its composition and surface characteristics a convenient index of the tendency of a surface to become positively or negatively charged as a function of ph is the value required for the net charge of the adsorbent to be zero i e the point of zero charge pzc for ph values below the pzc the surface charge is positive and the adsorption of anions is favored for ph values higher than the pzc the surface charge is negative and the adsorption of cations is favored appel et al 2003 levels 5 7 and 9 pertain to the minimum average and maximum values of the ph of groundwater respectively the ions added to the solutions were chloride sulfide bicarbonate and nitrate at concentrations of 30 mg l and 60 mg l in addition to the initial fluoride concentrations of 1 5 3 and 4 5 mg l these ions are found in groundwater owing to the contamination of water by natural processes such as leaching of rocks with high fluorine content the experimental data were statistically evaluated using statistica 12 software with the response variable being the percentage of fluorine adsorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 solid waste classification the physical characteristics of wtp sludge evaluated according to the brazilian technical standard abnt nbr 10004 abnt 2004a are presented in table 2 the concentrations of the elements present in the solubilized extract of the wtp sludge are listed in table 3 the concentrations of iron manganese and surfactants are above the limits specified in annexe g the sludge has classified as class ii a non inert waste according to the standards for the solubilization test abnt 2004a iron and manganese are derived from raw water however surfactants originate from polymers used in the flocculation process 3 2 characterization of waste the waste generation at the drinking water treatment plant is approximately 500 kg per month dry basis this quantification was performed by measuring the amount of material retained in the drying bed for a period of six months if the amount of fluorine adsorbent such as bone charcoal is 6 g l the amount of waste generated and functionalized as a fluorine adsorbent will be able to treat approximately 833 l of drinking water per month the surface areas and pore volumes of the adsorbent materials obtained by bet table 4 using heat treatment at 300 c were 124 016 m2 g and 0 141 cc g respectively prior to the heat treatment the values obtained were 100 317 m2 g and 0 117 cc g respectively initially the adsorbate adsorbent interaction depends on the specific areas and pore volume that increases or decreases the adsorption capacities of the sorbents which can be controlled by mass transfer aragaw 2021 sorption within the pores is only possible when the pore size of the adsorbent is greater than 1 7 times the second largest dimension of the adsorbent ranasinghe et al 2022 the particle size distribution of the studied sample indicated a d10 of 1 42 μm d50 of 16 62 μm d90 of 52 61 μm and a dave of 21 95 μm however bone charcoal had an average diameter of 450 μm a maximum diameter of 800 μm and a minimum diameter of 400 μm bonechar carvão ativado do brasil ltda maringá pr the sample under study had an average diameter smaller than that of the bone charcoal thus dispensing with any comminution process the results of the chemical analysis of the wtp sludge table 5 obtained via x ray fluorescence indicates that the residue under study is composed of alumina al2o3 ferric oxide fe2o3 and silica sio2 presenting a sum of 68 the use of aluminum compounds as coagulating agents poly aluminum chloride results in a significant amount of aluminum present in the sample in addition a low chlorine content is present iron and silica originate from the raw water the wtp sludge exhibits a loss on ignition of 28 41 owing to the decomposition of organic matter present in the surface water structural characterization fig 1 indicates that the dominant phases are quartz icdd 01 070 7344 kaolinite icdd 00 006 0221 and illite icdd 00 002 0042 these results imply towards a clayey residue characterized by the al2o3 and sio2 contents as revealed by the chemical analysis the results of the differential thermal and thermogravimetric analyses dta tga of the sludge are presented in fig 2 a mass loss of approximately 30 between 150 c and 800 c can be observed which is attributed to the reactions resulting from the elimination of water molecules and the decomposition of chlorides surfactants and organic matter 3 3 performance characterization adsorption tests 3 3 1 adsorption balance the adsorption capacity mg g of the wtp sludge for each initial fluoride concentration mg l is presented in fig 3 the adsorption capacity increases linearly with increasing initial fluorine concentration the adsorption equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity and adsorbate adsorbent interaction constant during the removal of fluoride from wtp sludge were determined using the freundlich and langmuir models fig 4 a and b the models were mathematically represented using a series of equations 1 4 the advantage of the freundlich and langmuir models is their capability to predict the maximum adsorption capacity of the material in addition to describing the behavior of the experimental data from the equation of the straight line obtained graphically from the freundlich isotherm and by equations 3 and 4 the constants n and k f mg g table 6 were obtained the n value was in the range of 1 10 which indicates favorable conditions for adsorption the values of the quadratic correlations r2 between the two models were greater than 0 97 as presented in fig 4 a and b the langmuir model fig 4 b shows a better response to fluoride adsorption by the wtp sludge with a correlation of 0 9979 thus from the equation of the straight line obtained from the langmuir isotherm the constants q m and k representing the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and the adsorbate adsorbent interaction constant l mg respectively were determined the values of q m k and r2 calculated using equation 2 are listed in table 7 a quadratic correlation r2 greater than 0 99 indicates the formation of heterogeneous layers on the surface this model assumes uniform adsorption energies at the surface and no transmigration of the adsorbate in the surface plane ahamad et al 2018 3 3 2 reaction kinetics the adsorption kinetics aids in determining the equilibrium time and adsorption rate in addition it facilitates the discernment of the adsorption mechanisms the effect of the contact time of the adsorbent on the amount of fluoride present in the solution has been represented by the fluoride removal capacity as a function of time fig 5 the rate of removal of fluoride from the solution with an adsorbent concentration of 6 g l increases until 120 min then reaches a constant when approximately 28 fluoride is removed indicating the equilibrium of the reaction in a previous study rocha et al 2012 when in natura and washed bone charcoal were used as adsorbents equilibrium was reached when 88 and 94 of fluoride was removed respectively fluorine adsorption occurs by chemisorption at a low concentration range whereas chemisorption and physisorption both are responsible for adsorption at higher concentrations raghav and kumar 2019 the mechanism of removal developed by the material under study and its respective adsorption capacity wtp sludge are well represented by the surface phenomenon related to the high specific surface area the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models were evaluated to determine the reaction rate fig 6 a and b the model that best represented the adsorption phenomenon of wtp sludge was the pseudo second order model with r2 0 9986 and the r2 calculated from the pseudo first order model was 0 7922 using the equation of a straight line in combination with the linearization of the equation for the pseudo second order model the values of the adsorption rate q e and adsorption capacity k 2 constants were obtained as shown in table 8 from equations 9 and 10 the calculated and experimental adsorption capacities q e are 0 206 and 0 200 mg g respectively these values indicate that the experimental results approach the results obtained using the pseudo second order model 3 3 3 influence of variables to determine the interference in fluoride adsorption by the wtp sludge a factorial statistical design considering three factors ph ion concentration in the solution and initial fluorine f concentration was implemented table 9 lists the experimentally obtained results of the adsorption capacity as a function of the ph initial fluoride concentration and ion concentration of the solution table 10 presents the statistical treatment of the data as indicated in the analysis of variance anova table table 10 with 95 confidence α 0 05 the interaction between the three factors is significant for the response variable fluoride removal however the individual parameters are not significant response surfaces have been reproduced from the treatment of statistical data fig 7 based on the analysis of the isolated effects it could be concluded that ph had a positive effect on the removal of fluoride the higher the ph the greater was the fluoride removal however the initial concentrations of fluorine and ions had a negative effect the lower the initial concentration the was greater the removal of fluoride considering the variation in the initial concentrations of fluorine and ions at a constant ph of 5 fig 7 a 7 fig 7 b and 9 fig 7 c on the response surfaces it could be observed that if the initial concentrations were high and the ph 5 was low fluoride removal was less however the removal of fluoride from the solution was high if the ph 9 and initial concentrations were high because the interaction between the three factors was positive from the fluorine and ion concentration measurements in the treated water it was determined that the variation in the ph of the water resulted in greater fluoride removal with the proposed adsorbent if the initial concentrations of fluorine and ions were high and zero respectively a ph of approximately 5 was found to be appropriate for the treatment however if both the initial concentrations fluorine and ions were high a ph of approximately 9 enhanced the treatment 4 conclusion the wtp sludge classified as class ii a a non inert waste can be reused as a functional fluoride adsorption component the specific surface areas of the wtp sludge following heat treatment and the pore volumes were 124 016 m2 g and 0 141 cc g respectively the particle size distribution of the wtp sludge indicated a d50 of 16 62 μm which was 3 2 times smaller than that of bone charcoal the results of the chemical analysis of the wtp sludge indicated that the sludge was composed of 28 03 of al2o3 9 12 of fe2o3 and 30 85 of sio2 and was accompanied by a weight loss on ignition at 1000 c 28 41 thus characterized as a clayey residue xrd analysis indicated that the dominant crystalline phases were quartz kaolinite and illite the dta tga analysis indicated a weight loss of 30 between 150 c and 800 c which could be attributed to the reactions caused by the elimination of water molecules and the decomposition of chlorides surfactants and organic matter in the mathematical representation of fluoride removal both the langmuir and freundlich models proved to be adequate the langmuir model showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 0 21 mg g the reaction rate in turn was better represented by the pseudo second order model with an r2 0 9986 and an experimental adsorption capacity of 0 206 mg g the obtained values were in agreement with the results obtained using the langmuir model the experimental design indicated that the interactions between the three factors ph initial fluorine concentration and initial ion concentration had a significant effect on the response variable therefore the variables can be manipulated to enhance fluoride removal in water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

first and pseudo second order rate equations ho et al 1996 lagergren 1898 these equations represent variations in the amount adsorbed over time the adsorption rate equation and linearized form of the pseudo first order kinetic equation are given by equations 7 and 8 respectively 7 d q d t k 1 q e q 8 ln q e q ln q e k 1 t where q e mg g and q mg g are the amounts of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 1 is the adsorption rate constant min 1 the pseudo second order adsorption rate equation and its linearized form are represented by equations 9 and 10 respectively 9 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e mg g and qt mg g are the amounts of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium and time t respectively and k2 is the pseudo second order velocity constant 2 6 statistical evaluation fluoride adsorption depends on several factors that provide the maximum adsorption kimambo et al 2019 to determine the interference in the fluoride adsorption of the wtp sludge a factorial statistical design considering factors such as ph ion concentration in the solution and initial fluorine concentration f was implemented statistical planning 23 with the central point executed in triplicate resulted in the adoption of different levels of analysis for the independent variables the experimental planning data matrix is presented in table 1 the ph affects adsorption as it determines the degree of distribution of the chemical species the intensity of this effect can vary depending on the adsorbent because the surface charge of the adsorbent depends on its composition and surface characteristics a convenient index of the tendency of a surface to become positively or negatively charged as a function of ph is the value required for the net charge of the adsorbent to be zero i e the point of zero charge pzc for ph values below the pzc the surface charge is positive and the adsorption of anions is favored for ph values higher than the pzc the surface charge is negative and the adsorption of cations is favored appel et al 2003 levels 5 7 and 9 pertain to the minimum average and maximum values of the ph of groundwater respectively the ions added to the solutions were chloride sulfide bicarbonate and nitrate at concentrations of 30 mg l and 60 mg l in addition to the initial fluoride concentrations of 1 5 3 and 4 5 mg l these ions are found in groundwater owing to the contamination of water by natural processes such as leaching of rocks with high fluorine content the experimental data were statistically evaluated using statistica 12 software with the response variable being the percentage of fluorine adsorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 solid waste classification the physical characteristics of wtp sludge evaluated according to the brazilian technical standard abnt nbr 10004 abnt 2004a are presented in table 2 the concentrations of the elements present in the solubilized extract of the wtp sludge are listed in table 3 the concentrations of iron manganese and surfactants are above the limits specified in annexe g the sludge has classified as class ii a non inert waste according to the standards for the solubilization test abnt 2004a iron and manganese are derived from raw water however surfactants originate from polymers used in the flocculation process 3 2 characterization of waste the waste generation at the drinking water treatment plant is approximately 500 kg per month dry basis this quantification was performed by measuring the amount of material retained in the drying bed for a period of six months if the amount of fluorine adsorbent such as bone charcoal is 6 g l the amount of waste generated and functionalized as a fluorine adsorbent will be able to treat approximately 833 l of drinking water per month the surface areas and pore volumes of the adsorbent materials obtained by bet table 4 using heat treatment at 300 c were 124 016 m2 g and 0 141 cc g respectively prior to the heat treatment the values obtained were 100 317 m2 g and 0 117 cc g respectively initially the adsorbate adsorbent interaction depends on the specific areas and pore volume that increases or decreases the adsorption capacities of the sorbents which can be controlled by mass transfer aragaw 2021 sorption within the pores is only possible when the pore size of the adsorbent is greater than 1 7 times the second largest dimension of the adsorbent ranasinghe et al 2022 the particle size distribution of the studied sample indicated a d10 of 1 42 μm d50 of 16 62 μm d90 of 52 61 μm and a dave of 21 95 μm however bone charcoal had an average diameter of 450 μm a maximum diameter of 800 μm and a minimum diameter of 400 μm bonechar carvão ativado do brasil ltda maringá pr the sample under study had an average diameter smaller than that of the bone charcoal thus dispensing with any comminution process the results of the chemical analysis of the wtp sludge table 5 obtained via x ray fluorescence indicates that the residue under study is composed of alumina al2o3 ferric oxide fe2o3 and silica sio2 presenting a sum of 68 the use of aluminum compounds as coagulating agents poly aluminum chloride results in a significant amount of aluminum present in the sample in addition a low chlorine content is present iron and silica originate from the raw water the wtp sludge exhibits a loss on ignition of 28 41 owing to the decomposition of organic matter present in the surface water structural characterization fig 1 indicates that the dominant phases are quartz icdd 01 070 7344 kaolinite icdd 00 006 0221 and illite icdd 00 002 0042 these results imply towards a clayey residue characterized by the al2o3 and sio2 contents as revealed by the chemical analysis the results of the differential thermal and thermogravimetric analyses dta tga of the sludge are presented in fig 2 a mass loss of approximately 30 between 150 c and 800 c can be observed which is attributed to the reactions resulting from the elimination of water molecules and the decomposition of chlorides surfactants and organic matter 3 3 performance characterization adsorption tests 3 3 1 adsorption balance the adsorption capacity mg g of the wtp sludge for each initial fluoride concentration mg l is presented in fig 3 the adsorption capacity increases linearly with increasing initial fluorine concentration the adsorption equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity and adsorbate adsorbent interaction constant during the removal of fluoride from wtp sludge were determined using the freundlich and langmuir models fig 4 a and b the models were mathematically represented using a series of equations 1 4 the advantage of the freundlich and langmuir models is their capability to predict the maximum adsorption capacity of the material in addition to describing the behavior of the experimental data from the equation of the straight line obtained graphically from the freundlich isotherm and by equations 3 and 4 the constants n and k f mg g table 6 were obtained the n value was in the range of 1 10 which indicates favorable conditions for adsorption the values of the quadratic correlations r2 between the two models were greater than 0 97 as presented in fig 4 a and b the langmuir model fig 4 b shows a better response to fluoride adsorption by the wtp sludge with a correlation of 0 9979 thus from the equation of the straight line obtained from the langmuir isotherm the constants q m and k representing the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and the adsorbate adsorbent interaction constant l mg respectively were determined the values of q m k and r2 calculated using equation 2 are listed in table 7 a quadratic correlation r2 greater than 0 99 indicates the formation of heterogeneous layers on the surface this model assumes uniform adsorption energies at the surface and no transmigration of the adsorbate in the surface plane ahamad et al 2018 3 3 2 reaction kinetics the adsorption kinetics aids in determining the equilibrium time and adsorption rate in addition it facilitates the discernment of the adsorption mechanisms the effect of the contact time of the adsorbent on the amount of fluoride present in the solution has been represented by the fluoride removal capacity as a function of time fig 5 the rate of removal of fluoride from the solution with an adsorbent concentration of 6 g l increases until 120 min then reaches a constant when approximately 28 fluoride is removed indicating the equilibrium of the reaction in a previous study rocha et al 2012 when in natura and washed bone charcoal were used as adsorbents equilibrium was reached when 88 and 94 of fluoride was removed respectively fluorine adsorption occurs by chemisorption at a low concentration range whereas chemisorption and physisorption both are responsible for adsorption at higher concentrations raghav and kumar 2019 the mechanism of removal developed by the material under study and its respective adsorption capacity wtp sludge are well represented by the surface phenomenon related to the high specific surface area the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models were evaluated to determine the reaction rate fig 6 a and b the model that best represented the adsorption phenomenon of wtp sludge was the pseudo second order model with r2 0 9986 and the r2 calculated from the pseudo first order model was 0 7922 using the equation of a straight line in combination with the linearization of the equation for the pseudo second order model the values of the adsorption rate q e and adsorption capacity k 2 constants were obtained as shown in table 8 from equations 9 and 10 the calculated and experimental adsorption capacities q e are 0 206 and 0 200 mg g respectively these values indicate that the experimental results approach the results obtained using the pseudo second order model 3 3 3 influence of variables to determine the interference in fluoride adsorption by the wtp sludge a factorial statistical design considering three factors ph ion concentration in the solution and initial fluorine f concentration was implemented table 9 lists the experimentally obtained results of the adsorption capacity as a function of the ph initial fluoride concentration and ion concentration of the solution table 10 presents the statistical treatment of the data as indicated in the analysis of variance anova table table 10 with 95 confidence α 0 05 the interaction between the three factors is significant for the response variable fluoride removal however the individual parameters are not significant response surfaces have been reproduced from the treatment of statistical data fig 7 based on the analysis of the isolated effects it could be concluded that ph had a positive effect on the removal of fluoride the higher the ph the greater was the fluoride removal however the initial concentrations of fluorine and ions had a negative effect the lower the initial concentration the was greater the removal of fluoride considering the variation in the initial concentrations of fluorine and ions at a constant ph of 5 fig 7 a 7 fig 7 b and 9 fig 7 c on the response surfaces it could be observed that if the initial concentrations were high and the ph 5 was low fluoride removal was less however the removal of fluoride from the solution was high if the ph 9 and initial concentrations were high because the interaction between the three factors was positive from the fluorine and ion concentration measurements in the treated water it was determined that the variation in the ph of the water resulted in greater fluoride removal with the proposed adsorbent if the initial concentrations of fluorine and ions were high and zero respectively a ph of approximately 5 was found to be appropriate for the treatment however if both the initial concentrations fluorine and ions were high a ph of approximately 9 enhanced the treatment 4 conclusion the wtp sludge classified as class ii a a non inert waste can be reused as a functional fluoride adsorption component the specific surface areas of the wtp sludge following heat treatment and the pore volumes were 124 016 m2 g and 0 141 cc g respectively the particle size distribution of the wtp sludge indicated a d50 of 16 62 μm which was 3 2 times smaller than that of bone charcoal the results of the chemical analysis of the wtp sludge indicated that the sludge was composed of 28 03 of al2o3 9 12 of fe2o3 and 30 85 of sio2 and was accompanied by a weight loss on ignition at 1000 c 28 41 thus characterized as a clayey residue xrd analysis indicated that the dominant crystalline phases were quartz kaolinite and illite the dta tga analysis indicated a weight loss of 30 between 150 c and 800 c which could be attributed to the reactions caused by the elimination of water molecules and the decomposition of chlorides surfactants and organic matter in the mathematical representation of fluoride removal both the langmuir and freundlich models proved to be adequate the langmuir model showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 0 21 mg g the reaction rate in turn was better represented by the pseudo second order model with an r2 0 9986 and an experimental adsorption capacity of 0 206 mg g the obtained values were in agreement with the results obtained using the langmuir model the experimental design indicated that the interactions between the three factors ph initial fluorine concentration and initial ion concentration had a significant effect on the response variable therefore the variables can be manipulated to enhance fluoride removal in water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

11852,the source of groundwater and its flow pattern were investigated by analyzing hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios and chemical compositions for efficient heat utilization of groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan area in eastern toyama prefecture for indoor heating and cooling and greenhouse cultivation forty five groundwater and five river water samples were taken in july 2012 and additional samples were also taken in august and september 2013 to analyze annual changes in the water s chemical composition the isotope composition analyses revealed that the contribution of river water was large near the kurobe river but precipitation was also mixed in the contribution of river water decreases from the kurobe river to the central part of the alluvium fan and the contribution of precipitation increases the dissolved chemical constituents in the groundwater did not change significantly over time the electric conductivity ec of the groundwater tended to increase with distance from the kurobe river which was attributed to the increase in hco3 and ca2 concentrations when groundwater is used as a heat source in a geothermal heat pump system it is necessary to investigate the behavior of its precipitates scales which can reduce the heat exchange rate the saturation indices of common scale components calcite aragonite caco3 and iron feooh fe oh 3 compounds were calculated based on the chemical composition of the groundwater all groundwater was undersaturated for caco3 and feooh and fe oh 3 precipitated in all regions except for some areas however the amount of precipitation was not expected to be significant due to the low iron concentration graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater isotope chemistry heat utilization alluvial fan 1 introduction ground source heat pumps gshps utilize the thermostatic properties of groundwater and can be used for indoor heating and cooling as well as for melting snow on roads which may solve the problem of ground subsidence caused by pumping groundwater the use of gshps is a widespread approach globally e g huttrer 1997 diao et al 2004 lee and hahn 2006 fujii et al 2007 russo et al 2011 there are two types of gshps as follows open and closed type loops fig 1 in regions with abundant groundwater the open type method using existing wells is appropriate e g wang et al 2012 in open type gshps groundwater is pumped up to the surface exchanged for heat in a heat exchanger and then returned to the aquifer through a reinjection well conversely in closed type gshps heat exchange is carried out underground by burying u shaped pipes and using antifreeze if this type of gshp is used as a heat source for melting snow on roads and for indoor air conditioning it will not only reduce the decrease in groundwater levels in the area but will also be highly effective in terms of energy saving closed and open gshps do not discharge groundwater to the ground surface thus do not cause environmental pollution or land subsidence and can be used as a potential solution to the significant drop in groundwater levels in winter however for long term use of open type gshps a constant supply of groundwater is required and it is important to monitor changes in groundwater temperature and quality in order to maintain the heat exchange rate of the system analysis by hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of groundwater and river waters can contribute greatly to this method to discuss the origin and flow mode of groundwater hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition analysis is very useful and many research with chemical composition analysis have been reported worldwide e g kendall and mcdonnell 1999 davisson et al 1999 kumar et al 2015 2016 qian and li 2011 muñoz et al 2015 yuan et al clark

2009 iwatake et al 2013 ioka et al 2013 tomiyama et al 2013 yamada and ueda 2018 yoshida et al 2018 recently similar geochemical analyses have been also done for groundwater river water interactions and coastal salinization e g krishan et al 2019 2020 2021 lapworth et al 2021 iwatake and ueda 2021 matsuura et al 2021 the kurobe river fan located in the northeastern part of toyama prefecture japan is known for its abundance of groundwater the slope of the river is steep due to the short distance less than 50 km between the tateyama mountain range ca 3000 m elevation and the coast fig 2 a the snow that falls on the tateyama mountain range melts and becomes a rich source of groundwater for the kurobe river alluvial fan groundwater in this area is characterized by low concentrations of dissolved chemicals shimano et al 1992 matsuura et al 2021 and is used for a variety of purposes with 132 million tons year of groundwater pumped toyama prefecture 2018 of this amount approximately 30 million tons are annually pumped and used for melting snow on roads the groundwater level drops by more than 5 m in winter due to pumping for snow removal this lowering of the groundwater level is one of the causes of land subsidence with some areas having abated 86 mm in the past 16 years and groundwater salinization is also increasing in the coastal areas toyama prefecture 2018 subsurface temperature is approximately constant below 10 m depth and is 1 c 2 c higher than the average temperature in the area e g kawasaki et al 1987 the annual average temperature in the alluvial fan of the kurobe river has been 14 4 c for the past 20 years japan meteorological agency 2021 and accordingly groundwater temperature is expected to be about 15 c 16 c the primary goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the groundwater flow in the kurobe river alluvial fan to inform agriculture and industry and to improve heat energy utilization via geothermal heat pump room air conditioning greenhouse cultivation etc matsuura et al 2021 have been monitoring the temperature and electric conductivity ec values of river water and groundwater in the kurobe river catchment for 9 years since 2011 the groundwater in the kurobe river fan in the study area was extensively surveyed in 2012 and 2013 and the water temperature and ec values were preliminarily reported the age of the groundwater in the kurobe alluvium fan was estimated to be more than a decade based on the results of tritium analysis matsuura et al 2017 in this study the hydrogen and oxygen isotope and chemical compositions of the samples collected in 2012 and 2013 were analyzed to investigate the source and flow conditions of groundwater in the fan furthermore the behavior of scale components precipitated from the groundwater during heat use was analyzed to investigate the applicability of an open type gshp for thermal application 2 geological and hydrogeological overview of the study area the kurobe river is located in the northeastern part of toyama prefecture japan it originates from mt washu and has a trunk river channel length of 85 km and a basin area of 682 km2 fig 2a the kurobe river fan has an attractive fan shape with a distance of 13 4 km from the top of the fan to the mouth an area of 96 km2 and a 1 100 slope exhibiting concentric contours fig 2a this is the result of the almost uniform deposition of sand and gravel from the upper reaches of the kurobe river as it transitions from left to right on the fan shaped surface shimano et al 1992 the geological map of the study area is shown in fig 2b aist 2015 the mountainous area of the kurobe river basin is formed from mesozoic and quaternary igneous rock such as granite and granodiorite and the kurobe fan is covered by sand and gravel beds which are quaternary fan deposits the main aquifers in the kurobe river fan are the present fan deposits pleistocene paleo fan deposits and the sand and gravel layers of the kureha mountain formation a small number of continuous clay layers serve as impermeable layers in the present fan and paleo fan deposits near the top and middle of the fan in terms of rock types granodiorite is the most common among those larger than 3 cm in diameter followed by gneissic granodiorite gneissic quartz diorite gneiss acid volcanic rock a small amount of andesite and a small amount of mesozoic fine grained pebbles crystalline schist and limestone sumi et al 1989 geological cross sections of the central region within the kurobe alluvium fan are shown in fig 2c these were compiled from the geological data of groundwater wells about 100 m depth within the fan tebakari et al 2016 it consists of three layers from the top to the edge of the fan the surface layer is 20 100 m of fan deposits the second layer is covered by a rather thin layer of old fan deposits and the third layer is the kureha formation late miocene marine formation and sandstone few clay layers are observed in this cross section fujii et al 2007 reported that the main aquifers in the kurobe river fan are the present fan deposits pleistocene paleo fan deposits and the gravel and sand layers of the kureha formation tebakari et al 2016 concluded that these formations macroscopically contain groundwater as a series of aquifers and most of the groundwater is considered to be unconfined groundwater however in some areas at the edge of the fan clay layers are interbedded in a layered or lenticular manner and the groundwater is pressurized artesian groundwater and has been used as living water since ancient times it also forms an upwelling zone at the sea bottom through the highly permeable sand and gravel layer old river channel that is sandwiched between the clay layers zhang and satake 2003 this sand and gravel layer can also be found in the present river channel section the depth of groundwater pumping increased from approximately 1970 to 1990 shimano et al 1992 currently there are some cases in which groundwater is pumped from 30 m or deeper at the fan edge and from just above the basement rock at the center and top of the fan 3 sample location and analysis procedures groundwater samples were collected at 67 locations in 2012 and based on the results 45 locations were sampled in 2013 similarly river water samples were collected at 4 locations in 2012 and 3 locations in 2013 table 1 and fig 2a the groundwater was taken at a shallow 20 50 m depth water samples were collected for dissolved chemical components and stable isotope ratios in two polyethylene bottles which were rinsed with sample water three times filled with water up to the bottle mouth and covered with a lid to prevent air from entering as much as possible because the groundwater and river water samples were colorless and transparent filtration was not carried out in the field for major chemical and isotope analyses to analyze the fe and sio2 concentrations of groundwater 50 ml of water filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter and given a ph level of 2 or less by adding 1 ml of a 6 n hcl solution was sampled in the field measurements water temperatures were measured using a digital water thermometer yi chun waterproof digital thermometer ph values were measured by a portable ph meter toa hm 31 p ec values were measured by a portable conductivity meter toa cm 31 p and redox potential orp measurements were obtained using an orp meter toa rm 12 p the δd values were determined using the chromium cr reduction method itai and kusakabe 2004 the oxygen isotope δ18o compositions of the water samples were determined after pretreatment using a co2 h2o isotope exchange equilibrium epstein and mayeda 1953 at 25 c the δd and δ18o values were obtained using a mass spectrometer isoprime 100 isoprime the results were reported relative to the v smow with an analytical precision in this phase of 1 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o respectively the major components na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 of water sample were measured using ion chromatography metrohm 761 compact ic additionally dionex dx 320 j and ionpac as s22 columns were used to separate the cation and anion components respectively and the analytical error for each component concentration was less than 5 alkalinity hco3 was determined as ph 4 8 by the acid titration method and converted to hco3 concentrations as described in jis japanese industrial standards jis k0102 1 the dissolved sio2 was measured by a molybdate yellow method using a spectrophotometer uv vis shimadzu the charge balance err scat san scat san 100 s cat and an mean total cation and anion respectively appelo and postma 1993 was 2 to 10 in the water samples charge balance affects the total amount of dissolved constituents in groundwater e g williams et al 2009 who point out that most data fall within 10 below 2 meql l similar to the present results the reason why the cation is slightly higher in this analysis result is probably due to unanalyzed anion components such as f 4 results and discussion the results obtained in this study are shown in table 2 and figs 3 9 where the sample location numbers correspond to those in table 1 and fig 2a 4 1 physiochemical parameters data on water temperature and ec of groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan have been preliminarily reported by matsuura et al 2021 and the results for july 2012 as well as observations of river water are shown in fig 3a in the central to eastern part of the right bank region of the kurobe river the water temperature was constant at 16 c 2 c except for the selected sampling points and showed slightly lower temperatures in the coastal area conversely in the left bank area groundwater with a temperature above 20 c existed on the mountainside near the mouth of the kurobe river however this value was rather low at approximately 10 c the water temperature difference was within 5 c between 2012 and 2013 in the central part of the fan along the kurobe river because of the large amount of infiltration from rivers in the subsidence section however the temperature difference became larger with an increase in the distance from the kurobe river and the water temperature difference was also remarkably evident in the groundwater in the point close to the terrace planes matsuura et al 2021 water temperature is an important natural tracer for understanfing the groundwater flow because the residence time of groundwater can be estimated by comparing the temperature and air temperature of groundwater and river water e g anderson 2005 baena et al 2009 konishi et al 2020 the groundwater temperature was constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more and groundwater with a residence time of one year or more showed temperatures equal to or slightly lower than the annual average temperature e g yamamoto 1992 bartolino and niswonger 1999 bartolino 2003 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 based on the observed water temperature results the groundwater residence time was likely to have been more than one year in areas where the water temperature in the right bank region was close to the average air temperature the low temperature groundwater in coastal areas was more likely to have been infiltrated by precipitation originating from the higher elevation of mountainous areas than from river water as denoted by matsuura et al 2021 the ec value of the groundwater in the kurobe alluvial fan fell within the range of 58 227 μs cm except for sample point s 21 369 μs cm tended to be lower along the kurobe and ogawa rivers and increased with distance from these rivers fig 3b in contrast groundwater in the left bank area was characterized by the fact that no groundwater exceeded 200 μs cm the difference in ec values between 2012 and 2013 was a decrease of 50 100 μs cm in the upper reaches of the left bank of the kurobe river while other areas showed slight variations in the range of 50 μs cm matsuura et al 2021 4 2 chemical composition of groundwater the major chemical compositions of the groundwater and river water are shown in table 2 the piper 1944 and stiff diagrams 1951 of the samples collected in august 2012 are shown in fig 5a b respectively there was no significant difference in the chemical compositions between 2012 and 2013 table 2 most of the groundwater was identified as ca2 hco3 type which is similar to the composition of groundwater in the sho river and toyama alluvial fans e g iwatake et al 2013 hirata et al 2021 mori et al 2020 iwatake and ueda 2021 near the study area in the groundwater ca2 and hco3 concentrations increased with distance from the kurobe river and the ec values also increased figs 3b and 5b the relationship between ca2 and hco3 concentrations in groundwater is shown in fig 5c the two straight lines in fig 5c show equations 2 and 3 and most of the water samples showed compositions along the line 3 this was interpreted as a mixture of precipitation and river water dissolving carbonate minerals such as limestone which was previously reported to be present in sediment sumi et al 1989 the dissolution reactions of limestone to form dissolved bicarbonate and calcium ions can be described as follows 2 c a c o 3 h 2 o c a 2 h c o 3 o h if co2 is available from the atmosphere and or decomposition of organic matter the equations for carbonate dissolution can be given as follows 3 c a c o 3 h 2 o c o 2 c a 2 2 h c o 3 from the line of equation 3 there is groundwater enriched in hco3 however this water is most likely the result of ion exchange reactions with clay and other materials following the reaction with limestone and ca2 was replaced with na and k 4 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of groundwater the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in 2012 within the study area ranged from 79 to 53 and from 12 5 to 8 5 respectively table 2a and they were plotted near the local meteoric water line fig 4a which in turn was plotted close to the d 20 value of δd 8δ18o d craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 for groundwater samples in 2013 only δ18o was analyzed which ranged from 12 8 to 9 0 consistent with the results of 2012 table 2b river water from the kurobe river was sampled at three locations from upstream to downstream in the alluvial fan area fig 2a however no significant differences were found based on the δd and δ18o values of 83 and 13 2 to 13 0 respectively table 2a and b in contrast the ogawa river water showed higher values of 60 and 10 4 fig 4a compared with those of the kurobe river fig 4a also shows the monthly precipitation values for the period ranging from may 2012 to may 2015 which ranged from 10 to 30 for the d value of the meteoric water line these precipitation values were observed by okakita et al 2019 at site p 1 in the region fig 2a okakita et al 2019 analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of precipitation at eight locations in toyama prefecture and nearby areas for two years and reported that the compositions were around the d 10 line in summer and d 30 in winter it is interpreted that this is caused by air masses from the pacific ocean in summer and from continental air masses in winter the d values of groundwater and river water in this study area are almost around 20 fig 4a since the okakita data lacked measurements for march 2013 using data from april 2013 to march 2014 the mean values of δd and δ18o for precipitation during this year considering all precipitation amounts were calculated as 63 6 and 9 8 respectively this value was within the range of variation for the groundwater values in contrast the mean value of precipitation in toyama city 30 km southwest of the study area during the period of 1982 1995 was reported to be as high as 8 5 0 5 in terms of δ18o values mizutani and satake 1997 this is represented in fig 4a as a broken square the residence time of groundwater in this fan area was estimated to be less than 60 years based on the tritium concentrations matsuura et al 2017 if the groundwater was formed due to the mixture of precipitation and kurobe river water the δd and δ18o values of precipitation that explain the observed isotopic composition of the groundwater were likely 49 5 and 8 6 0 5 respectively the distribution of δ18o values of the groundwater in 2012 is shown in fig 4b groundwater with low δ18o values was distributed along the kurobe river this value rose as the distance from the river increased fig 4b in the area around the ogawa river δ18o values similar to those of river water were found in the right bank area but only in a small region in the left bank area assuming that the groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan is a simple mixture of precipitation and kurobe river water the mixing ratio of precipitation and river water and how it infiltrates underground were investigated in this calculation it was assumed that there is little evaporation when precipitation infiltrates into the ground the water mixing ratio was examined using the δ18o values obtained in this study the contribution of precipitation to groundwater is shown in equation 1 1 p e r c e n t of co n t r i b u t i o n δ 18 o g r o u n d w a t e r δ 18 o r i v e r w a t e r δ 18 o p e r c i p i t a t i o n δ 18 o r i v e r w a t e r 100 the δ18o values of precipitation and river water were set to 8 5 the annual weighted average of the precipitation over the years and 13 1 respectively considering the δ18o values of kurobe river water in this study and existing river water data in a study by mizutani and satake 1997 the percentages of precipitation in groundwater are shown in fig 4c the contribution of precipitation to groundwater was less than 20 in the area around the kurobe river indicating that a large amount of kurobe river water infiltrated into the groundwater but that precipitation also contributed to the groundwater even in areas near the river the further away from the kurobe river the higher the contribution rate became and it was judged that precipitation primarily infiltrated in particular the area near the top of the fan which was close to the mountain was assumed to be a precipitation origin in the area around the ogawa river river water may be seeping in the right bank area and only slightly in the left bank in contrast the groundwater near the mouth of the river indicates that river water is the main source but the water temperature is quite low about 12 c even though the sampling period was in july matsuura et al 2021 measured the water temperature and ec of river and groundwater in the kurobe river catchment area over a long period of time and pointed out that the origin of groundwater in this coastal area is high elevation ca 450 m river water infiltrating deep underground and gushing out as artesian groundwater in the coastal area which is also supported by the data of this study 4 4 origin of groundwater based on isotopic characteristics and degree of reaction with rock the ec value of the groundwater in the central area of the fan is about 10 times higher than that of precipitation and river water which is interpreted to mean that the groundwater reacted with the surrounding rocks during infiltrating and became rich in chemical components especially ca2 and hco3 figs 3b and 5b fig 6a shows the degree of rock water reaction proposed by gibbs 1970 and the smaller the na na ca2 ratio the more advanced the reaction with the rock indicating that the groundwater in the study area is judged to have a relatively advanced rock water reaction in this study more details for the groundwater sources and the extent of rock water reactions were discussed by simultaneously evaluating these na na ca2 weight ratios and δ18o values of groundwater fig 6b the na na ca2 of the precipitation data in fig 6b are taken from a study conducted by yasuda et al 1991 and the δ18o value was set to 8 5 0 5 based on data provided in mizutani and satake 1997 the groundwater in the study area had a triangular composition surrounded by the three end members i e river water precipitation and precipitation that had reacted with rock materials referred to here as mature precipitation this suggests that the groundwater was formed by mixing these three end components in arbitrary proportions among these data the groundwater where precipitation is considered to have simply mixed with river water and hardly reacted with rocks is located at the s 57 point upstream of the left bank of the kurobe river the groundwater with a composition closest to that of mature precipitation is located at the s 42 point upstream of the right bank the concentration of sio2 in groundwater is also one of the components to evaluate rock water reactions katsuyama et al 2005 narimiya et al 2009 ishibashi et al 2012 gbadebo et al 2013 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 marçais et al 2018 sospedra et al 2018 sio2 in groundwater is derived from glassy and minerals such as plagioclase in rocks but its dissolution rate is known to be slower than that of carbonate minerals e g lasaga 1998 as the ec value of the groundwater increases the ca concentration increases linearly with the dissolution of carbonate minerals fig 7a but the same linear increase is observed for sio2 fig 7b except for some groundwater when groundwater reacts with rocks it becomes enriched in ca2 and hco3 under the influence of easily soluble limestone the groundwater with high sio2 concentration in fig 7b is characterized by its distribution at the top of the fan fig 7c although the sio2 concentration is a component that does not affect the ec value the fact that it is increasing as the ec increases due to the progressive reaction with carbonate minerals indicates that the reaction with the rock is also progressing in particular the distribution area of high sio2 concentration groundwater indicates that the rocks in this area have been reacting for a long period of time and that the rocks are likely to leach silica more easily than other areas within the alluvial fan of the kurobe river quaternary fan deposits sand and gravel beds are predominant but terrace deposits and non marine sedimentary rocks are distributed around the top of the fan fig 2b sumi et al 1989 the reason for the high sio2 in the groundwater near the top of the fan is assumed to be due to the reaction with these sedimentary rocks but the detailed cause is unknown so far 4 5 scale precipitation to safely use gshps water movement and groundwater quality are important parameters to be considered in particular the use of open type gshps is recommended in areas with high groundwater flow such as the kurobe river alluvial fan because they are inexpensive when an open type gshp is used groundwater is pumped and heat is exchanged on the ground accordingly caco3 feooh goethite and fe oh 3 scales may precipitate in the heat exchangers and pipes the possibility of scale precipitation in the groundwater of the kurobe river alluvial fan was studied by calculating the saturation index s i of the scale components the s i was defined using the following equation and calculated using a phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 4 s i l o g q k where q is the activity product calculated using the chemical analysis value for the groundwater and k is the equilibrium constant of the mineral solubility product when s i was less than 0 mineral precipitation did not take place because the groundwater was undersaturated in terms of minerals when the s i was greater than 0 mineral precipitation could take place owing to supersaturation for carbonate components groundwater in the study area was found to be undersaturated although the saturation index of caco3 increased with an increasing ph fig 8a aragonite a type of calcium carbonate was also examined and showed values similar to those of calcite for the fe compound scale the fe oh 3 component was supersaturated with an increased s i as the fe concentration increased fig 8b goethite was supersaturated in all groundwater samples this indicated that the precipitation of fe compounds was likely to precipitate in a heat exchanger when groundwater with a high fe concentration was used for gshps the same result groundwater being supersaturated with fe compounds was reported in other alluvial fan groundwater samples collected in toyama prefecture iwatake and ueda 2021 mori et al 2020 hirata et al 2021 even if it is supersaturated as in the case of fe compounds if the fe concentration is small it can be handled by periodic cleaning of the heat pump or filter in fact an open type heat pump that has been operating for more than five years in the sho river alluvium fan area only needs to clean the filter installed in front of the heat exchanger once every few months kushida et al 2012 the concentration of fe in groundwater in the study area ranged from a low of 0 01 μg l at the lower limit of detection to a maximum of 5 μg l the concentration was higher in the central area of the right bank area of the kurobe river and nearer to the coast and lower in the left bank area and the region around ogawa river fig 9a the concentration of fe in groundwater varied with the oxidation reduction state orp and the more reductive the groundwater the higher the concentration of fe dissolved as fe2 okakita et al 2019 reported that the fe concentration in groundwater in okayama city became lower with higher orp values and at orps above 100 mv the fe concentration was less than 100 μg l the orp of groundwater in the study area showed oxidative values ranging from 100 to 800 mv with low values in the right bank area and coastal regions of the kurobe river and high values in some areas upstream of the right bank fig 9b the iron concentration was 5 μg l in all areas which was much lower compared with results for okayama city this was presumably because the groundwater in okayama city is based on granite whereas in the study area groundwater flows through fan deposits and the fe concentration in the reactive rocks is low the saturation index of fe oh 3 in the groundwater was lower than 0 in the eastern fan area and higher near the kurobe river fig 9c this high saturation index was interpreted as a result of the higher orp value and fe concentration in this area 4 6 assessment of the suitability of groundwater for heat utilization to ensure the efficient use of gshps the groundwater temperature must remain constant throughout the year alternatively even if the water temperature fluctuates yearly the air temperature differences must be large and the thermal efficiency should be high in terms of water quality it is also important for the long term operation of gshps that there be no precipitation of calcium carbonate or fe compounds alternatively if precipitation occurs it must be only in small amounts the temperature of the groundwater in the study area indicated a broad range 10 c 25 c but most areas showed a temperature of 16 c 2 c this was slightly higher than the average annual temperature of the region 14 4 c over the past 20 years japan meteorological agency 2021 indicating that this groundwater had been retained for at least one year the residence time estimated by the measurement of tritium concentration in the groundwater in this fan area is approximately 30 years matsuura et al 2017 this indicated that except for a few areas the temperature of the groundwater in this region remained essentially constant the ec values of the groundwater in the study area were characterized by low values ranging from 70 to 194 μs cm one sample except for s 21 although they increased with distance from the kurobe river the groundwater in the study area was the ca2 hco3 type which was similar to other alluvial fan groundwater in toyama prefecture this can be denoted as a characteristic of alluvial fan groundwater in toyama prefecture which includes a high level of precipitation and flows from the 3000 m high mountain range to the sea through fan shaped areas within a few tens of kilometers okakita et al 2019 examination of the scale components indicated that the groundwater in the study area was undersaturated with respect to calcite but may precipitate fe compounds such as feooh and fe oh 3 kawada industries situated in the sho river alluvial fan and where the formation of this fe scale has been observed during the use of gshps has responded by cleaning the filter every two months kushida et al 2012 since the concentration of fe in groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan is lower than 5 μg compared with groundwater in other fan areas even if fe scale precipitates it is not considered a major problem and can be addressed by cleaning the filter the final recommended area for an open type gshp using groundwater in the study area is shown in fig 10 water temperature groundwater flow pattern and scale components are considered to determine the regions where an open type gshp can be applied for groundwater heat utilization since the groundwater flow is abundant in this region groundwater can be used for heat utilization in almost all areas in particular the areas along the kurobe and ogawa rivers area a in fig 10 are suitable because they are constantly supplied with water from rivers and precipitation and the water temperature is almost constant throughout the year in contrast the upstream area along the right bank of the kurobe river can be used for open type gshps although the difference between the water and air temperatures is not as large as in area a in region c the fe concentration is higher than in other regions therefore frequent gshp filter cleaning will be necessary in addition the water temperature in region d is high in summer and originates from precipitation which makes heat use difficult 5 conclusions the groundwater system of the kurobe river alluvial fan area was roughly classified and its water quality characteristics and recharge sources were identified the results showed that the water quality concentration was low due to the dilution effect from the river and that open type gshps are appropriate for use in this region however the groundwater level is based on the flow rate of the river which must be addressed in the central part of the fan area groundwater ec is high and ca2 and hco3 concentrations are also high calcium carbonate and other substances do not precipitate at these water temperatures but there is a risk of scale precipitation as the temperature increases as a result the heat exchange aspect of gshps and piping may experience issues where the heat exchange rate decreases accordingly regular valve cleaning work will be necessary such as using a closed type gshp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11852,the source of groundwater and its flow pattern were investigated by analyzing hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios and chemical compositions for efficient heat utilization of groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan area in eastern toyama prefecture for indoor heating and cooling and greenhouse cultivation forty five groundwater and five river water samples were taken in july 2012 and additional samples were also taken in august and september 2013 to analyze annual changes in the water s chemical composition the isotope composition analyses revealed that the contribution of river water was large near the kurobe river but precipitation was also mixed in the contribution of river water decreases from the kurobe river to the central part of the alluvium fan and the contribution of precipitation increases the dissolved chemical constituents in the groundwater did not change significantly over time the electric conductivity ec of the groundwater tended to increase with distance from the kurobe river which was attributed to the increase in hco3 and ca2 concentrations when groundwater is used as a heat source in a geothermal heat pump system it is necessary to investigate the behavior of its precipitates scales which can reduce the heat exchange rate the saturation indices of common scale components calcite aragonite caco3 and iron feooh fe oh 3 compounds were calculated based on the chemical composition of the groundwater all groundwater was undersaturated for caco3 and feooh and fe oh 3 precipitated in all regions except for some areas however the amount of precipitation was not expected to be significant due to the low iron concentration graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater isotope chemistry heat utilization alluvial fan 1 introduction ground source heat pumps gshps utilize the thermostatic properties of groundwater and can be used for indoor heating and cooling as well as for melting snow on roads which may solve the problem of ground subsidence caused by pumping groundwater the use of gshps is a widespread approach globally e g huttrer 1997 diao et al 2004 lee and hahn 2006 fujii et al 2007 russo et al 2011 there are two types of gshps as follows open and closed type loops fig 1 in regions with abundant groundwater the open type method using existing wells is appropriate e g wang et al 2012 in open type gshps groundwater is pumped up to the surface exchanged for heat in a heat exchanger and then returned to the aquifer through a reinjection well conversely in closed type gshps heat exchange is carried out underground by burying u shaped pipes and using antifreeze if this type of gshp is used as a heat source for melting snow on roads and for indoor air conditioning it will not only reduce the decrease in groundwater levels in the area but will also be highly effective in terms of energy saving closed and open gshps do not discharge groundwater to the ground surface thus do not cause environmental pollution or land subsidence and can be used as a potential solution to the significant drop in groundwater levels in winter however for long term use of open type gshps a constant supply of groundwater is required and it is important to monitor changes in groundwater temperature and quality in order to maintain the heat exchange rate of the system analysis by hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of groundwater and river waters can contribute greatly to this method to discuss the origin and flow mode of groundwater hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition analysis is very useful and many research with chemical composition analysis have been reported worldwide e g kendall and mcdonnell 1999 davisson et al 1999 kumar et al 2015 2016 qian and li 2011 muñoz et al 2015 yuan et al clark

and coastal salinization e g krishan et al 2019 2020 2021 lapworth et al 2021 iwatake and ueda 2021 matsuura et al 2021 the kurobe river fan located in the northeastern part of toyama prefecture japan is known for its abundance of groundwater the slope of the river is steep due to the short distance less than 50 km between the tateyama mountain range ca 3000 m elevation and the coast fig 2 a the snow that falls on the tateyama mountain range melts and becomes a rich source of groundwater for the kurobe river alluvial fan groundwater in this area is characterized by low concentrations of dissolved chemicals shimano et al 1992 matsuura et al 2021 and is used for a variety of purposes with 132 million tons year of groundwater pumped toyama prefecture 2018 of this amount approximately 30 million tons are annually pumped and used for melting snow on roads the groundwater level drops by more than 5 m in winter due to pumping for snow removal this lowering of the groundwater level is one of the causes of land subsidence with some areas having abated 86 mm in the past 16 years and groundwater salinization is also increasing in the coastal areas toyama prefecture 2018 subsurface temperature is approximately constant below 10 m depth and is 1 c 2 c higher than the average temperature in the area e g kawasaki et al 1987 the annual average temperature in the alluvial fan of the kurobe river has been 14 4 c for the past 20 years japan meteorological agency 2021 and accordingly groundwater temperature is expected to be about 15 c 16 c the primary goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the groundwater flow in the kurobe river alluvial fan to inform agriculture and industry and to improve heat energy utilization via geothermal heat pump room air conditioning greenhouse cultivation etc matsuura et al 2021 have been monitoring the temperature and electric conductivity ec values of river water and groundwater in the kurobe river catchment for 9 years since 2011 the groundwater in the kurobe river fan in the study area was extensively surveyed in 2012 and 2013 and the water temperature and ec values were preliminarily reported the age of the groundwater in the kurobe alluvium fan was estimated to be more than a decade based on the results of tritium analysis matsuura et al 2017 in this study the hydrogen and oxygen isotope and chemical compositions of the samples collected in 2012 and 2013 were analyzed to investigate the source and flow conditions of groundwater in the fan furthermore the behavior of scale components precipitated from the groundwater during heat use was analyzed to investigate the applicability of an open type gshp for thermal application 2 geological and hydrogeological overview of the study area the kurobe river is located in the northeastern part of toyama prefecture japan it originates from mt washu and has a trunk river channel length of 85 km and a basin area of 682 km2 fig 2a the kurobe river fan has an attractive fan shape with a distance of 13 4 km from the top of the fan to the mouth an area of 96 km2 and a 1 100 slope exhibiting concentric contours fig 2a this is the result of the almost uniform deposition of sand and gravel from the upper reaches of the kurobe river as it transitions from left to right on the fan shaped surface shimano et al 1992 the geological map of the study area is shown in fig 2b aist 2015 the mountainous area of the kurobe river basin is formed from mesozoic and quaternary igneous rock such as granite and granodiorite and the kurobe fan is covered by sand and gravel beds which are quaternary fan deposits the main aquifers in the kurobe river fan are the present fan deposits pleistocene paleo fan deposits and the sand and gravel layers of the kureha mountain formation a small number of continuous clay layers serve as impermeable layers in the present fan and paleo fan deposits near the top and middle of the fan in terms of rock types granodiorite is the most common among those larger than 3 cm in diameter followed by gneissic granodiorite gneissic quartz diorite gneiss acid volcanic rock a small amount of andesite and a small amount of mesozoic fine grained pebbles crystalline schist and limestone sumi et al 1989 geological cross sections of the central region within the kurobe alluvium fan are shown in fig 2c these were compiled from the geological data of groundwater wells about 100 m depth within the fan tebakari et al 2016 it consists of three layers from the top to the edge of the fan the surface layer is 20 100 m of fan deposits the second layer is covered by a rather thin layer of old fan deposits and the third layer is the kureha formation late miocene marine formation and sandstone few clay layers are observed in this cross section fujii et al 2007 reported that the main aquifers in the kurobe river fan are the present fan deposits pleistocene paleo fan deposits and the gravel and sand layers of the kureha formation tebakari et al 2016 concluded that these formations macroscopically contain groundwater as a series of aquifers and most of the groundwater is considered to be unconfined groundwater however in some areas at the edge of the fan clay layers are interbedded in a layered or lenticular manner and the groundwater is pressurized artesian groundwater and has been used as living water since ancient times it also forms an upwelling zone at the sea bottom through the highly permeable sand and gravel layer old river channel that is sandwiched between the clay layers zhang and satake 2003 this sand and gravel layer can also be found in the present river channel section the depth of groundwater pumping increased from approximately 1970 to 1990 shimano et al 1992 currently there are some cases in which groundwater is pumped from 30 m or deeper at the fan edge and from just above the basement rock at the center and top of the fan 3 sample location and analysis procedures groundwater samples were collected at 67 locations in 2012 and based on the results 45 locations were sampled in 2013 similarly river water samples were collected at 4 locations in 2012 and 3 locations in 2013 table 1 and fig 2a the groundwater was taken at a shallow 20 50 m depth water samples were collected for dissolved chemical components and stable isotope ratios in two polyethylene bottles which were rinsed with sample water three times filled with water up to the bottle mouth and covered with a lid to prevent air from entering as much as possible because the groundwater and river water samples were colorless and transparent filtration was not carried out in the field for major chemical and isotope analyses to analyze the fe and sio2 concentrations of groundwater 50 ml of water filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter and given a ph level of 2 or less by adding 1 ml of a 6 n hcl solution was sampled in the field measurements water temperatures were measured using a digital water thermometer yi chun waterproof digital thermometer ph values were measured by a portable ph meter toa hm 31 p ec values were measured by a portable conductivity meter toa cm 31 p and redox potential orp measurements were obtained using an orp meter toa rm 12 p the δd values were determined using the chromium cr reduction method itai and kusakabe 2004 the oxygen isotope δ18o compositions of the water samples were determined after pretreatment using a co2 h2o isotope exchange equilibrium epstein and mayeda 1953 at 25 c the δd and δ18o values were obtained using a mass spectrometer isoprime 100 isoprime the results were reported relative to the v smow with an analytical precision in this phase of 1 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o respectively the major components na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 of water sample were measured using ion chromatography metrohm 761 compact ic additionally dionex dx 320 j and ionpac as s22 columns were used to separate the cation and anion components respectively and the analytical error for each component concentration was less than 5 alkalinity hco3 was determined as ph 4 8 by the acid titration method and converted to hco3 concentrations as described in jis japanese industrial standards jis k0102 1 the dissolved sio2 was measured by a molybdate yellow method using a spectrophotometer uv vis shimadzu the charge balance err scat san scat san 100 s cat and an mean total cation and anion respectively appelo and postma 1993 was 2 to 10 in the water samples charge balance affects the total amount of dissolved constituents in groundwater e g williams et al 2009 who point out that most data fall within 10 below 2 meql l similar to the present results the reason why the cation is slightly higher in this analysis result is probably due to unanalyzed anion components such as f 4 results and discussion the results obtained in this study are shown in table 2 and figs 3 9 where the sample location numbers correspond to those in table 1 and fig 2a 4 1 physiochemical parameters data on water temperature and ec of groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan have been preliminarily reported by matsuura et al 2021 and the results for july 2012 as well as observations of river water are shown in fig 3a in the central to eastern part of the right bank region of the kurobe river the water temperature was constant at 16 c 2 c except for the selected sampling points and showed slightly lower temperatures in the coastal area conversely in the left bank area groundwater with a temperature above 20 c existed on the mountainside near the mouth of the kurobe river however this value was rather low at approximately 10 c the water temperature difference was within 5 c between 2012 and 2013 in the central part of the fan along the kurobe river because of the large amount of infiltration from rivers in the subsidence section however the temperature difference became larger with an increase in the distance from the kurobe river and the water temperature difference was also remarkably evident in the groundwater in the point close to the terrace planes matsuura et al 2021 water temperature is an important natural tracer for understanfing the groundwater flow because the residence time of groundwater can be estimated by comparing the temperature and air temperature of groundwater and river water e g anderson 2005 baena et al 2009 konishi et al 2020 the groundwater temperature was constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more and groundwater with a residence time of one year or more showed temperatures equal to or slightly lower than the annual average temperature e g yamamoto 1992 bartolino and niswonger 1999 bartolino 2003 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 based on the observed water temperature results the groundwater residence time was likely to have been more than one year in areas where the water temperature in the right bank region was close to the average air temperature the low temperature groundwater in coastal areas was more likely to have been infiltrated by precipitation originating from the higher elevation of mountainous areas than from river water as denoted by matsuura et al 2021 the ec value of the groundwater in the kurobe alluvial fan fell within the range of 58 227 μs cm except for sample point s 21 369 μs cm tended to be lower along the kurobe and ogawa rivers and increased with distance from these rivers fig 3b in contrast groundwater in the left bank area was characterized by the fact that no groundwater exceeded 200 μs cm the difference in ec values between 2012 and 2013 was a decrease of 50 100 μs cm in the upper reaches of the left bank of the kurobe river while other areas showed slight variations in the range of 50 μs cm matsuura et al 2021 4 2 chemical composition of groundwater the major chemical compositions of the groundwater and river water are shown in table 2 the piper 1944 and stiff diagrams 1951 of the samples collected in august 2012 are shown in fig 5a b respectively there was no significant difference in the chemical compositions between 2012 and 2013 table 2 most of the groundwater was identified as ca2 hco3 type which is similar to the composition of groundwater in the sho river and toyama alluvial fans e g iwatake et al 2013 hirata et al 2021 mori et al 2020 iwatake and ueda 2021 near the study area in the groundwater ca2 and hco3 concentrations increased with distance from the kurobe river and the ec values also increased figs 3b and 5b the relationship between ca2 and hco3 concentrations in groundwater is shown in fig 5c the two straight lines in fig 5c show equations 2 and 3 and most of the water samples showed compositions along the line 3 this was interpreted as a mixture of precipitation and river water dissolving carbonate minerals such as limestone which was previously reported to be present in sediment sumi et al 1989 the dissolution reactions of limestone to form dissolved bicarbonate and calcium ions can be described as follows 2 c a c o 3 h 2 o c a 2 h c o 3 o h if co2 is available from the atmosphere and or decomposition of organic matter the equations for carbonate dissolution can be given as follows 3 c a c o 3 h 2 o c o 2 c a 2 2 h c o 3 from the line of equation 3 there is groundwater enriched in hco3 however this water is most likely the result of ion exchange reactions with clay and other materials following the reaction with limestone and ca2 was replaced with na and k 4 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of groundwater the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in 2012 within the study area ranged from 79 to 53 and from 12 5 to 8 5 respectively table 2a and they were plotted near the local meteoric water line fig 4a which in turn was plotted close to the d 20 value of δd 8δ18o d craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 for groundwater samples in 2013 only δ18o was analyzed which ranged from 12 8 to 9 0 consistent with the results of 2012 table 2b river water from the kurobe river was sampled at three locations from upstream to downstream in the alluvial fan area fig 2a however no significant differences were found based on the δd and δ18o values of 83 and 13 2 to 13 0 respectively table 2a and b in contrast the ogawa river water showed higher values of 60 and 10 4 fig 4a compared with those of the kurobe river fig 4a also shows the monthly precipitation values for the period ranging from may 2012 to may 2015 which ranged from 10 to 30 for the d value of the meteoric water line these precipitation values were observed by okakita et al 2019 at site p 1 in the region fig 2a okakita et al 2019 analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of precipitation at eight locations in toyama prefecture and nearby areas for two years and reported that the compositions were around the d 10 line in summer and d 30 in winter it is interpreted that this is caused by air masses from the pacific ocean in summer and from continental air masses in winter the d values of groundwater and river water in this study area are almost around 20 fig 4a since the okakita data lacked measurements for march 2013 using data from april 2013 to march 2014 the mean values of δd and δ18o for precipitation during this year considering all precipitation amounts were calculated as 63 6 and 9 8 respectively this value was within the range of variation for the groundwater values in contrast the mean value of precipitation in toyama city 30 km southwest of the study area during the period of 1982 1995 was reported to be as high as 8 5 0 5 in terms of δ18o values mizutani and satake 1997 this is represented in fig 4a as a broken square the residence time of groundwater in this fan area was estimated to be less than 60 years based on the tritium concentrations matsuura et al 2017 if the groundwater was formed due to the mixture of precipitation and kurobe river water the δd and δ18o values of precipitation that explain the observed isotopic composition of the groundwater were likely 49 5 and 8 6 0 5 respectively the distribution of δ18o values of the groundwater in 2012 is shown in fig 4b groundwater with low δ18o values was distributed along the kurobe river this value rose as the distance from the river increased fig 4b in the area around the ogawa river δ18o values similar to those of river water were found in the right bank area but only in a small region in the left bank area assuming that the groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan is a simple mixture of precipitation and kurobe river water the mixing ratio of precipitation and river water and how it infiltrates underground were investigated in this calculation it was assumed that there is little evaporation when precipitation infiltrates into the ground the water mixing ratio was examined using the δ18o values obtained in this study the contribution of precipitation to groundwater is shown in equation 1 1 p e r c e n t of co n t r i b u t i o n δ 18 o g r o u n d w a t e r δ 18 o r i v e r w a t e r δ 18 o p e r c i p i t a t i o n δ 18 o r i v e r w a t e r 100 the δ18o values of precipitation and river water were set to 8 5 the annual weighted average of the precipitation over the years and 13 1 respectively considering the δ18o values of kurobe river water in this study and existing river water data in a study by mizutani and satake 1997 the percentages of precipitation in groundwater are shown in fig 4c the contribution of precipitation to groundwater was less than 20 in the area around the kurobe river indicating that a large amount of kurobe river water infiltrated into the groundwater but that precipitation also contributed to the groundwater even in areas near the river the further away from the kurobe river the higher the contribution rate became and it was judged that precipitation primarily infiltrated in particular the area near the top of the fan which was close to the mountain was assumed to be a precipitation origin in the area around the ogawa river river water may be seeping in the right bank area and only slightly in the left bank in contrast the groundwater near the mouth of the river indicates that river water is the main source but the water temperature is quite low about 12 c even though the sampling period was in july matsuura et al 2021 measured the water temperature and ec of river and groundwater in the kurobe river catchment area over a long period of time and pointed out that the origin of groundwater in this coastal area is high elevation ca 450 m river water infiltrating deep underground and gushing out as artesian groundwater in the coastal area which is also supported by the data of this study 4 4 origin of groundwater based on isotopic characteristics and degree of reaction with rock the ec value of the groundwater in the central area of the fan is about 10 times higher than that of precipitation and river water which is interpreted to mean that the groundwater reacted with the surrounding rocks during infiltrating and became rich in chemical components especially ca2 and hco3 figs 3b and 5b fig 6a shows the degree of rock water reaction proposed by gibbs 1970 and the smaller the na na ca2 ratio the more advanced the reaction with the rock indicating that the groundwater in the study area is judged to have a relatively advanced rock water reaction in this study more details for the groundwater sources and the extent of rock water reactions were discussed by simultaneously evaluating these na na ca2 weight ratios and δ18o values of groundwater fig 6b the na na ca2 of the precipitation data in fig 6b are taken from a study conducted by yasuda et al 1991 and the δ18o value was set to 8 5 0 5 based on data provided in mizutani and satake 1997 the groundwater in the study area had a triangular composition surrounded by the three end members i e river water precipitation and precipitation that had reacted with rock materials referred to here as mature precipitation this suggests that the groundwater was formed by mixing these three end components in arbitrary proportions among these data the groundwater where precipitation is considered to have simply mixed with river water and hardly reacted with rocks is located at the s 57 point upstream of the left bank of the kurobe river the groundwater with a composition closest to that of mature precipitation is located at the s 42 point upstream of the right bank the concentration of sio2 in groundwater is also one of the components to evaluate rock water reactions katsuyama et al 2005 narimiya et al 2009 ishibashi et al 2012 gbadebo et al 2013 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 marçais et al 2018 sospedra et al 2018 sio2 in groundwater is derived from glassy and minerals such as plagioclase in rocks but its dissolution rate is known to be slower than that of carbonate minerals e g lasaga 1998 as the ec value of the groundwater increases the ca concentration increases linearly with the dissolution of carbonate minerals fig 7a but the same linear increase is observed for sio2 fig 7b except for some groundwater when groundwater reacts with rocks it becomes enriched in ca2 and hco3 under the influence of easily soluble limestone the groundwater with high sio2 concentration in fig 7b is characterized by its distribution at the top of the fan fig 7c although the sio2 concentration is a component that does not affect the ec value the fact that it is increasing as the ec increases due to the progressive reaction with carbonate minerals indicates that the reaction with the rock is also progressing in particular the distribution area of high sio2 concentration groundwater indicates that the rocks in this area have been reacting for a long period of time and that the rocks are likely to leach silica more easily than other areas within the alluvial fan of the kurobe river quaternary fan deposits sand and gravel beds are predominant but terrace deposits and non marine sedimentary rocks are distributed around the top of the fan fig 2b sumi et al 1989 the reason for the high sio2 in the groundwater near the top of the fan is assumed to be due to the reaction with these sedimentary rocks but the detailed cause is unknown so far 4 5 scale precipitation to safely use gshps water movement and groundwater quality are important parameters to be considered in particular the use of open type gshps is recommended in areas with high groundwater flow such as the kurobe river alluvial fan because they are inexpensive when an open type gshp is used groundwater is pumped and heat is exchanged on the ground accordingly caco3 feooh goethite and fe oh 3 scales may precipitate in the heat exchangers and pipes the possibility of scale precipitation in the groundwater of the kurobe river alluvial fan was studied by calculating the saturation index s i of the scale components the s i was defined using the following equation and calculated using a phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 4 s i l o g q k where q is the activity product calculated using the chemical analysis value for the groundwater and k is the equilibrium constant of the mineral solubility product when s i was less than 0 mineral precipitation did not take place because the groundwater was undersaturated in terms of minerals when the s i was greater than 0 mineral precipitation could take place owing to supersaturation for carbonate components groundwater in the study area was found to be undersaturated although the saturation index of caco3 increased with an increasing ph fig 8a aragonite a type of calcium carbonate was also examined and showed values similar to those of calcite for the fe compound scale the fe oh 3 component was supersaturated with an increased s i as the fe concentration increased fig 8b goethite was supersaturated in all groundwater samples this indicated that the precipitation of fe compounds was likely to precipitate in a heat exchanger when groundwater with a high fe concentration was used for gshps the same result groundwater being supersaturated with fe compounds was reported in other alluvial fan groundwater samples collected in toyama prefecture iwatake and ueda 2021 mori et al 2020 hirata et al 2021 even if it is supersaturated as in the case of fe compounds if the fe concentration is small it can be handled by periodic cleaning of the heat pump or filter in fact an open type heat pump that has been operating for more than five years in the sho river alluvium fan area only needs to clean the filter installed in front of the heat exchanger once every few months kushida et al 2012 the concentration of fe in groundwater in the study area ranged from a low of 0 01 μg l at the lower limit of detection to a maximum of 5 μg l the concentration was higher in the central area of the right bank area of the kurobe river and nearer to the coast and lower in the left bank area and the region around ogawa river fig 9a the concentration of fe in groundwater varied with the oxidation reduction state orp and the more reductive the groundwater the higher the concentration of fe dissolved as fe2 okakita et al 2019 reported that the fe concentration in groundwater in okayama city became lower with higher orp values and at orps above 100 mv the fe concentration was less than 100 μg l the orp of groundwater in the study area showed oxidative values ranging from 100 to 800 mv with low values in the right bank area and coastal regions of the kurobe river and high values in some areas upstream of the right bank fig 9b the iron concentration was 5 μg l in all areas which was much lower compared with results for okayama city this was presumably because the groundwater in okayama city is based on granite whereas in the study area groundwater flows through fan deposits and the fe concentration in the reactive rocks is low the saturation index of fe oh 3 in the groundwater was lower than 0 in the eastern fan area and higher near the kurobe river fig 9c this high saturation index was interpreted as a result of the higher orp value and fe concentration in this area 4 6 assessment of the suitability of groundwater for heat utilization to ensure the efficient use of gshps the groundwater temperature must remain constant throughout the year alternatively even if the water temperature fluctuates yearly the air temperature differences must be large and the thermal efficiency should be high in terms of water quality it is also important for the long term operation of gshps that there be no precipitation of calcium carbonate or fe compounds alternatively if precipitation occurs it must be only in small amounts the temperature of the groundwater in the study area indicated a broad range 10 c 25 c but most areas showed a temperature of 16 c 2 c this was slightly higher than the average annual temperature of the region 14 4 c over the past 20 years japan meteorological agency 2021 indicating that this groundwater had been retained for at least one year the residence time estimated by the measurement of tritium concentration in the groundwater in this fan area is approximately 30 years matsuura et al 2017 this indicated that except for a few areas the temperature of the groundwater in this region remained essentially constant the ec values of the groundwater in the study area were characterized by low values ranging from 70 to 194 μs cm one sample except for s 21 although they increased with distance from the kurobe river the groundwater in the study area was the ca2 hco3 type which was similar to other alluvial fan groundwater in toyama prefecture this can be denoted as a characteristic of alluvial fan groundwater in toyama prefecture which includes a high level of precipitation and flows from the 3000 m high mountain range to the sea through fan shaped areas within a few tens of kilometers okakita et al 2019 examination of the scale components indicated that the groundwater in the study area was undersaturated with respect to calcite but may precipitate fe compounds such as feooh and fe oh 3 kawada industries situated in the sho river alluvial fan and where the formation of this fe scale has been observed during the use of gshps has responded by cleaning the filter every two months kushida et al 2012 since the concentration of fe in groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan is lower than 5 μg compared with groundwater in other fan areas even if fe scale precipitates it is not considered a major problem and can be addressed by cleaning the filter the final recommended area for an open type gshp using groundwater in the study area is shown in fig 10 water temperature groundwater flow pattern and scale components are considered to determine the regions where an open type gshp can be applied for groundwater heat utilization since the groundwater flow is abundant in this region groundwater can be used for heat utilization in almost all areas in particular the areas along the kurobe and ogawa rivers area a in fig 10 are suitable because they are constantly supplied with water from rivers and precipitation and the water temperature is almost constant throughout the year in contrast the upstream area along the right bank of the kurobe river can be used for open type gshps although the difference between the water and air temperatures is not as large as in area a in region c the fe concentration is higher than in other regions therefore frequent gshp filter cleaning will be necessary in addition the water temperature in region d is high in summer and originates from precipitation which makes heat use difficult 5 conclusions the groundwater system of the kurobe river alluvial fan area was roughly classified and its water quality characteristics and recharge sources were identified the results showed that the water quality concentration was low due to the dilution effect from the river and that open type gshps are appropriate for use in this region however the groundwater level is based on the flow rate of the river which must be addressed in the central part of the fan area groundwater ec is high and ca2 and hco3 concentrations are also high calcium carbonate and other substances do not precipitate at these water temperatures but there is a risk of scale precipitation as the temperature increases as a result the heat exchange aspect of gshps and piping may experience issues where the heat exchange rate decreases accordingly regular valve cleaning work will be necessary such as using a closed type gshp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11853,the primary goal of this research is to demarcate aquifers favorable for groundwater development in the border district of rajouri in the union territory of jammu and kashmir in order to secure a long term water supply the schlumberger configuration resistivity survey technique vertical electrical sounding ves is used to investigate the characteristics of the subsurface layer and the potential of groundwater by using 30 ves sites in order to establish the optimum sites for digging a successful borehole for the qualitative and quantitative interpretations in the study area it is determined that real resistivity values of subsurface geoelectric layers less than 35 ohm m indicate the existence of finer sediments whilst moderate resistivity values ranging from 35 to 100 ohm m suggest the presence of coarser sediments favorable for groundwater development the resistivity value between 100 and 200 ohm m indicates weathered formation 200 400 ohm m indicates fractured rock and more than 400 ohm m represents hard formation which is devoid of any kind of groundwater development the bedrock resistivity nature of the curve and overburden thickness are the parameters utilized to

the source of energy that keeps life on the planet alive water is becoming increasingly important as the population s demands and requirements rise groundwater depletion is a result of recurrent monsoon failure and overexploitation of water resources in several regions of india unfortunately due to the ever increasing demand for water resources various repercussions of unsustainable groundwater usage are becoming increasingly apparent maintaining a long term sustainable yield from aquifers is one of the primary problems todd and mays 2005 jha et al 2006 singh et al 2017 khan et

2021 groundwater evaluation is one of the most important management parameters of exploration in india where economic constraints and other related issues necessitate appropriate planning for effective exploration as a result in order to determine the actual results of hydrogeological studies we must establish an effective correlation between lithological data from tube wells and resistivity field data particularly in non homogeneous and an isotropic aquifers in the hilly region of the outer himalayas as the current study focuses on estimating aquifer conditions using ves resistivity data and identifying aquifer conditions 2 study area the study area is a border region of rajouri in the union territory of jammu and kashmir india surrounded on the north by steep mountains and on the south by the siwalik hills and lies between 33 00 00 and 33 35 20 n and 74 08 00 and 74 42 30 e fig 1 a and the elevation of the study area fig 1b varies from 310 to 4608 m above mean sea level amsl the climate in the study region ranges from semitropical in the southern portion of the district which includes shera sunderbani and kalakote to temperate in the northern half which includes thannamandi rajouri and koteranka the southern semitropical region has frequent monsoons whilst the northern temperate zone experiences hailstorms and heavy rain the average annual rainfall is 1150 mm with the most of it falling during the southwest monsoon from july to september the remainder of the year is irregular and sparse with average temperatures ranging from 7 42 c to 37 40 c the manawar tawi which originates in the northern mountainous region is the sole river that flows through rajouri and joins the chenab river at pallanwala akhnoor 2 1 geology in general rocks from the pre cambrian to the quaternary periods are highlighted in the research area table 1 shows the geological sequence the geological map was prepared by using landsat 8 oli data sets fig 1c our research is focused on the southern siwalik groups upper siwaliks and middle siwaliks where the upper is mostly light grey medium to coarse sandstone with a few clay stones and the middle siwaliks are mostly medium to coarse grained sandstones and lesser grey brown mudstone with coarsening upward in sequence and firmer to the upper siwalik taloor et al 2020 the sandstones are dominated by coarse grained sandstone and pink grey mudstone which are highly compacted with silt and clay the murree group which spans about 70 of the research region and consists of monotonous grey sandstone brown to yellowish subordinate mudstone siltstone and clay is the most important geological group in the study area the murree group is separated from siwalik in the north by the murree thrust and from the lower himalayan units of older crystalline and metamorphic rocks in the south by the mandli kishanpur thrust mkt which is a component of the main boundary thrust mbt the lower himalayan crystalline unit lhcs is defined by slate and shale as well as low grade gneisses and is bordered to the north by the main central thrust mct and to the south by the main central thrust mbt the high himalayan proterozoic rock comprises of high grade metamorphic rocks such as higher grade schist and gneiss in the top northern portions and farther northward meets the upper triassic layers in the tethyan himalaya 2 2 hydrogeology due to hilly nature and structurally controlled hydrology of the study area it is quite difficult to determine the hydrogeological zones based on the lithology of the sediments and groundwater resources the study area is divided in to four zones 2 2 1 younger alluvial a small portion of alluvial plains created by the manawar tawi and its tributaries falls under the alluvial deposits that cover the manawar tawi river beds and a small area of alluvial plains developed by the manawar tawi and its tributaries is permitted for groundwater development the main porosity and permeability of these deposits are very high 2 2 2 siwalik group shallow drilled wells on younger alluvium strata provide a low to moderate groundwater flow in situ filtration of rainfall and subsurface flows from adjacent streams and nalahs are used to recharge these alluvial aquifers these alluvial aquifers are limited to a maximum depth of 12 15 m below ground level the secondary porosity inherent in these zones on the other hand makes it an ideal location for ground water development 2 2 3 murree group although the murree group lacks primary porosity groundwater can be found in the form of springs at the intersection of permeable and impermeable layers as well as other structural characteristics spring formation is more common where the water table is disturbed by the terrain the springs can be found in a variety of forms at various altitudes across the research region the lithological and structural characteristics of the rock formation in the area determine the occurrence of spring fig 1d 2 2 4 crystalline rocks the crystalline rocks are devoid of primary porosity although secondary porosity and glacier melt in the study area keep the streams almost perineal throughout the year the springs and nalahs are the main sources of drinking water supply besides this shallow water hand pump along the streams is a major source 3 methodology the electrical resistivity of a substance is defined as the resistance unit ohm available between two opposing sides of a unit cube of the material regardless of form or size the ohm meter is the most often used unit measuring resistivity the capacity of a water bearing geologic formation to transmit electric current through matrix and interstitial water in the pore spaces determines its bulk resistivity to identify changes in the electrical characteristics of the subsurface electrical geophysical techniques are utilized water concentration salt content mineralogical clay content the presence of metallic minerals and porosity all influence the electrical characteristics of rocks and soils however the bulk resistivity is naturally influenced by the water s resistivity rather than the rock or soil type changes in the electrical characteristics of rocks and soils create variations in the electrical signature detected by surface geophysical instruments which can be vertical or horizontal to the extent that variations in lithology or rock type are accompanied by differences in resistivity changes in the received signal can be linked to changes in the extent composition and physical characteristics of the rocks and soils within the subsurface to successfully identify these differences the property being measured must have a contrast and the target to be identified must have attributes that are considerably different from the background circumstances using ohm s law the electrical resistance of sub surface geologic formations is measured by electrifying the sub surface and taking measurements on the ground surface fig 2 it is observable when the resistivity value of an individual layer differs from the surrounding or effective presence depending on its relative resistivity and thickness in this method a known amount of electrical current i is sent into the ground through a pair of electrodes called current electrodes and the potential δv developed as a result of the resistance offered by the sub surface as a result of the current s passage is measured across another pair of electrodes called potential electrodes planted in the ground the resistance r of the ground to a depth depends on the distance between the two current electrodes and the ratio between the potential measured and the corresponding current delivered into the ground through the multiplication of this value of r by a geometric factor a parameter called the apparent resistivity ρa is computed both the parameters of apparent resistivity ρa and the resistance r contain information on the geo electric characteristics of the subsurface 3 1 vertical electrical sounding geophysical resistivity surveys are commonly used to determine the electrical resistivity of the subsurface by using ves as 1d vertical resolution depth wise resistivity variation profiling for information of lateral resistivity variation is used to carry out the measurements on the ground with the help an instrument known as terrameter sas 300c in all 30 ves were done in the region to investigate the underlying geologic layers with the goal of estimating the depth of the bedrock and layer thickness the vertical depth wise fluctuations in the subsurface resistivity are measured in ves this is accomplished by imposing an electrical field in the ground using a pair of electrodes of varied spacing spreading symmetrically from a central point then measuring the surface expression of the resulting potential field with the second pair of electrodes at the appropriate spacing fig 3 a b in practice there exist several configurations but the most commonly used are the wenner and schlumberger configurations for schlumberger array of current electrodes c1 and c2 or a and b and potential electrodes p1 and p2 or m and n the apparent resistivity ρa is expressed by following the equation ρa 2 π r ab 2 mn 2 ab 2 mn 2 mn where r resistance r v i i is the current introduced in the earth v is the potential difference between the potential electrodes ab distance between the current electrodes a and b and mn distance between the potential electrodes m and n on a double logarithmic scale paper with moduli 62 5 mm the values of apparent resistivity ρa product of resistance and geometric factor in ohm m are shown against the corresponding half current electrode spacing for the preliminary quantitative interpretation of the ves curve the semi empirical auxiliary point technique is employed with the aid of two layer master curves and auxiliary point charts mooney et al 1966 orellana and mooney 1966 the resistivity and depth of several interface layers under the surface are determined by the interpreted result the acquired apparent resistivity values were additionally processed and interpreted using the computer aided programs sclum aimrev and ipi2win to refine the manually interpreted findings using the automated curve matching approach in these computer assisted curve matching programs an initial model is provided for which the computer generates a theoretical curve and compares it to the field curve then it takes the difference between the recomputed and field curves and modifies the old model parameters to begin with a new model for reducing the difference error it calculates a new theoretical curve and compares it to the field curve once more then creates a new model to decrease the difference this iterative procedure continues until the error is reduced and the final model parameters are shown as a match between the field and theoretical curves to arrive at a realistic model any divergence of the calculated curves from the relevant field curves was adjusted smoothened while keeping in mind the local geology finally for each ves the geoelectrical layer characteristics layer resistivity and thickness are determined and shown in fig 4 a b 4 results and discussion to determine the groundwater potential in the study area a total of 30 ves sites were investigated in order to determine the favorable aquifers for groundwater prospects in site 1 at the thana mandi 1 ves 1 five subsurface geoelectric layers were identified having moderate to high resistivity values table 2 representing the presence of coarser sediments and weathered formation while at thana mandi 2 ves 2 four layers were detected but the depth of information is confined to shallow depth only and exploration work can be carried out at thana mandi 2 location in the chingus 1 ves 3 location three geoelectric layers were identified with a total depth 38 20 m the depth of layers 1 was 2 72 m thick with true resistivity of 39 ohm m representing the top soil whereas the depth of the second layer was calculated as 35 5 m thick with resistivity value of 210 ohm m indicating the presence of fresh water confined in fractured formation the thickness of the last layer is unknown and it the resistivity value was recorded 22 3 ohm m representing the presence of finer sediments at chingus 2 ves 4 four geoelectric layers were identified the thickness of first layer was 0 76 m with a resistivity of 16 ohm m as a topsoil layer the second and third layers composed of moderate resistivity values of thickness 2 1 and 13 7 respectively representing the presence of highly weathered formation saturated with freshwater availability whereas the last layer with unknown thickness having a resistivity value of 61 6 ohm indicates the presence of highly weathered formation make it favorable for geo exploration fig 4a for ves 1 15 the two ves 5 6 were conducted in panja village which is located in murree formations of oligocene age and the obtained resistivity values were found to be suitable for ground water exploration however the thickness of last layer was unknown the resistivity value of last layers of the ves 5 and ves 6 was recorded 390 and 118 ohm m respectively represent the presence of weathered formations based on the comparison between ves 5 and ves 6 the later was found more suitable for ground water development in the village barohi two ves were conducted barohi 1 ves 7 and barohi 2 ves 8 in barohi 1 three sub surface layers were recorded with maximum resistivity value recorded at layer 3 295 ohm m with the thickness varies from 1 14 to 13 3 m in the ves 8 at barohi 2 five sub surface layers were obtained ranges of 20 6 283 ohm m the last layer indicates the presence of weathered formation as the value is 283 ohm m besides this three sub surface geo electric layers were identified at phali brahmana ves 9 and resistivity values were found favorable for ground water development the last layer with unknown thickness having a resistivity 85 2 ohm m which indicated the presence of highly weathered formation in the village pukharni two ves 10 11 were conducted which is located a few kilometres from the border of india and pakistan along the line of control loc in the pukharni 1 ves 10 four geo electric layers were identified the second and last layer have moderate resistivity value 35 45 ohm m which indicate the presence of fresh ground water and seems to be confined to shallow depth in the pukharni 2 site ves 11 five layers were identified and favorable resistivity value was obtained for the fifth layer 114 ohm m with a total thickness of 14 80 m in the lamberi village two ves 12 13 were conducted along the kishanpur mandli thrust mkt at lamberi 1 ves 12 last layer shown favorable resistivity value of 54 65 ohm m while in the second and third layer 30 ohm m low resistivity values were obtained which indicate the presence of finer sediments the central ground water board cgwb government of india has already constructed an exploratory borehole at lamberi 1 in the lamberi 2 the resistivity values are favorable fourth and sixth layers with resistivity value of 115 and 139 ohm m respectively but for shallow depth only in the laroka 1 and laroka 2 ves 14 15 the groundwater conditions are not favorable for exploration in laroka 1 ves 14 four subsurface layers were identified the last layer having a high resistivity value 1608 ohm m which may be indicative of the presence

a long term water supply the schlumberger configuration resistivity survey technique vertical electrical sounding ves is used to investigate the characteristics of the subsurface layer and the potential of groundwater by using 30 ves sites in order to establish the optimum sites for digging a successful borehole for the qualitative and quantitative interpretations in the study area it is determined that real resistivity values of subsurface geoelectric layers less than 35 ohm m indicate the existence of finer sediments whilst moderate resistivity values ranging from 35 to 100 ohm m suggest the presence of coarser sediments favorable for groundwater development the resistivity value between 100 and 200 ohm m indicates weathered formation 200 400 ohm m indicates fractured rock and

the source of energy that keeps life on the planet alive water is becoming increasingly important as the population s demands and requirements rise groundwater depletion is a result of recurrent monsoon failure and overexploitation of water resources in several regions of india unfortunately due to the ever increasing demand for water resources various repercussions of unsustainable groundwater usage are becoming increasingly apparent maintaining a long term sustainable yield from aquifers is one of the primary problems todd and mays 2005 jha et al 2006 singh et al 2017 khan et

2021 groundwater evaluation is one of the most important management parameters of exploration in india where economic constraints and other related issues necessitate appropriate planning for effective exploration as a result in order to determine the actual results of hydrogeological studies we must establish an effective correlation between lithological data from tube wells and resistivity field data particularly in non homogeneous and an isotropic aquifers in the hilly region of the outer himalayas as the current study focuses on estimating aquifer conditions using ves resistivity data and identifying aquifer conditions 2 study area the study area is a border region of rajouri in the union territory of jammu and kashmir india surrounded on the north by steep mountains and on the south by the siwalik hills and lies between 33 00 00 and 33 35 20 n and 74 08 00 and 74 42 30 e fig 1 a and the elevation of the study area fig 1b varies from 310 to 4608 m above mean sea level amsl the climate in the study region ranges from semitropical in the southern portion of the district which includes shera sunderbani and kalakote to temperate in the northern half which includes thannamandi rajouri and koteranka the southern semitropical region has frequent monsoons whilst the northern temperate zone experiences hailstorms and heavy rain the average annual rainfall is 1150 mm with the most of it falling during the southwest monsoon from july to september the remainder of the year is irregular and sparse with average temperatures ranging from 7 42 c to 37 40 c the manawar tawi which originates in the northern mountainous region is the sole river that flows through rajouri and joins the chenab river at pallanwala akhnoor 2 1 geology in general rocks from the pre cambrian to the quaternary periods are highlighted in the research area table 1 shows the geological sequence the geological map was prepared by using landsat 8 oli data sets fig 1c our research is focused on the southern siwalik groups upper siwaliks and middle siwaliks where the upper is mostly light grey medium to coarse sandstone with a few clay stones and the middle siwaliks are mostly medium to coarse grained sandstones and lesser grey brown mudstone with coarsening upward in sequence and firmer to the upper siwalik taloor et al 2020 the sandstones are dominated by coarse grained sandstone and pink grey mudstone which are highly compacted with silt and clay the murree group which spans about 70 of the research region and consists of monotonous grey sandstone brown to yellowish subordinate mudstone siltstone and clay is the most important geological group in the study area the murree group is separated from siwalik in the north by the murree thrust and from the lower himalayan units of older crystalline and metamorphic rocks in the south by the mandli kishanpur thrust mkt which is a component of the main boundary thrust mbt the lower himalayan crystalline unit lhcs is defined by slate and shale as well as low grade gneisses and is bordered to the north by the main central thrust mct and to the south by the main central thrust mbt the high himalayan proterozoic rock comprises of high grade metamorphic rocks such as higher grade schist and gneiss in the top northern portions and farther northward meets the upper triassic layers in the tethyan himalaya 2 2 hydrogeology due to hilly nature and structurally controlled hydrology of the study area it is quite difficult to determine the hydrogeological zones based on the lithology of the sediments and groundwater resources the study area is divided in to four zones 2 2 1 younger alluvial a small portion of alluvial plains created by the manawar tawi and its tributaries falls under the alluvial deposits that cover the manawar tawi river beds and a small area of alluvial plains developed by the manawar tawi and its tributaries is permitted for groundwater development the main porosity and permeability of these deposits are very high 2 2 2 siwalik group shallow drilled wells on younger alluvium strata provide a low to moderate groundwater flow in situ filtration of rainfall and subsurface flows from adjacent streams and nalahs are used to recharge these alluvial aquifers these alluvial aquifers are limited to a maximum depth of 12 15 m below ground level the secondary porosity inherent in these zones on the other hand makes it an ideal location for ground water development 2 2 3 murree group although the murree group lacks primary porosity groundwater can be found in the form of springs at the intersection of permeable and impermeable layers as well as other structural characteristics spring formation is more common where the water table is disturbed by the terrain the springs can be found in a variety of forms at various altitudes across the research region the lithological and structural characteristics of the rock formation in the area determine the occurrence of spring fig 1d 2 2 4 crystalline rocks the crystalline rocks are devoid of primary porosity although secondary porosity and glacier melt in the study area keep the streams almost perineal throughout the year the springs and nalahs are the main sources of drinking water supply besides this shallow water hand pump along the streams is a major source 3 methodology the electrical resistivity of a substance is defined as the resistance unit ohm available between two opposing sides of a unit cube of the material regardless of form or size the ohm meter is the most often used unit measuring resistivity the capacity of a water bearing geologic formation to transmit electric current through matrix and interstitial water in the pore spaces determines its bulk resistivity to identify changes in the electrical characteristics of the subsurface electrical geophysical techniques are utilized water concentration salt content mineralogical clay content the presence of metallic minerals and porosity all influence the electrical characteristics of rocks and soils however the bulk resistivity is naturally influenced by the water s resistivity rather than the rock or soil type changes in the electrical characteristics of rocks and soils create variations in the electrical signature detected by surface geophysical instruments which can be vertical or horizontal to the extent that variations in lithology or rock type are accompanied by differences in resistivity changes in the received signal can be linked to changes in the extent composition and physical characteristics of the rocks and soils within the subsurface to successfully identify these differences the property being measured must have a contrast and the target to be identified must have attributes that are considerably different from the background circumstances using ohm s law the electrical resistance of sub surface geologic formations is measured by electrifying the sub surface and taking measurements on the ground surface fig 2 it is observable when the resistivity value of an individual layer differs from the surrounding or effective presence depending on its relative resistivity and thickness in this method a known amount of electrical current i is sent into the ground through a pair of electrodes called current electrodes and the potential δv developed as a result of the resistance offered by the sub surface as a result of the current s passage is measured across another pair of electrodes called potential electrodes planted in the ground the resistance r of the ground to a depth depends on the distance between the two current electrodes and the ratio between the potential measured and the corresponding current delivered into the ground through the multiplication of this value of r by a geometric factor a parameter called the apparent resistivity ρa is computed both the parameters of apparent resistivity ρa and the resistance r contain information on the geo electric characteristics of the subsurface 3 1 vertical electrical sounding geophysical resistivity surveys are commonly used to determine the electrical resistivity of the subsurface by using ves as 1d vertical resolution depth wise resistivity variation profiling for information of lateral resistivity variation is used to carry out the measurements on the ground with the help an instrument known as terrameter sas 300c in all 30 ves were done in the region to investigate the underlying geologic layers with the goal of estimating the depth of the bedrock and layer thickness the vertical depth wise fluctuations in the subsurface resistivity are measured in ves this is accomplished by imposing an electrical field in the ground using a pair of electrodes of varied spacing spreading symmetrically from a central point then measuring the surface expression of the resulting potential field with the second pair of electrodes at the appropriate spacing fig 3 a b in practice there exist several configurations but the most commonly used are the wenner and schlumberger configurations for schlumberger array of current electrodes c1 and c2 or a and b and potential electrodes p1 and p2 or m and n the apparent resistivity ρa is expressed by following the equation ρa 2 π r ab 2 mn 2 ab 2 mn 2 mn where r resistance r v i i is the current introduced in the earth v is the potential difference between the potential electrodes ab distance between the current electrodes a and b and mn distance between the potential electrodes m and n on a double logarithmic scale paper with moduli 62 5 mm the values of apparent resistivity ρa product of resistance and geometric factor in ohm m are shown against the corresponding half current electrode spacing for the preliminary quantitative interpretation of the ves curve the semi empirical auxiliary point technique is employed with the aid of two layer master curves and auxiliary point charts mooney et al 1966 orellana and mooney 1966 the resistivity and depth of several interface layers under the surface are determined by the interpreted result the acquired apparent resistivity values were additionally processed and interpreted using the computer aided programs sclum aimrev and ipi2win to refine the manually interpreted findings using the automated curve matching approach in these computer assisted curve matching programs an initial model is provided for which the computer generates a theoretical curve and compares it to the field curve then it takes the difference between the recomputed and field curves and modifies the old model parameters to begin with a new model for reducing the difference error it calculates a new theoretical curve and compares it to the field curve once more then creates a new model to decrease the difference this iterative procedure continues until the error is reduced and the final model parameters are shown as a match between the field and theoretical curves to arrive at a realistic model any divergence of the calculated curves from the relevant field curves was adjusted smoothened while keeping in mind the local geology finally for each ves the geoelectrical layer characteristics layer resistivity and thickness are determined and shown in fig 4 a b 4 results and discussion to determine the groundwater potential in the study area a total of

11854,with its arid and semi arid climate iran claims about one third of the world s average annual precipitation accordingly the present study investigated whether an effective water resources management wrm strategy both groundwater and reservoir resources could reduce groundwater drawdown while simultaneously providing secure enough water for preservation of agricultural activities and rural settlements for this purpose a comprehensive system dynamics sd model incorporating reservoir surface water and groundwater resources was developed then the model was implemented for the nesa plain in bam county iran as an example in this plain the construction of a dam to supply drinking water to the cities of bam and the bam industrial zone had devastated the environment and human communities in the downstream areas leading to the depopulation of as many as 104 villages in the bam region the results of the sd model revealed that the artificial recharge of the plain groundwater aquifer along with the management of the operation of the wells and increasing productivity would be very effective in order to estimate future precipitation data the sdsm statistical exponential microscale model was used to microscale the large canesm2 scale model under two scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the continuation of the current trend of the groundwater resources in the plain during the next 20 years will also cause a drop in water level of 8 3 m compared with the existing situation and a reduction of 41 m compared with the long term average of 1980 based on this modeling effort upon releasing 60 of river flow surplus to downstream demand for recharging aquifer through artificial recharge projects the rate of water table fall will decline significantly over a 20 year period

crisis in the future one of the most important challenges facing water resources management in iran is the natural limitations of such resources aalami et al 2014 iran s moe 2016 nahavandi and ahmadian 2019 iran is also an arid and semi arid country with an average precipitation of 240 mm mm year namely about one third of the global average and half of the average rate in asia iran s moe 2016 salimi et al 2021 the most important source of concern among water resources managers is thus the rate of freshwater consumption for drinking sanitation as well as industrial and agricultural purposes in the case of groundwater resources this country should also be equipped with the most innovated water resource evaluation and prediction methods to plan and implement a combination of groundwater utilization control and artificial groundwater recharge projects to maintain an acceptable groundwater balance iran s moe 2016 abdolabadi et al 2018 barati et al 2019 in recent decades there has been an increasing use of system analysis techniques and in particular simulation and optimization models for the planning as well as management of water resources aalami et al 2014 suwan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 balali and viaggi 2015 rudyanto et al 2016 amoo et al 2020 system simulations also involve estimating whether a system with certain specifications can achieve specific objectives if given certain inputs in simulation models the current state of a system is thus modeled according to its past behaviors and trends to gain a better understanding of its actual behavior also called objective oriented models suwan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 schoenenberger et al 2021 in comparison optimization models attempt to address the question of how to reach the best possible conditions suan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 schoenenberger et al 2021 these models additionally reproduce the behavior of the system in a certain range of conditions and then identify the optimal points within the feasible space based on a predetermined objective function suan et al 2015 naseri et al 2017 schoenenberger et al 2021 in this sense simulation models are the most suitable tools for analyzing complex systems wherein the multitude of components and the complexity of their relations make it impossible to develop algorithms or to formulate mathematical models for optimization rudyanto et al 2016 mashaly and fernald 2020 among the tools available for simulating complex water resources systems is the system dynamics sd in which the links between the system elements are expressed as causal relationships niazi et al 2014 aalami et al 2014 mashaly and fernald 2020 the sd based software packages can accordingly serve as flexible and integrated tools for a wide range of modeling applications from participatory modeling to economic analysis in this field in this regard the mike basin oasis and weap are some examples of software packages developed and used for this purpose niazi et al 2014 rudyanto et al 2016 mashaly and fernald 2020 schoenenberger et al 2021 in the forthcoming research a temporal system dynamics model namely a modified spatial system dynamics mssd was introduced and implemented using the vensim dss software designed to model the phenomena with one or more time varying quantities niazi et al 2014 rudyanto et al 2016 mashaly and fernald 2020 the sd is also assumed as a methodology for understanding complex systems formerly known as industry dynamics this method was originally developed by jay forrester to be used in the industry and to solve management problems such as production and employment instability poor growth and conflicts in business activities later the sd found extensive use in various fields including integrated planning and design strategies forrester 1961 wellinz 1980 economic behaviors sterman 1983 energy and the environment ford and lober 1989 and supply chain management scm tawil 1990 niazi et al 2014 mashaly and fernald 2020 abdolabadi et al 2018 in a study by jalali and afshar 2004 an sd based model was developed for utilizing hydroelectric dams in their model management scenarios and rule curves could be easily incorporated into the analysis and the problem could be rapidly solved clifford holmes et al 2014 also employed an sd model to investigate water supply and demand problems of an urban area in south africa in the given study recruiting an sd based model called k dem rainwater harvesting was identified as a viable alternative source of water elsewhere rahimi khoob et al 2015 applied the sd approach to examine the impact of climate change on water resources and agricultural systems in the hashtgerd plain in iran whereby the simulation results revealed extremely high vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change and population growth compared with drinking viz residential and industrial sectors also suwan et al 2015 developed an sd for a region in south korea and introduced multiple scenarios such as the development of alternative water resources into this model in a study by feizolahi et al 2020 had performed analysis of water resources in minab plain with system dynamic approach in term of the water supply the minab plain is one of the most important region of the hormozgan province in iran and various economic sectors of the plain have been facing with many problems due to the lack of access to water resources apart from conventional policies around water supply two policies based on water demand management approach have been extracted and discussed based on the performance of the given mechanism to maintain the spatial organization equilibrium of the minab plain in addition naseri et al 2017 recruited an sd model to study the tabriz plain as a semi arid region in iran the developed model could determine water supply and budget deficit for the industry as well as drinking and agriculture uses and propose some solutions to maintain the groundwater level in this plain xijuan and yun 2019 also developed an sd model for analyzing water supply and demand in jinjiang province in china with four main rivers their findings revealed that the region s water resources could not meet water consumption caused by the socio economic development of the region in recent years accordingly more water conservation policies needed to be adopted to ensure sustainable water supply for economic development in this region furthermore araujo et al 2019 used an sd model to predict water scarcity trends in northern brazil until 2025 the model developed based on the monte carlo mc method indicated that the valuation of water to encourage efficient water consumption in the areas stricken with water scarcity had led to an increased level of income and investments in other water resources management strategies nozari et al 2021 investigated the performance of the dose tank plus its regulatory and downstream diversion dams using the system dynamics sd method in vensim software they found that the sd simulated releases met downstream demands and the sd method had high accuracy in simulating the performance of the surface tank system rezaee et al 2021 by integrating economic social and environmental dimensions introduced a dynamic system model for water resource allocation decision making the topsis results revealed that in the best scenario most water was allocated to the non metal industry with a relative distance of 0 63 away from the ideal solution on the other hand the current water allocation scenario ranked seventh indicating that significant improvements are required to capture the social economic and environmental factors for optimal reallocation of water resources among different industry users kayhanpour et al 2021 has evaluated sustainable water resources management using a combined water food energy approach with a system dynamics model the simulation results of the proposed solutions were selected to be a combination of the strategies of water demand and food resources management as the best policies hence 16 increase in irrigation efficiency 10 improvement in cultivation patterns 6 reduction in agricultural products losses 5 decrease in food demand due to food losses and 5 annual increase in the performance of agriculture are selected as sustainable water resources management policies mashaly and fernald 2020 investigated the capabilities and potentials of system dynamics in hydrology and water resources as a sustainable modeling approach to water management this paper elaborated on studies and investigations on the use of sd in the water sector and highlighted the strengths of sd for encouraging researchers to use this promising method to manage such a vital resource accordingly this review seeks to include a comprehensive and up to date survey of existing publications and scholarly papers on the use of sd modeling as an effective technique for dealing with different problems associated with planning management and analysis of hydrology as well as water resources systems recent trends in the integration of sd with other modeling systems such as artificial intelligence systems are discussed along with the limitations and challenges facing application this article makes a new contribution by offering a foundation of references and studies for scholars researchers and academics which would encourage future investigation in employing the sd approach to hydrology and water resources management plus planning considering the blockage of the downstream aquifer feed of the reservoir built on the nessa river and its destructive effects on the downstream settlements the main purpose of this study is to numerically analyze the environmental effects of the reservoir construction on the current and future conditions while considering climate change overall the core idea of the present study was to model the changes of the reservoir level and then link the given model to the aquifer through separate subsystems considering the potentially effective factors in other words one of the innovations of this research is the integrated management of surface water and groundwater through the system dynamics method the primary data collected were thus introduced into the vensim dss software where they were treated as primary inputs and organized into separate sub systems with links to other hydrological factors in this study the allocation of water resources in the nesa plain basin in bam county iran was simulated and evaluated using sd approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a region known as the nesa plain which is part of the nesa river basin in the southern section of the bam aquifer this plain is located between 28 25 and 29 26 northern latitudes and 57 37 and 59 29 eastern longitudes approximately 25 km km southeast of the city of bam in kerman province iran this region has also a total area of 9658 18 square kilometer km2 of which 6032 79 km2 is flat and 3625 39 km2 is a mountainous terrain fig 1 the marked area in fig 1 is an alluvial fan enjoying high permeability and it is the main factor of surface groundwater connectivity of the plain further the nesa plain is mainly located in the southern alluvial fans of the bam plain and the north of jabalbarez heights viz the mountains in southern iran the average height of the plain is about 800 m m above sea level the general slope of the region in the direction of the steepest slope is 4 6 m per thousand the water budget studies carried out in the plain area by iran s ministry of energy moe during 1993 2010 also revealed a decline of 5 34 m in water table level which means an annual decline of about 0 31 m iran s moe 2016 the study area has also long and hot summers and relatively mild winters the maximum and absolute minimum temperatures in bam city station are 47 6 and 0 9 c respectively which can be observed in june and january respectively this area is located in the arid regions of iran and has a dry as well as semi tropical climate the annual average precipitation in the stations of bam county is 56 5 mm according to iran s moe about 65 of the total annual rainfall in the bam plain occurs in winter february and june have the highest and lowest rainfalls during the year with 26 71 and 0 8 respectively based on 36 years of observed river inflow at the reservoir entrance the average river yield is estimated 7 23 m3 s or 228 million cubic meters mcm per year iran s moe 2016 in the past the river flow spread across the plain and naturally recharged the wells downstream of the plain iran s moe 2016 however this process has been stopped upon reservoir construction the dam is a gravel structure covered with concrete with a height of 111 m and a total reservoir storage of 260 mcm this reservoir has been built to supply 30 mcm of drinking water for the city of bam to meet 47 7 mcm of agricultural water demand for providing 6 mcm to the nearby industrial zone generating 5 mw hour mwh of hydroelectric power and delivering 22 mcm of water for the environment annually iran s moe 2016 despite the rational objectives of the project in practice frequent droughts and prioritization of urban drinking water with an increasing demand have all led to negligence in the allocation of downstream environmental water resulting in a sharp decline in groundwater levels the downstream villages of this region have also become uninhabited the destruction of agricultural lands downstream of the nesa plain and the evacuation of the rural areas have caused numerous socioeconomic and cultural consequences for the city of bam given the importance of this issue the present study tried to employ an sd based model to find out an appropriate water resources management policy to revive the aquifer and the surrounding village in this region 2 2 surface water resources the water resources in the study area include surface water and groundwater the most important source of water in this area is also the nesa river which originates from the northern slopes of the jabalbarez mountains at an altitude of 3750 m after intersecting with several sub tributaries it flows toward the north and then the northeast before entering the bam plain at the reservoir site the maximum river yield occurs in march and its minimum yield take place in august and september iran s moe 2016 the time series of the monthly inflows of this river is presented in fig 2 2 3 water demand in the study area generally water demand is classified into four categories including agricultural industrial service sector urban rural drinking and sanitary and environmental requirements according to the studies conducted by iran s ministry of agriculture moa the study area contains about 14 452 ha ha of farmland and orchards about 11 782 ha of which is date and citrus with the rest being alfalfa wheat and forage table 1 reports the agricultural water demand of the study area according to the research department of agriculture organization in kerman province iran iran s moe 2016 the main drinking water and industrial requirements in the region are met through qanats in the plain with the main sources outside the aquifer though it is insufficient thus a water transmission line from the nesa reservoir to the city of bam and bam industrial area has been constructed to supply drinking water to the inhabitants and to meet the needs of the industry through which 40 and 20 mcm of drinking water are transferred per year to the city of bam and for industrial use respectively iran s moe 2016 currently this demand is met by 254 qanats and 1282 wells of note a qanat is a horizontal groundwater resources tunnel system with a very small slope dug into the ground along with some wells called rods to transfer water from the aquifer to the earth surface using gravity force 2 4 environmental demand sang mes the protected area just downstream of nesa reservoir contains unique biodiversity which highly depends on the river environmental water right ieo 2012 given the climatic and environmental conditions of the region the environmental demand of the nesa river was estimated using the montana method environmental water demand of river downstream of the reservoir was estimated using montana method in this research the montana method is a universally recognized method for this purpose the method has been designed based on minimum river flow required to conserve survival of its ecosystem tennant 1976 aalami et al 2014 in this method a percentage of average annual river flow is considered as environmental water demand the desired level of this method is acceptable according to the instructions issued by the ministry of energy and is equivalent to 30 mar for april to september and 10 mar for october to march tennant 1976 aalami et al 2014 zarakani et al 2017 thus the environmental flow in the first 6 months of the rainy part of the year october to march is 10 of the average annual flow and for the second 6 months april to september is 30 of the average annual flow fig 3 note that according to the artificial recharging policy of flood spreading in practice the volume of water will be far greater than the flow of environmental water right downstream of the dam and along the river which will meet the environmental needs and strengthen the aquifer 2 5 reservoir surface evaporation evaporation represents one of the important factors that play a significant role in water budget studies as it accounts for the largest portion of water loss in a reservoir upon completing the monthly and annual evaporation statistics at different stations of the study area they were used to estimate long term average annual evaporation the rate of evaporation from the free surface of water was further determined employing the pan evaporation conversion coefficient which is usually about 0 55 0 75 for hot and 0 65 0 9 for cold regions aalami et al 2014 iran s moe 2016 abdolabadi et al 2018 after applying the pan coefficient for flat and mountainous terrains the average pan evaporation on the heights and the plain of the study area was estimated to be 0 67 based on which the annual evaporation from the free water surface in the plain and the heights was estimated 2878 87 and 2287 19 mm respectively note that groundwater evaporation depends on water depth soil texture type ambient temperature vegetation relative humidity and concentration of minerals iran s moe 2016 aalami et al 2014 niazi et al 2014 the closer the groundwater is to the ground surface the higher is the evaporation rate the water table depth contour map of the study area also shows that the groundwater level rose above 5 m in only a few negligible areas iran s moe 2016 thus there was no evaporation from the groundwater in this area iran s moe 2016 2 6 discharge and withdrawal one of the main components of water balance is the amount of water extraction from groundwater resources in estimating the groundwater balance of the given plain infiltration of rainfall into groundwater aquifers infiltration of surface flows as well as return water from agricultural drinking and industrial uses as input factors plus withdrawal from wells qanats drainages and runoffs as output factors were introduced into the model the annual recharge and discharge of aquifer are estimated 678 87 and 742 95 respectively iran s moe 2016 the estimation of the groundwater balance shows an annual decline in the aquifer storage of 64 08 mcm table 2 iran s moe 2016 note that the measurement of withdrawal from all wells in nessa bam plain is performed and recorded by the experts of the ministry of energy on a monthly basis since over 90 of agricultural lands and date orchards are irrigated by the traditional flooding method according to the recommendations of the food and agriculture organization fao return irrigation flows are assumed to be 30 of the applied water aalami et al 2014 salimi et al 2021 this irrigation return flow coefficient was chosen because of the soil texture of the area as well as the presence of permanent qanats in the vast date palm orchards of the region nevertheless conducting field research to determine this coefficient can enhance the accuracy of the model and the resulting conclusions since the wastewater of residential and industrial sectors of the area is disposed of in dry wells the rate of the water return used for domestic and industrial purposes to the groundwater resources was assumed 75 or 60 mcm year 2 7 groundwater inflows and outflows the flow of water in and out of groundwater resources aquifers is estimated using the darcy s law as follows 1 q i n o r q o u t l i t t where l represents the length of the inlet or outlet section in meter i shows the hydraulic gradient t refers to the average transmissivity of the cross section in square meters per day m2 day and t indicates the time period of analysis in days niazi et al 2014 xu et al 2005 note that the groundwater resource aquifer inflows and outflows are estimated according to the hydro climatological balance rate of infiltration at overlooking heights and rate of water return from mountainous terrains to estimate the groundwater inflow the length of groundwater inlets hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity coefficient had to be determined initially the groundwater level maps were used to determine the length of the inlet and outlet sections after which the existing conductivity maps were utilized to estimate conductivity in the areas of interest note that the studied aquifer is replenished through 17 sections in its west northwest and north while being discharged through a groundwater resources stream in its southeast section in this aquifer the volume of inflows to the area of interest is about 198 56 mcm and the volume of outflow is equal to 3 65 mcm table 2 iran s moe 2016 2 8 conceptual sd model and formulation the sd model developed using the vensim dss software consisted of two sub systems namely the reservoir and the plain groundwater mass balance with the floodwater spread acting as the interface between these two the volume of water in the reservoir was selected as the state variable in this modeling attempt it was further estimated based on the difference between water inputs viz inflows and outputs that is outflows at each time step the variable inputs of the reservoir state were river inflow and outflow from the reservoir evaporation from the reservoir lake surface infiltration from the bottom of the reservoir drinking water industry agriculture and overflow outflow in the groundwater balance section the volume of the groundwater aquifer was considered as the state variable in calculating the groundwater budget inflow and outflow from the aquifer i e q i n a n d q o u t the rate of groundwater entry from precipitation rp evaporation from the aquifer e recharge by wells and qanats d and withdrawal from the groundwater aquifer rw were regarded as the effective variables upon allocating the drinking industry agriculture and environmental requirements the excess water was calculated and estimated as a rechargeable volume and used in estimating the groundwater balance the sd modeling procedure also involved several steps as defining the problem drawing the causal relationship diagram fig 4 constructing the conceptual model fig 5 formulating the model testing the model and using the model for policy analysis abdolabadi et al 2018 nahavandi and ahmadian 2019 barati et al 2019 niazi et al 2014 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 balali and viaggi 2015 rudyanto et al 2016 as mentioned a state variable was used to represent water storage in the reservoir in each month time step the difference between total water inputs and outputs was further calculated to determine the state of water level monthly evaporation was also estimated based on the historical evaporation data recorded at the site of the reservoir at each time step the monthly evaporation was estimated with reference to the reservoir surface area namely based on the reservoir s storage area diagram niazi et al 2014 suwan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 3 modeling and simulation in vensim dss software initially a conceptual model of the reservoir and the groundwater flow of the area was created and converted into a computational form in the vensim software then the model was calibrated and implemented through hydrological data plus aquifer characteristics section 2 collected from 1980 to 2016 by local hydrologists the model was subsequently validated using similar data obtained for 2014 2016 via standard indicators next different scenarios were implemented and tested with an sd model in the sd model as mentioned earlier the groundwater budget of the plain was estimated according to the reservoir outputs and other components 3 1 model validation and calibration prior to the implementation of the scenarios the sensitivity and the stability of the model needed to be tested and calibrated through standard quantitative methods for this purpose two fitting tests and the output results of the model were compared with the observational data based on the reports of aquifer studies in 2014 2016 to determine and to evaluate the model fit simulation coefficients and real values for 2014 2016 were further compared as reported in table 3 in addition fig 6 compares the average water level in the plain with the observed water level based on the volume of groundwater estimated in the simulation process and the results of the plain water balance which indicates a good correlation table 4 presents the error rates between the simulation results and the observed data based on the field observation results given that the percentage of error in the mentioned values is below 10 it seems that there is a good correlation between the simulation model results and the actual ones suwan et al 2015 mahdavi et al 2019 in this study only regression equations were used note that sometimes the accuracy of the results is lower due to the inaccuracy in the relationships of the variables in the equations despite the shortcomings of this method the real results are well reflected in the simulation thus it is categorized as an acceptable prediction model 4 modeling results and discussion upon collecting the required data the modeling was carried out using the approach outlined in previous sections then the results of the simulation of the parameters with an impact on water resources and consumption in the area of interest were examined to prevent solution instability in the developed sd the time step was set to 0 125 of a month the modeling analyses were carried out on monthly time step meanwhile to estimate the annual water balance which is of great importance to the water decision makers of the county the results were added up to derive annual estimates the baseline scenario was also implemented without applying the artificial recharge and the control policy where only the groundwater balance review with the continuation of the current trend was included the changes in the groundwater volume in this scenario are plotted in fig 7 in this respect the average budget deficit of the plain groundwater over the next 20 years will reach about 78 mcm given the socioeconomic conditions of the region and the water resources management options by the government the following scenarios alone or in combination with each other can be defined a 20 increase in urban and industrial annual demands b implementation of a program to enhance water efficiency of the agricultural sector by reducing withdrawal from wells i e mandatory water withdrawal control and reducing the area under cultivation of water intensive crops c dredging of qanats and increasing withdrawal from qanats by 200 mcm year to affect inflow and return of agricultural water iran s moe 2016 d artificial recharge through floodwater spreading assuming an infiltration rate of 50 70 in total about 28 scenarios were selected and introduced into the model the main priority in allocating the volume of the dam reservoir was to supply drinking water followed by meeting the needs of the industry and service sectors in the city of bam the results of the applied scenarios reveal that some policies had little effect on improving the plain groundwater accordingly out of the results of 28 initial scenarios seven standard and operational cases were selected and their output results were compared with each other table 5 in order to estimate future precipitation and temperature data the statistical downscaling model sdsm as a statistical exponential structure was employed to micro scale the large second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 under two scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the canesm2 is a comprehensive paired model and the fourth generation of the paired general circulation models the fourth generation coupled global climate model cgcm4 it is also part of the model series the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 and the fifth report the fifth assessment report ar5 of the international climate change board intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc table 6 to evaluate the sensitivity of the sdsm model to the global model output precipitation and temperature indices were initially simulated using the historical data of the canesm2 model they were then compared with the observational data and the ability of the large scale model to generate scenarios for the given period future items were correspondingly evaluated finally the rainfall was converted into runoff using artificial neural network method through coding in the matlab software and was called to the model in excel format the comparison of the scenarios 1 4 as policies without artificial recharge shows that the declining trend of groundwater level diminished by applying restrictions on extraction from existing wells and enhancing agricultural productivity fig 8 accordingly the budget deficit of the groundwater in the plain in scenario 4 will reach about 44 84 mcm implying the favorable effect of the policies fig 8 also cumulatively illustrates the groundwater budget for the model simulation results in scenarios 1 4 the artificial recharge of the plain through flood spreading in the area with high drainage capacity was further considered as an alternative and the main policy in the restoration of the groundwater aquifers in the area after meeting the needs of drinking and the industry as the main priorities the volume that could be transferred downstream of the reservoir for an artificial recharge was estimated this volume was selected in such a way that 100 of the drinking and industry needs could be met even in the months with low river flow and low water level of the dam reservoir while the remaining reservoir volume was planned to recharge fig 9 displays the volume of water available for artificial recharge indeed the reservoir surplus should be used as artificial recharge after meeting the drinking industrial and environmental needs instead of being stored in the reservoir and eventually lost through evaporation definitely the implementation of this policy must be based on the instructions for the reservoir operation by applying the aquifer recharge policy through flood spreading during the simulation period the results indicated a relative improvement of the groundwater balance in the region fig 10 depicts the simulation results of the continuation of the existing trend namely baseline scenario with the scenario of artificial recharge via improving irrigation methods as well as boosting the efficiency of the agricultural sector and dredging of qanats viz scenario 7 it is observed that the average water budget deficit of the plain will decline from 65 4844 to about 35 17 mcm table 7 presents the outputs of the model for the groundwater budget in different scenarios due to the lack of control over the volume of water output of aqueducts in the region it is possible to reduce the working hours of agricultural wells change the cultivation pattern i e reducing the area of underwater crops such as alfalfa and encouraging farmers to grow resistant crops with low water requirements such as rapeseed replace pressurized irrigation systems with traditional irrigation systems and at the same time implement artificial recharging to establish the balance of the groundwater aquifer by applying the combined scenario i e scenario 7 with a monthly recharge of 4 92 mcm of the reservoir water volume the groundwater budget deficit of the plain will be mitigated by about 50 to 35 mcm figs 10 and 11 represent the improvement of the groundwater budget for scenario 7 compared with other policies the dynamic model of the system for the nesa bam plain shows a drop in the groundwater level of the plain in 2002 on average about 18 m compared with that in 1980 maknoun and tabatabai 2004 the continuation of the current trend will thus result in a reduction of water level equivalent to 23 24 m in 2030 compared with that in 2002 and about 41 m compared with the level of water in 1980 5 conclusions this study evaluated the condition of the nesa plain aquifer in bam county iran by applying recharge scenarios for improving the groundwater storage system a comprehensive model was thus developed based on the sd approach within this system the relationships and the feedback of the changes in the sub systems were expressed using cause and effect diagrams in order to implement the model several scenarios were further considered alone or in combination with each other the comparison of the outputs of the prepared model indicated that the top priority was the volume of water stored in the reservoir of the nesa plain followed by drinking water supply of the city of bam in the region and then the consumption of industry and services the water budget of the plain was also equal to 65 4844 mcm indicting the critical situation of the region given that about 4395 ha of the lands in the region were under the predominant cultivation of alfalfa approximately 60 and wheat about 30 with a total of 60 mcm of water consumption modifying the cultivation pattern that is eliminating the cultivation of these crops alone had no significant impact on water balance installation of volume meters and implementation of well regulation policy to about 75 of current permits will thus boost the water balance of the region to 44 84 mcm via artificial recharging of the plain by flood spreading method the balance of water resources became equal to 35 17 mcm which implies the success of the combined policy thus the application of regulatory policies and the implementation of modern irrigation systems especially for date orchards as the main crop in the region with an annual consumption of about 2300 mcm ha and preventing the drilling of more wells can be steps towards balancing the water resources in the region this will be possible only through the cooperation of stakeholders and beneficiaries along with the implementation of support packages in general the assessment of flood distribution showes that feeding groundwater aquifers leads to increasing water levels in wells increasing the flow of springs and canals improving groundwater quality and satisfying local communities and will promote rural life the model introduced here can be a good paradigm in economic scenarios researchers can accordingly define economic scenarios by examining the vensim model of this research and examine the impact of effective parameters in artificial nutrition policy on the economy of this region

11854,with its arid and semi arid climate iran claims about one third of the world s average annual precipitation accordingly the present study investigated whether an effective water resources management wrm strategy both groundwater and reservoir resources could reduce groundwater drawdown while simultaneously providing secure enough water for preservation of agricultural activities and rural settlements for this purpose a comprehensive system dynamics sd model incorporating reservoir surface water and groundwater resources was developed then the model was implemented for the nesa plain in bam county iran as an example in this plain the construction of a dam to supply drinking water to the cities of bam and the bam industrial zone had devastated the environment and human communities in the downstream areas leading to the depopulation of as many as 104 villages in the bam region the results of the sd model revealed that the artificial recharge of the plain groundwater aquifer along with the management of the operation of the wells and increasing productivity would be very effective in order to estimate future precipitation data the sdsm statistical exponential microscale model was used to microscale the large canesm2 scale model under two scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the continuation of the current trend of the groundwater resources in the plain during the next 20 years will also cause a drop in water level of 8 3 m compared with the existing situation and a reduction of 41 m compared with the long term average of 1980 based on this modeling effort upon releasing 60 of river flow surplus to downstream demand for recharging aquifer through artificial recharge projects the rate of water table fall will decline significantly over a 20 year period and the amount of negative aquifer water balance would most likely improve from 65 5 to 35 17 million cubic meters annually graphical abstract image 1 keywords system dynamics water resources management vensim management scenarios 1 introduction today access to clean fresh water is assumed as a major source of concern in many communities across the world with the steady rise in water demand which often exceeds the amount that can be recharged by water resources as well as the growing pollution of rivers lakes and other sources of fresh water this issue could turn into a major crisis in the future one of the most important challenges facing water resources management in iran is the natural limitations of such resources aalami et al 2014 iran s moe 2016 nahavandi and ahmadian 2019 iran is also an arid and semi arid country with an average precipitation of 240 mm mm year namely about one third of the global average and half of the average rate in asia iran s moe 2016 salimi et al 2021 the most important source of concern among water resources managers is thus the rate of freshwater consumption for drinking sanitation as well as industrial and agricultural purposes in the case of groundwater resources this country should also be equipped with the most innovated water resource evaluation and prediction methods to plan and implement a combination of groundwater utilization control and artificial groundwater recharge projects to maintain an acceptable groundwater balance iran s moe 2016 abdolabadi et al 2018 barati et al 2019 in recent decades there has been an increasing use of system analysis techniques and in particular simulation and optimization models for the planning as well as management of water resources aalami et al 2014 suwan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 balali and viaggi 2015 rudyanto et al 2016 amoo et al 2020 system simulations also involve estimating whether a system with certain specifications can achieve specific objectives if given certain inputs in simulation models the current state of a system is thus modeled according to its past behaviors and trends to gain a better understanding of its actual behavior also called objective oriented models suwan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 schoenenberger et al 2021 in comparison optimization models attempt to address the question of how to reach the best possible conditions suan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 schoenenberger et al 2021 these models additionally reproduce the behavior of the system in a certain range of conditions and then identify the optimal points within the feasible space based on a predetermined objective function suan et al 2015 naseri et al 2017 schoenenberger et al 2021 in this sense simulation models are the most suitable tools for analyzing complex systems wherein the multitude of components and the complexity of their relations make it impossible to develop algorithms or to formulate mathematical models for optimization rudyanto et al 2016 mashaly and fernald 2020 among the tools available for simulating complex water resources systems is the system dynamics sd in which the links between the system elements are expressed as causal relationships niazi et al 2014 aalami et al 2014 mashaly and fernald 2020 the sd based software packages can accordingly serve as flexible and integrated tools for a wide range of modeling applications from participatory modeling to economic analysis in this field in this regard the mike basin oasis and weap are some examples of software packages developed and used for this purpose niazi et al 2014 rudyanto et al 2016 mashaly and fernald 2020 schoenenberger et al 2021 in the forthcoming research a temporal system dynamics model namely a modified spatial system dynamics mssd was introduced and implemented using the vensim dss software designed to model the phenomena with one or more time varying quantities niazi et al 2014 rudyanto et al 2016 mashaly and fernald 2020 the sd is also assumed as a methodology for understanding complex systems formerly known as industry dynamics this method was originally developed by jay forrester to be used in the industry and to solve management problems such as production and employment instability poor growth and conflicts in business activities later the sd found extensive use in various fields including integrated planning and design strategies forrester 1961 wellinz 1980 economic behaviors sterman 1983 energy and the environment ford and lober 1989 and supply chain management scm tawil 1990 niazi et al 2014 mashaly and fernald 2020 abdolabadi et al 2018 in a study by jalali and afshar 2004 an sd based model was developed for utilizing hydroelectric dams in their model management scenarios and rule curves could be easily incorporated into the analysis and the problem could be rapidly solved clifford holmes et al 2014 also employed an sd model to investigate water supply and demand problems of an urban area in south africa in the given study recruiting an sd based model called k dem rainwater harvesting was identified as a viable alternative source of water elsewhere rahimi khoob et al 2015 applied the sd approach to examine the impact of climate change on water resources and agricultural systems in the hashtgerd plain in iran whereby the simulation results revealed extremely high vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change and population growth compared with drinking viz residential and industrial sectors also suwan et al 2015 developed an sd for a region in south korea and introduced multiple scenarios such as the development of alternative water resources into this model in a study by feizolahi et al 2020 had performed analysis of water resources in minab plain with system dynamic approach in term of the water supply the minab plain is one of the most important region of the hormozgan province in iran and various economic sectors of the plain have been facing with many problems due to the lack of access to water resources apart from conventional policies around water supply two policies based on water demand management approach have been extracted and discussed based on the performance of the given mechanism to maintain the spatial organization equilibrium of the minab plain in addition naseri et al 2017 recruited an sd model to study the tabriz plain as a semi arid region in iran the developed model could determine water supply and budget deficit for the industry as well as drinking and agriculture uses and propose some solutions to maintain the groundwater level in this plain xijuan and yun 2019 also developed an sd model for analyzing water supply and demand in jinjiang province in china with four main rivers their findings revealed that the region s water resources could not meet water consumption caused by the socio economic development of the region in recent years accordingly more water conservation policies needed to be adopted to ensure sustainable water supply for economic development in this region furthermore araujo et al 2019 used an sd model to predict water scarcity trends in northern brazil until 2025 the model developed based on the monte carlo mc method indicated that the valuation of water to encourage efficient water consumption in the areas stricken with water scarcity had led to an increased level of income and investments in other water resources management strategies nozari et al 2021 investigated the performance of the dose tank plus its regulatory and downstream diversion dams using the system dynamics sd method in vensim software they found that the sd simulated releases met downstream demands and the sd method had high accuracy in simulating the performance of the surface tank system rezaee et al 2021 by integrating economic social and environmental dimensions introduced a dynamic system model for water resource allocation decision making the topsis results revealed that in the best scenario most water was allocated to the non metal industry with a relative distance of 0 63 away from the ideal solution on the other hand the current water allocation scenario ranked seventh indicating that significant improvements are required to capture the social economic and environmental factors for optimal reallocation of water resources among different industry users kayhanpour et al 2021 has evaluated sustainable water resources management using a combined water food energy approach with a system dynamics model the simulation results of the proposed solutions were selected to be a combination of the strategies of water demand and food resources management as the best policies hence 16 increase in irrigation efficiency 10 improvement in cultivation patterns 6 reduction in agricultural products losses 5 decrease in food demand due to food losses and 5 annual increase in the performance of agriculture are selected as sustainable water resources management policies mashaly and fernald 2020 investigated the capabilities and potentials of system dynamics in hydrology and water resources as a sustainable modeling approach to water management this paper elaborated on studies and investigations on the use of sd in the water sector and highlighted the strengths of sd for encouraging researchers to use this promising method to manage such a vital resource accordingly this review seeks to include a comprehensive and up to date survey of existing publications and scholarly papers on the use of sd modeling as an effective technique for dealing with different problems associated with planning management and analysis of hydrology as well as water resources systems recent trends in the integration of sd with other modeling systems such as artificial intelligence systems are discussed along with the limitations and challenges facing application this article makes a new contribution by offering a foundation of references and studies for scholars researchers and academics which would encourage future investigation in employing the sd approach to hydrology and water resources management plus planning considering the blockage of the downstream aquifer feed of the reservoir built on the nessa river and its destructive effects on the downstream settlements the main purpose of this study is to numerically analyze the environmental effects of the reservoir construction on the current and future conditions while considering climate change overall the core idea of the present study was to model the changes of the reservoir level and then link the given model to the aquifer through separate subsystems considering the potentially effective factors in other words one of the innovations of this research is the integrated management of surface water and groundwater through the system dynamics method the primary data collected were thus introduced into the vensim dss software where they were treated as primary inputs and organized into separate sub systems with links to other hydrological factors in this study the allocation of water resources in the nesa plain basin in bam county iran was simulated and evaluated using sd approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a region known as the nesa plain which is part of the nesa river basin in the southern section of the bam aquifer this plain is located between 28 25 and 29 26 northern latitudes and 57 37 and 59 29 eastern longitudes approximately 25 km km southeast of the city of bam in kerman province iran this region has also a total area of 9658 18 square kilometer km2 of which 6032 79 km2 is flat and 3625 39 km2 is a mountainous terrain fig 1 the marked area in fig 1 is an alluvial fan enjoying high permeability and it is the main factor of surface groundwater connectivity of the plain further the nesa plain is mainly located in the southern alluvial fans of the bam plain and the north of jabalbarez heights viz the mountains in southern iran the average height of the plain is about 800 m m above sea level the general slope of the region in the direction of the steepest slope is 4 6 m per thousand the water budget studies carried out in the plain area by iran s ministry of energy moe during 1993 2010 also revealed a decline of 5 34 m in water table level which means an annual decline of about 0 31 m iran s moe 2016 the study area has also long and hot summers and relatively mild winters the maximum and absolute minimum temperatures in bam city station are 47 6 and 0 9 c respectively which can be observed in june and january respectively this area is located in the arid regions of iran and has a dry as well as semi tropical climate the annual average precipitation in the stations of bam county is 56 5 mm according to iran s moe about 65 of the total annual rainfall in the bam plain occurs in winter february and june have the highest and lowest rainfalls during the year with 26 71 and 0 8 respectively based on 36 years of observed river inflow at the reservoir entrance the average river yield is estimated 7 23 m3 s or 228 million cubic meters mcm per year iran s moe 2016 in the past the river flow spread across the plain and naturally recharged the wells downstream of the plain iran s moe 2016 however this process has been stopped upon reservoir construction the dam is a gravel structure covered with concrete with a height of 111 m and a total reservoir storage of 260 mcm this reservoir has been built to supply 30 mcm of drinking water for the city of bam to meet 47 7 mcm of agricultural water demand for providing 6 mcm to the nearby industrial zone generating 5 mw hour mwh of hydroelectric power and delivering 22 mcm of water for the environment annually iran s moe 2016 despite the rational objectives of the project in practice frequent droughts and prioritization of urban drinking water with an increasing demand have all led to negligence in the allocation of downstream environmental water resulting in a sharp decline in groundwater levels the downstream villages of this region have also become uninhabited the destruction of agricultural lands downstream of the nesa plain and the evacuation of the rural areas have caused numerous socioeconomic and cultural consequences for the city of bam given the importance of this issue the present study tried to employ an sd based model to find out an appropriate water resources management policy to revive the aquifer and the surrounding village in this region 2 2 surface water resources the water resources in the study area include surface water and groundwater the most important source of water in this area is also the nesa river which originates from the northern slopes of the jabalbarez mountains at an altitude of 3750 m after intersecting with several sub tributaries it flows toward the north and then the northeast before entering the bam plain at the reservoir site the maximum river yield occurs in march and its minimum yield take place in august and september iran s moe 2016 the time series of the monthly inflows of this river is presented in fig 2 2 3 water demand in the study area generally water demand is classified into four categories including agricultural industrial service sector urban rural drinking and sanitary and environmental requirements according to the studies conducted by iran s ministry of agriculture moa the study area contains about 14 452 ha ha of farmland and orchards about 11 782 ha of which is date and citrus with the rest being alfalfa wheat and forage table 1 reports the agricultural water demand of the study area according to the research department of agriculture organization in kerman province iran iran s moe 2016 the main drinking water and industrial requirements in the region are met through qanats in the plain with the main sources outside the aquifer though it is insufficient thus a water transmission line from the nesa reservoir to the city of bam and bam industrial area has been constructed to supply drinking water to the inhabitants and to meet the needs of the industry through which 40 and 20 mcm of drinking water are transferred per year to the city of bam and for industrial use respectively iran s moe 2016 currently this demand is met by 254 qanats and 1282 wells of note a qanat is a horizontal groundwater resources tunnel system with a very small slope dug into the ground along with some wells called rods to transfer water from the aquifer to the earth surface using gravity force 2 4 environmental demand sang mes the protected area just downstream of nesa reservoir contains unique biodiversity which highly depends on the river environmental water right ieo 2012 given the climatic and environmental conditions of the region the environmental demand of the nesa river was estimated using the montana method environmental water demand of river downstream of the reservoir was estimated using montana method in this research the montana method is a universally recognized method for this purpose the method has been designed based on minimum river flow required to conserve survival of its ecosystem tennant 1976 aalami et al 2014 in this method a percentage of average annual river flow is considered as environmental water demand the desired level of this method is acceptable according to the instructions issued by the ministry of energy and is equivalent to 30 mar for april to september and 10 mar for october to march tennant 1976 aalami et al 2014 zarakani et al 2017 thus the environmental flow in the first 6 months of the rainy part of the year october to march is 10 of the average annual flow and for the second 6 months april to september is 30 of the average annual flow fig 3 note that according to the artificial recharging policy of flood spreading in practice the volume of water will be far greater than the flow of environmental water right downstream of the dam and along the river which will meet the environmental needs and strengthen the aquifer 2 5 reservoir surface evaporation evaporation represents one of the important factors that play a significant role in water budget studies as it accounts for the largest portion of water loss in a reservoir upon completing the monthly and annual evaporation statistics at different stations of the study area they were used to estimate long term average annual evaporation the rate of evaporation from the free surface of water was further determined employing the pan evaporation conversion coefficient which is usually about 0 55 0 75 for hot and 0 65 0 9 for cold regions aalami et al 2014 iran s moe 2016 abdolabadi et al 2018 after applying the pan coefficient for flat and mountainous terrains the average pan evaporation on the heights and the plain of the study area was estimated to be 0 67 based on which the annual evaporation from the free water surface in the plain and the heights was estimated 2878 87 and 2287 19 mm respectively note that groundwater evaporation depends on water depth soil texture type ambient temperature vegetation relative humidity and concentration of minerals iran s moe 2016 aalami et al 2014 niazi et al 2014 the closer the groundwater is to the ground surface the higher is the evaporation rate the water table depth contour map of the study area also shows that the groundwater level rose above 5 m in only a few negligible areas iran s moe 2016 thus there was no evaporation from the groundwater in this area iran s moe 2016 2 6 discharge and withdrawal one of the main components of water balance is the amount of water extraction from groundwater resources in estimating the groundwater balance of the given plain infiltration of rainfall into groundwater aquifers infiltration of surface flows as well as return water from agricultural drinking and industrial uses as input factors plus withdrawal from wells qanats drainages and runoffs as output factors were introduced into the model the annual recharge and discharge of aquifer are estimated 678 87 and 742 95 respectively iran s moe 2016 the estimation of the groundwater balance shows an annual decline in the aquifer storage of 64 08 mcm table 2 iran s moe 2016 note that the measurement of withdrawal from all wells in nessa bam plain is performed and recorded by the experts of the ministry of energy on a monthly basis since over 90 of agricultural lands and date orchards are irrigated by the traditional flooding method according to the recommendations of the food and agriculture organization fao return irrigation flows are assumed to be 30 of the applied water aalami et al 2014 salimi et al 2021 this irrigation return flow coefficient was chosen because of the soil texture of the area as well as the presence of permanent qanats in the vast date palm orchards of the region nevertheless conducting field research to determine this coefficient can enhance the accuracy of the model and the resulting conclusions since the wastewater of residential and industrial sectors of the area is disposed of in dry wells the rate of the water return used for domestic and industrial purposes to the groundwater resources was assumed 75 or 60 mcm year 2 7 groundwater inflows and outflows the flow of water in and out of groundwater resources aquifers is estimated using the darcy s law as follows 1 q i n o r q o u t l i t t where l represents the length of the inlet or outlet section in meter i shows the hydraulic gradient t refers to the average transmissivity of the cross section in square meters per day m2 day and t indicates the time period of analysis in days niazi et al 2014 xu et al 2005 note that the groundwater resource aquifer inflows and outflows are estimated according to the hydro climatological balance rate of infiltration at overlooking heights and rate of water return from mountainous terrains to estimate the groundwater inflow the length of groundwater inlets hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity coefficient had to be determined initially the groundwater level maps were used to determine the length of the inlet and outlet sections after which the existing conductivity maps were utilized to estimate conductivity in the areas of interest note that the studied aquifer is replenished through 17 sections in its west northwest and north while being discharged through a groundwater resources stream in its southeast section in this aquifer the volume of inflows to the area of interest is about 198 56 mcm and the volume of outflow is equal to 3 65 mcm table 2 iran s moe 2016 2 8 conceptual sd model and formulation the sd model developed using the vensim dss software consisted of two sub systems namely the reservoir and the plain groundwater mass balance with the floodwater spread acting as the interface between these two the volume of water in the reservoir was selected as the state variable in this modeling attempt it was further estimated based on the difference between water inputs viz inflows and outputs that is outflows at each time step the variable inputs of the reservoir state were river inflow and outflow from the reservoir evaporation from the reservoir lake surface infiltration from the bottom of the reservoir drinking water industry agriculture and overflow outflow in the groundwater balance section the volume of the groundwater aquifer was considered as the state variable in calculating the groundwater budget inflow and outflow from the aquifer i e q i n a n d q o u t the rate of groundwater entry from precipitation rp evaporation from the aquifer e recharge by wells and qanats d and withdrawal from the groundwater aquifer rw were regarded as the effective variables upon allocating the drinking industry agriculture and environmental requirements the excess water was calculated and estimated as a rechargeable volume and used in estimating the groundwater balance the sd modeling procedure also involved several steps as defining the problem drawing the causal relationship diagram fig 4 constructing the conceptual model fig 5 formulating the model testing the model and using the model for policy analysis abdolabadi et al 2018 nahavandi and ahmadian 2019 barati et al 2019 niazi et al 2014 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 balali and viaggi 2015 rudyanto et al 2016 as mentioned a state variable was used to represent water storage in the reservoir in each month time step the difference between total water inputs and outputs was further calculated to determine the state of water level monthly evaporation was also estimated based on the historical evaporation data recorded at the site of the reservoir at each time step the monthly evaporation was estimated with reference to the reservoir surface area namely based on the reservoir s storage area diagram niazi et al 2014 suwan et al 2015 xu et al 2005 naseri et al 2017 3 modeling and simulation in vensim dss software initially a conceptual model of the reservoir and the groundwater flow of the area was created and converted into a computational form in the vensim software then the model was calibrated and implemented through hydrological data plus aquifer characteristics section 2 collected from 1980 to 2016 by local hydrologists the model was subsequently validated using similar data obtained for 2014 2016 via standard indicators next different scenarios were implemented and tested with an sd model in the sd model as mentioned earlier the groundwater budget of the plain was estimated according to the reservoir outputs and other components 3 1 model validation and calibration prior to the implementation of the scenarios the sensitivity and the stability of the model needed to be tested and calibrated through standard quantitative methods for this purpose two fitting tests and the output results of the model were compared with the observational data based on the reports of aquifer studies in 2014 2016 to determine and to evaluate the model fit simulation coefficients and real values for 2014 2016 were further compared as reported in table 3 in addition fig 6 compares the average water level in the plain with the observed water level based on the volume of groundwater estimated in the simulation process and the results of the plain water balance which indicates a good correlation table 4 presents the error rates between the simulation results and the observed data based on the field observation results given that the percentage of error in the mentioned values is below 10 it seems that there is a good correlation between the simulation model results and the actual ones suwan et al 2015 mahdavi et al 2019 in this study only regression equations were used note that sometimes the accuracy of the results is lower due to the inaccuracy in the relationships of the variables in the equations despite the shortcomings of this method the real results are well reflected in the simulation thus it is categorized as an acceptable prediction model 4 modeling results and discussion upon collecting the required data the modeling was carried out using the approach outlined in previous sections then the results of the simulation of the parameters with an impact on water resources and consumption in the area of interest were examined to prevent solution instability in the developed sd the time step was set to 0 125 of a month the modeling analyses were carried out on monthly time step meanwhile to estimate the annual water balance which is of great importance to the water decision makers of the county the results were added up to derive annual estimates the baseline scenario was also implemented without applying the artificial recharge and the control policy where only the groundwater balance review with the continuation of the current trend was included the changes in the groundwater volume in this scenario are plotted in fig 7 in this respect the average budget deficit of the plain groundwater over the next 20 years will reach about 78 mcm given the socioeconomic conditions of the region and the water resources management options by the government the following scenarios alone or in combination with each other can be defined a 20 increase in urban and industrial annual demands b implementation of a program to enhance water efficiency of the agricultural sector by reducing withdrawal from wells i e mandatory water withdrawal control and reducing the area under cultivation of water intensive crops c dredging of qanats and increasing withdrawal from qanats by 200 mcm year to affect inflow and return of agricultural water iran s moe 2016 d artificial recharge through floodwater spreading assuming an infiltration rate of 50 70 in total about 28 scenarios were selected and introduced into the model the main priority in allocating the volume of the dam reservoir was to supply drinking water followed by meeting the needs of the industry and service sectors in the city of bam the results of the applied scenarios reveal that some policies had little effect on improving the plain groundwater accordingly out of the results of 28 initial scenarios seven standard and operational cases were selected and their output results were compared with each other table 5 in order to estimate future precipitation and temperature data the statistical downscaling model sdsm as a statistical exponential structure was employed to micro scale the large second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 under two scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the canesm2 is a comprehensive paired model and the fourth generation of the paired general circulation models the fourth generation coupled global climate model cgcm4 it is also part of the model series the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 and the fifth report the fifth assessment report ar5 of the international climate change board intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc table 6 to evaluate the sensitivity of the sdsm model to the global model output precipitation and temperature indices were initially simulated using the historical data of the canesm2 model they were then compared with the observational data and the ability of the large scale model to generate scenarios for the given period future items were correspondingly evaluated finally the rainfall was converted into runoff using artificial neural network method through coding in the matlab software and was called to the model in excel format the comparison of the scenarios 1 4 as policies without artificial recharge shows that the declining trend of groundwater level diminished by applying restrictions on extraction from existing wells and enhancing agricultural productivity fig 8 accordingly the budget deficit of the groundwater in the plain in scenario 4 will reach about 44 84 mcm implying the favorable effect of the policies fig 8 also cumulatively illustrates the groundwater budget for the model simulation results in scenarios 1 4 the artificial recharge of the plain through flood spreading in the area with high drainage capacity was further considered as an alternative and the main policy in the restoration of the groundwater aquifers in the area after meeting the needs of drinking and the industry as the main priorities the volume that could be transferred downstream of the reservoir for an artificial recharge was estimated this volume was selected in such a way that 100 of the drinking and industry needs could be met even in the months with low river flow and low water level of the dam reservoir while the remaining reservoir volume was planned to recharge fig 9 displays the volume of water available for artificial recharge indeed the reservoir surplus should be used as artificial recharge after meeting the drinking industrial and environmental needs instead of being stored in the reservoir and eventually lost through evaporation definitely the implementation of this policy must be based on the instructions for the reservoir operation by applying the aquifer recharge policy through flood spreading during the simulation period the results indicated a relative improvement of the groundwater balance in the region fig 10 depicts the simulation results of the continuation of the existing trend namely baseline scenario with the scenario of artificial recharge via improving irrigation methods as well as boosting the efficiency of the agricultural sector and dredging of qanats viz scenario 7 it is observed that the average water budget deficit of the plain will decline from 65 4844 to about 35 17 mcm table 7 presents the outputs of the model for the groundwater budget in different scenarios due to the lack of control over the volume of water output of aqueducts in the region it is possible to reduce the working hours of agricultural wells change the cultivation pattern i e reducing the area of underwater crops such as alfalfa and encouraging farmers to grow resistant crops with low water requirements such as rapeseed replace pressurized irrigation systems with traditional irrigation systems and at the same time implement artificial recharging to establish the balance of the groundwater aquifer by applying the combined scenario i e scenario 7 with a monthly recharge of 4 92 mcm of the reservoir water volume the groundwater budget deficit of the plain will be mitigated by about 50 to 35 mcm figs 10 and 11 represent the improvement of the groundwater budget for scenario 7 compared with other policies the dynamic model of the system for the nesa bam plain shows a drop in the groundwater level of the plain in 2002 on average about 18 m compared with that in 1980 maknoun and tabatabai 2004 the continuation of the current trend will thus result in a reduction of water level equivalent to 23 24 m in 2030 compared with that in 2002 and about 41 m compared with the level of water in 1980 5 conclusions this study evaluated the condition of the nesa plain aquifer in bam county iran by applying recharge scenarios for improving the groundwater storage system a comprehensive model was thus developed based on the sd approach within this system the relationships and the feedback of the changes in the sub systems were expressed using cause and effect diagrams in order to implement the model several scenarios were further considered alone or in combination with each other the comparison of the outputs of the prepared model indicated that the top priority was the volume of water stored in the reservoir of the nesa plain followed by drinking water supply of the city of bam in the region and then the consumption of industry and services the water budget of the plain was also equal to 65 4844 mcm indicting the critical situation of the region given that about 4395 ha of the lands in the region were under the predominant cultivation of alfalfa approximately 60 and wheat about 30 with a total of 60 mcm of water consumption modifying the cultivation pattern that is eliminating the cultivation of these crops alone had no significant impact on water balance installation of volume meters and implementation of well regulation policy to about 75 of current permits will thus boost the water balance of the region to 44 84 mcm via artificial recharging of the plain by flood spreading method the balance of water resources became equal to 35 17 mcm which implies the success of the combined policy thus the application of regulatory policies and the implementation of modern irrigation systems especially for date orchards as the main crop in the region with an annual consumption of about 2300 mcm ha and preventing the drilling of more wells can be steps towards balancing the water resources in the region this will be possible only through the cooperation of stakeholders and beneficiaries along with the implementation of support packages in general the assessment of flood distribution showes that feeding groundwater aquifers leads to increasing water levels in wells increasing the flow of springs and canals improving groundwater quality and satisfying local communities and will promote rural life the model introduced here can be a good paradigm in economic scenarios researchers can accordingly define economic scenarios by examining the vensim model of this research and examine the impact of effective parameters in artificial nutrition policy on the economy of this region
