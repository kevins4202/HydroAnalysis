3630,modeling groundwater level gwl is a challenging task particularly in intensive groundwater based irrigated regions due to its dependency on multiple natural and anthropogenic factors the main motivation of the current investigation is to develop a new advanced artificial intelligence ai model for gwl simulation an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis optimized by improved alpha guided grey wolf optimization ia gwo algorithm is proposed in this study for reliable prediction of gwl in an intensively irrigated region of northwest bangladesh natural and anthropogenic factors including rainfall evapotranspiration groundwater abstraction and irrigation return flow were considered as input variables for the development of the models the efficacy of the proposed model was compared with standalone anfis and ann models and their hybrid versions using particle swarm optimization anfis pso models both standard statistical metrics and visual inspection of scatter plots violin plots and taylor diagrams were employed for performance evaluation thirty one years 1981 2011 monthly groundwater level data were used for the calibration and validation of the models the results revealed the better performance of anfis ia gwo with normalized root mean square error nrmse of 0 06 0 11 and kling gupta efficiency kge of 0 96 0 98 compared to anfis pso nrmse 0 38 0 55 and kge 0 70 0 86 and ann ia gwo nrmse 0 42 0 57 and kge 0 75 0 91 and ann pso nrmse 0 50 0 63 and kge 0 63 0 83 the visual comparison of results showed that anfis ia gwo model was able to replicate the mean distribution interquartile range and standard deviation of observed gwl more appropriately compared to other models keywords groundwater level artificial intelligence adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system improved alpha guided grey wolf algorithm prediction model 1 introduction agriculture plays a major role in the national economy people s well being and social security in most of the developing countries of the world various meteorological physical and policy related factors play roles in agricultural development and the agro based economy of a region khudhair et al 2020 among all the factors water is considered as the most important to crop productivity makurira et al 2009 a major portion of cropland in the world is irrigated using groundwater due to the unavailability of sufficient surface water during the irrigation season al aboodi and hashim 2019 salem et al 2018 besides groundwater can balance large swings in precipitation and the associated increase in demands during droughts gurdak and qi 2012 taniguchi and hiyama 2014 therefore groundwater has become the major source of irrigation in many regions with an increase of droughts and water stress due to climate change wang et al 2016 for example about 60 of the irrigated food grain production in india depends on groundwater irrigation and about half of the total area irrigated depends on groundwater wells pour et al 2020 tukimat et al 2012 about 85 of total water for irrigation in bangladesh comes from groundwater ahmed et al 2015 however groundwater based irrigation is much costly compared to surface water irrigation in many regions it is the major source of the total cost incurred in agriculture for example irrigation shares about 40 of the total cost of grain production in some regions of bangladesh shahid et al 2006 however irrigation cost varies significantly from place to place irrigation cost in a groundwater dependent irrigation system depends on the amount of irrigation needs depth of groundwater table and price of energy required for groundwater abstraction shahid et al 2015 among these three factors groundwater depth is the most influencing factor in the regions where groundwater table depletes significantly during irrigation season malik et al 2019 a huge abstraction of groundwater to meet the growing demand for irrigation has caused the groundwater level to fall drastically during the irrigation season in many regions of the world the decline of groundwater level causes an increase in energy demand for groundwater abstraction and therefore irrigation cost it was estimated that irrigation cost increase by up to 6 due to a 1 meter drop in groundwater levels in india shukla 2003 accurate prediction of groundwater level is therefore very important for agricultural planning and irrigation scheduling for the economic benefit of farmers reliable estimation of groundwater level is also important for the sustainable management of groundwater resources of a region groundwater based irrigation plays a pivotal role in agro based economies food security and the livelihoods of people in many countries around the world siebert et al 2010 watto and mugera 2015 therefore economies and people s livelihoods can be significantly improved through providing an accurate prediction of groundwater level gwl there are several major negative concerns related to the aquifer depletion such as dry wells local water rationing changes in groundwater flow pattern that is resultant in poor water quality erratic ground water quality and sea water intrusion in coastal area armanuos et al 2021 the accurate groundwater level forecasting can be highly essential for catchment and basin management and sustainability for a general point of view of aquifer groundwater level forecasting required a huge hydrological parameters and effective simulation model for better understanding the pattern of the groundwater level fluctuation hence finding an alternative for technology is highly recommended from the aspect of hydrology point of view water management planning and operation in developed countries are often involved the feasibility of computer simulation models these models are based on theoretical background and might be simple or complex mathematic deterministic or stochastic can provide a reliable framework for decision makers a large number of studies have been conducted for the prediction of gwl mehr et al 2018 naganna et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 yaseen et al 2018 generally hydrogeologist uses conventional physical based models gwl prediction models e g modflow mohammadi 2008 such models need a large amount of meteorological geological and hydrological information for accurate prediction of gwl xu et al 2012 the availability of such a large amount of data is a major challenge in gwl prediction in most regions of the world in recent years data driven statistical models have been developed for prediction of gwl using a limited amount of available data jalalkamali et al 2011 sharafati et al 2020 the conventional statistical methods such as multiple linear regression mlr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima have been used in those studies barzegar et al 2017 for example sahoo and jha 2013 used linear regression for prediction of groundwater level sahoo and jha 2013 takafuji et al 2019 employed an arima for the prediction of groundwater level de moraes takafuji et al 2019 the major disadvantage of conventional statistical models is the large uncertainty in their predictions yaseen et al 2019a such models often fail in simulating groundwater level in a complex hydrological setup machine learning ml models have been proposed to overcome the difficulties of conventional statistical models in the simulation of complex hydrological process ahmadianfar et al 2020 ghorbani et al 2018 jamei et al 2020 khosravi et al 2019 naganna et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019b for groundwater level simulation different ml algorithms have been conducted such as artificial neural network nayak et al 2006 gradient boosting kenda et al 2020 least square support vector machine lssvm khedri et al 2020 gene expression programming shiri and ki≈üi 2011 anfis nadiri et al 2019 neuro fuzzy kisi and shiri 2012 support vector machine salem et al 2018 studies revealed a large improvement in model performance using ml methods the application of ml methods in gwl prediction revealed the better performance of ann in most of the previous studies however the recent applications of anfis showed better prediction capability due to integration of the fuzzy system in ann nadiri et al 2019 the literature review on the ml models development for gwl prediction based on scopus database presented using vosviewer algorithm in fig 1 the interconnection between the major keywords indicated the massive application of the gwl using the feasibility of ml models in addition several regions have been explored using the potential of the computer aid models as it can been in table 1 however bangladesh is not between those regions among several ai model developed for gwl modeling anfis and ann models observed to be majorly established emamgholizadeh et al 2014 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 moosavi et al 2012 nourani et al 2008 trichakis et al 2011 although the anfis and ann have shown higher potential in predicting gwl the accuracy of the models often not satisfactory when employed for gwl prediction in a complex hydrological setup moghaddam et al 2019 natarajan and sudheer 2020 yoon et al 2016 such as intensive groundwater based irrigated region where gwl changes drastically due to human interference like the abstraction of groundwater studies showed that the performance of ml models in simulating complex phenomena can be improved significantly by optimizing its hyper parameters ehteram et al 2020 qi et al 2020 tiyasha et al 2020 for example maroufpoor et al 2019 showed that the performance of the anfis model can be improved by optimizing the internal parameters for modeling soil temperature maroufpoor et al 2019 a recent study of banadkooki et al 2020 showed enhancement of ml based gwl prediction models by optimizing its parameters using whale algorithm other researches on diverse hydrological processes have confirmed the potential of hybrid ml models applications anaraki et al 2021 fu et al 2021 kim et al 2019 kraft et al 2021 lin et al 2021 tian et al 2021 varieties of algorithms have been proposed for optimization of ml model parameters which includes ant colony aco genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso butterfly optimization algorithm boa harris hawks optimization hho particle swarm optimization pso and grey wolf optimization gwo tiyasha et al 2020 the major problem of the optimization algorithm is trapping to local minima salih and alsewari 2019 recently performance of gwo is improved to make it efficient in avoiding trapping to local minima and providing optimum outputs adnan et al 2021 the application of the gwo has been observed in diverse engineering and sciences applications and evidenced its capacity alirahmi et al 2021 fan et al 2021 habibollahzade et al 2021 mani and jain 2020 zhao et al 2021 however the latest version of gwo known as improved alpha guided gwo ia gwo mani and jain 2020 is employed in this study for optimization of anfis and ann model parameters the performance of ia gwo was compared with pso which has been widely used in recent years for the optimization of many natural processes therefore four hybrid models anfis ia gwo ann ia gwo anfis pso and ann pso and two standalone models anfis and ann were developed in this study the anfis and ann were used to evaluate the relative performance of ml methods found most efficient in prediction gwl while ia gwo and pso optimization algorithms were used to assess the improvement of model performance using a newly developed optimization algorithm besides the performance of stand alone anfis and ann models were evaluated to show the improvement in prediction through hybridization of optimization algorithms it is expected that the models developed in this study can be employed for the prediction of groundwater in an intensive groundwater based irrigated region where overexploitation and large seasonal variation of groundwater abstraction have made the gwl prediction highly complex 2 study area and data the study area lat 23 87 24 78 n long 88 30 88 89 e is situated in the northwestern part of bangladesh fig 2 the topography of the area is completely flat with a mild slope toward the southeast the region receives the least amount of rainfall 1500 to 1600 mm in the country mohsenipour et al 2018 almost 85 of the annual rainfall occurs during may october the rainfed crop is grown during the rainy season the rest of the months are dry the temperature during march and april reaches the annual maximum which causes high evaporation and drying of all surface water bodies nashwan et al 2019 groundwater is used as the only source of water during the dry season the government encouraged groundwater based irrigated agriculture during the dry season in the mid eighties to alleviate poverty a large expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture has been notified in the region in the last three decades at present northwest bangladesh is one of the most intensive irrigated agriculture regions of the country about 60 of the crop in the region is grown during the dry season january to april groundwater is used as the only source of irrigation during the crop growing period high yield variety hyv paddy is the crop mainly cultivated using irrigation through groundwater abstraction the groundwater depth in the region varies from 5 17 m overexploitation of groundwater to support intensive irrigation caused a gradual decline of gwl shahid 2011 accurate prediction of gwl is very important for the region for the sustainable management of groundwater resources monthly gwl depth to groundwater table monitored at three locations for the period 1981 2011 was collected from the barind multipurpose development authority of bangladesh fig 3 monthly rainfall and temperature data for the same period were collected from the meteorological station in the study area the information related to soil mechanical properties was gathered from the soil map of the soil resources development authority of bangladesh the time series of gwl data at three locations of the study area are shown in fig 3 3 methodology the seasonal and annual variation of gwl depends on the variability of climate for example gwl goes down in dry season when rainfall is less or evapotranspiration et is high while it comes near to ground surface during the wet season however groundwater abstraction gwa is the major driving factor of gwl in the groundwater based irrigated region a large portion of irrigated water percolates through the irrigated cropland and returns to the subsurface the irrigation return flow irf also controls gwl the irf depends on soil characteristics for example permeable soil allows more infiltration while impermeable soil allows less percolation and more standing water to evaporate into the atmosphere based on this basic concept four factors namely rainfall et gwa and irf were taken into account for the prediction of gwl the procedure followed for the prediction of gwl is shown using a flowchart in fig 4 in this study a temperature based monthly et estimation model proposed by thornthwaite was used for the generation of monthly time series of et gwa was considered equals to the irrigation demand of the crop cultivated in the region a water balance model was used for the estimation of crop irrigation needs the irf was estimated based on soil mechanical properties the estimated values of et gwa and irf along with rainfall was used as input in ml models developed in this study for the prediction of gwl the methods used for the generation of input data and algorithms used for the development of gwl prediction are described in the following subsections 3 1 generation of inputs in this subsection a description for the main essential input variables used for the ground water simulation those input variables are including irrigation demand evapotranspiration and the infiltration from cropland 3 1 1 estimation of irrigation demand high yield variety hyv paddy is cultivated in the study area which needs groundwater irrigation during january to april shew et al 2019 the fao 56 method was used to estimate irrigation needs i n of paddy as 1 i n et c w s r e where et c is is the et from cropland which can be estimated as the product of et and crop coefficient of hyv paddy w s is the water needed for land preparation which is estimated from soil moisture holding capacity and r e is effective rainfall 3 1 2 estimation of evapotranspiration the monthly values of et can be estimated using thornthwaite method as basile and corbin 1969 2 et 16 c 10 t mean h a where c is the correction factor defined based on the latitude and month of the year tmean is the monthly average of daily mean temperature oc h is a heat index estimated for the whole year and a is a coefficient dependent to h 3 1 3 calculation of infiltration from cropland the soil permeability near the vicinity of gwl monitoring well was employed for the calculation of irf the mechanical composition of soil of sand clay and loam was used to estimate irf based on the guidelines proposed by brouwer et al brouwer and heibloem 1986 irf equals to 8 mm day for sand 4 mm day for clay and 6 mm day for loam groundwater abstraction for irrigation in the region is required only from january to april therefore the monthly time series of gwa and irf were estimated for those months the values of gwa and irf for other months were considered zero 3 2 artificial neural network ann ann is a technique that works based on the brain s learning process ehteram et al 2020 ann is developed using several neurons in different layers which are considered as the building block of ann in a typical ann system neurons are arranged in three layers input hidden and output as shown in fig 5 nourani et al 2008 the neurons in the first layer receive the inputs x i the hidden layers allow neurons to learn complex features taormina et al 2012 a weight is assigned to each input which modifies the inputs according to their influence on the output each neuron also has a bias which is considered as the additional inputs to neurons the anns generate the relationships between the input and output data by calculating weight values the nonlinear activation function is applied to the weighted input to sum them and provide output in ann the weights and biases are updated to maximize prediction accuracy different algorithms are used to optimize ann weight and bias parameters 3 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis integrates the strengths of ann and fuzzy logic to improves its learning capacity of the behavior of a complex process and therefore it has been found to provide a better simulation of many natural and engineering processes compared to other ml methods shahid et al 2002 in this study anfis was used for the prediction of gwl a typical two inputs anfis system is shown in fig 6 penghui et al 2020 anfis simulates a process e g gwl using five steps the first step is known as fuzzification where fuzzy sets are generated from inputs using takagi sugeno fuzzification rule in fig 6 x and y are the fuzzy sets of inputs a and b the nodes of the fuzzification layer are adaptive represented using the box in the diagram which implies that the node parameters are adjustable during the learning phase zounemat kermani et al 2020 the second layer of anfis is known as a product which is fixed represented using circles in the diagram products of input signals are generated in this layer the product value w is then passed to normalization third layer where the values are normalized as below 3 w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 where w 1 and w 2 are the product of the inputs generated in the second layer a function is performed in the fourth layer which can be presented as 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r i where p i q i and r i are inference parameters finally the output is estimated at the last or fifth layer using the following equation 5 f i w i f i i w i f i i w i in anfis simulation is conducted using two passes a forward pass where a least square algorithm is used to alter the fuzzy rule function parameters and a backward pass where fuzzy membership function parameters of inputs are altered using an error backpropagation algorithm the performance of anfis depends on the type and the number of membership functions which are known as hyperparameters of anfis optimization of hyperparameters is required during the learning process to achieve higher accuracy in simulation mohammed et al 2020 the learning process of hybrid ann or hybrid anfis consists of two phases the first is the optimization of model parameters and the second is the improvement of prediction accuracy using the optimized model several optimization algorithms are employed in literature for training ml models the major problem of optimization algorithm is trapping to local minima therefore a recently developed sophisticated optimization algorithm ia gwa is used in this study for optimization of ann and anfis model parameters the performance of ia gwo is compared with pso which has been reported to show excellent performance in optimization of ml models in simulation of various natural and engineering processes the optimization algorithms used in this study are described below 3 4 improved alpha guided grey wolf optimization ia gwo the gwo is developed considering social hierarchical structure and hunting procedure of wolf pack elhariri et al 2016 naturally wolves belong to different ranks based on their social status in gwo it is considered that wolves belong to four grades where the bottom to top grades are Œ± Œ≤ Œ¥ and œâ tahani et al 2019 the preying activities of a wolf pack consist of three steps tracing and heading trailing and inclosing and finally confronting the prey in gwo the wolves belong to Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ grades guide the hunting while the wolves belong to grade œâ improve their hunting ability by following the wolves of other grades the encircling method can be represented as 6 x t 1 x p t a c x p t x t in the above equation t is the present iteration x p and x implicate the location vectors of the hunt and hunter candidate solutions respectively a 2 a r 1 a and c 2 r 2 indicate coefficient vectors with r 1 and r 2 being as random vectors range from 0 to1 allow the wolves to change their status in the hunt space the magnitude of a is gradually decreased from 2 to zero using the following equation 7 a t 2 2 t t where t signifies the total number of iterations during the search process œâ wolves update their status according to the best exploration factors i e Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ which are represented as 8 x 1 x Œ± a 1 c 1 x Œ± x 9 x 2 x Œ≤ a 2 c 2 x Œ≤ x 10 x 3 x Œ¥ a 3 c 3 x Œ¥ x 11 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 in gwo Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ are more knowledgeable about the potential prey they guide œâ but lacks any effective mechanism for successful preying pin et al 2013 improved gwo by proposing a guiding mechanism by Œ± which is known alpha guided gwo a gwo in this improved algorithm the position of Œ± is updated in each iteration to change the dimensions of Œ± coordinate which helps to move gradually towards a better position however the population is concerted to Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ which often keep them immobile in the same place for a longer period ia gwo improves the ability of Œ± to skip of the local optimum hu et al 2018 in ia gwo if the fitness of Œ± is found more than the previous iteration the position of the whole wolf pack is updated towards the direction of Œ± the flowchart of the ia gwo is presented in fig 7 3 5 particle swarm optimization pso pso is a stochastic optimization algorithm developed based on the conception of bird s communal behavior yang 2014 in searching for food the flocking birds try to follow the bird which is nearest to food trelea 2003 therefore each bird is considered as a solution in the search space which is known as a particle in pso the optimal solution is searched through particles each particle is determined by its achieved position and the best particle position the particles change their positions based on the equations below jahandideh tehrani et al 2020 13 v i t 1 œâ v i t c 1 r

inertia coefficient the stochastic properties of pso guarantee the solution space exploitation eberhart and shi 2001 pso has been employed in numerous fields in optimization it has only a few adjustable parameters and therefore found more efficient in estimation of optimum values of prediction models parameters 3 6 performance evaluation of prediction models four statistical indices namely normalized root mean square error nrmse relative absolute error re armstrong and collopy 1992 nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 modified index of agreement md willmott 1981 and kling gupta efficiency kge index pool et al 2018 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models the statistical indices used are defined below 15 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 x obs

observed obs data x obs denotes the mean value of the observed data Œ± œÉ sim œÉ obs which is presented the variability Œ≤ Œº sim Œº obs which is the bias term j is the exponent term the values of nrmse ranges between 0 and nse between 1 0 and md between 1 0 and 1 0 and kge between and 1 0 the optimum value of nse md and kge is 1 0 while nrmse is 0 4 results and discussion precipitation et gwa and irf data were used as input and gwl data as output for the development of ml models as per the presented gwl time series data at three locations of the study area presented in fig 3 it can be observed that a gradual increase in variability in gwl in all the locations in the study area an increase in groundwater abstraction to meet the growing irrigation demand causes declination of gwl in peak irrigation period prediction of gwl using stochastic models is not possible for the region due to high non stationary in terms of both mean and variability in data therefore an attempt was taken in this study to predict gwl from surficial hydro meteorological variables the data were divided into calibration and validation periods for the development and testing of the models the models were calibrated with 70 of observed data january 1981 august 2002 and validated for the rest 30 data september 2002 december 2011 the performance of the models was compared with observed gwl data at all the locations the performance of the models was evaluated using both statistical metrics and graphical presentations obtained results during model validation at three locations are presented in the following subsections 4 1 statistical assessment of model performance the performance of the models in terms of four statistical indices during model validations is presented in table 2 the hybrid models were found to perform much better compared to standalone ml models at all three locations the relative performance of the hybrid models revealed the better performance of ia gwo compared to pso the highest performance was obtained when anfis was hybridized with ia gwo algorithm the nrmse nse md and kge of anfis ia gwo model was found in the range of 0 06 0 11 0 97 0 98 0 94 0 96 and 0 96 0 98 while those were found in the range of 0 42 0 57 0 77 0 82 0 77 0 80 and 0 75 0 91 for ann ia gwo another important evaluation metric which is the relative absolute error based on the computed re minimum values were attained for the three investigated locations of gwl the lowest modeling performance was noticed for ann however it was still satisfactory in terms of statistical indices nrmse between 0 66 and 0 77 nse between 0 51 and 0 59 md in the range of 0 65 to 0 70 and kge between 0 63 and 0 68 all the models were found to perform better at gwl 02 location compared to the other two sites the least performance was noticed at gwl 03 high variability and continuous declination of gwl with time have made the prediction of gwl at the location more complicated 4 2 performance assessment using box whisker and scatter plots box whisker plots of observed and simulated monthly gwl data by the models were developed fig 8 to show the capability of the models to replicate median inter quartile range iqr and spread of data the results revealed that the anfis ia gwo box is more similar to the observed box in all the three study locations the anfis ia gwo model was able to replicate the observed median and iqr perfectly it was found to overestimate a few high gwl data and underestimate some low values at gwl 01 however the data spread estimated by anfis ia gwo at gwl 02 and gwl 03 were perfect the ann ia gwo model was found to perform very near to anfis ia gwo at gwl 01 and gwl 03 the performance of anfis pso and ann pso was also found good in all the locations they were also found to replicate the median and range of data reliably however the performance of models optimized using ia gwo was found higher compared to those optimized using pso the lowest performance was noticed for standalone models at all the locations which indicate the necessity of ml model hyperparameter optimization for reliable prediction of gwl the scatter plots of observed and simulated gwl using different models are presented in fig 9 the performance of anfis ia gwo compared to anfis pso and standalone anfis are shown using scatter plots in the left column while those for ann are shown in the right column each row shows the model performance at each of the three locations the results show that the simulated gwl is more aligned to the diagonal line of the scatter plot for anfis ia gwo the coefficient of determination r2 values for anfis ia gwo were found 0 99 0 99 and 1 0 at gwl 01 gwl 02 and gwl 03 locations the r2 values and the narrow spread of the anfis ia gwo simulated gwl around the diagonal line indicate a very high performance of the model the performance of anfis ia gwo was found much higher compared to anfis pso r2 0 91 0 9 and 0 91 and standalone anfis r2 0 82 0 81 and 0 87 a similar improvement in model performance was noticed for ann models the r2 values for ann ia gwo were found 0 84 0 85 and 0 87 for the locations gwl 01 gwl 02 and gwl 03 respectively which was much higher compared to that obtained using ann pso and standalone ann a comparison of the relative performance of anfis and ann hybrid models revealed the better performance of anfis hybrid models 4 3 performance assessment using taylor diagram the performance of different hybrid models was also evaluated using taylor diagram obtained results at three locations are presented in fig 10 the black hollow circle on the x axis of the taylor diagram represents observed gwl a model is considered better if it is near to the observed point taylor diagram compares three statistics together in a graphical way and therefore provides a reliable assessment of the relative performance of different models the taylor diagrams in fig 10 shows a very close performance of the hybrid models at all the locations all the models except anfis ia gwo were found to clustered very close to each other which indicates the very close performance of the models the anfis ia gwo model was found to replicate the variability of observed gwl at gwl 01 and gwl 03 perfectly while it was found to overestimate the variability a bit at gwl 02 consistency in the results of the models were noticed at all the locations based on the taylor diagram the models can be ranked as follows anfis ia gwo anfis pso ann ia gwo ann pso anfis ann 4 4 performance assessment in replicating gwl probability distribution finally the performance of the model to replicate the probability distribution of observed gwl data was visually evaluated through the preparation of violin plots the plots for observed and model simulated gwl data are shown in fig 11 the similarity in the shape of the violin represents more similarity in the distribution of simulated and observed gwl data the figure shows a good similarity between observed and anfis ia gwo simulated gwl at all three locations overall the shape of the violin of hybrid models was found more similar to the observed violin for all the cases the highest distortion in the violin was observed for standalone ann followed by standalone anfis a comparison of the results at three locations revealed the better performance of all the models in replicating observed gwl distribution at gwl 1 and gwl 3 the performance of different models in terms of different statistics was found to vary little for different locations consistency in the results indicates a clear superiority of the anfis ia gwo model in simulating gwl in the study area in addition several other hydrometeorological parameters possibly can be considered as external predictors for the gwl fluctuation 5 validation with the literature it is worth to validate the current research results with the established research over the literature as the absolute error metrics might be varied from one case to another as per the data range the determination coefficient value r2 was selected for the validation nayak et al 2006 developed classical ann model for shallow gwl aquifer in india the proposed ann model attained maximum r2 0 73 same model was adopted to predict gwl at south korea lee et al 2019 and the model reported r2 0 84 pre processing approach of wavelet analysis was integrated with ann model for the purpose of improving the prediction results of gwl at two sites in the chateauguay watershed in quebec canada and the proposed model was able to achieve r2 0 97 adamowski and chan 2011 several ai models were conducted on the prediction gwl at the vizianagaram district india including ann support vector regression svr extreme learning machine elm genetic programming gp natarajan and sudheer 2020 the best prediction result was attained by elm model with r2 0 96 based on the revealed prediction accuracy and in comparison with the current research model accuracy the anfis ia gwo was able to obtain better predictability performance 6 conclusion and future research direction prediction of gwl in groundwater based irrigation regions is highly complex due to increasing variability and decreasing mean with time however accurate prediction of gwl in such a region is highly important for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this study models were developed for the prediction of gwl from surficial hydro meteorological variables the novelty of the study is the use of an improved algorithm for optimization of the parameters of anfis model which has been found to provide higher reliability in gwl predication in different studies the study found the capability of the newly developed model in providing near perfect simulation of gwl in the irrigated region of northwest bangladesh it was observed that hybridization of conventional ml models with advanced optimization algorithm can improve the model prediction capability significantly the drawbacks of the physically based model such as the requirement of a high volume of data and lower prediction accuracy can be overcome using the anfis ia gwo model developed in this study in quantitative terms the proposed anfis ia gwo model attained nrmse values between 0 06 and 0 11 and kge values between 0 96 and 0 98 in comparison with the other models anfis pso nrmse 0 38 0 55 and kge 0 70 0 86 ann ia gwo nrmse 0 42 0 57 and kge 0 75 0 91 and ann pso nrmse 0 50 0 63 and kge 0 63 0 83 the model can be used for reliable estimation of gwl for estimation of groundwater abstraction cost for irrigation appropriate scheduling of irrigation and taking necessary measures to sustain groundwater level for environmental protection the current research can further extend through studying the associated uncertainties that are related to the models dataset or the input variables goliatt et al 2021 an attempt can be taken for prediction for daily gwl using different inputs that can be analyzed for the selection of the higher influential factors only as inputs for the development of parsimonious model in addition the next generation of the ml development is the online modeling by implementing an expert system that can be used in more practical aspects future research can be devoted on developing and designing up to date gwl data sampling based on advanced federated learning fl technology moubayed et al 2021 park et al 2021 the functionality of the fl can be tested for more practical gwl detection and monitoring the expected

3630,modeling groundwater level gwl is a challenging task particularly in intensive groundwater based irrigated regions due to its dependency on multiple natural and anthropogenic factors the main motivation of the current investigation is to develop a new advanced artificial intelligence ai model for gwl simulation an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis optimized by improved alpha guided grey wolf optimization ia gwo algorithm is proposed in this study for reliable prediction of gwl in an intensively irrigated region of northwest bangladesh natural and anthropogenic factors including rainfall evapotranspiration groundwater abstraction and irrigation return flow were considered as input variables for the development of the models the efficacy of the proposed model was compared with standalone anfis and ann models and their hybrid versions using particle swarm optimization anfis pso models both standard statistical metrics and visual inspection of scatter plots violin plots and taylor diagrams were employed for performance evaluation thirty one years 1981 2011 monthly groundwater level data were used for the calibration and validation of the models the results revealed the better performance of anfis ia gwo with normalized root mean square error nrmse of 0 06 0 11 and kling gupta efficiency kge of 0 96 0 98 compared to anfis pso nrmse 0 38 0 55 and kge 0 70 0 86 and ann ia gwo nrmse 0 42 0 57 and kge 0 75 0 91 and ann pso nrmse 0 50 0 63 and kge 0 63 0 83 the visual comparison of results showed that anfis ia gwo model was able to replicate the mean distribution interquartile range and standard deviation of observed gwl more appropriately compared to other models keywords groundwater level artificial intelligence adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system improved alpha guided grey wolf algorithm prediction model 1 introduction agriculture plays a major role in the national economy people s well being and social security in most of the developing countries of the world various meteorological physical and policy related factors play roles in agricultural development and the agro based economy of a region khudhair et al 2020 among all the factors water is considered as the most important to crop productivity makurira et al 2009 a major portion of cropland in the world is irrigated using groundwater due to the unavailability of sufficient surface water during the irrigation season al aboodi and hashim 2019 salem et al 2018 besides groundwater can balance large swings in precipitation and the associated increase in demands during droughts gurdak and qi 2012 taniguchi and hiyama 2014 therefore groundwater has become the major source of irrigation in many regions with an increase of droughts and water stress due to climate change wang et al 2016 for example about 60 of the irrigated food grain production in india depends on groundwater irrigation and about half of the total area irrigated depends on groundwater wells pour et al 2020 tukimat et al 2012 about 85 of total water for irrigation in bangladesh comes from groundwater ahmed et al 2015 however groundwater based irrigation is much costly compared to surface water irrigation in many regions it is the major source of the total cost incurred in agriculture for example irrigation shares about 40 of the total cost of grain production in some regions of bangladesh shahid et al 2006 however irrigation cost varies significantly from place to place irrigation cost in a groundwater dependent irrigation system depends on the amount of irrigation needs depth of groundwater table and price of energy required for groundwater abstraction shahid et al 2015 among these three factors groundwater depth is the most influencing factor in the regions where groundwater table depletes significantly during irrigation season malik et al 2019 a huge abstraction of groundwater to meet the growing demand for irrigation has caused the groundwater level to fall drastically during the irrigation season in many regions of the world the decline of groundwater level causes an increase in energy demand for groundwater abstraction and therefore irrigation cost it was estimated that irrigation cost increase by up to 6 due to a 1 meter drop in groundwater levels in india shukla 2003 accurate prediction of groundwater level is therefore very important for agricultural planning and irrigation scheduling for the economic benefit of farmers reliable estimation of groundwater level is also important for the sustainable management of groundwater resources of a region groundwater based irrigation plays a pivotal role in agro based economies food security and the livelihoods of people in many countries around the world siebert et al 2010 watto and mugera 2015 therefore economies and people s livelihoods can be significantly improved through providing an accurate prediction of groundwater level gwl there are several major negative concerns related to the aquifer depletion such as dry wells local water rationing changes in groundwater flow pattern that is resultant in poor water quality erratic ground water quality and sea water intrusion in coastal area armanuos et al 2021 the accurate groundwater level forecasting can be highly essential for catchment and basin management and sustainability for a general point of view of aquifer groundwater level forecasting required a huge hydrological parameters and effective simulation model for better understanding the pattern of the groundwater level fluctuation hence finding an alternative for technology is highly recommended from the aspect of hydrology point of view water management planning and operation in developed countries are often involved the feasibility of computer simulation models these models are based on theoretical background and might be simple or complex mathematic deterministic or stochastic can provide a reliable framework for decision makers a large number of studies have been conducted for the prediction of gwl mehr et al 2018 naganna et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 yaseen et al 2018 generally hydrogeologist uses conventional physical based models gwl prediction models e g modflow mohammadi 2008 such models need a large amount of meteorological geological and hydrological information for accurate prediction of gwl xu et al 2012 the availability of such a large amount of data is a major challenge in gwl prediction in most regions of the world in recent years data driven statistical models have been developed for prediction of gwl using a limited amount of available data jalalkamali et al 2011 sharafati et al 2020 the conventional statistical methods such as multiple linear regression mlr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima have been used in those studies barzegar et al 2017 for example sahoo and jha 2013 used linear regression for prediction of groundwater level sahoo and jha 2013 takafuji et al 2019 employed an arima for the prediction of groundwater level de moraes takafuji et al 2019 the major disadvantage of conventional statistical models is the large uncertainty in their predictions yaseen et al 2019a such models often fail in simulating groundwater level in a complex hydrological setup machine learning ml models have been proposed to overcome the difficulties of conventional statistical models in the simulation of complex hydrological process ahmadianfar et al 2020 ghorbani et al 2018 jamei et al 2020 khosravi et al 2019 naganna et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019b for groundwater level simulation different ml algorithms have been conducted such as artificial neural network nayak et al 2006 gradient boosting kenda et al 2020 least square support vector machine lssvm khedri et al 2020 gene expression programming shiri and ki≈üi 2011 anfis nadiri et al 2019 neuro fuzzy kisi and shiri 2012 support vector machine salem et al 2018 studies revealed a large improvement in model performance using ml methods the application of ml methods in gwl prediction revealed the better performance of ann in most of the previous studies however the recent applications of anfis showed better prediction capability due to integration of the fuzzy system in ann nadiri et al 2019 the literature review on the ml models development for gwl prediction based on scopus database presented using vosviewer algorithm in fig 1 the interconnection between the major keywords indicated the massive application of the gwl using the feasibility of ml models in addition several regions have been explored using the potential of the computer aid models as it can been in table 1 however bangladesh is not between those regions among several ai model developed for gwl modeling anfis and ann models observed to be majorly established emamgholizadeh et al 2014 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 moosavi et al 2012 nourani et al 2008 trichakis et al 2011 although the anfis and ann have shown higher potential in predicting gwl the accuracy of the models often not satisfactory when employed for gwl prediction in a complex hydrological setup moghaddam et al 2019 natarajan and sudheer 2020 yoon et al 2016 such as intensive groundwater based irrigated region where gwl changes drastically due to human interference like the abstraction of groundwater studies showed that the performance of ml models in simulating complex phenomena can be improved significantly by optimizing its hyper parameters ehteram et al 2020 qi et al 2020 tiyasha et al 2020 for example maroufpoor et al 2019 showed that the performance of the anfis model can be improved by optimizing the internal parameters for modeling soil temperature maroufpoor et al 2019 a recent study of banadkooki et al 2020 showed enhancement of ml based gwl prediction models by optimizing its parameters using whale algorithm other researches on diverse hydrological processes have confirmed the potential of hybrid ml models applications anaraki et al 2021 fu et al 2021 kim et al 2019 kraft et al 2021 lin et al 2021 tian et al 2021 varieties of algorithms have been proposed for optimization of ml model parameters which includes ant colony aco genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso butterfly optimization algorithm boa harris hawks optimization hho particle swarm optimization pso and grey wolf optimization gwo tiyasha et al 2020 the major problem of the optimization algorithm is trapping to local minima salih and alsewari 2019 recently performance of gwo is improved to make it efficient in avoiding trapping to local minima and providing optimum outputs adnan et al 2021 the application of the gwo has been observed in diverse engineering and sciences applications and evidenced its capacity alirahmi et al 2021 fan et al 2021 habibollahzade et al 2021 mani and jain 2020 zhao et al 2021 however the latest version of gwo known as improved alpha guided gwo ia gwo mani and jain 2020 is employed in this study for optimization of anfis and ann model parameters the performance of ia gwo was compared with pso which has been widely used in recent years for the optimization of many natural processes therefore four hybrid models anfis ia gwo ann ia gwo anfis pso and ann pso and two standalone models anfis and ann were developed in this study the anfis and ann were used to evaluate the relative performance of ml methods found most efficient in prediction gwl while ia gwo and pso optimization algorithms were used to assess the improvement of model performance using a newly developed optimization algorithm besides the performance of stand alone anfis and ann models were evaluated to show the improvement in prediction through hybridization of optimization algorithms it is expected that the models developed in this study can be employed for the prediction of groundwater in an intensive groundwater based irrigated region where overexploitation and large seasonal variation of groundwater abstraction have made the gwl prediction highly complex 2 study area and data the study area lat 23 87 24 78 n long 88 30 88 89 e is situated in the northwestern part of bangladesh fig 2 the topography of the area is completely flat with a mild slope toward the southeast the region receives the least amount of rainfall 1500 to 1600 mm in the country mohsenipour et al 2018 almost 85 of the annual rainfall occurs during may october the rainfed crop is grown during the rainy season the rest of the months are dry the temperature during march and april reaches the annual maximum which causes high evaporation and drying of all surface water bodies nashwan et al 2019 groundwater is used as the only source of water during the dry season the government encouraged groundwater based irrigated agriculture during the dry season in the mid eighties to alleviate poverty a large expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture has been notified in the region in the last three decades at present northwest bangladesh is one of the most intensive irrigated agriculture regions of the country about 60 of the crop in the region is grown during the dry season january to april groundwater is used as the only source of irrigation during the crop growing period high yield variety hyv paddy is the crop mainly cultivated using irrigation through groundwater abstraction the groundwater depth in the region varies from 5 17 m overexploitation of groundwater to support intensive irrigation caused a gradual decline of gwl shahid 2011 accurate prediction of gwl is very important for the region for the sustainable management of groundwater resources monthly gwl depth to groundwater table monitored at three locations for the period 1981 2011 was collected from the barind multipurpose development authority of bangladesh fig 3 monthly rainfall and temperature data for the same period were collected from the meteorological station in the study area the information related to soil mechanical properties was gathered from the soil map of the soil resources development authority of bangladesh the time series of gwl data at three locations of the study area are shown in fig 3 3 methodology the seasonal and annual variation of gwl depends on the variability of climate for example gwl goes down in dry season when rainfall is less or evapotranspiration et is high while it comes near to ground surface during the wet season however groundwater abstraction gwa is the major driving factor of gwl in the groundwater based irrigated region a large portion of irrigated water percolates through the irrigated cropland and returns to the subsurface the irrigation return flow irf also controls gwl the irf depends on soil characteristics for example permeable soil allows more infiltration while impermeable soil allows less percolation and more standing water to evaporate into the atmosphere based on this basic concept four factors namely rainfall et gwa and irf were taken into account for the prediction of gwl the procedure followed for the prediction of gwl is shown using a flowchart in fig 4 in this study a temperature based monthly et estimation model proposed by thornthwaite was used for the generation of monthly time series of et gwa was considered equals to the irrigation demand of the crop cultivated in the region a water balance model was used for the estimation of crop irrigation needs the irf was estimated based on soil mechanical properties the estimated values of et gwa and irf along with rainfall was used as input in ml models developed in this study for the prediction of gwl the methods used for the generation of input data and algorithms used for the development of gwl prediction are described in the following subsections 3 1 generation of inputs in this subsection a description for the main essential input variables used for the ground water simulation those input variables are including irrigation demand evapotranspiration and the infiltration from cropland 3 1 1 estimation of irrigation demand high yield variety hyv paddy is cultivated in the study area which needs groundwater irrigation during january to april shew et al 2019 the fao 56 method was used to estimate irrigation needs i n of paddy as 1 i n et c w s r e where et c is is the et from cropland which can be estimated as the product of et and crop coefficient of hyv paddy w s is the water needed for land preparation which is estimated from soil moisture holding capacity and r e is effective rainfall 3 1 2 estimation of evapotranspiration the monthly values of et can be estimated using thornthwaite method as basile and corbin 1969 2 et 16 c 10 t mean h a where c is the correction factor defined based on the latitude and month of the year tmean is the monthly average of daily mean temperature oc h is a heat index estimated for the whole year and a is a coefficient dependent to h 3 1 3 calculation of infiltration from cropland the soil permeability near the vicinity of gwl monitoring well was employed for the calculation of irf the mechanical composition of soil of sand clay and loam was used to estimate irf based on the guidelines proposed by brouwer et al brouwer and heibloem 1986 irf equals to 8 mm day for sand 4 mm day for clay and 6 mm day for loam groundwater abstraction for irrigation in the region is required only from january to april therefore the monthly time series of gwa and irf were estimated for those months the values of gwa and irf for other months were considered zero 3 2 artificial neural network ann ann is a technique that works based on the brain s learning process ehteram et al 2020 ann is developed using several neurons in different layers which are considered as the building block of ann in a typical ann system neurons are arranged in three layers input hidden and output as shown in fig 5 nourani et al 2008 the neurons in the first layer receive the inputs x i the hidden layers allow neurons to learn complex features taormina et al 2012 a weight is assigned to each input which modifies the inputs according to their influence on the output each neuron also has a bias which is considered as the additional inputs to neurons the anns generate the relationships between the input and output data by calculating weight values the nonlinear activation function is applied to the weighted input to sum them and provide output in ann the weights and biases are updated to maximize prediction accuracy different algorithms are used to optimize ann weight and bias parameters 3 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis integrates the strengths of ann and fuzzy logic to improves its learning capacity of the behavior of a complex process and therefore it has been found to provide a better simulation of many natural and engineering processes compared to other ml methods shahid et al 2002 in this study anfis was used for the prediction of gwl a typical two inputs anfis system is shown in fig 6 penghui et al 2020 anfis simulates a process e g gwl using five steps the first step is known as fuzzification where fuzzy sets are generated from inputs using takagi sugeno fuzzification rule in fig 6 x and y are the fuzzy sets of inputs a and b the nodes of the fuzzification layer are adaptive represented using the box in the diagram which implies that the node parameters are adjustable during the learning phase zounemat kermani et al 2020 the second layer of anfis is known as a product which is fixed represented using circles in the diagram products of input signals are generated in this layer the product value w is then passed to normalization third layer where the values are normalized as below 3 w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 where w 1 and w 2 are the product of the inputs generated in the second layer a function is performed in the fourth layer which can be presented as 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r i where p i q i and r i are inference parameters finally the output is estimated at the last or fifth layer using the following equation 5 f i w i f i i w i f i i w i in anfis simulation is conducted using two passes a forward pass where a least square algorithm is used to alter the fuzzy rule function parameters and a backward pass where fuzzy membership function parameters of inputs are altered using an error backpropagation algorithm the performance of anfis depends on the type and the number of membership functions which are known as hyperparameters of anfis optimization of hyperparameters is required during the learning process to achieve higher accuracy in simulation mohammed et al 2020 the learning process of hybrid ann or hybrid anfis consists of two phases the first is the optimization of model parameters and the second is the improvement of prediction accuracy using the optimized model several optimization algorithms are employed in literature for training ml models the major problem of optimization algorithm is trapping to local minima therefore a recently developed sophisticated optimization algorithm ia gwa is used in this study for optimization of ann and anfis model parameters the performance of ia gwo is compared with pso which has been reported to show excellent performance in optimization of ml models in simulation of various natural and engineering processes the optimization algorithms used in this study are described below 3 4 improved alpha guided grey wolf optimization ia gwo the gwo is developed considering social hierarchical structure and hunting procedure of wolf pack elhariri et al 2016 naturally wolves belong to different ranks based on their social status in gwo it is considered that wolves belong to four grades where the bottom to top grades are Œ± Œ≤ Œ¥ and œâ tahani et al 2019 the preying activities of a wolf pack consist of three steps tracing and heading trailing and inclosing and finally confronting the prey in gwo the wolves belong to Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ grades guide the hunting while the wolves belong to grade œâ improve their hunting ability by following the wolves of other grades the encircling method can be represented as 6 x t 1 x p t a c x p t x t in the above equation t is the present iteration x p and x implicate the location vectors of the hunt and hunter candidate solutions respectively a 2 a r 1 a and c 2 r 2 indicate coefficient vectors with r 1 and r 2 being as random vectors range from 0 to1 allow the wolves to change their status in the hunt space the magnitude of a is gradually decreased from 2 to zero using the following equation 7 a t 2 2 t t where t signifies the total number of iterations during the search process œâ wolves update their status according to the best exploration factors i e Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ which are represented as 8 x 1 x Œ± a 1 c 1 x Œ± x 9 x 2 x Œ≤ a 2 c 2 x Œ≤ x 10 x 3 x Œ¥ a 3 c 3 x Œ¥ x 11 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 in gwo Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ are more knowledgeable about the potential prey they guide œâ but lacks any effective mechanism for successful preying pin et al 2013 improved gwo by proposing a guiding mechanism by Œ± which is known alpha guided gwo a gwo in this improved algorithm the position of Œ± is updated in each iteration to change the dimensions of Œ± coordinate which helps to move gradually towards a better position however the population is concerted to Œ± Œ≤ and Œ¥ which often keep them immobile in the same place for a longer period ia gwo improves the ability of Œ± to skip of the local optimum hu et al 2018 in ia gwo if the fitness of Œ± is found more than the previous iteration the position of the whole wolf pack is updated towards the direction of Œ± the flowchart of the ia gwo is presented in fig 7 3 5 particle swarm optimization pso pso is a stochastic optimization algorithm developed based on the conception of bird s communal behavior yang 2014 in searching for food the flocking birds try to follow the bird which is nearest to food trelea 2003 therefore each bird is considered as a solution in the search space which is known as a particle in pso the optimal solution is searched through particles each particle is determined by its achieved position and the best particle position the particles change their positions based on the equations below jahandideh tehrani et al 2020 13 v i t 1 œâ v i t c 1 r

inertia coefficient the stochastic properties of pso guarantee the solution space exploitation eberhart and shi 2001 pso has been employed in numerous fields in optimization it has only a few adjustable parameters and therefore found more efficient in estimation of optimum values of prediction models parameters 3 6 performance evaluation of prediction models four statistical indices namely normalized root mean square error nrmse relative absolute error re armstrong and collopy 1992 nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 modified index of agreement md willmott 1981 and kling gupta efficiency kge index pool et al 2018 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models the statistical indices used are defined below 15 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 x obs

observed obs data x obs denotes the mean value of the observed data Œ± œÉ sim œÉ obs which is presented the variability Œ≤ Œº sim Œº obs which is the bias term j is the exponent term the values of nrmse ranges between 0 and nse between 1 0 and md between 1 0 and 1 0 and kge between and 1 0 the optimum value of nse md and kge is 1 0 while nrmse is 0 4 results and discussion precipitation et gwa and irf data were used as input and gwl data as output for the development of ml models as per the presented gwl time series data at three locations of the study area presented in fig 3 it can be observed that a gradual increase in variability in gwl in all the locations in the study area an increase in groundwater abstraction to meet the growing irrigation demand causes declination of gwl in peak irrigation period prediction of gwl using stochastic models is not possible for the region due to high non stationary in terms of both mean and variability in data therefore an attempt was taken in this study to predict gwl from surficial hydro meteorological variables the data were divided into calibration and validation periods for the development and testing of the models the models were calibrated with 70 of observed data january 1981 august 2002 and validated for the rest 30 data september 2002 december 2011 the performance of the models was compared with observed gwl data at all the locations the performance of the models was evaluated using both statistical metrics and graphical presentations obtained results during model validation at three locations are presented in the following subsections 4 1 statistical assessment of model performance the performance of the models in terms of four statistical indices during model validations is presented in table 2 the hybrid models were found to perform much better compared to standalone ml models at all three locations the relative performance of the hybrid models revealed the better performance of ia gwo compared to pso the highest performance was obtained when anfis was hybridized with ia gwo algorithm the nrmse nse md and kge of anfis ia gwo model was found in the range of 0 06 0 11 0 97 0 98 0 94 0 96 and 0 96 0 98 while those were found in the range of 0 42 0 57 0 77 0 82 0 77 0 80 and 0 75 0 91 for ann ia gwo another important evaluation metric which is the relative absolute error based on the computed re minimum values were attained for the three investigated locations of gwl the lowest modeling performance was noticed for ann however it was still satisfactory in terms of statistical indices nrmse between 0 66 and 0 77 nse between 0 51 and 0 59 md in the range of 0 65 to 0 70 and kge between 0 63 and 0 68 all the models were found to perform better at gwl 02 location compared to the other two sites the least performance was noticed at gwl 03 high variability and continuous declination of gwl with time have made the prediction of gwl at the location more complicated 4 2 performance assessment using box whisker and scatter plots box whisker plots of observed and simulated monthly gwl data by the models were developed fig 8 to show the capability of the models to replicate median inter quartile range iqr and spread of data the results revealed that the anfis ia gwo box is more similar to the observed box in all the three study locations the anfis ia gwo model was able to replicate the observed median and iqr perfectly it was found to overestimate a few high gwl data and underestimate some low values at gwl 01 however the data spread estimated by anfis ia gwo at gwl 02 and gwl 03 were perfect the ann ia gwo model was found to perform very near to anfis ia gwo at gwl 01 and gwl 03 the performance of anfis pso and ann pso was also found good in all the locations they were also found to replicate the median and range of data reliably however the performance of models optimized using ia gwo was found higher compared to those optimized using pso the lowest performance was noticed for standalone models at all the locations which indicate the necessity of ml model hyperparameter optimization for reliable prediction of gwl the scatter plots of observed and simulated gwl using different models are presented in fig 9 the performance of anfis ia gwo compared to anfis pso and standalone anfis are shown using scatter plots in the left column while those for ann are shown in the right column each row shows the model performance at each of the three locations the results show that the simulated gwl is more aligned to the diagonal line of the scatter plot for anfis ia gwo the coefficient of determination r2 values for anfis ia gwo were found 0 99 0 99 and 1 0 at gwl 01 gwl 02 and gwl 03 locations the r2 values and the narrow spread of the anfis ia gwo simulated gwl around the diagonal line indicate a very high performance of the model the performance of anfis ia gwo was found much higher compared to anfis pso r2 0 91 0 9 and 0 91 and standalone anfis r2 0 82 0 81 and 0 87 a similar improvement in model performance was noticed for ann models the r2 values for ann ia gwo were found 0 84 0 85 and 0 87 for the locations gwl 01 gwl 02 and gwl 03 respectively which was much higher compared to that obtained using ann pso and standalone ann a comparison of the relative performance of anfis and ann hybrid models revealed the better performance of anfis hybrid models 4 3 performance assessment using taylor diagram the performance of different hybrid models was also evaluated using taylor diagram obtained results at three locations are presented in fig 10 the black hollow circle on the x axis of the taylor diagram represents observed gwl a model is considered better if it is near to the observed point taylor diagram compares three statistics together in a graphical way and therefore provides a reliable assessment of the relative performance of different models the taylor diagrams in fig 10 shows a very close performance of the hybrid models at all the locations all the models except anfis ia gwo were found to clustered very close to each other which indicates the very close performance of the models the anfis ia gwo model was found to replicate the variability of observed gwl at gwl 01 and gwl 03 perfectly while it was found to overestimate the variability a bit at gwl 02 consistency in the results of the models were noticed at all the locations based on the taylor diagram the models can be ranked as follows anfis ia gwo anfis pso ann ia gwo ann pso anfis ann 4 4 performance assessment in replicating gwl probability distribution finally the performance of the model to replicate the probability distribution of observed gwl data was visually evaluated through the preparation of violin plots the plots for observed and model simulated gwl data are shown in fig 11 the similarity in the shape of the violin represents more similarity in the distribution of simulated and observed gwl data the figure shows a good similarity between observed and anfis ia gwo simulated gwl at all three locations overall the shape of the violin of hybrid models was found more similar to the observed violin for all the cases the highest distortion in the violin was observed for standalone ann followed by standalone anfis a comparison of the results at three locations revealed the better performance of all the models in replicating observed gwl distribution at gwl 1 and gwl 3 the performance of different models in terms of different statistics was found to vary little for different locations consistency in the results indicates a clear superiority of the anfis ia gwo model in simulating gwl in the study area in addition several other hydrometeorological parameters possibly can be considered as external predictors for the gwl fluctuation 5 validation with the literature it is worth to validate the current research results with the established research over the literature as the absolute error metrics might be varied from one case to another as per the data range the determination coefficient value r2 was selected for the validation nayak et al 2006 developed classical ann model for shallow gwl aquifer in india the proposed ann model attained maximum r2 0 73 same model was adopted to predict gwl at south korea lee et al 2019 and the model reported r2 0 84 pre processing approach of wavelet analysis was integrated with ann model for the purpose of improving the prediction results of gwl at two sites in the chateauguay watershed in quebec canada and the proposed model was able to achieve r2 0 97 adamowski and chan 2011 several ai models were conducted on the prediction gwl at the vizianagaram district india including ann support vector regression svr extreme learning machine elm genetic programming gp natarajan and sudheer 2020 the best prediction result was attained by elm model with r2 0 96 based on the revealed prediction accuracy and in comparison with the current research model accuracy the anfis ia gwo was able to obtain better predictability performance 6 conclusion and future research direction prediction of gwl in groundwater based irrigation regions is highly complex due to increasing variability and decreasing mean with time however accurate prediction of gwl in such a region is highly important for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this study models were developed for the prediction of gwl from surficial hydro meteorological variables the novelty of the study is the use of an improved algorithm for optimization of the parameters of anfis model which has been found to provide higher reliability in gwl predication in different studies the study found the capability of the newly developed model in providing near perfect simulation of gwl in the irrigated region of northwest bangladesh it was observed that hybridization of conventional ml models with advanced optimization algorithm can improve the model prediction capability significantly the drawbacks of the physically based model such as the requirement of a high volume of data and lower prediction accuracy can be overcome using the anfis ia gwo model developed in this study in quantitative terms the proposed anfis ia gwo model attained nrmse values between 0 06 and 0 11 and kge values between 0 96 and 0 98 in comparison with the other models anfis pso nrmse 0 38 0 55 and kge 0 70 0 86 ann ia gwo nrmse 0 42 0 57 and kge 0 75 0 91 and ann pso nrmse 0 50 0 63 and kge 0 63 0 83 the model can be used for reliable estimation of gwl for estimation of groundwater abstraction cost for irrigation appropriate scheduling of irrigation and taking necessary measures to sustain groundwater level for environmental protection the current research can further extend through studying the associated uncertainties that are related to the models dataset or the input variables goliatt et al 2021 an attempt can be taken for prediction for daily gwl using different inputs that can be analyzed for the selection of the higher influential factors only as inputs for the development of parsimonious model in addition the next generation of the ml development is the online modeling by implementing an expert system that can be used in more practical aspects future research can be devoted on developing and designing up to date gwl data sampling based on advanced federated learning fl technology moubayed et al 2021 park et al 2021 the functionality of the fl can be tested for more practical gwl detection and monitoring the expected system is fundamentally constructed based on distributed network architecture and smart internet of thing iot sensors system edge servers and centralized could for fl aggregation as presented in fig 12 the first phase includes the sensing data for the gwl and transmits to the second phase where the edge server gathers all the information to be supplied to the predictive model the third phase comprised the fl process that is communicated the modeling results with centralized cloud the fl centralized cloud initiate the update for the global model prediction the advantage of this model is to have more informative intelligence model that can be practically contribute to the decision making of the related hydrological engineering credit authorship contribution statement fang cui data

3631,the model calibration is one of the essential processes in the land surface model lsm simulations to achieve high performance and predictability for the use in integrated water resources and disaster risk management to climate change since the performance criteria often used to evaluate or calibrate hydrological models have their own advantages and limitations it is necessary to understand the nature of each performance criterion in the model performance assessment or identification to the model application purpose for the design flow estimates from hydrological modeling data the liu mean efficiency lme was proposed by reformulating the three metric components correlation variability and bias measures in the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse or the kling and gupta efficiency kge to improve flow variability in the runoff simulations optimized with the nse or kge however the lme criterion can potentially pose serious challenges to comparative performance evaluation and reliable design flow estimation due to the underdetermined solutions towards the excessive flow variation for a complementary approach to the limitations of the nse kge and lme this study has therefore proposed a new rebalanced performance criterion based on the least squares regression components combined from both way regression analysis between simulations and observations it has been illustrated that the proposed criterion can provide a rebalanced trade off between the constituent metric components leading to the improved flow variability with taking advantages of the kge through the theoretical comparative analysis and the case study for long term weekly streamflow time series from the lsm simulations in the four study watersheds with natural unregulated flow observations keywords model calibration model performance evaluation rebalanced performance criterion streamflow simulation land surface model liu mean efficiency 1 introduction runoff plays a significant role in balancing the terrestrial hydrologic cycle the surface and subsurface runoff simulations have been one of the most important topics for the water resource management zhang et al 2016 as natural disasters related to streamflow such as floods and droughts have increased in the frequency and severity due to climate change ipcc 2012 it is necessary to simulate long term streamflow in the hydrologic modeling for integrated water resources and water related disaster risk management moreover from the perspective of water related hazard assessments and sustainable adaptation strategies to climate change at large scale watersheds land surface models lsms are required to simulate the spatial and temporal changes of surface and subsurface runoff reflecting both topographical features of the land and meteorological factors of the atmosphere since the lsms coupled to the global climate models gcms or regional climate models rcms can simulate the exchanges of both water and energy between surface and atmosphere they have been providing the comprehensive information about climate change impacts on the terrestrial hydrologic cycle muleta and nicklow 2005 troy et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2015 parker et al 2019 despite or due to persistent and significant model improvements the current lsms incorporating the sophisticated assimilation processes can inevitably introduce substantial uncertainties associated with model parameters as well as input data therefore the model calibration or parameter estimation is one of the essential processes in the lsm simulations to improve the model performance and predictability the streamflow simulation results from the lsms can often contain systematic errors or biases associated with terrestrial parameterization schemes whether simplistic or complex hence the model calibration is necessary to systematically adjust model parameters so that the model streamflow results are as close as possible to the observed data in general the calibration procedure requires the numerical criteria to evaluate model performance usually defined as mathematical functions that can measure agreement between the observed data and the simulation results of the model beven 2001 the use of biased calibration methods may result in degraded performance of model predictability or biased estimates of model parameters it is therefore desirable to conduct the hydrological model calibration as a multi objective approach for measuring the overall model performance gupta et al 1998 in particular the multi objective framework should be designed to prevent the possibility of miscalculation by the dominant measure among all constituent performance metrics that must be mutually independent in an objective space however when some of the constituent metric components are mathematically related or interacting with each other a multi objective calibration approach might be affected by the unintendedly weighted metric measures lee and choi 2021 it is also considered that the multi objective framework should be designed to avoid overfitting by an underdetermined or unexpected behavior of the performance criterion which might evaluate poor performance as the optimal cases the performance criteria have been often used in the hydrological model evaluation or calibration based on the goodness of fit between the simulated results and the observed data since each of the performance criteria has its own nature and peculiarity one of the aims in this study is to examine the advantages and limitations of some popular performance criteria to be applied appropriately to the purposes of model applications if there is a systematic bias tendency towards overestimation or underestimation in the streamflow simulation results from the lsms even when optimizing with one of the popular performance criteria it will significantly reduce the validity and reliability on the use of the lsms for the water related hazard and risk management the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 most commonly used for the hydrological model calibration was algebraically decomposed into separate components to identify possible trade offs between the constituent components murphy 1988 weglarczyk 1998 gupta et al 2009 gupta et al 2009 decomposed the nse into three distinctive components representing the relative variability Œ± the normalized bias Œ≤ n and the linear correlation coefficient r between the simulated and observed data and also demonstrated that the calibration by the nse tends to select the underestimated variability in the model streamflow because the optimal nse is likely to occurs when Œ± is equal to r which cannot achieve its ideal value of unity the kling and gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was therefore proposed for a balanced solution among the three components variability Œ± bias Œ≤ and correlation r measures decomposed from the nse by computing the euclidian distance in the three dimensional pareto front of the three components the kge implicitly based on the equally weighted three metric measures has been used in evaluating the hydrological model behavior on streamflow simulations and achieved better variability performance than the nse calibration results gupta et al 2009 fowler et al 2018 santos et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 it has been however found that the kge criterion still tends to underestimate peak flows in the streamflow simulation results albeit not as severe as with the nse gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 santos et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 liu 2020 lee and choi 2021 as the correlation r of flows tends to be substantially lower than unity in most streamflow modeling the kge criterion is more likely to account for the r measure with a dominant relative contribution to the kge unintentionally rather than the other two metric components Œ± and Œ≤ gupta et al 2009 lee and choi 2021 to further improve the underestimation of flow variability in the kge optimization the liu mean efficiency lme liu 2020 was developed based on the standard regression statistics for the one way regression line regressing the simulated result against the observed data by taking into account the condition for a desirable regression line slope and offset and the relative accuracy measure to a standard reference mean observed data liu 2020 formulated the lme by the euclidian distance from the ideal point of the two metric components such as the regression slope and the bias in the simulated against observed flows the optimal slope r Œ± 1 condition for a desirable regression line in the lme can increase the variability Œ± measure because the value of correlation r is typically smaller than unity which seems to mitigate the underestimation of peak flows on the nse or kge optimization however such optimal condition Œ± 1 for r Œ± 1 of flow variability has a strong tendency to overestimate high flows and or underestimate low flows in the lme optimal simulations as a result the frequency analysis results of high flows and low flows with the lme criterion produced significantly larger amounts of designed floods and smaller amounts of designed low flows as provided in liu 2020 moreover larger possible errors in both r and Œ± allowed for the optimal slope condition r Œ± 1 can mislead the model performance evaluation obtained by the lme criterion choi 2021 as addressed in liu 2020 the lme does not guarantee that higher lme scores correspond to smaller errors in simulations therefore the lme criterion has the potential to introduce significant ambiguity in hydrological model evaluation or calibration choi 2021 to complement the lme based on the one way least squares regression analysis this study proposed a more robust performance criterion by combining the least squares regression coefficients from the two regression lines in both way regression analysis between simulations and observations this study first reviewed the framework and nature of a new proposed criterion along with the popular performance criteria the nse kge and lme and then the behavior features of each performance criterion were diagnostically investigated by theoretical relationships and exemplary comparisons a case study for calibrating long term streamflow simulations from a lsm was also illustrated for the assessment of a new performance criterion proposed in this study for long term large scale streamflow time series of the lsm simulations this study selected one of the most advanced lsms an enhanced version of the common land model colm incorporating a set of lateral flow schemes that combine a diffusion wave surface flow with a topographically controlled baseflow choi et al 2013 lee and choi 2017 the model grid based streamflow simulations of the colm have been already implemented and assessed for the model streamflow applications in a standalone mode at the 30 km resolution gan et al 2015 lee and choi 2017 lee and choi 2021 in order to evaluate the performance of long term streamflow simulations at a regional mesoscale by the choice of performance criteria under study the colm has been calibrated from 2000 to 2009 and then validated from 2010 to 2019 for the weekly streamflow time series at the four dam reservoir inflow sites in the republic of korea where long term observations of the natural unregulated flow are available along with the realistic surface boundary conditions sbcs based on the high quality and finer resolution data the meteorological forcing data for long term offline simulations have been also constructed from the point data of the meteorological stations onto the computational domain of the 30 km scale grids under study the theoretical considerations were all supported by the colm streamflow simulation results during both calibration and validation periods in the case study followed by the discussion and conclusions to address the advantages of the proposed method and the limitations of this study 2 theoretical framework 2 1 overview of nse kge and lme the performance criteria for measuring the overall model performance have been usually used in the calibration scheme based on the goodness of fit between model and data the calibration approach of hydrological models generally selects the optimal parameter set that can produce the simulation result with the best agreement against the observed data as the calibration of the hydrological models is usually approached as a multi objective problem it is desirable that the performance criteria comprise multiple metrics for measuring different aspects of model performance gupta et al 1998 bastidas et al 1999 bastidas et al 2006 moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 2009 van werkhoven et al 2009 neelin et al 2010 the mean squared error mse or root mean squared error rmse has been commonly used as a statistical estimator for the hydrological model performance by measuring the discrepancy between the simulated and observed values the nse a normalized mse by the standard deviation sd of observations is one of the popular dimensionless performance criteria as presented by nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 n s e 1 mse sd 2 1 x o x s 2 x o Œº o 2 where x o and x s are the observed and simulated values respectively and Œº o is the mean value of x o as for an alternative way to the previous decomposition analysis murphy 1988 weglarczyk 1998 of the nse gupta et al 2009 mathematically decomposed the nse into the three constituent components to understand the distinctive metrics interrelated in the nse as 2 n s e 2 Œ± r Œ± 2 Œ≤ n 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between x s and x o Œ± œÉ s œÉ o is the relative variability measured by the ratio between standard deviations œÉ s of x s and œÉ o of x o Œ≤ n Œº s Œº o œÉ o is the bias difference between mean values Œº s of x s and Œº o o f x o normalized by œÉ o in a multi objective perspective of the trade offs among the three separate metrics correlation r variability ratio Œ± and bias Œ≤ decomposed from the nse to be optimized gupta et al 2009 aggregated the three components into a new performance criterion the kge by the euclidian distance function to compute a compromise solution from the three dimensional pareto front as 3 k g e 1 r 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 where Œ≤ Œº s Œº o is the bias measured by the ratio between means Œº s of x s and Œº o of x o on the other hand one of the most common and simple methods for evaluating model performance is to analyze scatter plots between the simulated and observed values for the similarity to the 1 1 line by interpreting the slope and offset y intercept parameters of the least squares regression models for both way x s against x o and x o against x s moriasi et al 2007 pi√±eiro et al 2008 in the both regression equations x s m o x o c o and x o m s x s c s the slopes m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± the offsets c o Œº s m o Œº o and c s Œº o m s Œº s and the coefficient of determination r 2 m o m s can be estimated by the least squares approach note that unless both Œ± and Œ≤ are equal to unity the two regression lines are asymmetric where the two values of slopes m o and m s and the two values of offsets c o and c s can be distinguished from each other in the axis orientation for regressing x s and x o gupta et al 2009 demonstrated that the optimal nse can be obtained when Œ± r and Œ≤ n 0 resulting in m o r 2 and m s 1 whereas the optimal kge can be obtained when Œ± 1 and Œ≤ 1 leading to m o r and m s r the interpretation of the slope value m o r 2 in the optimal nse or m o r in the optimal kge can imply that there is a general tendency to underestimate high flows and overestimate low flows in the optimal result with the nse or kge since the value of r is typically smaller than unity gupta et al 2009 on the contrary the interpretation of the other slope value m s 1 in the optimal nse or m s r in the optimal kge can provide another performance evaluation information as such the model performance evaluation may vary depending on the regression results by variables x o and x s placed in each axis and the selection of only one of the two regression parameter sets m o c o or m s c s can change the conclusions of the model performance evaluation pi√±eiro et al 2008 the liu 2020 focused on the standard regression statistics in the single regression line x s m o x o c o with the ideal condition for slope m o r Œ± 1 and offset c o Œº s m o Œº o 0 resulting in Œ≤ 1 and formulated the lme by the euclidian distance from the ideal point in the pareto front of the metric components m o and Œ≤ as 4 lme 1 m o 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 since the value of r is smaller than unity in general the optimal Œ± will be greater than unity so that m o r Œ± is close to unity while the other component Œ≤ is able to unity when optimizing with the lme this optimal condition m o r Œ± 1 and c o Œº s m o Œº o 0 for maximizing the lme will also result in a milder slope m s r Œ± 1 and a positive offset c s Œº o c s Œº s 0 in the other regression line x o m s x s c s which indicates a general tendency to overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows as also expected in the optimal variability measure Œ± 1 for maximizing the lme as such the model performance evaluation can be significantly changed by the interpretation of each of the two regression lines x s and x s thus the interpretation of the slope m o alone in the lme is not sufficient for the model performance evaluation which can be the same issue as the interpretation in accordance with the slope m s alone in the nse furthermore the lme is an underdetermined system with more decision variables Œ± Œ≤ and r than constraints r Œ± 1 and Œ≤ 1 resulting in an infinite number of solutions for the maximum potential value of the lme the optimal ideal condition of m o r Œ± 1 for maximizing the lme when Œ≤ 1 can yield numerous combinations of r and Œ± where large errors in both can compensate each other for r Œ± 1 and even they can be evaluated as being higher in the lme skill scores than when both r and Œ± are very close to their ideal values at unity this implies that higher skill scores of the lme criterion cannot guarantee the model performance with smaller errors thus in addition to regression coefficients slope and offset of the regression line another statistical information is required for comprehensively evaluating the similarity of the regression lines to the 1 1 line in the same vein but instead of the confidence level or intervals based on the probability or cumulative distribution function of the lme suggested by liu 2020 this study has taken into consideration measuring how close the data are to the regression line which is the coefficient of determination r 2 representing the proportion of the total variation explained by the regression model even in a desirable regression model x s with m o 1 and c o 0 i e Œ≤ 1 a smaller value of r 2 indicates that more data points are scattered far from the regression line which means that observations cannot be accurately reproduced by the model note that the value of r 2 is identical in both regression lines x s and x o thus a desirable regression line x s or x o when m o 1 or m s 1 and Œ≤ 1 can perfectly fit the data when r 2 m o m s 1 resulting in m s 1 o r m o 1 which is consequently identical to the optimal condition for both way desirable regression lines x s and x o as discussed earlier 2 2 a rebalanced performance criterion as reviewed above although the lme criterion was presented by reformulating the three metric components of the nse or kge to improve an underestimation of flow variability the lme based on a single regression line x s is likely to produce overfitting results where the problematic interplay between r and Œ± measures tends to overestimate flow variability on the lme optimization for a comprehensive performance criterion based on the standard regression statistics the optimal condition of the least squares regression is required for both desirable regression lines such as m o 1 c o 0 i e Œ≤ 1 for x s and m s 1 c s 0 i e Œ≤ 1 for x o or the optimal condition of m o 1 Œ≤ 1 for a desirable regression model x s requires another condition of m s 1 for r 2 m o m s 1 to have more data closer to the regression line x s such optimal condition is identical to the other regression line x o as a result therefore this study has proposed a new rebalanced performance criterion based on the least squares coefficients combined from both regression lines the least squares combined efficiency or lee and choi efficiency lce as 5 l c e 1 m o 1 2 m s 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 taking the partial derivatives of the lce with respect to r Œ± and Œ≤ and then setting them equal to zero indicates that the lce can be potentially maximized when all the three metric components r Œ± and Œ≤ are equal to unity resulting in m o 1 and m s 1 as 6 l c e r Œ± r Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 Œ± 2 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 2 0 l c e Œ± r r Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 Œ± 2 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 2 0 l c e Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 2 0 fig 1 illustrates the theoretical relationships of the nse kge lme and lce with changes in r 0 5 to 1 0 and Œ± 0 5 to 1 5 while assuming Œ≤ n 0 and Œ≤ 1 the maximum nse occurs when Œ± is equal to a given r smaller than unity in general gupta et al 2009 at a given r the optimal Œ± is the ideal value of unity for maximizing the kge gupta et al 2009 whereas the optimal Œ± for maximizing the lme are on the curve line for r Œ± 1 liu 2020 this indicates a problematic underdetermined system with numerous combinations between r and Œ± for r Œ± 1 resulting in the maximum potential lme score even when neither r nor Œ± is the ideal value of unity the optimal lme is likely to be achieved by the optimal Œ± overestimation much larger than unity when r is much smaller than unity on the other hand the maximum lce occurs when Œ± 1 for a given r as in the case with the kge fig 1 also shows the difference between kge and lce in that the identical skill scores of the kge are symmetrical across the vertical line of Œ± 1 whereas those of the lce are asymmetric and biased expanding towards larger Œ± values Œ± 1 due to the inverse relationship between the reciprocal functions of Œ± and 1 Œ± in the lce formulation see eq 5 also this means that the optimal result with the lce is more likely to be achieved when Œ± 1 rather than when Œ± 1 of course at the value of Œ± close to unity unless Œ± is able to achieve the ideal value at unity as usually in hydrological simulations thus the proposed lce optimization can offer the possibility to improve the variability in the simulated runoff which can overcome a tendency of underestimation in optimization on the nse or kge as well as a tendency of overestimation in optimization on the lme 2 3 exemplary comparison of performance criteria as discussed above theoretical behavior relationships of the nse kge lme and lce show that a peculiar interplay between r and Œ± for each performance criterion can play a significant role in the hydrological model calibration or identification however the theoretical considerations presented above may be not always feasible in hydrological modeling that might be impossible to provide all combinations of the metric component measures in simulation results thus to examine the model performance evaluation based on the skill scores of each performance criterion table 1 and fig 2 illustrate a comparative example of the six sample simulation cases against the observed monthly runoff time series for two years the performance evaluation results for the six sample simulation cases are obtained by the nse kge lme and lce respectively as shown in table 1 while assuming that Œ≤ n 0 and Œ≤ 1 for the simplicity the six sample simulation cases exhibit illustrative combinations of Œ± and r measures such as Œ± 1 r Œ± for sim1 Œ± 1 r Œ± for sim2 Œ± 1 r Œ± for sim3 Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 for sim4 and Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 for sim5 and sim6 each simulation case number 1 6 is hereinafter referred to by a subscript for variables to be described in the model skill scores based on the nse n s e 1 0 727 shows the highest score when Œ± r Œ± 1 0 853 and r 1 0 853 with the smallest Œ± value among the six simulation cases which demonstrates that the nse optimization is likely to underestimate flow variability as a result in the model performance evaluation by the kge k g e 3 0 853 when Œ± 1 Œ± 3 1 000 and r 3 0 853 is the highest score which indicates that the kge can somewhat improve flow variability underestimated in the nse i g when Œ± 1 0 853 Œ± 3 1 000 k g e 1 0 792 k g e 3 0 853 whereas n s e 1 0 727 n s e 3 0 707 but there is still a tendency towards underestimation of flow variability with the kge i g when Œ± 2 0 935 Œ± 4 1 068 k g e 2 0 839 k g e 4 0 838 in the lme optimization l m e 5 1 000 when r Œ± 1 Œ± 5 1 173 and r 5 0 853 is the maximum potential score along with l m e 6 1 000 when r Œ± 1 albeit by inferior Œ± and r Œ± 6 1 253 and r 6 0 798 as such the maximum potential lme 1 000 occurs at larger errors in both Œ± and r of sim5 and sim6 compared with the other four simulation cases moreover both sim5 and sim6 with the maximum lme score will be selected as the optimal results even if there exists an outstanding case where both Œ± and r are almost equal to their ideal values i g lme 0 998 at Œ± 0 999 and r 0 999 this implies that higher lme skill scores cannot correspond to smaller errors in the simulation results which may potentially lead to significant ambiguity in the comparative model evaluation on the contrary in the skill scores based on the lce criterion sim5 and sim6 are evaluated as l c e 5 0 727 and l c e 6 0 637 lower than the other four cases as in the results with the nse and kge in addition the lce optimization can improve flow variability still underestimated in the kge optimization i g when Œ± 2 0 935 Œ± 4 1 068 l c e 2 0 779 l c e 4 0 780 whereas k g e 2 0 839 k g e 4 0 838 this is due to the nature of the lce criterion where the model skill scores are asymmetric with respect to the Œ± 1 possibly resulting in higher lce scores when Œ± 1 i g sim4 than when Œ± 1 i g sim2 of course the optimal lce occurs when there is the ideal case for the variability Œ± 1 at a given r measure such as in sim3 l c e 3 0 793 at Œ± 3 1 000 and r 3 0 853 3 case study 3 1 study watershed to investigate and demonstrate the implications of the proposed lce criterion for the performance evaluation of hydrological models this study has chosen the four study watersheds in the republic of korea for the colm streamflow simulations fig 3 and table 2 denote the four hydrologic stream gauge stations of each dam reservoir inflow site such as soyang river dam sd chungju dam cd daecheong dam dd and nam river dam nd which were selected for study sites by taking into account the minimal effect of both the flow regulation of river facilities in the upstream and the environmental control of tidal fluctuations in the estuary as denoted in table 2 the upstream areas of the four study watersheds range from 3 151 to 6 771 km2 representing the four largest dam upstream watersheds in the republic of korea for both calibration and validation of weekly streamflow simulations against observations at these four stream gauge stations the persistent long term observations of the natural unregulated flow were achieved from the dam reservoir inflow data of the water resources management information system wamis website http www wamis go kr wkd mn dammain aspx managed by the ministry of environment in these study watersheds affected by east asian monsoon climate the concentrated rainfall occurs during the summer period from june to september according to past meteorological data from 2000 to 2019 the average summer precipitation 897

and energy interactions between the land and the atmosphere as a lsm of the climate weather research and forecasting cwrf model liang et al 2012 the colm has taken the following major updates to improve the terrestrial hydrologic schemes focusing on runoff predictions a volume averaged soil moisture transport parameterization choi et al 2007 a surface subsurface interaction parameterization choi and liang 2010 and a conjunctive surface subsurface flow scheme choi et al 2013 in addition another version of the colm has recently presented by incorporating a topographically controlled lateral flow scheme into the baseline soil moisture transport scheme lee and choi 2017 it can be a simplified version of the conjunctive surface subsurface flow scheme choi et al 2013 for the streamflow simulations in the sites where the soil moisture data are insufficient to implement a volume averaged soil moisture transport scheme a more detailed description of the colm streamflow simulations is presented in lee and choi 2017 the performance of streamflow simulations from the colm incorporating the lateral flow scheme at a model grid based mesoscale has been evaluated against

distance weight idw method onto the 30 km computational domain covering the four study watersheds long term offline simulations from the colm were conducted for the past thirty years from january 1990 to december 2019 to minimize the impact of uncertainty in the initial conditions on the colm predictability the simulation results for the first ten years during 1990 1999 were excluded from the

results in this study the colm calibration against weekly streamflow time series at the four study watersheds focused on a set of the two parameters the hydraulic conductivity decay factor ∆í and the hydraulic conductivity anisotropic ratio Œ∂ see also appendix known as the key parameters affecting on the colm streamflow simulations in the previous studies chen and kumar 2001 kumar 2004 choi and liang 2010 choi et al 2013 lee and choi 2017 lee and choi 2021 an ensemble experiments of the colm simulations were generated for the calibration period from january 2000 to december 2009 by changing values of the calibration parameters within the feasible ranges from 2 to 9 for the decay factor ∆í and from 10 to 10 000 for the anisotropic ratio Œ∂ after the calibration period analysis determined the optimal parameter ∆í and Œ∂ values to maximize each performance criterion the nse kge lme and lce respectively for the four study watersheds they were used to simulate weekly streamflow time series during the independent validation period from january 2010 to december 2019 respectively for the four study watersheds under each performance criterion the weekly streamflow discharge observations and watershed drainage areas were obtained from the wamis website for the four study watersheds the observed and simulated streamflow values were compared by using the specific runoff streamflow per unit area because of the difference between the real watershed area and the model grid based watershed area table 4 and fig 5 present the three metric component measures of the variability Œ± the bias Œ≤ and the correlation r along with the two slope m o and m s values of both regression lines x s and x o respectively for the optimal cases obtained by each performance criterion nse kge lme and lce during the calibration and validation periods over the four study watersheds sd cd dd and nd in the republic of korea in general the Œ± values that can reflect each criterion s own nature are substantially different in the four performance criteria which can also affect the Œ≤ measures to a certain extent whereas the r values change little by the choice of the four methods the Œ± values are smaller in the nse with the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r and larger in the lme with the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r 1 than in each other three performance criteria meanwhile the Œ± values are closer to unity in the kge and lce but the lce with the theoretically optimal condition of r Œ± 1 while r Œ± 1 will tend to increase Œ± values to be larger than unity which is not the case in the kge with the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± 1 for the four study watersheds as a result the m o values are smaller while the m s values are larger in the nse and the m o values increase while the m s values decrease as the optimal Œ± values increase with the performance criteria in the order of the nse kge lce and lme overall the model performance results are statistically more desirable for the calibration period and statistically consistent for the validation period in all of the four performance criteria although the performance measures are somewhat inferior when moving from the calibration to validation periods as shown in table 4 and fig 5 fig 6 shows the relationship between r and Œ± along with the relationship between m o and m s in the optimal cases obtained by the choice of the four performance criteria for both calibration and validation periods over the four study watersheds the nse criterion tends to yield the optimal cases where Œ± values are slightly bigger than r values as shown in fig 6 a consequently the values of m o are relatively smaller while the values of m s are substantially large in the nse optimization as shown in fig 6 b in the kge optimization where the Œ± values are slightly smaller than the ideal value at unity as shown in fig 6 a the both m o and m s values are similar to each other and the data points in the scatter plot are slightly below the 1 1 line m s values are slightly larger than m o values as shown in fig 6 b when optimizing with the lme criterion the Œ± values are substantially larger than the ideal value at unity see fig 6 a to achieve m o values close to unity but m s values are much smaller than unity see fig 6 b as a result as shown in fig 6 b the proposed lce criterion will make both m o and m s values together closer to unity in contrast to the nse or lme results and also shows that the data points in the scatter plot are slightly above the 1 1 line m o values are slightly larger than m s values in contrast to the kge results accordingly the lce tends to have the optimal Œ± values slightly larger than unity but not as large as those obtained by the lme optimization as shown in fig 6 a figs 6 and 7 also illustrate the scatter plots for relationships between weekly streamflow observations and simulations optimized by the four performance criteria for depicting simulations against observations during the calibration period in fig 7 a and the validation period in fig 8 a and for depicting observations against simulations during the calibration period in fig 7 b and the validation period in fig 8 b respectively over the four study watersheds the trends of the optimal runoff simulations by the nse are smoother than those by the other three performance criteria in the scatter plots for simulations against observations as shown in fig 7 a and fig 8 a whereas those by the lme are smoother than those by the other three performance criteria in the scatter plots for observations against simulations as shown in fig 7 b and fig 8 b in terms of the variation of data sets the lme results tend to be the highest and the nse results tend to be the lowest for both calibration see fig 7 and validation see fig 8 periods in the four study watersheds as such the nse tends to underestimate high flows and overestimate low flows whereas the lme tends to overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows on the other hand the optimal runoff results by the kge and lce tend to lie between the nse and lme data sets in all the scatter plots for simulations against observations fig 7 a and fig 8 a and for observations against simulations fig 7 b and fig 8 b compared with the kge results the peak flows optimized by the lce tend to be slightly higher in the fig 7 a and fig 8 a and tend to be slightly to the right side in fig 7 b and fig 8 b this shows the lce will further improve the still underestimated high flows in the kge optimization figs 7 and 8 illustrate that the scatter points of the lce results are closer to the 1 1 line with smaller variations than the other results 5 discussion 5 1 model performance by performance criteria for the use in design flow estimates liu 2020 proposed the lme by reformulating the three distinctive components correlation variability and bias measures of the nse or kge to improve the model performance associated with flow variability in the runoff simulations when optimizing on the nse or kge however there can be potential problems in the model calibration or identification with the lme based on the one way regression line x s for regressing the simulated against observed values although the standard regression statistics for measuring the linear relationship between simulations and observations is one of the most common techniques for evaluating the hydrological model performance moriasi et al 2007 the two regression lines x s and x o can have significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation pi√±eiro et al 2008 thus the lme optimization for a desirable regression line x s alone could not reflect the behavior of the other regression line x o since the one way regression line can only guarantee the goodness of fit to the expected values of simulations or observations rather than their individual values complementary measures to the lme criterion are required for the use in diagnostic evaluations to support hydrological model calibration or identification choi 2021 this study first investigated peculiar features and appropriateness of the lme as an alternative performance criterion to the nse or kge and diagnosed problematic issues associated with an optimization on the lme in terms of the two slopes in both regression lines x s and x o such as m o r Œ± for regressing simulations against observations and m s r Œ± for regressing observations against simulations the optimal slope values are m o r 2 and m s 1 for maximizing the nse and m o r and m s r for maximizing the kge respectively the interpretation of the slope values of m o 1 due to r 1 in general in the nse and kge can indicate that there is the systematical tendency for the mean of high flows to be underestimated and the mean of low flows to be overestimated when optimizing with the nse or kge thus as a way to improve such underestimation in flow variability on the nse or kge optimization the lme criterion incorporates the optimal condition of m o r Œ± 1 which will lead to the optimal value of Œ± 1 to compensate for r 1 regardless of the optimal ideal condition for each component however this optimal condition of m o will result in the other slope value of m s r Œ± 1 which indicates that the mean of high flows will tend to be overestimated and the mean of low flows will tend to be underestimated as can be also found in the optimal condition of Œ± 1 although the lme criterion was proposed for the design flow estimates from hydrological frequency analysis on model simulation results with the improved flow variability the lme optimal results will provide significantly larger amounts of designed floods and smaller amounts of designed low flows which is also less reliable for the water related hazard and risk management therefore the comprehensive interpretation of both slopes m o and m s along with the variability Œ± measure is required for the model performance evaluation especially associated with the extreme flows peak and or low flows of interest moreover the lme is an underdetermined system where the number of constraints r Œ± 1 and Œ≤ 1 is fewer than the number of decision variables Œ± Œ≤ and r as shown in theoretical and exemplary considerations earlier the interplay between r and Œ± for the optimal condition of m o r Œ± 1 in the lme can have numerous optimal solutions that can potentially maximize the lme score even when both r and Œ± have large errors contradictorily such cases will be treated as superior to when both r and Œ± are closer to unity in the model calibration results with the lme in general the model calibration with the performance criteria should select the optimal model parameters consistently by the optimal skill score of the performance criteria designed towards the minimum or none error achieved in the only one ideal case during a model calibration or evaluation process choi 2021 thus the lme optimization in which higher scores of the lme based on error metrics cannot reflect smaller simulation errors should be further reviewed by another visual or statistical goodness of fit measure choi 2021 these limitations lead to the conclusion that the lme is not sufficient to evaluate the overall model performance in hydrological modeling the evaluation of a regression line against the 1 1 line can only measure the proximity of the mean or expected values of simulations or observations to the 1 1 line rather than their individual agreement hence only one aspect of the two regression slopes especially when they are distinguished can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations in the model performance evaluation as in the interpretation of m s 1 alone instead of m o 1 when optimizing with the nse the optimal slope condition of m o 1 alone instead of m s 1 in the lme cannot accurately reflect the model performance therefore in the standard regression statistics for measuring the linear relationship between model and data it is desirable that both slope m o and m s values approach one with a smaller difference between them for a better goodness of fit result both m o and m s values can be equal to one only when the model can provide a perfect match to data in contrast the significant difference between m o and m s values in the nse or lme optimization can lead to the misinterpretation of model performance as well as the strong tendency towards severe underestimation or overestimation in the simulations again the problematic interplay between r and Œ± for m o alone in the lme criterion is more likely to overestimate high flows and or underestimate low flows in the optimal runoff simulation faced with poor performance due to overfitting when optimizing with the lme as such the lme criterion has weaknesses of an underdetermined system that can potentially induce the vagueness in comparative assessments for alternative model performance as well as an overestimation system that can substantially reduce the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological modeling in order to complement the limitations of the lme criterion this study has proposed the lce criterion based on the least squares statistics combined from both way regression lines for regressing the simulated against observed values and regressing the observed against simulated values in the lce criterion for a balanced evaluation on the similarity of the two regression lines to the 1 1 line the optimal condition of the two slopes m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± will achieve their ideal values at unity which can happen only when r 1 and Œ± 1 unlike in the lme unless the optimal value of Œ± can exactly achieve the ideal value of unity the optimal lce score is more like to occur when Œ± 1 due to the role of a reciprocal relationship between Œ± and 1 Œ± in the lce criterion this will potentially improve the tendency towards underestimation of flow variability in the model calibrations with the nse or kge in addition the variability Œ± incorporated with the two metric components m o and m s in the lce formulation can play a significant role in the optimization on the lce whereas the impact of the variability Œ± along with the bias Œ≤ tends to be limited on the kge results that tend to be dominated by the correlation r as shown in gupta et al 2009 theoretical considerations for the four performance criteria nse kge lme and lce were reviewed with several example cases representing typical simulation characteristics since all theoretically optimal conditions for the performance criteria are not always feasible in hydrological modeling experiments and then these theoretical and comparative analysis results were all supported by long term streamflow time series from the colm simulations in the case study although the hydrological models might be impossible to produce all modeling experiment data within the theoretical criteria space due to constraints on model structure parameter ranges and available data gupta et al 2009 overall our case study provided adequate experiments to illustrate the advantages and limitations of each performance criterion under study the colm streamflow results optimized with the lce criterion showed relatively good measures for the three metric components Œ± Œ≤ and r over the four study watersheds in general the case study demonstrated that there is a strong tendency for the optimal Œ± to be slightly larger than unity due to the role of Œ± associated with m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± in the lce while this is not the case with the kge in our experiments Œ± can also of course be larger than unity in the kge optimization the optimal r and Œ± values will increase in the lce so that the m o and m s values can approach their ideal values while the Œ≤ errors tend to slightly increase which is less likely to be the optimal case for the kge due to the albeit little increased Œ≤ errors the case study can also help to understand the trade offs between the correlation r the variability Œ± and the bias Œ≤ measures in each performance criterion the nse kge lme and lce the nse criterion produced the optimal Œ± values less than unity and also smaller than the kge results but they tend to be somewhat larger than the optimal correlation r values unlike the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r the lme produced the optimal Œ± values greater than unity and also larger than the lce results but they can be somewhat insufficient smaller to achieve the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r 1 it is implied that such optimal Œ± results obtained with the nse or lme can be effected and limited by the bias Œ≤ measures assumed to be zero for the simplicity in theoretical and exemplary considerations since the simulation results with much larger or smaller values of Œ± will at the same time have a tendency towards larger Œ≤ errors resulting in lower skill scores that are less likely to be the optimal results in the nse or lme optimization in the same context the optimal Œ≤ results tend to be superior in the kge and lce where the optimal Œ± values can be closer to the ideal value at unity compared with in the nse and lme where the optimal Œ± values are much smaller in the nse or larger in the lme than unity compared with the substantial changes in the optimal values of Œ± and Œ≤ that can be close to their ideal values by the choice of the performance criteria all the four criteria under study have the similar optimal values of the correlation r that cannot reach its ideal value at unity in general there is only a small difference in the r values for each performance criterion in that the kge and lce tend to have the optimal r values slightly smaller than those in the nse and they can decrease more by much larger optimal Œ± values for Œ± r 1 in the lme the four performance criteria also showed different behaviors on the slope values m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± for the two regression lines of the colm streamflow simulations since the r values are typically smaller than unity m o m s 1 due to Œ± 1 on the nse optimization whereas m o 1 m s due to Œ± 1 on the lme optimization unlike the nse and lme optimization results where the m o and m s values are distinguished the differences between m o and m s values tend to decrease in the kge and lce where the optimal Œ± values can be closer to unity than in the nse and lme in streamflow simulations with r 1 m o values will increase and m s values will decrease as Œ± values increase thus there is a tendency for m o values to be slightly larger than m s values in the lce where the optimal Œ± values tend to be slightly larger than unity but this tendency is not noticeable or vice versa m s values are slightly larger than m o in the kge the case study showed that the lce optimal results can be obtained when the two slope m o and m s values are considerably larger and similar to each other for the both desirable regression lines 5 2 model parameters by performance criteria fig 9 shows the statistical properties of the streamflow hydrographs measured by Œ± Œ≤ and r according to the change in values of the calibration parameter sets within the feasible ranges ∆í 2 9 and Œ∂ 10 10 000 over the four study watersheds when the parameter ∆í value is less than around 6 an increase in the parameter Œ∂ has the effect of increasing the Œ± and Œ≤ measures under the other conditions of the parameter ∆í greater than around 6 the Œ± and Œ≤ values initially increase and then decrease as the parameter Œ∂ increases it is due to a consequence of complex interaction of the two parameters ∆í and Œ∂ in the surface and subsurface flow modeling structure of the colm see appendix for details in general increasing the parameter Œ∂ results in more baseflow and increasing the parameter ∆í results in higher peak flows but limited for relatively smaller Œ∂ values which has the overall effect of increasing the values of both Œ± and Œ≤ measures except when both parameters ∆í and Œ∂ are relatively larger on the contrary when the parameter ∆í value is larger than around 6 and also the parameter Œ∂ value is larger than around 1 500 the surface flow and peak flows significantly decreases albeit the baseflow still increases as the parameter Œ∂ increases which has the overall effect of decreasing the values of both Œ± and Œ≤ measures as the parameter ∆í exerts a strong control on the surface and subsurface runoff partitioning by interacting in complex with other factors including the parameter Œ∂ the parameter ∆í acts as a double sided factor that can increase or decrease the surface runoff see eq a 2 along with eqs a 3 and a 4 as such the combination of the two parameters ∆í and Œ∂ has an intricate effect on the streamflow generation in the colm as denoted in table 4 the optimal values of the two calibration parameters ∆í and Œ∂ do not change significantly compared to the feasible parameter ranges across the three performance criteria the nse kge and lce except for the lme with much larger ∆í and much smaller Œ∂ values over the four study watersheds although there are somewhat more variations among the three optimal parameter sets in the watershed nd and dd when moving from the nse to the kge and lce the parameter ∆í slightly increases and the parameter Œ∂ slightly decreases which can improve the underestimated high flows with the nse in all the four study watersheds such change in the parameter ∆í and Œ∂ values are even more pronounced particularly for the watershed dd moreover the parameter ∆í values become much larger and the parameter Œ∂ values become much smaller in the lme optimization which has the effect of higher peaks in the surface flow and quicker recession in the baseflow of the model streamflow this is due to that fact that the lme optimization seeks to achieve a much higher value than the ideal value of unity of the Œ± measure in addition from the best calibration results with the lce we can infer the relationship between the optimal values of the parameter set ∆í and Œ∂ and the features of watersheds vegetation topography soil texture etc as denoted in table 3 a relatively smaller ∆í value is calibrated to be identical for the three study watersheds sd cd and nd ∆í 3 where the land cover types are predominantly mixed forest and thus may have relatively less macropore effect on the surface in these three watersheds a relatively smaller Œ∂ value is calibrated for the watershed nd Œ∂ 1 200 in a milder slope terrain with a relatively deeper bedrock depth i e composite effects of very slow lateral subsurface flow and a decline tendency of the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth than the watersheds sd Œ∂ 3 400 and cd Œ∂ 3 300 for the optimal parameter values in the watershed dd ∆í 5 and Œ∂ 900 it can be inferred that a relatively larger ∆í value is mainly influenced by relatively more macropore effect in the savanna region with a relatively gentle terrain slope and a relatively smaller Œ∂ value is mainly influenced by a relatively deeper bedrock depth along with more macropore effect i e a decrease in Œ∂ can be compensated by an increase in ∆í as such it was found that the optimal parameter set obtained with the lce calibration can more realistically reflect the watershed characteristics the calibration parameters with different performance criteria can also affect the water budget results for the terrestrial components in a watershed fig 10 compares the 20 yr averaged climatology of monthly surface runoff subsurface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration and recharge results from the colm respectively calibrated with the nse kge lme and lce for the four study watersheds as illustrated in fig 10 a and d relatively larger ∆í and smaller Œ∂ values with the lme than the other three calibration cases have the overall effect of more surface runoff leading to higher peak flows and less infiltration particularly in j j a over the four study watersheds when moving from the nse to the kge and lce the baseflow generation is enhanced by an increase in ∆í or Œ∂ value which shows a decrease in the infiltration and recharge rate as a result in particular the baseflow further enhanced with the lce can improve streamflow variability in the rainy season j j a compared to the nse and kge optimizations as shown in fig 10 b the baseflow results by a certain amount of Œ∂ with the lme are comparable to those with the kge and lce in the watersheds sd and cd whereas relatively less baseflow is generated by much smaller Œ∂ values with the lme in the watersheds dd and nd note that the baseflow contribution to the streamflow is relatively smaller in the watersheds dd and nd where the watershed terrain slope is relatively gentle see also table 3 overall the infiltration and recharge rate is relatively higher on the nse optimization that generates less surface or subsurface runoff compared to the other calibration cases on the other hand as denoted in fig 10 c there is no significant change in the evapotranspiration results across all the four performance criteria as the parameters ∆í and Œ∂ do not directly affect the evapotranspiration response which is more largely influenced by watershed characteristics and climatic factors vegetation cover solar radiation precipitation humidity wind etc 5 3 implications and future research for performance criteria therefore the use of lce criterion for model calibration will provide a rebalanced performance in trade offs between correlation variability and bias measures and the streamflow simulation results on the lce optimization will further improve a tendency towards underestimation of flow variability when taking advantages of the kge the weekly streamflow simulations were also evaluated for the validation period 2010 2019 independent to the calibration period 2000 2009 although the individual performance components and the performance criteria statistically tend to somewhat deteriorate in the four study watersheds for the validation period the behavior trends in model performance by the choice of performance criteria persisted during the validation period in general the evaluation results for hydrological model performance criteria in this study are required for further analysis on the reliability of the model parameter values along with the sensitivity of input data and the uncertainty in the computed statistics associated with differences between theory or population and sampling cases 6 conclusions this study has proposed a rebalanced performance criterion the lce based on the least squares statistics from the both regression lines for regressing simulations against observations and regressing observations against simulations the lce was formulated by the euclidian distance from the ideal point of the least squares regression components estimated by the previous metric components correlation variability and bias in the nse or kge this study diagnosed the systematic problems inherent in optimization on the lme criterion prone to overfitting with excessive flow variation and then demonstrated the advantages of the lce proposed for a rebalanced trade off between the performance metric components in the streamflow simulation results as a complementary approach to the limitations associated with the other performance criteria nse kge and lme the lce optimization with better variability and correlation measures at the expense of a slightly larger bias error not only can prevent underdetermined solutions that tend to overestimate flow variability on the lme optimization but also can improve a tendency towards underestimation of flow variability with taking advantages of the kge optimization thus the use of lce criterion for model evaluation or calibration can potentially improve the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological frequency analysis on model simulation results as well as the consistency in comparative assessments for alternative model performance it is also necessary to understand the nature of performance criteria that have their own advantages and limitations in the model performance evaluation or identification for model applications through the theoretical analysis and case study on the four performance criteria the nse kge lme and lce this study can present the influence of the peculiar trade offs between individual metric measures for each performance criterion on the diagnostic model evaluation or model calibration process of hydrological modeling however since it is not possible for our experiments to generate and investigate all possible optimization cases because the calibration results reflect the heterogeneity of modelling processes parameter selections basin characteristics climatic conditions sample sizes temporal data scales and spatial model resolutions etc the proposed lce criterion needs to be tested and evaluated systematically for more simulation

3631,the model calibration is one of the essential processes in the land surface model lsm simulations to achieve high performance and predictability for the use in integrated water resources and disaster risk management to climate change since the performance criteria often used to evaluate or calibrate hydrological models have their own advantages and limitations it is necessary to understand the nature of each performance criterion in the model performance assessment or identification to the model application purpose for the design flow estimates from hydrological modeling data the liu mean efficiency lme was proposed by reformulating the three metric components correlation variability and bias measures in the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse or the kling and gupta efficiency kge to improve flow variability in the runoff simulations optimized with the nse or kge however the lme criterion can potentially pose serious challenges to comparative performance evaluation and reliable design flow estimation due to the underdetermined solutions towards the excessive flow variation for a complementary approach to the limitations of the nse kge and lme this study has therefore proposed a new rebalanced performance criterion based on the least squares regression components combined from both way regression analysis between simulations and observations it has been illustrated that the proposed criterion can provide a rebalanced trade off between the constituent metric components leading to the improved flow variability with taking advantages of the kge

significant role in balancing the terrestrial hydrologic cycle the surface and subsurface runoff simulations have been one of the most important topics for the water resource management zhang et al 2016 as natural disasters related to streamflow such as floods and droughts have increased in the frequency and severity due to climate change ipcc 2012 it is necessary to simulate long term streamflow in the hydrologic modeling for integrated water resources and water related disaster risk management moreover from the perspective of water related hazard assessments and sustainable adaptation strategies to climate change at large scale watersheds land surface models lsms are required to simulate the spatial and temporal changes of surface and subsurface runoff reflecting both topographical features of the land and meteorological factors of the atmosphere since the lsms coupled to the global climate models gcms or regional climate models rcms can simulate the exchanges of both water and energy between surface and atmosphere they have been providing the comprehensive information about climate change impacts on the terrestrial hydrologic cycle muleta and nicklow 2005 troy et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2015 parker et al 2019 despite or due to persistent and significant model improvements the current lsms incorporating the sophisticated assimilation processes can inevitably introduce substantial uncertainties associated with model parameters as well as input data therefore the model calibration or parameter estimation is one of the essential processes in the lsm simulations to improve the model performance and predictability the streamflow simulation results from the lsms can often contain systematic errors or biases associated with terrestrial parameterization schemes whether simplistic or complex hence the model calibration is necessary to systematically adjust model parameters so that the model streamflow results are as close as possible to the observed data in general the calibration procedure requires the numerical criteria to evaluate model performance usually defined as mathematical functions that can measure agreement between the observed data and the simulation results of the model beven 2001 the use of biased calibration methods may result in degraded performance of model predictability or biased estimates of model parameters it is therefore desirable to conduct the hydrological model calibration as a multi objective approach for measuring the overall model performance gupta et al 1998 in particular the multi objective framework should be designed to prevent the possibility of miscalculation by the dominant measure among all constituent performance metrics that must be mutually independent in an objective space however when some of the constituent metric components are mathematically related or interacting with each other a multi objective calibration approach might be affected by the unintendedly weighted metric measures lee and choi 2021 it is also considered that the multi objective framework should be designed to avoid overfitting by an underdetermined or unexpected behavior of the performance criterion which might evaluate poor performance as the optimal cases the performance criteria have been often used in the hydrological model evaluation or calibration based on the goodness of fit between the simulated results and the observed data since each of the performance criteria has its own nature and peculiarity one of the aims in this study is to examine the advantages and limitations of some popular performance criteria to be applied appropriately to the purposes of model applications if there is a systematic bias tendency towards overestimation or underestimation in the streamflow simulation results from the lsms even when optimizing with one of the popular performance criteria it will significantly reduce the validity and reliability on the use of the lsms for the water related hazard and risk management the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 most commonly used for the hydrological model calibration was algebraically decomposed into separate components to identify possible trade offs between the constituent components murphy 1988 weglarczyk 1998 gupta et al 2009 gupta et al 2009 decomposed the nse into three distinctive components representing the relative variability Œ± the normalized bias Œ≤ n and the linear correlation coefficient r between the simulated and observed data and also demonstrated that the calibration by the nse tends to select the underestimated variability in the model streamflow because the optimal nse is likely to occurs when Œ± is equal to r which cannot achieve its ideal value of unity the kling and gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was therefore proposed for a balanced solution among the three components variability Œ± bias Œ≤ and correlation r measures decomposed from the nse by computing the euclidian distance in the three dimensional pareto front of the three components the kge implicitly based on the equally weighted three metric measures has been used in evaluating the hydrological model behavior on streamflow simulations and achieved better variability performance than the nse calibration results gupta et al 2009 fowler et al 2018 santos et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 it has been however found that the kge criterion still tends to underestimate peak flows in the streamflow simulation results albeit not as severe as with the nse gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 santos et al 2018 mizukami et al 2019 liu 2020 lee and choi 2021 as the correlation r of flows tends to be substantially lower than unity in most streamflow modeling the kge criterion is more likely to account for the r measure with a dominant relative contribution to the kge unintentionally rather than the other two metric components Œ± and Œ≤ gupta et al 2009 lee and choi 2021 to further improve the underestimation of flow variability in the kge optimization the liu mean efficiency lme liu 2020 was developed based on the standard regression statistics for the one way regression line regressing the simulated result against the observed data by taking into account the condition for a desirable regression line slope and offset and the relative accuracy measure to a standard reference mean observed data liu 2020 formulated the lme by the euclidian distance from the ideal point of the two metric components such as the regression slope and the bias in the simulated against observed flows the optimal slope r Œ± 1 condition for a desirable regression line in the lme can increase the variability Œ± measure because the value of correlation r is typically smaller than unity which seems to mitigate the underestimation of peak flows on the nse or kge optimization however such optimal condition Œ± 1 for r Œ± 1 of flow variability has a strong tendency to overestimate high flows and or underestimate low flows in the lme optimal simulations as a result the frequency analysis results of high flows and low flows with the lme criterion produced significantly larger amounts of designed floods and smaller amounts of designed low flows as provided in liu 2020 moreover larger possible errors in both r and Œ± allowed for the optimal slope condition r Œ± 1 can mislead the model performance evaluation obtained by the lme criterion choi 2021 as addressed in liu 2020 the lme does not guarantee that higher lme scores correspond to smaller errors in simulations therefore the lme criterion has the potential to introduce significant ambiguity in hydrological model evaluation or calibration choi 2021 to complement the lme based on the one way least squares regression analysis this study proposed a more robust performance criterion by combining the least squares regression coefficients from the two regression lines in both way regression analysis between simulations and observations this study first reviewed the framework and nature of a new proposed criterion along with the popular performance criteria the nse kge and lme and then the behavior features of each performance criterion were diagnostically investigated by theoretical relationships and exemplary comparisons a case study for calibrating long term streamflow simulations from a lsm was also illustrated for the assessment of a new performance criterion proposed in this study for long term large scale streamflow time series of the lsm simulations this study selected one of the most advanced lsms an enhanced version of the common land model colm incorporating a set of lateral flow schemes that combine a diffusion wave surface flow with a topographically controlled baseflow choi et al 2013 lee and choi 2017 the model grid based streamflow simulations of the colm have been already implemented and assessed for the model streamflow applications in a standalone mode at the 30 km resolution gan et al 2015 lee and choi 2017 lee and choi 2021 in order to evaluate the performance of long term streamflow simulations at a regional mesoscale by the choice of performance criteria under study the colm has been calibrated from 2000 to 2009 and then validated from 2010 to 2019 for the weekly streamflow time series at the four dam reservoir inflow sites in the republic of korea where long term observations of the natural unregulated flow are available along with the realistic surface boundary conditions sbcs based on the high quality and finer resolution data the meteorological forcing data for long term offline simulations have been also constructed from the point data of the meteorological stations onto the computational domain of the 30 km scale grids under study the theoretical considerations were all supported by the colm streamflow simulation results during both calibration and validation periods in the case study followed by the discussion and conclusions to address the advantages of the proposed method and the limitations of this study 2 theoretical framework 2 1 overview of nse kge and lme the performance criteria for measuring the overall model performance have been usually used in the calibration scheme based on the goodness of fit between model and data the calibration approach of hydrological models generally selects the optimal parameter set that can produce the simulation result with the best agreement against the observed data as the calibration of the hydrological models is usually approached as a multi objective problem it is desirable that the performance criteria comprise multiple metrics for measuring different aspects of model performance gupta et al 1998 bastidas et al 1999 bastidas et al 2006 moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 2009 van werkhoven et al 2009 neelin et al 2010 the mean squared error mse or root mean squared error rmse has been commonly used as a statistical estimator for the hydrological model performance by measuring the discrepancy between the simulated and observed values the nse a normalized mse by the standard deviation sd of observations is one of the popular dimensionless performance criteria as presented by nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 n s e 1 mse sd 2 1 x o x s 2 x o Œº o 2 where x o and x s are the observed and simulated values respectively and Œº o is the mean value of x o as for an alternative way to the previous decomposition analysis murphy 1988 weglarczyk 1998 of the nse gupta et al 2009 mathematically decomposed the nse into the three constituent components to understand the distinctive metrics interrelated in the nse as 2 n s e 2 Œ± r Œ± 2 Œ≤ n 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between x s and x o Œ± œÉ s œÉ o is the relative variability measured by the ratio between standard deviations œÉ s of x s and œÉ o of x o Œ≤ n Œº s Œº o œÉ o is the bias difference between mean values Œº s of x s and Œº o o f x o normalized by œÉ o in a multi objective perspective of the trade offs among the three separate metrics correlation r variability ratio Œ± and bias Œ≤ decomposed from the nse to be optimized gupta et al 2009 aggregated the three components into a new performance criterion the kge by the euclidian distance function to compute a compromise solution from the three dimensional pareto front as 3 k g e 1 r 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 where Œ≤ Œº s Œº o is the bias measured by the ratio between means Œº s of x s and Œº o of x o on the other hand one of the most common and simple methods for evaluating model performance is to analyze scatter plots between the simulated and observed values for the similarity to the 1 1 line by interpreting the slope and offset y intercept parameters of the least squares regression models for both way x s against x o and x o against x s moriasi et al 2007 pi√±eiro et al 2008 in the both regression equations x s m o x o c o and x o m s x s c s the slopes m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± the offsets c o Œº s m o Œº o and c s Œº o m s Œº s and the coefficient of determination r 2 m o m s can be estimated by the least squares approach note that unless both Œ± and Œ≤ are equal to unity the two regression lines are asymmetric where the two values of slopes m o and m s and the two values of offsets c o and c s can be distinguished from each other in the axis orientation for regressing x s and x o gupta et al 2009 demonstrated that the optimal nse can be obtained when Œ± r and Œ≤ n 0 resulting in m o r 2 and m s 1 whereas the optimal kge can be obtained when Œ± 1 and Œ≤ 1 leading to m o r and m s r the interpretation of the slope value m o r 2 in the optimal nse or m o r in the optimal kge can imply that there is a general tendency to underestimate high flows and overestimate low flows in the optimal result with the nse or kge since the value of r is typically smaller than unity gupta et al 2009 on the contrary the interpretation of the other slope value m s 1 in the optimal nse or m s r in the optimal kge can provide another performance evaluation information as such the model performance evaluation may vary depending on the regression results by variables x o and x s placed in each axis and the selection of only one of the two regression parameter sets m o c o or m s c s can change the conclusions of the model performance evaluation pi√±eiro et al 2008 the liu 2020 focused on the standard regression statistics in the single regression line x s m o x o c o with the ideal condition for slope m o r Œ± 1 and offset c o Œº s m o Œº o 0 resulting in Œ≤ 1 and formulated the lme by the euclidian distance from the ideal point in the pareto front of the metric components m o and Œ≤ as 4 lme 1 m o 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 since the value of r is smaller than unity in general the optimal Œ± will be greater than unity so that m o r Œ± is close to unity while the other component Œ≤ is able to unity when optimizing with the lme this optimal condition m o r Œ± 1 and c o Œº s m o Œº o 0 for maximizing the lme will also result in a milder slope m s r Œ± 1 and a positive offset c s Œº o c s Œº s 0 in the other regression line x o m s x s c s which indicates a general tendency to overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows as also expected in the optimal variability measure Œ± 1 for maximizing the lme as such the model performance evaluation can be significantly changed by the interpretation of each of the two regression lines x s and x s thus the interpretation of the slope m o alone in the lme is not sufficient for the model performance evaluation which can be the same issue as the interpretation in accordance with the slope m s alone in the nse furthermore the lme is an underdetermined system with more decision variables Œ± Œ≤ and r than constraints r Œ± 1 and Œ≤ 1 resulting in an infinite number of solutions for the maximum potential value of the lme the optimal ideal condition of m o r Œ± 1 for maximizing the lme when Œ≤ 1 can yield numerous combinations of r and Œ± where large errors in both can compensate each other for r Œ± 1 and even they can be evaluated as being higher in the lme skill scores than when both r and Œ± are very close to their ideal values at unity this implies that higher skill scores of the lme criterion cannot guarantee the model performance with smaller errors thus in addition to regression coefficients slope and offset of the regression line another statistical information is required for comprehensively evaluating the similarity of the regression lines to the 1 1 line in the same vein but instead of the confidence level or intervals based on the probability or cumulative distribution function of the lme suggested by liu 2020 this study has taken into consideration measuring how close the data are to the regression line which is the coefficient of determination r 2 representing the proportion of the total variation explained by the regression model even in a desirable regression model x s with m o 1 and c o 0 i e Œ≤ 1 a smaller value of r 2 indicates that more data points are scattered far from the regression line which means that observations cannot be accurately reproduced by the model note that the value of r 2 is identical in both regression lines x s and x o thus a desirable regression line x s or x o when m o 1 or m s 1 and Œ≤ 1 can perfectly fit the data when r 2 m o m s 1 resulting in m s 1 o r m o 1 which is consequently identical to the optimal condition for both way desirable regression lines x s and x o as discussed earlier 2 2 a rebalanced performance criterion as reviewed above although the lme criterion was presented by reformulating the three metric components of the nse or kge to improve an underestimation of flow variability the lme based on a single regression line x s is likely to produce overfitting results where the problematic interplay between r and Œ± measures tends to overestimate flow variability on the lme optimization for a comprehensive performance criterion based on the standard regression statistics the optimal condition of the least squares regression is required for both desirable regression lines such as m o 1 c o 0 i e Œ≤ 1 for x s and m s 1 c s 0 i e Œ≤ 1 for x o or the optimal condition of m o 1 Œ≤ 1 for a desirable regression model x s requires another condition of m s 1 for r 2 m o m s 1 to have more data closer to the regression line x s such optimal condition is identical to the other regression line x o as a result therefore this study has proposed a new rebalanced performance criterion based on the least squares coefficients combined from both regression lines the least squares combined efficiency or lee and choi efficiency lce as 5 l c e 1 m o 1 2 m s 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 taking the partial derivatives of the lce with respect to r Œ± and Œ≤ and then setting them equal to zero indicates that the lce can be potentially maximized when all the three metric components r Œ± and Œ≤ are equal to unity resulting in m o 1 and m s 1 as 6 l c e r Œ± r Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 Œ± 2 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 2 0 l c e Œ± r r Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 Œ± 2 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 2 0 l c e Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 r Œ± 1 2 r Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 1 2 0 fig 1 illustrates the theoretical relationships of the nse kge lme and lce with changes in r 0 5 to 1 0 and Œ± 0 5 to 1 5 while assuming Œ≤ n 0 and Œ≤ 1 the maximum nse occurs when Œ± is equal to a given r smaller than unity in general gupta et al 2009 at a given r the optimal Œ± is the ideal value of unity for maximizing the kge gupta et al 2009 whereas the optimal Œ± for maximizing the lme are on the curve line for r Œ± 1 liu 2020 this indicates a problematic underdetermined system with numerous combinations between r and Œ± for r Œ± 1 resulting in the maximum potential lme score even when neither r nor Œ± is the ideal value of unity the optimal lme is likely to be achieved by the optimal Œ± overestimation much larger than unity when r is much smaller than unity on the other hand the maximum lce occurs when Œ± 1 for a given r as in the case with the kge fig 1 also shows the difference between kge and lce in that the identical skill scores of the kge are symmetrical across the vertical line of Œ± 1 whereas those of the lce are asymmetric and biased expanding towards larger Œ± values Œ± 1 due to the inverse relationship between the reciprocal functions of Œ± and 1 Œ± in the lce formulation see eq 5 also this means that the optimal result with the lce is more likely to be achieved when Œ± 1 rather than when Œ± 1 of course at the value of Œ± close to unity unless Œ± is able to achieve the ideal value at unity as usually in hydrological simulations thus the proposed lce optimization can offer the possibility to improve the variability in the simulated runoff which can overcome a tendency of underestimation in optimization on the nse or kge as well as a tendency of overestimation in optimization on the lme 2 3 exemplary comparison of performance criteria as discussed above theoretical behavior relationships of the nse kge lme and lce show that a peculiar interplay between r and Œ± for each performance criterion can play a significant role in the hydrological model calibration or identification however the theoretical considerations presented above may be not always feasible in hydrological modeling that might be impossible to provide all combinations of the metric component measures in simulation results thus to examine the model performance evaluation based on the skill scores of each performance criterion table 1 and fig 2 illustrate a comparative example of the six sample simulation cases against the observed monthly runoff time series for two years the performance evaluation results for the six sample simulation cases are obtained by the nse kge lme and lce respectively as shown in table 1 while assuming that Œ≤ n 0 and Œ≤ 1 for the simplicity the six sample simulation cases exhibit illustrative combinations of Œ± and r measures such as Œ± 1 r Œ± for sim1 Œ± 1 r Œ± for sim2 Œ± 1 r Œ± for sim3 Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 for sim4 and Œ± 1 r Œ± 1 for sim5 and sim6 each simulation case number 1 6 is hereinafter referred to by a subscript for variables to be described in the model skill scores based on the nse n s e 1 0 727 shows the highest score when Œ± r Œ± 1 0 853 and r 1 0 853 with the smallest Œ± value among the six simulation cases which demonstrates that the nse optimization is likely to underestimate flow variability as a result in the model performance evaluation by the kge k g e 3 0 853 when Œ± 1 Œ± 3 1 000 and r 3 0 853 is the highest score which indicates that the kge can somewhat improve flow variability underestimated in the nse i g when Œ± 1 0 853 Œ± 3 1 000 k g e 1 0 792 k g e 3 0 853 whereas n s e 1 0 727 n s e 3 0 707 but there is still a tendency towards underestimation of flow variability with the kge i g when Œ± 2 0 935 Œ± 4 1 068 k g e 2 0 839 k g e 4 0 838 in the lme optimization l m e 5 1 000 when r Œ± 1 Œ± 5 1 173 and r 5 0 853 is the maximum potential score along with l m e 6 1 000 when r Œ± 1 albeit by inferior Œ± and r Œ± 6 1 253 and r 6 0 798 as such the maximum potential lme 1 000 occurs at larger errors in both Œ± and r of sim5 and sim6 compared with the other four simulation cases moreover both sim5 and sim6 with the maximum lme score will be selected as the optimal results even if there exists an outstanding case where both Œ± and r are almost equal to their ideal values i g lme 0 998 at Œ± 0 999 and r 0 999 this implies that higher lme skill scores cannot correspond to smaller errors in the simulation results which may potentially lead to significant ambiguity in the comparative model evaluation on the contrary in the skill scores based on the lce criterion sim5 and sim6 are evaluated as l c e 5 0 727 and l c e 6 0 637 lower than the other four cases as in the results with the nse and kge in addition the lce optimization can improve flow variability still underestimated in the kge optimization i g when Œ± 2 0 935 Œ± 4 1 068 l c e 2 0 779 l c e 4 0 780 whereas k g e 2 0 839 k g e 4 0 838 this is due to the nature of the lce criterion where the model skill scores are asymmetric with respect to the Œ± 1 possibly resulting in higher lce scores when Œ± 1 i g sim4 than when Œ± 1 i g sim2 of course the optimal lce occurs when there is the ideal case for the variability Œ± 1 at a given r measure such as in sim3 l c e 3 0 793 at Œ± 3 1 000 and r 3 0 853 3 case study 3 1 study watershed to investigate and demonstrate the implications of the proposed lce criterion for the performance evaluation of hydrological models this study has chosen the four study watersheds in the republic of korea for the colm streamflow simulations fig 3 and table 2 denote the four hydrologic stream gauge stations of each dam reservoir inflow site such as soyang river dam sd chungju dam cd daecheong dam dd and nam river dam nd which were selected for study sites by taking into account the minimal effect of both the flow regulation of river facilities in the upstream and the environmental control of tidal fluctuations in the estuary as denoted in table 2 the upstream areas of the four study watersheds range from 3 151 to 6 771 km2 representing the four largest dam upstream watersheds in the republic of korea for both calibration and validation of weekly streamflow simulations against observations at these four stream gauge stations the persistent long term observations of the natural unregulated flow were achieved from the dam reservoir inflow data of the water resources management information system wamis website http www wamis go kr wkd mn dammain aspx managed by the ministry of environment in these study watersheds affected by east asian monsoon climate the concentrated rainfall occurs during the summer period from june to september according to past meteorological data from 2000 to 2019 the average summer precipitation 897 7 1 007 5 mm is 68 73 of the average annual precipitation 1 278 8 1 471 4 mm over the four study watersheds as shown in table 2 3 2 model description the colm has been developed to predict both water and energy interactions between the land and the atmosphere as a lsm of the climate weather research and forecasting cwrf model liang et al 2012 the colm has taken the following major updates to improve the terrestrial hydrologic schemes focusing on runoff predictions a volume averaged soil moisture transport parameterization choi et al 2007 a surface subsurface interaction parameterization choi and liang 2010 and a conjunctive surface subsurface flow scheme choi et al 2013 in addition another version of the colm has recently presented by incorporating a topographically controlled lateral flow scheme into the baseline soil moisture transport scheme lee and choi 2017 it can be a simplified version of the conjunctive surface subsurface flow scheme choi et al 2013 for the streamflow simulations in the sites where the soil moisture data are insufficient to implement a volume averaged soil moisture transport scheme a more detailed description of the colm streamflow simulations is presented in lee and choi 2017 the performance of streamflow simulations from the colm incorporating the lateral flow scheme at a model grid based mesoscale has been evaluated against the observed streamflow time series for the nakdong river watershed in the republic of korea lee and choi 2017 lee and choi 2021 fig 4 illustrates the key components of terrestrial hydrologic processes for the streamflow generation in the colm and detailed parameterizations for the surface and subsurface runoff components are given by eqs a 1 a 8 in appendix the colm can generate the model grid based streamflow runoff r str by combining a routed surface flow with an unrouted subsurface flow baseflow at the target grid point as 7 r str q s n f a r sb where q s is the surface flow discharge by a flow routing a is a grid cell area n f is the flow accumulation number including the target grid at the target grid point and r sb is the averaged subsurface runoff for the total grid cells located upstream of the target grid point see appendix for detailed parameterizations of q s and r sb the variation of r str in time is used for comparison with streamflow discharge observations per unit area 3 3 model setup the colm requires the realistic sbcs for the two categories of vegetation and terrain features constructed from the high quality and finer data the vegetative sbcs consist of land cover category albedo fractional vegetation cover and monthly leaf area index the terrain sbcs consist of surface elevation soil sand clay fraction profiles at each soil layer bedrock depth and flow direction accumulation information table 3 summarizes characteristics of the representative sbcs constructed for the four study watersheds at the 30 km grids following lee and choi 2017 further detailed information on the sbcs for raw data and construction processes can be found in lee and choi 2017 to drive standalone simulations of the colm this study has constructed the meteorological forcing data from the meteorological point data directly measured at the automated synoptic observing system asos in the 77 meteorological stations managed by the korea meteorological administration kma as shown in fig 3 in the asos meteorological data network https data kma go kr cmmn main do widely used for hydrological modeling and climate change analysis in the republic of

radiation mj m2 are available for the past thirty years from 1990 to 2019 for the grid based meteorological forcing data in the colm the asos point data were spatially interpolated by the inverse distance weight idw method onto the 30 km computational domain covering the four study watersheds long term offline simulations from the colm were conducted for the past thirty years from january 1990 to december 2019 to minimize the impact of uncertainty in the initial conditions on the colm predictability the simulation results for the first ten years during 1990 1999 were excluded from the simulation performance analysis it is desirable to divide the available record equally into the model calibration and the model validation kleme≈° 1986 hence each ten year simulation results were used for the calibration during 2000 2009 and for the validation during 2010 2019 against the weekly streamflow times series over the four study watersheds sd cd dd and nd in the republic of korea 4 results in this study the colm calibration against weekly streamflow time series at the four study watersheds focused on a set of the two parameters the hydraulic conductivity decay factor ∆í and the hydraulic conductivity anisotropic ratio Œ∂ see also appendix known as the key parameters affecting on the colm streamflow simulations in the previous studies chen and kumar 2001 kumar 2004 choi and liang 2010 choi et al 2013 lee and choi 2017 lee and choi 2021 an ensemble experiments of the colm simulations were generated for the calibration period from january 2000 to december 2009 by changing values of the calibration parameters within the feasible ranges from 2 to 9 for the decay factor ∆í and from 10 to 10 000 for the anisotropic ratio Œ∂ after the calibration period analysis determined the optimal parameter ∆í and Œ∂ values to maximize each performance criterion the nse kge lme and lce respectively for the four study watersheds they were used to simulate weekly streamflow time series during the independent validation period from january 2010 to december 2019 respectively for the four study watersheds under each performance criterion the weekly streamflow discharge observations and watershed drainage areas were obtained from the wamis website for the four study watersheds the observed and simulated streamflow values were compared by using the specific runoff streamflow per unit area because of the difference between the real watershed area and the model grid based watershed area table 4 and fig 5 present the three metric component measures of the variability Œ± the bias Œ≤ and the correlation r along with the two slope m o and m s values of both regression lines x s and x o respectively for the optimal cases obtained by each performance criterion nse kge lme and lce during the calibration and validation periods over the four study watersheds sd cd dd and nd in the republic of korea in general the Œ± values that can reflect each criterion s own nature are substantially different in the four performance criteria which can also affect the Œ≤ measures to a certain extent whereas the r values change little by the choice of the four methods the Œ± values are smaller in the nse with the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r and larger in the lme with the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r 1 than in each other three performance criteria meanwhile the Œ± values are closer to unity in the kge and lce but the lce with the theoretically optimal condition of r Œ± 1 while r Œ± 1 will tend to increase Œ± values to be larger than unity which is not the case in the kge with the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± 1 for the four study watersheds as a result the m o values are smaller while the m s values are larger in the nse and the m o values increase while the m s values decrease as the optimal Œ± values increase with the performance criteria in the order of the nse kge lce and lme overall the model performance results are statistically more desirable for the calibration period and statistically consistent for the validation period in all of the four performance criteria although the performance measures are somewhat inferior when moving from the calibration to validation periods as shown in table 4 and fig 5 fig 6 shows the relationship between r and Œ± along with the relationship between m o and m s in the optimal cases obtained by the choice of the four performance criteria for both calibration and validation periods over the four study watersheds the nse criterion tends to yield the optimal cases where Œ± values are slightly bigger than r values as shown in fig 6 a consequently the values of m o are relatively smaller while the values of m s are substantially large in the nse optimization as shown in fig 6 b in the kge optimization where the Œ± values are slightly smaller than the ideal value at unity as shown in fig 6 a the both m o and m s values are similar to each other and the data points in the scatter plot are slightly below the 1 1 line m s values are slightly larger than m o values as shown in fig 6 b when optimizing with the lme criterion the Œ± values are substantially larger than the ideal value at unity see fig 6 a to achieve m o values close to unity but m s values are much smaller than unity see fig 6 b as a result as shown in fig 6 b the proposed lce criterion will make both m o and m s values together closer to unity in contrast to the nse or lme results and also shows that the data points in the scatter plot are slightly above the 1 1 line m o values are slightly larger than m s values in contrast to the kge results accordingly the lce tends to have the optimal Œ± values slightly larger than unity but not as large as those obtained by the lme optimization as shown in fig 6 a figs 6 and 7 also illustrate the scatter plots for relationships between weekly streamflow observations and simulations optimized by the four performance criteria for depicting simulations against observations during the calibration period in fig 7 a and the validation period in fig 8 a and for depicting observations against simulations during the calibration period in fig 7 b and the validation period in fig 8 b respectively over the four study watersheds the trends of the optimal runoff simulations by the nse are smoother than those by the other three performance criteria in the scatter plots for simulations against observations as shown in fig 7 a and fig 8 a whereas those by the lme are smoother than those by the other three performance criteria in the scatter plots for observations against simulations as shown in fig 7 b and fig 8 b in terms of the variation of data sets the lme results tend to be the highest and the nse results tend to be the lowest for both calibration see fig 7 and validation see fig 8 periods in the four study watersheds as such the nse tends to underestimate high flows and overestimate low flows whereas the lme tends to overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows on the other hand the optimal runoff results by the kge and lce tend to lie between the nse and lme data sets in all the scatter plots for simulations against observations fig 7 a and fig 8 a and for observations against simulations fig 7 b and fig 8 b compared with the kge results the peak flows optimized by the lce tend to be slightly higher in the fig 7 a and fig 8 a and tend to be slightly to the right side in fig 7 b and fig 8 b this shows the lce will further improve the still underestimated high flows in the kge optimization figs 7 and 8 illustrate that the scatter points of the lce results are closer to the 1 1 line with smaller variations than the other results 5 discussion 5 1 model performance by performance criteria for the use in design flow estimates liu 2020 proposed the lme by reformulating the three distinctive components correlation variability and bias measures of the nse or kge to improve the model performance associated with flow variability in the runoff simulations when optimizing on the nse or kge however there can be potential problems in the model calibration or identification with the lme based on the one way regression line x s for regressing the simulated against observed values although the standard regression statistics for measuring the linear relationship between simulations and observations is one of the most common techniques for evaluating the hydrological model performance moriasi et al 2007 the two regression lines x s and x o can have significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation pi√±eiro et al 2008 thus the lme optimization for a desirable regression line x s alone could not reflect the behavior of the other regression line x o since the one way regression line can only guarantee the goodness of fit to the expected values of simulations or observations rather than their individual values complementary measures to the lme criterion are required for the use in diagnostic evaluations to support hydrological model calibration or identification choi 2021 this study first investigated peculiar features and appropriateness of the lme as an alternative performance criterion to the nse or kge and diagnosed problematic issues associated with an optimization on the lme in terms of the two slopes in both regression lines x s and x o such as m o r Œ± for regressing simulations against observations and m s r Œ± for regressing observations against simulations the optimal slope values are m o r 2 and m s 1 for maximizing the nse and m o r and m s r for maximizing the kge respectively the interpretation of the slope values of m o 1 due to r 1 in general in the nse and kge can indicate that there is the systematical tendency for the mean of high flows to be underestimated and the mean of low flows to be overestimated when optimizing with the nse or kge thus as a way to improve such underestimation in flow variability on the nse or kge optimization the lme criterion incorporates the optimal condition of m o r Œ± 1 which will lead to the optimal value of Œ± 1 to compensate for r 1 regardless of the optimal ideal condition for each component however this optimal condition of m o will result in the other slope value of m s r Œ± 1 which indicates that the mean of high flows will tend to be overestimated and the mean of low flows will tend to be underestimated as can be also found in the optimal condition of Œ± 1 although the lme criterion was proposed for the design flow estimates from hydrological frequency analysis on model simulation results with the improved flow variability the lme optimal results will provide significantly larger amounts of designed floods and smaller amounts of designed low flows which is also less reliable for the water related hazard and risk management therefore the comprehensive interpretation of both slopes m o and m s along with the variability Œ± measure is required for the model performance evaluation especially associated with the extreme flows peak and or low flows of interest moreover the lme is an underdetermined system where the number of constraints r Œ± 1 and Œ≤ 1 is fewer than the number of decision variables Œ± Œ≤ and r as shown in theoretical and exemplary considerations earlier the interplay between r and Œ± for the optimal condition of m o r Œ± 1 in the lme can have numerous optimal solutions that can potentially maximize the lme score even when both r and Œ± have large errors contradictorily such cases will be treated as superior to when both r and Œ± are closer to unity in the model calibration results with the lme in general the model calibration with the performance criteria should select the optimal model parameters consistently by the optimal skill score of the performance criteria designed towards the minimum or none error achieved in the only one ideal case during a model calibration or evaluation process choi 2021 thus the lme optimization in which higher scores of the lme based on error metrics cannot reflect smaller simulation errors should be further reviewed by another visual or statistical goodness of fit measure choi 2021 these limitations lead to the conclusion that the lme is not sufficient to evaluate the overall model performance in hydrological modeling the evaluation of a regression line against the 1 1 line can only measure the proximity of the mean or expected values of simulations or observations to the 1 1 line rather than their individual agreement hence only one aspect of the two regression slopes especially when they are distinguished can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations in the model performance evaluation as in the interpretation of m s 1 alone instead of m o 1 when optimizing with the nse the optimal slope condition of m o 1 alone instead of m s 1 in the lme cannot accurately reflect the model performance therefore in the standard regression statistics for measuring the linear relationship between model and data it is desirable that both slope m o and m s values approach one with a smaller difference between them for a better goodness of fit result both m o and m s values can be equal to one only when the model can provide a perfect match to data in contrast the significant difference between m o and m s values in the nse or lme optimization can lead to the misinterpretation of model performance as well as the strong tendency towards severe underestimation or overestimation in the simulations again the problematic interplay between r and Œ± for m o alone in the lme criterion is more likely to overestimate high flows and or underestimate low flows in the optimal runoff simulation faced with poor performance due to overfitting when optimizing with the lme as such the lme criterion has weaknesses of an underdetermined system that can potentially induce the vagueness in comparative assessments for alternative model performance as well as an overestimation system that can substantially reduce the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological modeling in order to complement the limitations of the lme criterion this study has proposed the lce criterion based on the least squares statistics combined from both way regression lines for regressing the simulated against observed values and regressing the observed against simulated values in the lce criterion for a balanced evaluation on the similarity of the two regression lines to the 1 1 line the optimal condition of the two slopes m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± will achieve their ideal values at unity which can happen only when r 1 and Œ± 1 unlike in the lme unless the optimal value of Œ± can exactly achieve the ideal value of unity the optimal lce score is more like to occur when Œ± 1 due to the role of a reciprocal relationship between Œ± and 1 Œ± in the lce criterion this will potentially improve the tendency towards underestimation of flow variability in the model calibrations with the nse or kge in addition the variability Œ± incorporated with the two metric components m o and m s in the lce formulation can play a significant role in the optimization on the lce whereas the impact of the variability Œ± along with the bias Œ≤ tends to be limited on the kge results that tend to be dominated by the correlation r as shown in gupta et al 2009 theoretical considerations for the four performance criteria nse kge lme and lce were reviewed with several example cases representing typical simulation characteristics since all theoretically optimal conditions for the performance criteria are not always feasible in hydrological modeling experiments and then these theoretical and comparative analysis results were all supported by long term streamflow time series from the colm simulations in the case study although the hydrological models might be impossible to produce all modeling experiment data within the theoretical criteria space due to constraints on model structure parameter ranges and available data gupta et al 2009 overall our case study provided adequate experiments to illustrate the advantages and limitations of each performance criterion under study the colm streamflow results optimized with the lce criterion showed relatively good measures for the three metric components Œ± Œ≤ and r over the four study watersheds in general the case study demonstrated that there is a strong tendency for the optimal Œ± to be slightly larger than unity due to the role of Œ± associated with m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± in the lce while this is not the case with the kge in our experiments Œ± can also of course be larger than unity in the kge optimization the optimal r and Œ± values will increase in the lce so that the m o and m s values can approach their ideal values while the Œ≤ errors tend to slightly increase which is less likely to be the optimal case for the kge due to the albeit little increased Œ≤ errors the case study can also help to understand the trade offs between the correlation r the variability Œ± and the bias Œ≤ measures in each performance criterion the nse kge lme and lce the nse criterion produced the optimal Œ± values less than unity and also smaller than the kge results but they tend to be somewhat larger than the optimal correlation r values unlike the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r the lme produced the optimal Œ± values greater than unity and also larger than the lce results but they can be somewhat insufficient smaller to achieve the theoretically optimal condition of Œ± r 1 it is implied that such optimal Œ± results obtained with the nse or lme can be effected and limited by the bias Œ≤ measures assumed to be zero for the simplicity in theoretical and exemplary considerations since the simulation results with much larger or smaller values of Œ± will at the same time have a tendency towards larger Œ≤ errors resulting in lower skill scores that are less likely to be the optimal results in the nse or lme optimization in the same context the optimal Œ≤ results tend to be superior in the kge and lce where the optimal Œ± values can be closer to the ideal value at unity compared with in the nse and lme where the optimal Œ± values are much smaller in the nse or larger in the lme than unity compared with the substantial changes in the optimal values of Œ± and Œ≤ that can be close to their ideal values by the choice of the performance criteria all the four criteria under study have the similar optimal values of the correlation r that cannot reach its ideal value at unity in general there is only a small difference in the r values for each performance criterion in that the kge and lce tend to have the optimal r values slightly smaller than those in the nse and they can decrease more by much larger optimal Œ± values for Œ± r 1 in the lme the four performance criteria also showed different behaviors on the slope values m o r Œ± and m s r Œ± for the two regression lines of the colm streamflow simulations since the r values are typically smaller than unity m o m s 1 due to Œ± 1 on the nse optimization whereas m o 1 m s due to Œ± 1 on the lme optimization unlike the nse and lme optimization results where the m o and m s values are distinguished the differences between m o and m s values tend to decrease in the kge and lce where the optimal Œ± values can be closer to unity than in the nse and lme in streamflow simulations with r 1 m o values will increase and m s values will decrease as Œ± values increase thus there is a tendency for m o values to be slightly larger than m s values in the lce where the optimal Œ± values tend to be slightly larger than unity but this tendency is not noticeable or vice versa m s values are slightly larger than m o in the kge the case study showed that the lce optimal results can be obtained when the two slope m o and m s values are considerably larger and similar to each other for the both desirable regression lines 5 2 model parameters by performance criteria fig 9 shows the statistical properties of the streamflow hydrographs measured by Œ± Œ≤ and r according to the change in values of the calibration parameter sets within the feasible ranges ∆í 2 9 and Œ∂ 10 10 000 over the four study watersheds when the parameter ∆í value is less than around 6 an increase in the parameter Œ∂ has the effect of increasing the Œ± and Œ≤ measures under the other conditions of the parameter ∆í greater than around 6 the Œ± and Œ≤ values initially increase and then decrease as the parameter Œ∂ increases it is due to a consequence of complex interaction of the two parameters ∆í and Œ∂ in the surface and subsurface flow modeling structure of the colm see appendix for details in general increasing the parameter Œ∂ results in more baseflow and increasing the parameter ∆í results in higher peak flows but limited for relatively smaller Œ∂ values which has the overall effect of increasing the values of both Œ± and Œ≤ measures except when both parameters ∆í and Œ∂ are relatively larger on the contrary when the parameter ∆í value is larger than around 6 and also the parameter Œ∂ value is larger than around 1 500 the surface flow and peak flows significantly decreases albeit the baseflow still increases as the parameter Œ∂ increases which has the overall effect of decreasing the values of both Œ± and Œ≤ measures as the parameter ∆í exerts a strong control on the surface and subsurface runoff partitioning by interacting in complex with other factors including the parameter Œ∂ the parameter ∆í acts as a double sided factor that can increase or decrease the surface runoff see eq a 2 along with eqs a 3 and a 4 as such the combination of the two parameters ∆í and Œ∂ has an intricate effect on the streamflow generation in the colm as denoted in table 4 the optimal values of the two calibration parameters ∆í and Œ∂ do not change significantly compared to the feasible parameter ranges across the three performance criteria the nse kge and lce except for the lme with much larger ∆í and much smaller Œ∂ values over the four study watersheds although there are somewhat more variations among the three optimal parameter sets in the watershed nd and dd when moving from the nse to the kge and lce the parameter ∆í slightly increases and the parameter Œ∂ slightly decreases which can improve the underestimated high flows with the nse in all the four study watersheds such change in the parameter ∆í and Œ∂ values are even more pronounced particularly for the watershed dd moreover the parameter ∆í values become much larger and the parameter Œ∂ values become much smaller in the lme optimization which has the effect of higher peaks in the surface flow and quicker recession in the baseflow of the model streamflow this is due to that fact that the lme optimization seeks to achieve a much higher value than the ideal value of unity of the Œ± measure in addition from the best calibration results with the lce we can infer the relationship between the optimal values of the parameter set ∆í and Œ∂ and the features of watersheds vegetation topography soil texture etc as denoted in table 3 a relatively smaller ∆í value is calibrated to be identical for the three study watersheds sd cd and nd ∆í 3 where the land cover types are predominantly mixed forest and thus may have relatively less macropore effect on the surface in these three watersheds a relatively smaller Œ∂ value is calibrated for the watershed nd Œ∂ 1 200 in a milder slope terrain with a relatively deeper bedrock depth i e composite effects of very slow lateral subsurface flow and a decline tendency of the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth than the watersheds sd Œ∂ 3 400 and cd Œ∂ 3 300 for the optimal parameter values in the watershed dd ∆í 5 and Œ∂ 900 it can be inferred that a relatively larger ∆í value is mainly influenced by relatively more macropore effect in the savanna region with a relatively gentle terrain slope and a relatively smaller Œ∂ value is mainly influenced by a relatively deeper bedrock depth along with more macropore effect i e a decrease in Œ∂ can be compensated by an increase in ∆í as such it was found that the optimal parameter set obtained with the lce calibration can more realistically reflect the watershed characteristics the calibration parameters with different performance criteria can also affect the water budget results for the terrestrial components in a watershed fig 10 compares the 20 yr averaged climatology of monthly surface runoff subsurface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration and recharge results from the colm respectively calibrated with the nse kge lme and lce for the four study watersheds as illustrated in fig 10 a and d relatively larger ∆í and smaller Œ∂ values with the lme than the other three calibration cases have the overall effect of more surface runoff leading to higher peak flows and less infiltration particularly in j j a over the four study watersheds when moving from the nse to the kge and lce the baseflow generation is enhanced by an increase in ∆í or Œ∂ value which shows a decrease in the infiltration and recharge rate as a result in particular the baseflow further enhanced with the lce can improve streamflow variability in the rainy season j j a compared to the nse and kge optimizations as shown in fig 10 b the baseflow results by a certain amount of Œ∂ with the lme are comparable to those with the kge and lce in the watersheds sd and cd whereas relatively less baseflow is generated by much smaller Œ∂ values with the lme in the watersheds dd and nd note that the baseflow contribution to the streamflow is relatively smaller in the watersheds dd and nd where the watershed terrain slope is relatively gentle see also table 3 overall the infiltration and recharge rate is relatively higher on the nse optimization that generates less surface or subsurface runoff compared to the other calibration cases on the other hand as denoted in fig 10 c there is no significant change in the evapotranspiration results across all the four performance criteria as the parameters ∆í and Œ∂ do not directly affect the evapotranspiration response which is more largely influenced by watershed characteristics and climatic factors vegetation cover solar radiation precipitation humidity wind etc 5 3 implications and future research for performance criteria therefore the use of lce criterion for model calibration will provide a rebalanced performance in trade offs between correlation variability and bias measures and the streamflow simulation results on the lce optimization will further improve a tendency towards underestimation of flow variability when taking advantages of the kge the weekly streamflow simulations were also evaluated for the validation period 2010 2019 independent to the calibration period 2000 2009 although the individual performance components and the performance criteria statistically tend to somewhat deteriorate in the four study watersheds for the validation period the behavior trends in model performance by the choice of performance criteria persisted during the validation period in general the evaluation results for hydrological model performance criteria in this study are required for further analysis on the reliability of the model parameter values along with the sensitivity of input data and the uncertainty in the computed statistics associated with differences between theory or population and sampling cases 6 conclusions this study has proposed a rebalanced performance criterion the lce based on the least squares statistics from the both regression lines for regressing simulations against observations and regressing observations against simulations the lce was formulated by the euclidian distance from the ideal point of the least squares regression components estimated by the previous metric components correlation variability and bias in the nse or kge this study diagnosed the systematic problems inherent in optimization on the lme criterion prone to overfitting with excessive flow variation and then demonstrated the advantages of the lce proposed for a rebalanced trade off between the performance metric components in the streamflow simulation results as a complementary approach to the limitations associated with the other performance criteria nse kge and lme the lce optimization with better variability and correlation measures at the expense of a slightly larger bias error not only can prevent underdetermined solutions that tend to overestimate flow variability on the lme optimization but also can improve a tendency towards underestimation of flow variability with taking advantages of the kge optimization thus the use of lce criterion for model evaluation or calibration can potentially improve the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological frequency analysis on model simulation results as well as the consistency in comparative assessments for alternative model performance it is also necessary to understand the nature of performance criteria that have their own advantages and limitations in the model performance evaluation or identification for model applications through the theoretical analysis and case study on the four performance criteria the nse kge lme and lce this study can present the influence of the peculiar trade offs between individual metric measures for each performance criterion on the diagnostic model evaluation or model calibration process of hydrological modeling however since it is not possible for our experiments to generate and investigate all possible optimization cases because the calibration results reflect the heterogeneity of modelling processes parameter selections basin characteristics climatic conditions sample sizes temporal data scales and spatial model resolutions etc the proposed lce criterion needs to be tested and evaluated systematically for more simulation

et al 2019b tan et al 2019a near real time nrt products comprise the er and lr with the latency of 4 h and 14 h the post real time fr has a latency of 3 5 months the nrt products serve for real time applications such as natural hazards monitoring and forecasting the fr is a research level product that aims at providing high accuracy huffman et al 2019b the main differences between the three products include but not limited to that 1 lr and fr incorporate more pmw estimates than er and both lr and fr adopt forward and backward morphing while er only morphs forward 2 fr corrects the systematic bias with the monthly global prediction climatology center gpcc gauge based product and 3 er and lr derive the motion vectors from goddard earth observing system forward processing geos fp while fr uses modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 numerical models tan et al 2019b more detailed descriptions of the algorithmic differences are summarized by huffman et al 2019b in this study three runs i e er lr and fr of the latest imerg version 06b data and the embedded pmw and ir sensors are investigated over the conterminous us conus from 2015 to 06 01 to 2019 06 30 imerg has a 0 1 degree spatial resolution and half hourly time interval covering majority of the globe huffman et al 2019b half hourly precipitation estimates are averaged to hourly to match the reference data resolution the six pmw gpm sensors used to generate imerg data are summarized in table 1 three of them are imagers i e amsr2 gmi and ssmis which are prioritized over sounders in imerg as they are considered more accurate in precipitation estimation to be noted ssmis has both imager and sounder sensors a detailed description of each sensor can be found in the latest imerg technical documentation huffman et al 2019b at a given timestep the algorithm uses the pmw estimates closest to the target analysis time and propagate to target time using the motion vector derived from the total precipitable water vapor during which imagers are prioritized over sounders if available if the gap between target time and observation time is longer than 30 min yet shorter than 90 min the precipitation field is merged by interpolated pmw estimates and weighted ir estimates according to the observational correlations once the gap exceeds 90 min the ir based estimates are largely weighted because the ir has a higher correlation than propagated pmw data a long propagated pmw still contributes to a small weight specifically the hqprecipsource data field categorizes the source of precipitation pmw estimates at a given timeframe and grid similarly the inclusion of ir estimates can be identified in the irkalmanfilterweight data field in which 100 0 means ir only morph only or pmw overpass and every percentage in between indicates ir morph combined estimates 2 2 ncep stage iv ground based radar data are increasingly used to investigate extreme precipitation lengfeld et al 2020 the national centers for environmental predictions ncep stage iv precipitation product herein referred to as stage iv is an operational radar gauge merged quantitative precipitation estimation qpe based on the next generation weather radar nexrad precipitation processing system pps at the national water service nws river forecast center rfc seo and breidenbach 2002 stage iv produces multi scale estimates i e hourly 6 hourly and 24 hourly and undergoes rigorous quality control qc measures including manual inspections at each rfc in this study we use the hourly precipitation field which is close to imerg temporal resolution to match up with imerg spatially the 4 km stage iv data are upscaled using the nearest neighbors the rationale behind using the nearest neighbors is to preserve local extreme rates that may be smoothed when averaging to imerg resolution however it is noteworthy that this possibly leads to the underestimation of imerg the availability of the stage iv is not homogenous across conus samples in the western u s are generally under 60 available due to the belated data delivery in the california nevada rfc and northwest rfc supplementary fig 1 therefore data in these regions are excluded from this study 2 3 definitions of extreme precipitation amongst various definitions for extreme events percentile event and frequency based approaches are the most popular ways the percentile based approach rests on the foundation of precipitation distribution at each grid cell where the 95th 99th and 99 9th percentile values from the product are chosen in this study to represent extreme rates this approach does not rely on time series and the comparison between estimates and references may not be coincident meanwhile the percentile based approach weighs more on rainfall events due to its higher rates whereas it is likely to miss solid precipitation events i e snow storm which are relatively less intense noh et al 2009 wen et al 2016 the event based approach addresses complementary aspects of extremes and relies on temporal information and precipitation type simultaneously in this study recorded event data are obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information storm events database https www ncdc noaa gov stormevents reports in this database entail three criteria a having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life injuries damages and disruption to commerce b rare unusual weather phenomena and c significant meteorological events overall a total of 48 event types have been recorded since 1950 to date yet only heavy rain snow and hail events are considered in this study from 2015 to 2019 the event counts for rainfall snow and hail are 6065 5917 and 37212 respectively in this work the data fields spatial extent impacted area and event period start date and end date are taken to extract precipitation rates from both stage iv and imerg to account for errors in reported event location we filter out pixels with extracted precipitation depth 1 mm during each event another extreme definition i e frequency based from a hydrologic application perspective is dependent upon the intensity duration and frequency hosking and wallis 1997 in addition to intensity and duration frequency i e period emphasizes the severity of the event in historical records intensity duration frequency idf curve is a pragmatic way to represent the relation among rainfall intensity duration and frequency this study retrieves the noaa atlas 14 gridded product which is derived by 100 year long nation wide gauge stations and fitted with an assumed extreme value distribution perica et al 2013 the frequencies at 0 5 i e once every two years 0 2 0 1 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 are collected in conjunction with four durations i e 3 6 12 and 24 h sufficient samples are reached because grid cells are aggregated over conus to perform the statistical analysis the noaa atlas 14 idf curves are utilized from the frequency perspective the statistical analysis for enumerations between return period and duration is conducted as follows first each grid cell value from the raw data applies an areal reduction factor miller et al 1973 to match the same spatial resolution as imerg second a continuous time window with respect to duration at each grid cell and spatial extent are determined when stage iv exceeds certain thresholds lastly the statistics for a certain return period and duration are computed within that time window and over a spatial domain 2 4 statistical metrics a suite of statistical metrics is summarized in table 2 among which the mean error me and bias evaluate the general underestimation overestimation the root mean squared error rmse evaluates the errors magnitudes the normalized mean error nme and normalized mean absolute error nmae quantify the systematic and random error respectively normalized by the mean rain rate correlation coefficient cc investigates the spatial temporal correspondence of estimates and references the cc values can be computed over a spatial domain without time signature cc spat or over a time period related to an event cc event the cc spat investigates the systematic differences of two fields with linear correlation while the cc event focuses on temporal correlation samples with p value 0 05 confidence level 95 are excluded during our analysis to underline statistical significance collectively these event metrics are calculated for a given time period such as recorded in storm report and a spatial domain storm range where rainfall values of estimates and observations are aggregated first and then compute respective statistical scores in addition to quantitative assessments we evaluate the performance of extreme precipitation detection with the number of hits false alarms and misses the number of hits is measured by counting the times both stage iv and imerg exceeding a threshold while the number of false alarms misses is determined by imerg stage iv detecting an extreme event but stage iv imerg does not a composite index critical success index csi jointly consider hits false alarms and misses and thus gives a broad assessment 3 results 3 1 merged products 3 1 1 percentile based extremes figure 1 depicts the percentile based extreme precipitation rates over the conus from stage iv and the corresponding differences displayed by three imerg runs for er lr and fr clearly the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation is on par with us annual precipitation climatology high end stage iv values rate 10 mm hr 1 concentrate on the coastlines of the gulf of mexico and atlantic east coast where the 99 9th percentile values are up to 50 mm hr 1 presumably owing to frequently endured extra tropical storms and hurricanes li et al 2021b inland areas such as the high plains also have discernable hotspots likely associated with local convective storms and thunderstorms kunkel et al 2013 extreme rates in the rockies are induced by orographic lifting of moisture but it is also likely that values in these regions are underestimated by stage iv due to radar beam blockage or overshooting caused by high elevation angles to overcome beam blockage further north the extreme rain rates decrease to around 5 mm hr 1 95th percentile 15 mm hr 1 99th percentile and 35 mm hr 1 99 9th percentile in association with cold fronts and jet streams these spatial features are comparable to the results of prat nelson 2015 and nelson et al 2016 which investigated the climatology of extreme precipitation for stage iv the differences between the three imerg runs and stage iv are shown to increase with precipitation severity from 95th percentile to 99th percentile and to 99 9th percentile er and lr display overall overestimation of precipitation extreme rates over the conus while fr shows some balance between overestimation and underestimation the proportions of grid cells having the absolute differences within 0 5 mm hr 1 between three runs and stage iv are 13 5 4 54 and 2 37 16 4 6 58 and 3 42 and 29 9 12 0 and 4 89 respectively at 95th percentile 99th percentile and 99 9th percentile apparently fr has the least differences with stage iv followed by lr and er for all products there is a clear transition from overestimation in the northern and central us to underestimation near the southeast coast e g texas florida louisiana the overestimation in high latitude is likely a result of climatological error which is alleviated in fr while the underestimation in the gulf coast is relevant to signal saturation by spaceborne sensors and precipitation microphysics that is poorly represented for satellites from er to lr to fr this transition moves further inland because of decreasing rates broadly as the data latency increases spatially aggregated statistics are displayed in the density scatter plots in figure 2 as expected the performance increases with the data latency of imerg runs and the inclusion of more observations from space and gauges for instance the bias of fr at three percentiles 95th 99th and 99 9th percentiles are 0 08 0 14 and 0 16 respectively smaller than that of lr er 0 22 0 33 0 23 0 36 and 0 27 0 40 the reduced bias in fr is mainly attributed to following reasons 1 compensation between overestimation of low end values and underestimation of high end values 2 the gauge correction at monthly scale alleviates the overestimation of lr meanwhile the added backward morphing in lr may lead to significant performance gains compared to er as precipitation severity increases the degrees of overestimation by er and lr and underestimation by fr increase suggesting a systematic difference between imerg and stage iv figure 3 depicts the probability density function pdf and cumulative density function cdf of extreme rainfall rates at three percentiles rainfall rates for stage iv are unimodal across three percentiles and peak at the lower end values 3 5 9 and 26 mm hr 1 for 95th 99th and 99 9th percentiles respectively relative to imerg three imerg runs display bi modal distributions at 95th and 99th percentiles with a primary mode around 6 5 and 15 mm hr 1 and another mode around 3 and 6 mm hr 1 at the low end smaller than 5 10 20 mm hr 1 the fr curve is reasonably close to stage iv as shown in the cdf plot but its spread is significantly narrower and it fails to pick up high end values above 10 20 40 mm hr 1 at 95 99 99 5th percentile er and lr have significantly lower density than stage iv when lower than 5 12 28 mm hr 1 but capture better high end values relatively speaking lr outperforms the other two runs for rainfall values above 10 20 40 mm hr 1 overall fr outperforms nrt products over conus based upon the percentile based extremes all imerg runs underestimate the highest extremes in the south coast gulf of mexico 3 1 2 event based extremes an overview of the spatial distribution of the extreme events reported in the storm events database from the same study period 2015 2019 is provided in figure 4 all pixels within the event extent and period are extracted according to the nws storm report and accumulated as depth over the time period hail events account for 80 of the records because of its great socioeconomic impact the three extreme event types are spatially concentrated over different parts of the conus hail mainly occurs in central us e g the great plains snowstorms are mainly located in the northeast particularly adjacent to the great lakes heavy rainfall events are concentrated on the northeast us midwest and western mountainous regions notably the distribution of heavy rainfall events may not align well with the high end extreme precipitation in figure 1 because the events in the database are recorded based on the primary precipitation type leading to the most economic losses rather than precipitation intensity as such the underestimation of extreme rainfall in southeast coast for three runs may be overshadowed the density scatter plot in figure 5 shows the performance of er lr and fr against stage iv for all the extreme events combined for the bias three runs concur with an overestimation bias 0 in these events as already mentioned fr outperforms the other two runs with lower bias 0 03 and me 0 052 mm hr 1 surprisingly er shows slightly better performance than lr with a smaller bias 0 27 versus 0 31 and rmse 1 25 mm hr 1 versus 1 29 mm hr 1 er even has the highest event based cc among the three runs with above 90 confidence by the kolmogorov smirnov test these advances in er are possibly tied to precipitation types such as snowfall and hail which will be discussed later these observations are fairly comparable to the scatterplot in figure 2 with percentile based extreme precipitation for instance the degree of overestimation decreases with data latency the cc spat 0 79 in event based extremes is also similar to that in percentile based extremes 0 74 however differently the transition from underestimation percentile based to overestimation event based for fr is primarily attributed to the precipitation types as the mixture of precipitation types results in a slight difference the event precipitation distributions in figure 6 depict better visual agreement between the three imerg runs and stage iv than with a conus wide comparison section 3 1 1 all distributions display bi modal pdfs the lower end of event precipitation 1 10 mm is largely associated with snow and the higher end 100 mm is associated with heavy rains hail three imerg runs markedly underestimate snowfall rates while comparatively overestimate high rates associated with rain hail as revealed by the positive bias for the latter fr follows stage iv more closely than er and lr which again can be attributed to the gauge corrections compared to the pdf plots in figure 3 for percentile based events one common trait across imerg runs is the bi modal distribution fr similarly underestimates two tails extremely high and extremely low precipitation er and lr still underestimate low precipitation values and overestimates high precipitation values closest to stage iv in both configurations figure 7 displays boxplots of the imerg runs scores broken down following three types of precipitation events since three imerg runs all exhibit negative bias we use bias 1 for a better visualization with higher correlations and moderate biases overall hail events appear to be better quantified than heavy rain and snow events by imerg it probably relates to the clear signature that hail displays in ir or pmw brightness temperatures that is associated with high ice content aloft however the high interquartile range of scores especially the correlation suggests that hail events are more difficult to quantify consistently it probably relates to the extreme variability of these events that challenges the imerg blending procedures of diverse satellite sensors imerg consistently shows larger biases and lower correlation scores in snow events than with other events highlighting the long standing challenges associated with estimating snow from space milani et al 2021 skofronick jackson et al 2017 correlation scores tend to decrease from er to lr to fr for instance the median cc event for er in hail events is around 0 6 figure 7 higher than 0 5 for both lr and fr again the blending of different sensors with increasing latency may be challenged by the inherent variability in extreme events and impacts correlations in contrast there is a general improvement in terms of bias from er to lr to fr in heavy rain in this case lower rates are estimated by imerg runs with increasing latency leading er to overestimation bias 0 17 fr to underestimation bias 0 08 and lr to the lowest bias 0 03 for heavy rains the added pmw estimates and backward morphing techniques from er to lr improves the performance while the gauge correction from lr to fr appears to exacerbate the underestimation similar findings can also be found in chen et al 2013 huang et al 2019 on the contrary for solid precipitation and hail events the gauge correction offsets the positive bias 3 1 3 frequency based extremes figure 8 shows the mean respective metrics for combinations of different return period and durations first it is worth noting that the performance of imerg is highly dependent on the combinations of frequency and durations higher durations generally go along with better agreement with the reference for example systematic error bias 1 and correlation cc event improve from 3 hour duration up to 24 hour duration consistently for all three products it is likely that random errors are mitigated over longer time periods leaving systematic errors to remain longer return periods may also imply heavier rates that likely lead to larger instantaneous errors like rmse unlike previously stated overestimation for the three products section 3 1 1 they all display negative bias over the whole conus this is because the reconstructed events inferred by idf are mainly concentrated on the coastlines based on the supplementary fig 1 in these regions all imerg runs experience significant underestimation against stage iv as discussed in section 3 1 1 likewise the degree of underestimation of extreme values increases with data latency as shown in the bias regarding cc event er again outperforms especially for short living events duration 6 h lr and fr perform similarly as in the event based correlations this result is consistent with event based definitions in fig 7 3 2 sources of estimation figs 9 and 10 show the spatial distribution and total samples for each sensor during the study period as expected er weighs more on the combination of ir and morphing 60 higher than lr fr lr and fr otherwise depend more on the pmw morph only 78 higher than er second the pmw overpasses on average for three runs only takes up 30 9 of the total observations whereas the remaining part is from pmw morphing 30 6 ir morph 23 8 and ir only 14 7 third for individual pmw sensors the saphir sensor accounts for an only limited portion around 0 2 of total samples over the conus therefore it is excluded in the following analysis moreover imerg pmw precipitation retrievals rely heavily on mhs 12 2 and ssmis 10 3 gmi atms and amsr contribute almost 2 5 samples individually to the estimates the spatial distributions in fig 10 shows the relative compositions of sensors used for different regions over the conus for instance in the south us imerg has more samples from pmw sensors e g mhs and ssmis than pure ir 5 in the north ir takes up higher portions 20 and ssmis 10 is dominant within pmw sensors the greater use of ir sensor in high latitudes is likely due to snow coverage over which the pmw is not used 3 2 1 extreme precipitation detection fig 9b c and d illustrate precipitation detectability for sensors which is categorized as hits false alarms misses and correct negatives of extreme precipitation 95th percentile threshold against stage iv table 3 provides the csi values for each sensor at respective imerg runs first in terms of the performance er and lr similarly detects more extreme precipitation events than fr they have fewer miss rates resulting in slightly higher csi values 0 147 and 0 149 for er and lr respectively vs 0 133 for fr second pmw sensors have better detection of extreme precipitation on averaged over the three runs with a higher proportion of hits 1 8 than ir sensor 0 18 leading to a higher csi value 0 14 vs 0 05 it is ascribed to multi frequency channels in pmw that have a better precipitation detection due to cloud penetration rather than estimated from the cloud top by ir li et al 2020b third amongst pmw sensors ssmis stands out to have the highest hits 1 7 and moderate csi 0 144 followed by mhs and amsr compared to the study of tan et al 2016 chen et al 2019 in normal precipitation condition amsr and gmi perform consistently well across normal and extreme conditions and mhs appears to be more suited to extreme conditions it is noteworthy that morph only estimates display slightly better csi than any pmw sensor estimates a testimony to the effectiveness of the approach that extends the coverage of pmw based information in contrast ir only estimates display poor skills in detecting precipitation extremes csi 0 06 this may be related to ambiguities in the relations between cold ir brightness temperatures and high rainfall rates in persiann ccs kirstetter et al 2018 the ir morph estimates display similar scores as pmw or morph only estimates again illustrating the efficiency in combining ir and pmw estimates in imerg 3 2 2 extreme precipitation estimation the following results are based on noaa extreme storm database to investigate different precipitation types only imerg fr is investigated to focus on the relative sensor performance in this regard it is important to acknowledge that the gauges used to correct fr and stage iv are not fully independent fig 11 depicts the scatter plots of sensor performance with respect to stage iv for three types of extreme events i e snow hail and rain similar to previous negative nme for fr section 3 1 2 all pmw estimates tend to underestimate the extreme events with the nme values ranging from 0 47 to 0 30 ir estimates poorly quantify extreme rates with a systematic underestimation majority of the points are below 1 1 line in the scatter plot and largest nmae 1 23 within pmw sensors the performances are ranked according to correlation in a decreasing order amsr nme 0 39 nmae 1 11 cc spat 0 75 ssmis nme 0 44 nmae 1 11 cc spat 0 60 mhs nme 0 30 nmae 1 18 cc spat 0 52 atms nme 0 37 nmae 1 15 cc spat 0 51 and gmi nme 0 44 nmae 1 14 cc spat 0 43 as imagers amsr and ssmis consistently outperform other sensors in extreme precipitation detection and estimation as noted before morphing strategies display good performances with respect to pmw estimates morph only shows slightly higher performance nme 0 18 nmae 1 11 cc 0 85 and the ir morph nme 0 26 nmae 1 03 cc spat 0 71 that is on par with individual pmw estimates this result is also suggested by tan et al 2016 and ayat et al 2021 where they stated that the performance of morphing heavily relies on individual pmw estimates breaking down precipitation types fig 12 provides insights of the performance of each sensor in each event type table 4 provides the total samples and values for the four metrics regarding sample sizes ir only samples are limited for hail events 67 and heavy rain 192 since imerg mainly uses ir based precipitation in northern us see fig 10 where snowfall is more frequent see fig 4 in comparison pmw estimates have more hail and heavy rain samples but less than morph based estimates regarding performance hail events are again the most uncertain events to estimate as illustrated by the largest interquartile range of performance metrics for each sensor relatively speaking ir sensors makes better estimation in hail events than most pmw sensors with the highest cc spat 0 87 amongst pmw sensors ssmis leads the performance ranking nme 0 40 cc spat 0 77 nmae 1 47 rmse 3 06 mm h 1 while mhs displays the worst scores nme 1 10 cc 0 72 nmae 1 85 rmse 4 50 mm h 1 ir morph displays better results than morph only because of the inclusion of ir estimates which outperforms pmw estimates in hail events for heavy rain pmw exhibits markedly less errors and higher correlations than ir which supports that pmw supersedes ir estimates gmi estimates display the best performance with the second highest cc spat 0 74 and least nme 0 18 ir morph and morph only display similar performance to predict heavy rain that lay in between pmw and ir estimates lastly for snowstorms all estimates perform poorly in terms of cc spat which is around 0 2 the performance of pmw estimates is slightly better than ir estimates mhs displays the better performance than the other pmw estimates in snowfall prediction with the least rmse 0 85 and nme 0 35 and highest cc spat 0 23 the ir morph combined technique has again comparable scores with morph only technique in summary pmw estimates seem better suited to estimate heavy rainfall rates while ir estimates display better performance for hail events imagers perform generally better than sounders especially for heavy rains gmi performs particularly well in heavy rainfall estimation characterized by high variability hail events are challenging to consistently estimate and snowstorms are generally associated with low performance cc 0 2 which are thus far common challenges for satellite precipitation retrievals and also radar measurements 4 discussions 4 1 remarks on three types of extreme event definitions three types of extreme assessments offer complementary aspects on evaluating precipitation extremes similarities for these three methods are clear and also align with many other studies imerg fr presents the overall best quality with minimized bias yet it also suggests the degrees of underestimation of high end extreme values in the coastal regions increase with data latency fr lr er both percentiles and idf curves are likely to reconstruct more rainfall events due to higher intensities while ignoring snowfall events that in nature have light intensities particularly events inferred by idf curve appear to be major meso scale or synoptic scale weather systems e g tropical cyclones and hurricanes that primarily occur in the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast where three imerg runs present negative biases similar results discovered by previous studies corroborate this point ayat et al 2021 li et al 2020a however storm events divide precipitation events into rainfall events snowfall events and hail events which enables separate assessments although precipitation could be mixed a general performance of imerg product for each event is ranked as rainfall events hail events snowfall events yet the variability of scores associated with each event have a reversed order meaning that imerg so far does not have enough confidence when quantifying hail events overall depending on the primary events of interest users can select the way that is the most appropriate to define extreme events 4 2 uncertainties and heterogeneities in imerg we highlight the fact that the imerg is not a homogeneous product when it comes to estimating extreme precipitation due to varying performance of individual sensors and morphing techniques for instance pmw estimates are better suited to heavy rainfall detection and quantification while ir quantifies hail events better within pmw sensors imagers generally perform better than sounders no single sensor behaves consistently across three precipitation types meaning each sensor has its own zone of optimal performance similar findings for hurricane events in the us also demonstrate the heterogenous performance for each sensor ayat et al 2021 it complicates the merging process unless we fully understand each sensor and its associated characteristics which hopes to maximize the benefits in the final merging process as such we hope an uncertainty range could be adopted in a future version of imerg acknowledging uncertainties exist generally from retrieval algorithms to morphing and to gauge adjustments etc similar to ground radar rainfall uncertainties that factored by z r relations kirstetter et al 2015 and ir related t r relations kirstetter et al 2018 imerg could derive certain relations to generate ensemble measures from its candidates in doing so it benefits downstream data users such as hydrologic modelers who can incorporate uncertainties from atmospheric forcing into hydrologic systems 5 conclusion and recommendations throughout this study the performance of imerg in the context of extreme precipitation is investigated over the conus three definitions for extreme events bring complementary insight and reach an overall agreement fr generally outperforms nrt products due to gauge correction breaking down to three precipitation events er outperforms in hail events due to higher fraction of ir estimates lr improves heavy rainfall estimates compared to er which is mainly attributed to the added backward morphing and more pmw compositions fr consistently displays the least bias across all precipitation events for different frequencies and durations the underestimation of high end extreme rates partly due to interpolation increases with data latency which poses challenges for fr comparing pmw estimates to ir estimates pmw generally exhibits better detectability csi 0 14 than ir csi 0 05 and quantification 0 97 vs 1 04 for nmae and 0 42 vs 0 64 for nme however ir could be a good substitute for quantifying hail events amongst individual sensors imagers outperform sounders especially in heavy rain in terms of extreme precipitation detection mhs saphir exhibits the highest lowest csi 0 152 vs 0 10 for quantification amsr and ssmis estimates tend to outperform other sensors regarding precipitation types gmi is more appropriate in heavy rainfall estimation while amsr and mhs perform better in hail and snowfall events in summary imerg is not a homogenous precipitation product when it comes to estimating precipitation extremes due to variable performance of individual sensors its performances highly depend on the sensor and the type of precipitation sampled at any given time and location besides evaluating the performance of precipitation products this study primarily suggests that room for improvement lays in enhanced homogeneity across precipitation estimates used in imerg

3632,improved quantification of extreme precipitation rates using observations has far reaching implications for environmental sciences especially for hydrometeorological studies yet uncertainties still remain in satellite precipitation estimates especially for a merged product this study evaluates the performance of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg in extreme events over the conterminous us three approaches are followed to define and evaluate extreme events 1 a percentile based analysis 2 an event based analysis using the national weather service storm database and 3 a frequency based analysis using intensity durationfrequency idf curves the imerg early run er late run lr and final run fr products and their original passive microwave and infrared ir sensors are intercompared against the national centers for environmental predictions stage iv ground based radar precipitation data from 2015 to 2019 in particular we break down the performance in three types of events rain snow and hail the results reveal that 1 three types of extreme definitions converge toward an overall agreement the degrees of underestimation of high end extreme precipitation rates increases with data latency fr lr er and fr delivers overall best performance 2 passive microwave pmw estimates generally exhibits better detectability and quantification of extreme precipitation than

grid followed by an intercalibration with the gpm combined radar radiometer algorithm grecu et al 2016 due to the discontinuous sampling of the pmw sensors the gaps within between pmw overpasses are

precipitation fang et al 2019 huang et al 2019 li et al 2020a li et al 2021a prakash et al 2016 huang et al 2019 conducted an intercomparison of imerg early run er and final run fr over extreme precipitation generated by typhoons in china and indicate a good spatiotemporal correspondence between imerg and ground reference li et al 2020a characterized uncertainties of gauge based radar based and satellite based imerg precipitation estimates in hurricane tropical cyclone events and found that imerg captures the storm cores reasonably well ayat et al 2021 attributed error sources to different sensors during hurricane days however a comprehensive evaluation on three runs er late run lr and fr and along with a focus on the gpm constellation sensors is still lacking for hydrometeorological studies although works tracing error sources in normal conditions are present sui et al 2020 tan et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 uncertainties due to limited cases and means of describing extreme events impede a systematic assessment let alone tracing errors back to individual sensor and algorithms definitions for extreme precipitation are diverse including threshold based e g todorovic and zelenhasic 1970 tian et al 2018 percentile based prudhomme 1999 aghakouchak et al 2011 li et al 2021a event based huang et al 2019 li et al 2020a scofield and kuligowski 2003 and frequency based stevenson and schumacher 2014 approaches the simple thresholding approach is one of the most popular ways to examine extreme events yet it requires prior knowledge of local precipitation climatology to determine the hard coded threshold for instance prat and nelson 2015 adaptively used 1 and 2 in day 1 to represent wet and extreme precipitation events in north america more importantly such an approach does not account for heterogenous climatology across the study region aghakouchak et al 2011 instead the other three methods are adaptive to precipitation climatology to our knowledge there are few works assembling results from different definitions of extreme precipitation events nor systematic evaluation of imerg runs and its constellations in such context over a long period uncertainties relating to internal sensor performance in extreme events such as rainfall events and snowfall events remain largely unclear the goals of this study are to evaluate 1 the similarities differences of imerg performances in the context of three common definitions of extreme events i e percentile events and frequency and 2 the imerg algorithmic and sensors advantages drawbacks in extreme precipitation in doing so three imerg runs i e er lr and fr and individual gpm sensors merged prioritized and calibrated by the imerg algorithm are intercompared in extreme events defined by percentile event long hazard and climatological hazard based definitions as such we can generalize the homogeneity of the imerg product by assessing its upstream data quality and algorithmic development this work targets a broad range of audiences including but not limited to water resources managers environmental modelers and algorithm developers the values and precautions of each product er lr fr highlighted in this work helps to inform users which one is appropriate to use in hydrometeorological events for hazard assessments for algorithm developers the performance of each sensor in extreme events could guide them prioritize the use of constellations in a coordinated manner the remainder of this article is structured as follows section 2 describes the datasets and statistical metrics for estimations section 3 presents the results from broad merged products er lr and fr to detailed independent sensors pmw sensors and ir sensor section 4 concludes the major findings and recommendations for improving current imerg algorithms 2 data and methods 2 1 imerg imerg consists of three runs to accommodate various user requirements for latency and accuracy huffman et al 2019b tan et al 2019a near real time nrt products comprise the er and lr with the latency of 4 h and 14 h the post real time fr has a latency of 3 5 months the nrt products serve for real time applications such as natural hazards monitoring and forecasting the fr is a research level product that aims at providing high accuracy huffman et al 2019b the main differences between the three products include but not limited to that 1 lr and fr incorporate more pmw estimates than er and both lr and fr adopt forward and backward morphing while er only morphs forward 2 fr corrects the systematic bias with the monthly global prediction climatology center gpcc gauge based product and 3 er and lr derive the motion vectors from goddard earth observing system forward processing geos fp while fr uses modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 numerical models tan et al 2019b more detailed descriptions of the algorithmic differences are summarized by huffman et al 2019b in this study three runs i e er lr and fr of the latest imerg version 06b data and the embedded pmw and ir sensors are investigated over the conterminous us conus from 2015 to 06 01 to 2019 06 30 imerg has a 0 1 degree spatial resolution and half hourly time interval covering majority of the globe huffman et al 2019b half hourly precipitation estimates are averaged to hourly to match the reference data resolution the six pmw gpm sensors used to generate imerg data are summarized in table 1 three of them are imagers i e amsr2 gmi and ssmis which are prioritized over sounders in imerg as they are considered more accurate in precipitation estimation to be noted ssmis has both imager and sounder sensors a detailed description of each sensor can be found in the latest imerg technical documentation huffman et al 2019b at a given timestep the algorithm uses the pmw estimates closest to the target analysis time and propagate to target time using the motion vector derived from the total precipitable water vapor during which imagers are prioritized over sounders if available if the gap between target time and observation time is longer than 30 min yet shorter than 90 min the precipitation field is merged by interpolated pmw estimates and weighted ir estimates according to the observational correlations once the gap exceeds 90 min the ir based estimates are largely weighted because the ir has a higher correlation than propagated pmw data a long propagated pmw still contributes to a small weight specifically the hqprecipsource data field categorizes the source of precipitation pmw estimates at a given timeframe and grid similarly the inclusion of ir estimates can be identified in the irkalmanfilterweight data field in which 100 0 means ir only morph only or pmw overpass and every percentage in between indicates ir morph combined estimates 2 2 ncep stage iv ground based radar data are increasingly used to investigate extreme precipitation lengfeld et al 2020 the national centers for environmental predictions ncep stage iv precipitation product herein referred to as stage iv is an operational radar gauge merged quantitative precipitation estimation qpe based on the next generation weather radar nexrad precipitation processing system pps at the national water service nws river forecast center rfc seo and breidenbach 2002 stage iv produces multi scale estimates i e hourly 6 hourly and 24 hourly and undergoes rigorous quality control qc measures including manual inspections at each rfc in this study we use the hourly precipitation field which is close to imerg temporal resolution to match up with imerg spatially the 4 km stage iv data are upscaled using the nearest neighbors the rationale behind using the nearest neighbors is to preserve local extreme rates that may be smoothed when averaging to imerg resolution however it is noteworthy that this possibly leads to the underestimation of imerg the availability of the stage iv is not homogenous across conus samples in the western u s are generally under 60 available due to the belated data delivery in the california nevada rfc and northwest rfc supplementary fig 1 therefore data in these regions are excluded from this study 2 3 definitions of extreme precipitation amongst various definitions for extreme events percentile event and frequency based approaches are the most popular ways the percentile based approach rests on the foundation of precipitation distribution at each grid cell where the 95th 99th and 99 9th percentile values from the product are chosen in this study to represent extreme rates this approach does not rely on time series and the comparison between estimates and references may not be coincident meanwhile the percentile based approach weighs more on rainfall events due to its higher rates whereas it is likely to miss solid precipitation events i e snow storm which are relatively less intense noh et al 2009 wen et al 2016 the event based approach addresses complementary aspects of extremes and relies on temporal information and precipitation type simultaneously in this study recorded event data are obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information storm events database https www ncdc noaa gov stormevents reports in this database entail three criteria a having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life injuries damages and disruption to commerce b rare unusual weather phenomena and c significant meteorological events overall a total of 48 event types have been recorded since 1950 to date yet only heavy rain snow and hail events are considered in this study from 2015 to 2019 the event counts for rainfall snow and hail are 6065 5917 and 37212 respectively in this work the data fields spatial extent impacted area and event period start date and end date are taken to extract precipitation rates from both stage iv and imerg to account for errors in reported event location we filter out pixels with extracted precipitation depth 1 mm during each event another extreme definition i e frequency based from a hydrologic application perspective is dependent upon the intensity duration and frequency hosking and wallis 1997 in addition to intensity and duration frequency i e period emphasizes the severity of the event in historical records intensity duration frequency idf curve is a pragmatic way to represent the relation among rainfall intensity duration and frequency this study retrieves the noaa atlas 14 gridded product which is derived by 100 year long nation wide gauge stations and fitted with an assumed extreme value distribution perica et al 2013 the frequencies at 0 5 i e once every two years 0 2 0 1 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 are collected in conjunction with four durations i e 3 6 12 and 24 h sufficient samples are reached because grid cells are aggregated over conus to perform the statistical analysis the noaa atlas 14 idf curves are utilized from the frequency perspective the statistical analysis for enumerations between return period and duration is conducted as follows first each grid cell value from the raw data applies an areal reduction factor miller et al 1973 to match the same spatial resolution as imerg second a continuous time window with respect to duration at each grid cell and spatial extent are determined when stage iv exceeds certain thresholds lastly the statistics for a certain return period and duration are computed within that time window and over a spatial domain 2 4 statistical metrics a suite of statistical metrics is summarized in table 2 among which the mean error me and bias evaluate the general underestimation overestimation the root mean squared error rmse evaluates the errors magnitudes the normalized mean error nme and normalized mean absolute error nmae quantify the systematic and random error respectively normalized by the mean rain rate correlation coefficient cc investigates the spatial temporal correspondence of estimates and references the cc values can be computed over a spatial domain without time signature cc spat or over a time period related to an event cc event the cc spat investigates the systematic differences of two fields with linear correlation while the cc event focuses on temporal correlation samples with p value 0 05 confidence level 95 are excluded during our analysis to underline statistical significance collectively these event metrics are calculated for a given time period such as recorded in storm report and a spatial domain storm range where rainfall values of estimates and observations are aggregated first and then compute respective statistical scores in addition to quantitative assessments we evaluate the performance of extreme precipitation detection with the number of hits false alarms and misses the number of hits is measured by counting the times both stage iv and imerg exceeding a threshold while the number of false alarms misses is determined by imerg stage iv detecting an extreme event but stage iv imerg does not a composite index critical success index csi jointly consider hits false alarms and misses and thus gives a broad assessment 3 results 3 1 merged products 3 1 1 percentile based extremes figure 1 depicts the percentile based extreme precipitation rates over the conus from stage iv and the corresponding differences displayed by three imerg runs for er lr and fr clearly the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation is on par with us annual precipitation climatology high end stage iv values rate 10 mm hr 1 concentrate on the coastlines of the gulf of mexico and atlantic east coast where the 99 9th percentile values are up to 50 mm hr 1 presumably owing to frequently endured extra tropical storms and hurricanes li et al 2021b inland areas such as the high plains also have discernable hotspots likely associated with local convective storms and thunderstorms kunkel et al 2013 extreme rates in the rockies are induced by orographic lifting of moisture but it is also likely that values in these regions are underestimated by stage iv due to radar beam blockage or overshooting caused by high elevation angles to overcome beam blockage further north the extreme rain rates decrease to around 5 mm hr 1 95th percentile 15 mm hr 1 99th percentile and 35 mm hr 1 99 9th percentile in association with cold fronts and jet streams these spatial features are comparable to the results of prat nelson 2015 and nelson et al 2016 which investigated the climatology of extreme precipitation for stage iv the differences between the three imerg runs and stage iv are shown to increase with precipitation severity from 95th percentile to 99th percentile and to 99 9th percentile er and lr display overall overestimation of precipitation extreme rates over the conus while fr shows some balance between overestimation and underestimation the proportions of grid cells having the absolute differences within 0 5 mm hr 1 between three runs and stage iv are 13 5 4 54 and 2 37 16 4 6 58 and 3 42 and 29 9 12 0 and 4 89 respectively at 95th percentile 99th percentile and 99 9th percentile apparently fr has the least differences with stage iv followed by lr and er for all products there is a clear transition from overestimation in the northern and central us to underestimation near the southeast coast e g texas florida louisiana the overestimation in high latitude is likely a result of climatological error which is alleviated in fr while the underestimation in the gulf coast is relevant to signal saturation by spaceborne sensors and precipitation microphysics that is poorly represented for satellites from er to lr to fr this transition moves further inland because of decreasing rates broadly as the data latency increases spatially aggregated statistics are displayed in the density scatter plots in figure 2 as expected the performance increases with the data latency of imerg runs and the inclusion of more observations from space and gauges for instance the bias of fr at three percentiles 95th 99th and 99 9th percentiles are 0 08 0 14 and 0 16 respectively smaller than that of lr er 0 22 0 33 0 23 0 36 and 0 27 0 40 the reduced bias in fr is mainly attributed to following reasons 1 compensation between overestimation of low end values and underestimation of high end values 2 the gauge correction at monthly scale alleviates the overestimation of lr meanwhile the added backward morphing in lr may lead to significant performance gains compared to er as precipitation severity increases the degrees of overestimation by er and lr and underestimation by fr increase suggesting a systematic difference between imerg and stage iv figure 3 depicts the probability density function pdf and cumulative density function cdf of extreme rainfall rates at three percentiles rainfall rates for stage iv are unimodal across three percentiles and peak at the lower end values 3 5 9 and 26 mm hr 1 for 95th 99th and 99 9th percentiles respectively relative to imerg three imerg runs display bi modal distributions at 95th and 99th percentiles with a primary mode around 6 5 and 15 mm hr 1 and another mode around 3 and 6 mm hr 1 at the low end smaller than 5 10 20 mm hr 1 the fr curve is reasonably close to stage iv as shown in the cdf plot but its spread is significantly narrower and it fails to pick up high end values above 10 20 40 mm hr 1 at 95 99 99 5th percentile er and lr have significantly lower density than stage iv when lower than 5 12 28 mm hr 1 but capture better high end values relatively speaking lr outperforms the other two runs for rainfall values above 10 20 40 mm hr 1 overall fr outperforms nrt products over conus based upon the percentile based extremes all imerg runs underestimate the highest extremes in the south coast gulf of mexico 3 1 2 event based extremes an overview of the spatial distribution of the extreme events reported in the storm events database from the same study period 2015 2019 is provided in figure 4 all pixels within the event extent and period are extracted according to the nws storm report and accumulated as depth over the time period hail events account for 80 of the records because of its great socioeconomic impact the three extreme event types are spatially concentrated over different parts of the conus hail mainly occurs in central us e g the great plains snowstorms are mainly located in the northeast particularly adjacent to the great lakes heavy rainfall events are concentrated on the northeast us midwest and western mountainous regions notably the distribution of heavy rainfall events may not align well with the high end extreme precipitation in figure 1 because the events in the database are recorded based on the primary precipitation type leading to the most economic losses rather than precipitation intensity as such the underestimation of extreme rainfall in southeast coast for three runs may be overshadowed the density scatter plot in figure 5 shows the performance of er lr and fr against stage iv for all the extreme events combined for the bias three runs concur with an overestimation bias 0 in these events as already mentioned fr outperforms the other two runs with lower bias 0 03 and me 0 052 mm hr 1 surprisingly er shows slightly better performance than lr with a smaller bias 0 27 versus 0 31 and rmse 1 25 mm hr 1 versus 1 29 mm hr 1 er even has the highest event based cc among the three runs with above 90 confidence by the kolmogorov smirnov test these advances in er are possibly tied to precipitation types such as snowfall and hail which will be discussed later these observations are fairly comparable to the scatterplot in figure 2 with percentile based extreme precipitation for instance the degree of overestimation decreases with data latency the cc spat 0 79 in event based extremes is also similar to that in percentile based extremes 0 74 however differently the transition from underestimation percentile based to overestimation event based for fr is primarily attributed to the precipitation types as the mixture of precipitation types results in a slight difference the event precipitation distributions in figure 6 depict better visual agreement between the three imerg runs and stage iv than with a conus wide comparison section 3 1 1 all distributions display bi modal pdfs the lower end of event precipitation 1 10 mm is largely associated with snow and the higher end 100 mm is associated with heavy rains hail three imerg runs markedly underestimate snowfall rates while comparatively overestimate high rates associated with rain hail as revealed by the positive bias for the latter fr follows stage iv more closely than er and lr which again can be attributed to the gauge corrections compared to the pdf plots in figure 3 for percentile based events one common trait across imerg runs is the bi modal distribution fr similarly underestimates two tails extremely high and extremely low precipitation er and lr still underestimate low precipitation values and overestimates high precipitation values closest to stage iv in both configurations figure 7 displays boxplots of the imerg runs scores broken down following three types of precipitation events since three imerg runs all exhibit negative bias we use bias 1 for a better visualization with higher correlations and moderate biases overall hail events appear to be better quantified than heavy rain and snow events by imerg it probably relates to the clear signature that hail displays in ir or pmw brightness temperatures that is associated with high ice content aloft however the high interquartile range of scores especially the correlation suggests that hail events are more difficult to quantify consistently it probably relates to the extreme variability of these events that challenges the imerg blending procedures of diverse satellite sensors imerg consistently shows larger biases and lower correlation scores in snow events than with other events highlighting the long standing challenges associated with estimating snow from space milani et al 2021 skofronick jackson et al 2017 correlation scores tend to decrease from er to lr to fr for instance the median cc event for er in hail events is around 0 6 figure 7 higher than 0 5 for both lr and fr again the blending of different sensors with increasing latency may be challenged by the inherent variability in extreme events and impacts correlations in contrast there is a general improvement in terms of bias from er to lr to fr in heavy rain in this case lower rates are estimated by imerg runs with increasing latency leading er to overestimation bias 0 17 fr to underestimation bias 0 08 and lr to the lowest bias 0 03 for heavy rains the added pmw estimates and backward morphing techniques from er to lr improves the performance while the gauge correction from lr to fr appears to exacerbate the underestimation similar findings can also be found in chen et al 2013 huang et al 2019 on the contrary for solid precipitation and hail events the gauge correction offsets the positive bias 3 1 3 frequency based extremes figure 8 shows the mean respective metrics for combinations of different return period and durations first it is worth noting that the performance of imerg is highly dependent on the combinations of frequency and durations higher durations generally go along with better agreement with the reference for example systematic error bias 1 and correlation cc event improve from 3 hour duration up to 24 hour duration consistently for all three products it is likely that random errors are mitigated over longer time periods leaving systematic errors to remain longer return periods may also imply heavier rates that likely lead to larger instantaneous errors like rmse unlike previously stated overestimation for the three products section 3 1 1 they all display negative bias over the whole conus this is because the reconstructed events inferred by idf are mainly concentrated on the coastlines based on the supplementary fig 1 in these regions all imerg runs experience significant underestimation against stage iv as discussed in section 3 1 1 likewise the degree of underestimation of extreme values increases with data latency as shown in the bias regarding cc event er again outperforms especially for short living events duration 6 h lr and fr perform similarly as in the event based correlations this result is consistent with event based definitions in fig 7 3 2 sources of estimation figs 9 and 10 show the spatial distribution and total samples for each sensor during the study period as expected er weighs more on the combination of ir and morphing 60 higher than lr fr lr and fr otherwise depend more on the pmw morph only 78 higher than er second the pmw overpasses on average for three runs only takes up 30 9 of the total observations whereas the remaining part is from pmw morphing 30 6 ir morph 23 8 and ir only 14 7 third for individual pmw sensors the saphir sensor accounts for an only limited portion around 0 2 of total samples over the conus therefore it is excluded in the following analysis moreover imerg pmw precipitation retrievals rely heavily on mhs 12 2 and ssmis 10 3 gmi atms and amsr contribute almost 2 5 samples individually to the estimates the spatial distributions in fig 10 shows the relative compositions of sensors used for different regions over the conus for instance in the south us imerg has more samples from pmw sensors e g mhs and ssmis than pure ir 5 in the north ir takes up higher portions 20 and ssmis 10 is dominant within pmw sensors the greater use of ir sensor in high latitudes is likely due to snow coverage over which the pmw is not used 3 2 1 extreme precipitation detection fig 9b c and d illustrate precipitation detectability for sensors which is categorized as hits false alarms misses and correct negatives of extreme precipitation 95th percentile threshold against stage iv table 3 provides the csi values for each sensor at respective imerg runs first in terms of the performance er and lr similarly detects more extreme precipitation events than fr they have fewer miss rates resulting in slightly higher csi values 0 147 and 0 149 for er and lr respectively vs 0 133 for fr second pmw sensors have better detection of extreme precipitation on averaged over the three runs with a higher proportion of hits 1 8 than ir sensor 0 18 leading to a higher csi value 0 14 vs 0 05 it is ascribed to multi frequency channels in pmw that have a better precipitation detection due to cloud penetration rather than estimated from the cloud top by ir li et al 2020b third amongst pmw sensors ssmis stands out to have the highest hits 1 7 and moderate csi 0 144 followed by mhs and amsr compared to the study of tan et al 2016 chen et al 2019 in normal precipitation condition amsr and gmi perform consistently well across normal and extreme conditions and mhs appears to be more suited to extreme conditions it is noteworthy that morph only estimates display slightly better csi than any pmw sensor estimates a testimony to the effectiveness of the approach that extends the coverage of pmw based information in contrast ir only estimates display poor skills in detecting precipitation extremes csi 0 06 this may be related to ambiguities in the relations between cold ir brightness temperatures and high rainfall rates in persiann ccs kirstetter et al 2018 the ir morph estimates display similar scores as pmw or morph only estimates again illustrating the efficiency in combining ir and pmw estimates in imerg 3 2 2 extreme precipitation estimation the following results are based on noaa extreme storm database to investigate different precipitation types only imerg fr is investigated to focus on the relative sensor performance in this regard it is important to acknowledge that the gauges used to correct fr and stage iv are not fully independent fig 11 depicts the scatter plots of sensor performance with respect to stage iv for three types of extreme events i e snow hail and rain similar to previous negative nme for fr section 3 1 2 all pmw estimates tend to underestimate the extreme events with the nme values ranging from 0 47 to 0 30 ir estimates poorly quantify extreme rates with a systematic underestimation majority of the points are below 1 1 line in the scatter plot and largest nmae 1 23 within pmw sensors the performances are ranked according to correlation in a decreasing order amsr nme 0 39 nmae 1 11 cc spat 0 75 ssmis nme 0 44 nmae 1 11 cc spat 0 60 mhs nme 0 30 nmae 1 18 cc spat 0 52 atms nme 0 37 nmae 1 15 cc spat 0 51 and gmi nme 0 44 nmae 1 14 cc spat 0 43 as imagers amsr and ssmis consistently outperform other sensors in extreme precipitation detection and estimation as noted before morphing strategies display good performances with respect to pmw estimates morph only shows slightly higher performance nme 0 18 nmae 1 11 cc 0 85 and the ir morph nme 0 26 nmae 1 03 cc spat 0 71 that is on par with individual pmw estimates this result is also suggested by tan et al 2016 and ayat et al 2021 where they stated that the performance of morphing heavily relies on individual pmw estimates breaking down precipitation types fig 12 provides insights of the performance of each sensor in each event type table 4 provides the total samples and values for the four metrics regarding sample sizes ir only samples are limited for hail events 67 and heavy rain 192 since imerg mainly uses ir based precipitation in northern us see fig 10 where snowfall is more frequent see fig 4 in comparison pmw estimates have more hail and heavy rain samples but less than morph based estimates regarding performance hail events are again the most uncertain events to estimate as illustrated by the largest interquartile range of performance metrics for each sensor relatively speaking ir sensors makes better estimation in hail events than most pmw sensors with the highest cc spat 0 87 amongst pmw sensors ssmis leads the performance ranking nme 0 40 cc spat 0 77 nmae 1 47 rmse 3 06 mm h 1 while mhs displays the worst scores nme 1 10 cc 0 72 nmae 1 85 rmse 4 50 mm h 1 ir morph displays better results than morph only because of the inclusion of ir estimates which outperforms pmw estimates in hail events for heavy rain pmw exhibits markedly less errors and higher correlations than ir which supports that pmw supersedes ir estimates gmi estimates display the best performance with the second highest cc spat 0 74 and least nme 0 18 ir morph and morph only display similar performance to predict heavy rain that lay in between pmw and ir estimates lastly for snowstorms all estimates perform poorly in terms of cc spat which is around 0 2 the performance of pmw estimates is slightly better than ir estimates mhs displays the better performance than the other pmw estimates in snowfall prediction with the least rmse 0 85 and nme 0 35 and highest cc spat 0 23 the ir morph combined technique has again comparable scores with morph only technique in summary pmw estimates seem better suited to estimate heavy rainfall rates while ir estimates display better performance for hail events imagers perform generally better than sounders especially for heavy rains gmi performs particularly well in heavy rainfall estimation characterized by high variability hail events are challenging to consistently estimate and snowstorms are generally associated with low performance cc 0 2 which are thus far common challenges for satellite precipitation retrievals and also radar measurements 4 discussions 4 1 remarks on three types of extreme event definitions three types of extreme assessments offer complementary aspects on evaluating precipitation extremes similarities for these three methods are clear and also align with many other studies imerg fr presents the overall best quality with minimized bias yet it also suggests the degrees of underestimation of high end extreme values in the coastal regions increase with data latency fr lr er both percentiles and idf curves are likely to reconstruct more rainfall events due to higher intensities while ignoring snowfall events that in nature have light intensities particularly events inferred by idf curve appear to be major meso scale or synoptic scale weather systems e g tropical cyclones and hurricanes that primarily occur in the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast where three imerg runs present negative biases similar results discovered by previous studies corroborate this point ayat et al 2021 li et al 2020a however storm events divide precipitation events into rainfall events snowfall events and hail events which enables separate assessments although precipitation could be mixed a general performance of imerg product for each event is ranked as rainfall events hail events snowfall events yet the variability of scores associated with each event have a reversed order meaning that imerg so far does not have enough confidence when quantifying hail events overall depending on the primary events of interest users can select the way that is the most appropriate to define extreme events 4 2 uncertainties and heterogeneities in imerg we highlight the fact that the imerg is not a homogeneous product when it comes to estimating extreme precipitation due to varying performance of individual sensors and morphing techniques for instance pmw estimates are better suited to heavy rainfall detection and quantification while ir quantifies hail events better within pmw sensors imagers generally perform better than sounders no single sensor behaves consistently across three precipitation types meaning each sensor has its own zone of optimal performance similar findings for hurricane events in the us also demonstrate the heterogenous performance for each sensor ayat et al 2021 it complicates the merging process unless we fully understand each sensor and its associated characteristics which hopes to maximize the benefits in the final merging process as such we hope an uncertainty range could be adopted in a future version of imerg acknowledging uncertainties exist generally from retrieval algorithms to morphing and to gauge adjustments etc similar to ground radar rainfall uncertainties that factored by z r relations kirstetter et al 2015 and ir related t r relations kirstetter et al 2018 imerg could derive certain relations to generate ensemble measures from its candidates in doing so it benefits downstream data users such as hydrologic modelers who can incorporate uncertainties from atmospheric forcing into hydrologic systems 5 conclusion and recommendations throughout this study the performance of imerg in the context of extreme precipitation is investigated over the conus three definitions for extreme events bring complementary insight and reach an overall agreement fr generally outperforms nrt products due to gauge correction breaking down to three precipitation events er outperforms in hail events due to higher fraction of ir estimates lr improves heavy rainfall estimates compared to er which is mainly attributed to the added backward morphing and more pmw compositions fr consistently displays the least bias across all precipitation events for different frequencies and durations the underestimation of high end extreme rates partly due to interpolation increases with data latency which poses challenges for fr comparing pmw estimates to ir estimates pmw generally exhibits better detectability csi 0 14 than ir csi 0 05 and quantification 0 97 vs 1 04 for nmae and 0 42 vs 0 64 for nme however ir could be a good substitute for quantifying hail events amongst individual sensors imagers outperform sounders especially in heavy rain in terms of extreme precipitation detection mhs saphir exhibits the highest lowest csi 0 152 vs 0 10 for quantification amsr and ssmis estimates tend to outperform other sensors regarding precipitation types gmi is more appropriate in heavy rainfall estimation while amsr and mhs perform better in hail and snowfall events in summary imerg is not a homogenous precipitation product when it comes to estimating precipitation extremes due to variable performance of individual sensors its performances highly depend on the sensor and the type of precipitation sampled at any given time and location besides evaluating the performance of precipitation products this study primarily suggests that room for improvement lays in enhanced homogeneity across precipitation estimates used in imerg

3633,to ensure regional grain security the grain is transferred from grain surplus provinces to grain deficient provinces in china then water embedded in grain virtual water flows accordingly which promotes the spatial redistribution of water resources to explore the influencing factors of virtual water flow this study first obtained the inter provincial virtual water flow pattern and then constructed a virtual water flow trade gravity model based on socio hydrology theory and estimated the model with multiple regression methods and the impulse response function was used to analyze the response trajectory of virtual water flow under the shock of other endogenous variable fluctuation the results show that from 1997 to 2014 the quantity of inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 73 billion m3to 124 64 billion m3 the positive driving effect of the population and per capita gdp in virtual water inflow areas is significant and the negative suppression effect of the grain output per unit in inflow areas and the population in outflow areas is significant heilongjiang is the province with the largest outflow of virtual water and the outflow is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita water resources fluctuation guangdong is the province with the largest inflow and the inflow is more sensitive to the local per capita gdp fluctuation chinese mainland s grain virtual water flow pattern and trend will continue to exist in the future in addition to the endowment of water resources social and economic factors also need to be considered during the process of water resources management keywords virtual water drivers gravity model socio hydrology impulse response 1 introduction at different stages of the development of human society the human water relationship is undergoing constant changes with the continuous improvement of social productivity human demand for water resources has gradually expanded and the degree of development and utilization of water resources has also expanded manfreda 2013 zhou et al 2021 with the enhancement of the interaction between human and water hydrological system and human system gradually evolved into a coupling system it is difficult to give a comprehensive and reasonable explanation for many problems with the traditional hydrology theory in order to study the mutual feedback relationship and co evolution process of coupled human water system and to better cope with the challenges in the process of water resources utilization socio hydrology came into being sivapalan et al 2012 and professor sivapalan sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan et al 2014 defined socio hydrology as an application oriented discipline that considers the two way feedback mechanism of socio hydrology and strives to explain understand and analyze the hydrological cycle influenced by human activities traditional hydrology focuses on the primitive watershed to deepen the understanding of the characteristics and relationship of water cycle while socio hydrology aims to improve the understanding of the impact of human activities and development on the environment especially the water system brath et al 2006 distefano et al 2020a socio hydrology considers many social factors such as economy environment policy and consciousness qualitatively and quantitatively and then couples these social factors into the human water system to make them become the internal social driving force its purpose is to explore the mutual feedback mechanism between human and water so as to promote the comprehensive management of water resources and the sustainable development of society at present the research contents of socio hydrology mainly include 1 tradeoffs in human water coupling systems such as the watershed pendulum effect the direction of water use swings between agricultural irrigation and environmental protection that is seeking the maximization of socio economic and ecological benefits between agricultural economic development and water ecosystem health liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 2 the evaluation of benefit in water resources management limited water resources cannot fully meet the needs of all users which will lead to benefit conflicts among different users in the process of water resources utilization lanini et al 2004 savenije et al 2014 3 research on virtual water in human water coupling system the proposal of virtual water concept makes people realize that regional water resource crisis can be alleviated through inter regional trade which provides a new idea for the research on water resource security allan 1993 allan 1998 hoekstra and hung 2002 tuninetti et al 2017 in recent years hydrologists and social economists often found that they have studied the same system socio hydrological system from different locations because the hydrological system and the socio economic system interact with each other evolve together and they are more and more coupled together and regarded as a unified whole gradually m√ºller and levy 2019 virtual water flow is usually understood as the flow from humid regions to arid regions based on market forces and is interpreted as more efficient water use allan 1998 but there are exceptional phenomena in many places which may exacerbate regional water shortages sun et al 2019a so the virtual water flow between regions needs to be carefully considered before development as an important aspect of socio hydrology virtual water has received extensive attention in the academic field in recent years which broadens people s understanding of water resources and deepens the research of social water cycle the research shows that the amount of regional water is not the only factor driving the virtual water trade flow and the process of virtual water trade can be fully understood on the basis of comprehensive consideration of natural factors and social and economic factors dermody et al 2014 and wu et al 2019 pointed out that due to the availability of water resources and the changing world economy water resources management has become more uncertain so the research on the flow of virtual water needs to be combined with broader interdisciplinary approaches based on socio hydrology the main content of current virtual water research is the accounting of virtual water flow and the display of flow patterns zhao et al 2015 marston et al 2015 wang et al 2019 in addition there are a few studies on virtual water flow driving factors fracasso et al 2016 song et al 2020 virtual water flow impact assessment cui et al 2018 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 and virtual water flow prediction zhuo et al 2016 sartori et al 2017 many scholars have discussed the driving factors of virtual water flow including among countries around the world duarte et al 2016 cai et al 2019 used the multi regional input output model and structural decomposition analysis to evaluate the redistribution of water withdrawal within chinese mainland in 2002 2007 and 2012 and they found local efficiency gains and consumption pattern changes in other provinces were the main drivers for changes in virtual water flows huang et al 2021 obtained the current situation of inter provincial virtual water flow with the estimation of crop related provincial virtual water balances and the research results show that agricultural infrastructure has a greater driving force of virtual water flow in addition the research on driving factors also includes the discussion on the influencing factors of virtual water flow between a region and its trading partners haddad et al 2020 the analysis of driving forces of virtual water flow among regions within a certain range oreggioni et al 2021 and review related to virtual water odey et al 2021 sun et al 2021 tinbergen 1962 and poyhonen 1963 were the first to apply gravity model to the study of trade between regions analyze or predict the trade potential of a certain industry and explain many factors that affect the trade volume between countries or regions they think that the trade volume mainly depends on the economic scale of two regions and the geographic distance between two regions compared with other research methods relevant studies show that gravity model can accurately restore network structure and generate lower relative errors relatively distefano et al 2020b as for the driving factors of international virtual water flow the researches show that population gdp and geographical distance are the main driving factors of virtual water flow and the trend of virtual water trade will continue to grow globally tamea et al 2014 konapala and mishra 2020 sun et al 2019b believed that the regional socio economic pattern and its evolution in china would affect the grain virtual flow pattern so the virtual flow would exert huge pressure on the water resources in the virtual water export area at present there are a large number of relevant studies on the current situation of virtual water flow between provinces in china huang et al 2021 but there are relatively few in depth studies and based on this we have carried out relevant studies behind the rapid development of the regional economy whether the use of water resources is sustainable requires the attention of relevant researches and organizations based on existing related researches it mostly quantifies the virtual water flow between regions or within a certain river basin based on this this study takes grain virtual water in 31 provinces of mainland china as the research object in terms of the methodology based on the quantification of grain virtual water this study combined the trade gravity model with impulse response and analyzed the response trajectory of grain virtual water flow dependent variable under the error impact of other driving factors endogenous variables on the basis of clarifying the driving force of each driving factor as for the innovation of this study and the contribution to this academic area it comprehensively analyzes the driving effects of social and economic factors such as population industrial structure natural resource endowment and grain production scale on grain virtual water flow from the perspective of socio hydrology and based on the theory of resource economics and econometric methods trade gravity model and impulse response the influence of virtual water flow on agricultural sustainable production and its response characteristics to social and economic factors are discussed the research has certain references and innovations which can provide relevant basis for the protection of regional water resources and coordinated development of various industries as well as insights for decision makers in relevant fields 2 materials and methods based on socio economic data natural resource data and geographic distance data this study firstly calculated the flow status of grain virtual water in chinese mainland then based on the existing research the trade gravity model was constructed and the simulation results the driving direction and strength of driving factors on inter provincial grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland were obtained by using the relevant software eviews finally the impulse response function is used to analyze the response trajectory of grain virtual water flow dependent variable under the impact of error of other endogenous variables driving factors the following is the specific application process of the method fig 1 section 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 1 data the data used in this study include socioeconomic data natural resource data and meteorological data socioeconomic data gdp data yuan population data 104 persons per capita disposable income yuan and grain output per unit area kg ha were obtained fromnational bureau of statistics and china statistical yearbooks nbsc 1997 2014 natural resource data water resources water resources per capita m3 person grain virtual water 109 m3 and per capita cultivated land resources ha person were obtained from china water resources bulletin nwrc 1997 2014 and national bureau of statistics and china statistical yearbooks nbsc 1997 2014 the regional coverage of the above data both are 31 provinces in chinese mainland and the time coverage both are 1997 2014 paneldata geographic distance data km between regions were obtained from chinese software developer network csdn 2 2 accounting of grain virtual water flow since chinese mainland s grain self sufficiency rate is over 95 this paper does not consider chinese mainland s grain trade with other countries the calculation of virtual water considers both blue water irrigation water and green water effective rainfall needed during crop growth the grain virtual water flow for each province is calculated yearly as follows hoekstra and hung 2002 hoekstra et al 2011 sun et al 2019a 1 gfv g o i p i g o n p n where gfv is the net flow volume of grain for region i and a positive value indicates grain export while a negative value indicates grain import kg goi is the grain output of region i kg pi is the population of region i capita

related to the grain in region i a positive value indicating grain export and a negative value indicating import w f i p is the water footprint of grain production in region i m3 kg w f e p is the water footprint of grain production in the export areas m3 kg sun et al 2016 the specific values of the above parameters can be calculated by referring to reference sun et al 2019a 2 3 construction of extended trade gravity model based on socio hydrology based on current research status we selected some social and economic factors to analyze how they affect the grain virtual water flow among provinces in chinese mainland influenced by regional economy population and resource endowment provinces in chinese mainland play different roles in the national development process fig 1 for example heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia and huang huai hai region shandong henan anhui and jiangsu are dominated by agricultural production while the jing jin ji region beijing tianjin hebei and the southeast coastal regions are more economically developed as a result the grain output of some provinces cannot meet their own needs so inter regional grain transfer occurs and at the same time the water resources embedded in the grain virtual water are also transferred the grain outflow regions consume a lot of water resources in the process of grain production and the grain inflow regions use more local water resources for the development of other industries grain virtual water under human activities is affecting the water cycle in chinese mainland s water resources system and the flow and redistribution of water resources among regions will in turn affect regional socio economic development according to the comparison of calculation results we finally selected the linear trade gravity model to evaluate the driving factors we selected the relevant influencing factors of grain virtual water flow to establish a trade gravity model and used multiple regression analysis method to calculate the trade gravity model and then analyzed how economic factors affect grain virtual water flow among provinces of chinese mainland tinbergen 1962 and poyhonen 1963 were the first to apply the gravity model to the study of the trade volume between regions based on the relevant studies carried out and heilongjiang and guangdong are the two provinces with the largest outflow and inflow of grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland this study considers these two provinces in the evaluation of driving factors of virtual water flow and the error analysis of research results in view of the current research situation based on the determination of research objects and the fact that bilateral trade occurs between two provinces the quantitative analysis of driving factors of virtual water flow is taken into overall consideration that is the study is conducted based on relevant data of chinese provinces the basic form of the gravity model is as follows 4 t ij k m i m j d ij where k is a constant tij is the trade volume between two regions mi and mj are the economic scale of two regions which are usually measured by gdp dij is the distance between two regions in empirical tests equation 4 is often converted to equation 5 in linear form 5 t x Œ≤ Œµ the above formula is called the classic gravity model the explained variable t represents trade volume x is various factors that affect trade volume which contains three parts factors that affect the supply of traded products factors that affect the demand for traded products and factors that affect trade resistance or thrust Œ≤ is the coefficient vector Œµ is the error term Œµ n 0 œÉ 2 based on neoclassical growth theory solow 1956 output growth mainly comes from the input of production factors capital accumulation and technological progress then according to the relevant literature about socio hydrology and virtual water research wu et al 2019 we selected the amount of grain virtual water flow vwl m3 as the explained variable the explanatory variables included the per capita water resources wpc m3 person the per capita arable land resources lpc ha person grain yield per unit area gpa kg ha population pop 104 persons gdp per capita gpc yuan per capita disposable income of urban residents gni yuan and geographic distance dis km the panel data of 31 provincial administrative regions in chinese mainland for 18 years from 1997 to 2014 were collected on the basis of the basic gravity model we constructed the gravity model of driving factors of grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland by adding corresponding new variables identified above as follows 6 v w l i j t Œ± Œ≤ 1 w p c i t Œ≤ 2 w p c j t Œ≤ 3 l p c i t Œ≤ 4 l p c j t Œ≤ 5 g p a i t Œ≤ 6 g p a j t Œ≤ 7 p o p i t Œ≤ 8 p o p j t Œ≤ 9 g

error shock on the current and future of each endogenous variable in the vector autoregressive model var and can describe the dynamic interaction between variables more intuitively sims 1980 l√ºtkepohl 2010 before the impulse response function analysis a vector autoregression model should be established this paper took heilongjiang and guangdong province as the analysis objects and used the basic theory of impulse response to simulate the response trajectory of grain virtual water flow to the change shock of population pop gdp per capita gpc water resources per capita wpc and cultivated land per capita lpc we used eviews software to perform a data stationarity test augmented dickey fuller adf on lnvwl lnpop lngpc lnwpc and lnlpc the test results showed that the logarithmic

mainland this paper calculated the grain virtual water flow between provinces in chinese mainland from 1997 to 2014 and in this section we show the grain virtual water flow of each province in 1997 2005 and 2014 fig 2 from the perspective of spatial distribution the provinces with grain virtual water flow are mainly distributed in eastern chinese mainland and the western region is less involved the outflow areas of grain virtual water mainly include the northeast heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and the huang huai hai region the inflow areas of grain virtual water mainly include beijing tianjin and the southeast coastal areas shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong from 1997 and 2014 chinese mainland s inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 73 billion m3 to 124 64 billion m3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow the outflow rose from 23 42 billion m3 to 58 83 billion m3 followed by jilin inner mongolia and henan province guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water inflow the inflow increased from 13 42 billion m3 to 36 58 billion m3 during the study period followed by zhejiang fujian and shanghai in addition the roles of individual provinces changed during the study period such as liaoning which switched between export and import regions and jiangsu gradually changed from a grain virtual water outflow area to an inflow area 3 2 case study of grain virtual water flow heilongjiang and guangdong firstly heilongjiang and guangdong are provinces with relatively large grain virtual water outflow and inflow which are representative and referential in addition the method selected in this study trade gravity model cannot simultaneously analyze the driving factors of virtual water trade between 31 provinces and their trading partners based on one formula therefore after obtaining the current situation of grain virtual water flow among 31 provinces in chinese mainland this study analyzed the driving factors of grain virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong 3 2 1 grain virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong from 1997 to 2014 the quantity and direction of grain virtual water outflow in heilongjiang are shown in fig 3 the total quantity of grain virtual water outflow in heilongjiang increased from 24 36 billion m3 in 1997 to 56 62 billion m3 in 2014 heilongjiang s grain virtual water has flowed to 18 other provinces in chinese mainland and the inflow provinces are mainly distributed in jing jin ji region and the southeast coastal areas guangdong province has the largest amount of virtual water input and the amount of input increased from 3 79 billion m3 in 1997 to 18 11 billion m3 in 2013 other provinces that transferred relatively more grain virtual water from heilongjiang also include beijing shanghai zhejiang and fujian northwest regions such as shanxi gansu and qinghai and southwest regions such as guangxi chongqing and sichuan these regions have also transferred grain virtual water from heilongjiang but the amount is relatively small the source areas and quantity of grain virtual water inflow in guangdong province are shown in fig 4 the amount of grain virtual water inflow in guangdong province increased from 18 85 billion m3 in 1997 to 75 74 billion m3 in 2014 with a large increment and a fast growth rate there are a total of 14 provinces of guangdong s grain virtual water source regions these regions are mainly distributed in northeast china heilongjiang jilin north china inner mongolia hebei central china henan hubei hunan and east china shandong anhui jiangsu among them heilongjiang has the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow and the amount of virtual water output has increased from 3 79 billion m3 in 1997 to 18 11 billion m3 in 2013 the provinces with relatively higher outflow also include jilin inner mongolia henan anhui and jiangsu although western regions such as xinjiang ningxia and central china regions such as hubei and hunan also export grain virtual water to guangdong the amount is relatively small among them the amount of virtual water outflow of jiangsu hubei and hunan showed a decreasing trend year by year 3 2 2 estimation results of trade gravity model for heilongjiang and guangdong the estimation results of the trade gravity model of heilongjiang s grain virtual water outflow are shown in table 1 the estimation results show that the common variables used to evaluate the influencing factors of grain virtual water trade also have significant explanatory power in the mixed gravity model we established and with the increase in the number of explanatory variables the degree of explanation of the model is also higher and the value of r2 increased from 0 58 to 0 65 the estimation results show that the population per capita gdp and per capita disposable income in the areas with virtual water inflow have a significant positive driving effect on grain virtual water flow which are all in confidence interval of 99 this means that with the further increase of the population and gdp of the grain input areas the amount of grain virtual water flow will further increase the distance between the input and output provinces with virtual water flow is not a factor that restricts grain transfer areas with large populations and relatively insufficient grain can import grain from areas with more grain surpluses and use virtual water strategy to ensure effective local grain supply and water security factors that are negatively related to the amount of grain virtual water flow include heilongjiang s population per capita gdp and per capita disposable income as well as the per capita arable land resources and grain yield per unit area of areas with virtual water inflow among them heilongjiang s per capita gdp and per capita disposable income as well the grain yield per unit area of areas with virtual water inflow have more significant effects the estimation results of the trade gravity model of guangdong s grain virtual water inflow are shown in table 2 the estimation results show that the common variables used to evaluate the influencing factors of grain virtual water trade also have significant explanatory power in the mixed gravity model we established and with the increase in the number of explanatory variables the degree of explanation of the model is also higher and the value of r2 increased from 0 85 to 0 88 the estimation results show that guangdong s population per capita disposable income and virtual water outflow provinces per capita water resources as well as the per capita arable land resources and grain output per unit area have a significant positive driving effect on bilateral virtual water flow among them variables are all in confidence interval of 99 except for guangdong s per capita disposable income this means that with the further increase of guangdong s population and the amount of water and land resources in the provinces with virtual water outflow the amount of grain virtual water input in guangdong will further increase similar to the estimation result of heilongjiang the geographic distance between the bilateral regions that generate virtual water flow is not a factor that restricts the virtual water flow factors that are negatively related to the amount of grain virtual water flow between guangdong and other provinces include population per capita disposable income of the exporting provinces and the amount of water and land resources in guangdong among them with the exception of the per capita disposable income of the exporting province the effects of other variables are more significant this shows that with the increase in the population of the exporting provinces and the amount of water and land resources in guangdong the quantity of virtual water inflow in guangdong will decrease 3 3 analysis of virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong the research results show that the grain virtual water output increases year by year under the condition that interannualvariation of the total amount of water resources in heilongjiang didn t change much in 2008 and 2011 heilongjiang s grain virtual water output accounted for 89 3 and 78 1 of its total water resources respectively therefore if this trend continues heilongjiang s water resources security will be threatened seriously fig 5 heilongjiang s grain yield has ranked first in chinese mainland for many years even though heilongjiang s grain crop is only grown once a year because of its location and climate it still plays the biggest and irreplaceable role in ensuring chinese mainland s grain security the reason for heilongjiang s high grain yield is that it has a large amount of black soil resources suitable for rice growth and the landform of heilongjiang is mostly plain which is convenient for the development of mechanized agriculture in addition compared with southern china heilongjiang has a large area with sparse population and its per capita grain yield is high therefore it will transfer grain to other provinces in chinese mainland while meeting its own grain needs at present the momentum of heilongjiang s virtual water outflow has not weakened combined with the implementation of strategy of revitalizing northeast china in recent years except for agricultural water consumption the water consumption of other industries in heilongjiang such as petrochemicals will also increase further it will undoubtedly further aggravate heilongjiang s water shortage problem and threaten the security of local ecological environment therefore chinese mainland should consider the use of water resources physical virtual water overall planning when implementing important national development strategies and ensure the security of resources and environment while vigorously developing the economy guangdong province the province with the largest amount of virtual water input in chinese mainland has different situations from that of heilongjiang the total amount of water resources in guangdong is much larger than that of heilongjiang almost twice that of heilongjiang even with abundant water resources the amount of virtual water input in guangdong is still increasing year by year since china s reform and opening up the market economy has gradually replaced the planned economy and driven by profit maximization guangdong s grain production has gradually lost its comparative advantage in addition due to the adjustment of the agricultural production structure guangdong s agricultural resources have been continuously transferred and the scale of grain production has been shrunk however guangdong is the most populous province in chinese mainland so it has to import grain from other provinces to ensure its own grain security therefore from the perspective of national level a country should overall plan the production roles of various regions to ensure the security of regional resources and environment from a regional perspective guangdong is rich in water resources and can try to change its industrial structure to achieve self supply of grain not only heilongjiang and guangdong but all provinces should appropriately adjust industrial structure and rationally implement virtual water strategies according to their own situation of socio economic and resource endowments 4 discussion 4 1 error shock analysis of influencing factors based on impulse response function besides analyzing the influencing factors of the grain virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong from the perspective of supply and demand with trade gravity model we also used the impulse response function to further analyze the response trajectory of the virtual water flow to the change shock of each endogenous variable for heilongjiang fig 6 the fluctuation range of its grain virtual water output was approximately between 0 04 and 0 04 after making a shock on various influencing factors in the current period the virtual water output of heilongjiang is the most sensitive to the shock of per capita water resources and showed positive fluctuation in the first period the shock of population and per capita water resources have a greater impact on heilongjiang s virtual water output while the impact of cultivated land resources is small the influence of each variable on the virtual water output tends to zero after the 10th period indicating that heilongjiang s grain virtual water output is less restricted by local social economy and natural resources and its virtual water output phenomenon will continue to exist in the future for guangdong fig 7 the fluctuation range of its grain virtual water output was approximately between 0 1 and 0 1 after making a shock on various influencing factors in current period indicating that grain virtual water flow in guangdong is more susceptible than that in heilongjiang guangdong s virtual water input is more sensitive to the shock of local gdp and water resources the fluctuation lasts for a long time and tends to be stable after the 20th period and the effect is zero no matter in heilongjiang or guangdong the fluctuation of the amount of grain virtual water flow caused by the shock of social economy and resource endowment eventually tends to zero which further indicates that the pattern and trend of grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland will continue to exist note the solid line represents the impulse response function and the dashed line represents the deviation band of double plus minus standard deviation the horizontal axis represents the number of lag periods years of the shock effect and the vertical axis represents the response of the virtual water flow taking guangdong as an example fig 8 the industrial structure of guangdong changed significantly from 1997 to 2014 for the proportion of output of the three major industries the proportion of output of the primary industry agriculture gradually decreased while the tertiary industry increased significantly the change of industrial structure led to the reduction of the scale of agricultural production in guangdong the sown area of grain decreased from 3 429 million hectares in 1997 to 2 507 million hectares in 2014 then the grain yield also decreased significantly from 1 968 million tons to 13 573 million tons the grain yield decreased significantly while the population increased gradually so the self sufficiency rate of grain in guangdong constantly decreased and the supply and demand of grain gradually became out of balance therefore guangdong needs to transfer grain from other provinces to meet its own grain demand as a result the amount of grain virtual water inflow also increased year by year from 18 85 billion m3 in 1997 to 75 74 billion m3 in 2014 4 2 relevant regional development suggestions in terms of water resource the interregional grain virtual water flow realizes the strong coupling between grain producing regions and distant consumers the trans regional flow of grain virtual water not only promotes the secondary allocation of water resources but also affects the reallocation of land resources labor resources and ecological resources meanwhile a large number of labor and capital factors are transferred to the developed import regions with the industrial development which further increases the grain consumption demand in the developed regions it is not difficult to find that the grain virtual water flow between chinese provinces has become a common phenomenon and the amount of flow is increasing it is worth noting that chinese mainland s existing virtual water flow pattern is from north to south while the distribution pattern of water resources is roughly more in the south and less in the north so the water resources pressure of virtual water outflow areas may be aggravated and cause an unsustainable situation of water resources utilization it is unrealistic to immediately change the current grain virtual water flow pattern in chinese mainland but exploring the driving factors of its flow can provide a reference for the adjustments of future flow patterns the development proposals are as follows 1 in terms of water resource utilization the quantity of output areas will promote the flow of grain virtual water while the input areas will do the opposite grain is a water intensive product so the output areas should take their own water resources endowment into full consideration when exporting grain at the same time it is imperative to improve the efficiency of water resource utilization 2 in terms of interregional coordinated development water rich areas should increase investment in agricultural production factors water and arable land resources increase investment in agricultural science and technology improve the level of agricultural production and provide guarantee for meeting their own grain needs and alleviating the pressure of water resources in water poor areas 3 in the adjustment of industrial structure we should fully recognize our own ecological environment and resource endowment so as to realize efficient allocation of natural resources among different industrial sectors 4 in terms of relevant policy decisions firstly the necessity and feasibility of chinese mainland s implementation of interregional virtual water strategy should be considered then further improve policies and measures such as grain subsidies agricultural water prices ecological compensation and grain strategic projects appropriately participate in the international virtual water trade according to the domestic and international situation 4 3 study s limitations and directions for future research there are some limitations in this study the first is the dependent variable the acquisition of the amount of virtual water flow the research object of this paper is chinese mainland s inter provincial grain virtual water flow due to data limitations the way to obtain the amount of virtual water flow mainly depends on the method of social justice law based on the population of each province rather than the real inter regional grain transportation data therefore the research results may have a certain degree of error in addition in the trade gravity model institutional factors have always been regarded as important driving forces of commercial transactions such as product prices and trade agreements which are not considered in this study due to data limitations in many studies on the influencing factors of virtual water flow socio economic factors such as population and economic development level are usually considered as the main influencing factors tamea et al 2014 sun et al 2019b qian et al 2019 and it is similar to the results of this paper cai et al 2020 thought that compared with water resources the impact of regional land resources on agricultural virtual water flow in chinese mainland is more significant this conclusion can be used for virtual water inflow provinces but it may not be applicable to all regions therefore further research about the impact of resource endowment on agricultural virtual flow is needed to be carried out further in addition with regard to the important factor of geographic distance compared with many studies on influencing factors of global agricultural virtual water flow fracasso et al 2016 duarte et al 2019 the result of our study is contrary to the results of those studies it does not hinder the grain virtual water flow between chinese provinces therefore in the analysis of agricultural virtual water flow it is necessary to further discuss and study whether to select influencing factors according to the selected research area finally the future development direction is to further strengthen the combination of socio hydrology and virtual water flow and explore the driving factors and sustainability of virtual water flow based on socio hydrology to the maximum extent 5 conclusions in the case of imbalanced grain supply and demand in chinese mainland water resources embedded in the grain flow with the transportation of grain during the study period 1997 2014 the quantity of inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased year by year the total amount increased from 73 billion m3 to 124 64 billion m3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow increasing from 24 36 billion m3 to 57 14 billion m3 guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water inflow increasing from 18 85 billion m3 to 78 79 billion m3 in terms of the driving factors of grain virtual water flow the per capita water resources per capita cultivated land resources per unit area grain yield in the outflow areas and the population as well as the per capita gdp and per capita disposable income of urban residents in the inflow areas have a positive driving effect on the grain virtual water flow between regions among these influencing factors the promotion effect of per unit area grain yield in the outflow areas and population in the inflow areas is the most significant the negative effect of population in the outflow areas and per unit area grain yield in the inflow areas is the most obvious the amount of grain virtual water outflow in heilongjiang is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita water resources fluctuation and the amount of grain virtual water inflow in guangdong is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita gdp fluctuation chinese mainland s inter provincial grain virtual water flow pattern and trend will continue to exist in the future in the process of water resources management in addition to water resources social and economic factors need to be considered appropriately attached table the names of various regions in chinese mainland and their

3633,to ensure regional grain security the grain is transferred from grain surplus provinces to grain deficient provinces in china then water embedded in grain virtual water flows accordingly which promotes the spatial redistribution of water resources to explore the influencing factors of virtual water flow this study first obtained the inter provincial virtual water flow pattern and then constructed a virtual water flow trade gravity model based on socio hydrology theory and estimated the model with multiple regression methods and the impulse response function was used to analyze the response trajectory of virtual water flow under the shock of other endogenous variable fluctuation the results show that from 1997 to 2014 the quantity of inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 73 billion m3to 124 64 billion m3 the positive driving effect of the population and per capita gdp in virtual water inflow areas is significant and the negative suppression effect of the grain output per unit in inflow areas and the population in outflow areas is significant heilongjiang is the province with the largest outflow of virtual water and the outflow is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita water resources fluctuation guangdong is the province with the largest inflow and the inflow is more sensitive to the local per capita gdp fluctuation chinese mainland s grain virtual water flow pattern and trend will continue to exist in the future in addition to the endowment of water resources social and economic factors also need to be considered during the process of water resources management keywords virtual water drivers gravity model socio hydrology impulse response 1 introduction at different stages of the development of human society the human water relationship is undergoing constant changes with the continuous improvement of social productivity human demand for water resources has gradually expanded and the degree of development and utilization of water resources has also expanded manfreda 2013 zhou et al 2021 with the enhancement of the interaction between human and water hydrological system and human system gradually evolved into a coupling system it is difficult to give a comprehensive and reasonable explanation for many problems with the traditional hydrology theory in order to study the mutual feedback relationship and co evolution process of coupled human water system and to better cope with the challenges in the process of water resources utilization socio hydrology came into being sivapalan et al 2012 and professor sivapalan sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan et al 2014 defined socio hydrology as an application oriented discipline that considers the two way feedback mechanism of socio hydrology and strives to explain understand and analyze the hydrological cycle influenced by human activities traditional hydrology focuses on the primitive watershed to deepen the understanding of the characteristics and relationship of water cycle while socio hydrology aims to improve the understanding of the impact of human activities and development on the environment especially the water system brath et al 2006 distefano et al 2020a socio hydrology considers many social factors such as economy environment policy and consciousness qualitatively and quantitatively and then couples these social factors into the human water system to make them become the internal social driving force its purpose is to explore the mutual feedback mechanism between human and water so as to promote the comprehensive management of water resources and the sustainable development of society at present the research contents of socio hydrology mainly include 1 tradeoffs in human water coupling systems such as the watershed pendulum effect the direction of water use swings between agricultural irrigation and environmental protection that is seeking the maximization of socio economic and ecological benefits between agricultural economic development and water ecosystem health liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 2 the evaluation of benefit in water resources management limited water resources cannot fully meet the needs of all users which will lead to benefit conflicts among different users in the process of water resources utilization lanini et al 2004 savenije et al 2014 3 research on virtual water in human water coupling system the proposal of virtual water concept makes people realize that regional water resource crisis can be alleviated through inter regional trade which provides a new idea for the research on water resource security allan 1993 allan 1998 hoekstra and hung 2002 tuninetti et al 2017 in recent years hydrologists and social economists often found that they have studied the same system socio hydrological system from different locations because the hydrological system and the socio economic system interact with each other evolve together and they are more and more coupled together and regarded as a unified whole gradually m√ºller and levy 2019 virtual water flow is usually understood as the flow from humid regions to arid regions based on market forces and is interpreted as more efficient water use allan 1998 but there are exceptional phenomena in many places which may exacerbate regional water shortages sun et al 2019a so the virtual water flow between regions needs to be carefully considered before development as an important aspect of socio hydrology virtual water has received extensive attention in the academic field in recent years which broadens people s understanding of water resources and deepens the research of social water cycle the research shows that the amount of regional water is not the only factor driving the virtual water trade flow and the process of virtual water trade can be fully understood on the basis of comprehensive consideration of natural factors and social and economic factors dermody et al 2014 and wu et al 2019 pointed out that due to the availability of water resources and the changing world economy water resources management has become more uncertain so the research on the flow of virtual water needs to be combined with broader interdisciplinary approaches based on socio hydrology the main content of current virtual water research is the accounting of virtual water flow and the display of flow patterns zhao et al 2015 marston et al 2015 wang et al 2019 in addition there are a few studies on virtual water flow driving factors fracasso et al 2016 song et al 2020 virtual water flow impact assessment cui et al 2018 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 and virtual water flow prediction zhuo et al 2016 sartori et al 2017 many scholars have discussed the driving factors of virtual water flow including among countries around the world duarte et al 2016 cai et al 2019 used the multi regional input output model and structural decomposition analysis to evaluate the redistribution of water withdrawal within chinese mainland in 2002 2007 and 2012 and they found local efficiency gains and consumption pattern changes in other provinces were the main drivers for changes in virtual water flows huang et al 2021 obtained the current situation of inter provincial virtual water flow with the estimation of crop related provincial virtual water balances and the research results show that agricultural infrastructure has a greater driving force of virtual water flow in addition the research on driving factors also includes the discussion on the influencing factors of virtual water flow between a region and its trading partners haddad et al 2020 the analysis of driving forces of virtual water flow among regions within a certain range oreggioni et al 2021 and review related to virtual water odey et al 2021 sun et al 2021 tinbergen 1962 and poyhonen 1963 were the first to apply gravity model to the study of trade between regions analyze or predict the trade potential of a certain industry and explain many factors that affect the trade volume between countries or regions they think that the trade volume mainly depends on the economic scale of two regions and the geographic distance between two regions compared with other research methods relevant studies show that gravity model can accurately restore network structure and generate lower relative errors relatively distefano et al 2020b as for the driving factors of international virtual water flow the researches show that population gdp and geographical distance are the main driving factors of virtual water flow and the trend of virtual water trade will continue to grow globally tamea et al 2014 konapala and mishra 2020 sun et al 2019b believed that the regional socio economic pattern and its evolution in china would affect the grain virtual flow pattern so the virtual flow would exert huge pressure on the water resources in the virtual water export area at present there are a large number of relevant studies on the current situation of virtual water flow between provinces in china huang et al 2021 but there are relatively few in depth studies and based on this we have carried out relevant studies behind the rapid development of the regional economy whether the use of water resources is sustainable requires the attention of relevant researches and organizations based on existing related researches it mostly quantifies the virtual water flow between regions or within a certain river basin based on this this study takes grain virtual water in 31 provinces of mainland china as the research object in terms of the methodology based on the quantification of grain virtual water this study combined the trade gravity model with impulse response and analyzed the response trajectory of grain virtual water flow dependent variable under the error impact of other driving factors endogenous variables on the basis of clarifying the driving force of each driving factor as for the innovation of this study and the contribution to this academic area it comprehensively analyzes the driving effects of social and economic factors such as population industrial structure natural resource endowment and grain production scale on grain virtual water flow from the perspective of socio hydrology and based on the theory of resource economics and econometric methods trade gravity model and impulse response the influence of virtual water flow on agricultural sustainable production and its response characteristics to social and economic factors are discussed the research has certain references and innovations which can provide relevant basis for the protection of regional water resources and coordinated development of various industries as well as insights for decision makers in relevant fields 2 materials and methods based on socio economic data natural resource data and geographic distance data this study firstly calculated the flow status of grain virtual water in chinese mainland then based on the existing research the trade gravity model was constructed and the simulation results the driving direction and strength of driving factors on inter provincial grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland were obtained by using the relevant software eviews finally the impulse response function is used to analyze the response trajectory of grain virtual water flow dependent variable under the impact of error of other endogenous variables driving factors the following is the specific application process of the method fig 1 section 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 1 data the data used in this study include socioeconomic data natural resource data and meteorological data socioeconomic data gdp data yuan population data 104 persons per capita disposable income yuan and grain output per unit area kg ha were obtained fromnational bureau of statistics and china statistical yearbooks nbsc 1997 2014 natural resource data water resources water resources per capita m3 person grain virtual water 109 m3 and per capita cultivated land resources ha person were obtained from china water resources bulletin nwrc 1997 2014 and national bureau of statistics and china statistical yearbooks nbsc 1997 2014 the regional coverage of the above data both are 31 provinces in chinese mainland and the time coverage both are 1997 2014 paneldata geographic distance data km between regions were obtained from chinese software developer network csdn 2 2 accounting of grain virtual water flow since chinese mainland s grain self sufficiency rate is over 95 this paper does not consider chinese mainland s grain trade with other countries the calculation of virtual water considers both blue water irrigation water and green water effective rainfall needed during crop growth the grain virtual water flow for each province is calculated yearly as follows hoekstra and hung 2002 hoekstra et al 2011 sun et al 2019a 1 gfv g o i p i g o n p n where gfv is the net flow volume of grain for region i and a positive value indicates grain export while a negative value indicates grain import kg goi is the grain output of region i kg pi is the population of region i capita

related to the grain in region i a positive value indicating grain export and a negative value indicating import w f i p is the water footprint of grain production in region i m3 kg w f e p is the water footprint of grain production in the export areas m3 kg sun et al 2016 the specific values of the above parameters can be calculated by referring to reference sun et al 2019a 2 3 construction of extended trade gravity model based on socio hydrology based on current research status we selected some social and economic factors to analyze how they affect the grain virtual water flow among provinces in chinese mainland influenced by regional economy population and resource endowment provinces in chinese mainland play different roles in the national development process fig 1 for example heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia and huang huai hai region shandong henan anhui and jiangsu are dominated by agricultural production while the jing jin ji region beijing tianjin hebei and the southeast coastal regions are more economically developed as a result the grain output of some provinces cannot meet their own needs so inter regional grain transfer occurs and at the same time the water resources embedded in the grain virtual water are also transferred the grain outflow regions consume a lot of water resources in the process of grain production and the grain inflow regions use more local water resources for the development of other industries grain virtual water under human activities is affecting the water cycle in chinese mainland s water resources system and the flow and redistribution of water resources among regions will in turn affect regional socio economic development according to the comparison of calculation results we finally selected the linear trade gravity model to evaluate the driving factors we selected the relevant influencing factors of grain virtual water flow to establish a trade gravity model and used multiple regression analysis method to calculate the trade gravity model and then analyzed how economic factors affect grain virtual water flow among provinces of chinese mainland tinbergen 1962 and poyhonen 1963 were the first to apply the gravity model to the study of the trade volume between regions based on the relevant studies carried out and heilongjiang and guangdong are the two provinces with the largest outflow and inflow of grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland this study considers these two provinces in the evaluation of driving factors of virtual water flow and the error analysis of research results in view of the current research situation based on the determination of research objects and the fact that bilateral trade occurs between two provinces the quantitative analysis of driving factors of virtual water flow is taken into overall consideration that is the study is conducted based on relevant data of chinese provinces the basic form of the gravity model is as follows 4 t ij k m i m j d ij where k is a constant tij is the trade volume between two regions mi and mj are the economic scale of two regions which are usually measured by gdp dij is the distance between two regions in empirical tests equation 4 is often converted to equation 5 in linear form 5 t x Œ≤ Œµ the above formula is called the classic gravity model the explained variable t represents trade volume x is various factors that affect trade volume which contains three parts factors that affect the supply of traded products factors that affect the demand for traded products and factors that affect trade resistance or thrust Œ≤ is the coefficient vector Œµ is the error term Œµ n 0 œÉ 2 based on neoclassical growth theory solow 1956 output growth mainly comes from the input of production factors capital accumulation and technological progress then according to the relevant literature about socio hydrology and virtual water research wu et al 2019 we selected the amount of grain virtual water flow vwl m3 as the explained variable the explanatory variables included the per capita water resources wpc m3 person the per capita arable land resources lpc ha person grain yield per unit area gpa kg ha population pop 104 persons gdp per capita gpc yuan per capita disposable income of urban residents gni yuan and geographic distance dis km the panel data of 31 provincial administrative regions in chinese mainland for 18 years from 1997 to 2014 were collected on the basis of the basic gravity model we constructed the gravity model of driving factors of grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland by adding corresponding new variables identified above as follows 6 v w l i j t Œ± Œ≤ 1 w p c i t Œ≤ 2 w p c j t Œ≤ 3 l p c i t Œ≤ 4 l p c j t Œ≤ 5 g p a i t Œ≤ 6 g p a j t Œ≤ 7 p o p i t Œ≤ 8 p o p j t Œ≤ 9 g

error shock on the current and future of each endogenous variable in the vector autoregressive model var and can describe the dynamic interaction between variables more intuitively sims 1980 l√ºtkepohl 2010 before the impulse response function analysis a vector autoregression model should be established this paper took heilongjiang and guangdong province as the analysis objects and used the basic theory of impulse response to simulate the response trajectory of grain virtual water flow to the change shock of population pop gdp per capita gpc water resources per capita wpc and cultivated land per capita lpc we used eviews software to perform a data stationarity test augmented dickey fuller adf on lnvwl lnpop lngpc lnwpc and lnlpc the test results showed that the logarithmic

mainland this paper calculated the grain virtual water flow between provinces in chinese mainland from 1997 to 2014 and in this section we show the grain virtual water flow of each province in 1997 2005 and 2014 fig 2 from the perspective of spatial distribution the provinces with grain virtual water flow are mainly distributed in eastern chinese mainland and the western region is less involved the outflow areas of grain virtual water mainly include the northeast heilongjiang jilin and inner mongolia and the huang huai hai region the inflow areas of grain virtual water mainly include beijing tianjin and the southeast coastal areas shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong from 1997 and 2014 chinese mainland s inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 73 billion m3 to 124 64 billion m3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow the outflow rose from 23 42 billion m3 to 58 83 billion m3 followed by jilin inner mongolia and henan province guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water inflow the inflow increased from 13 42 billion m3 to 36 58 billion m3 during the study period followed by zhejiang fujian and shanghai in addition the roles of individual provinces changed during the study period such as liaoning which switched between export and import regions and jiangsu gradually changed from a grain virtual water outflow area to an inflow area 3 2 case study of grain virtual water flow heilongjiang and guangdong firstly heilongjiang and guangdong are provinces with relatively large grain virtual water outflow and inflow which are representative and referential in addition the method selected in this study trade gravity model cannot simultaneously analyze the driving factors of virtual water trade between 31 provinces and their trading partners based on one formula therefore after obtaining the current situation of grain virtual water flow among 31 provinces in chinese mainland this study analyzed the driving factors of grain virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong 3 2 1 grain virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong from 1997 to 2014 the quantity and direction of grain virtual water outflow in heilongjiang are shown in fig 3 the total quantity of grain virtual water outflow in heilongjiang increased from 24 36 billion m3 in 1997 to 56 62 billion m3 in 2014 heilongjiang s grain virtual water has flowed to 18 other provinces in chinese mainland and the inflow provinces are mainly distributed in jing jin ji region and the southeast coastal areas guangdong province has the largest amount of virtual water input and the amount of input increased from 3 79 billion m3 in 1997 to 18 11 billion m3 in 2013 other provinces that transferred relatively more grain virtual water from heilongjiang also include beijing shanghai zhejiang and fujian northwest regions such as shanxi gansu and qinghai and southwest regions such as guangxi chongqing and sichuan these regions have also transferred grain virtual water from heilongjiang but the amount is relatively small the source areas and quantity of grain virtual water inflow in guangdong province are shown in fig 4 the amount of grain virtual water inflow in guangdong province increased from 18 85 billion m3 in 1997 to 75 74 billion m3 in 2014 with a large increment and a fast growth rate there are a total of 14 provinces of guangdong s grain virtual water source regions these regions are mainly distributed in northeast china heilongjiang jilin north china inner mongolia hebei central china henan hubei hunan and east china shandong anhui jiangsu among them heilongjiang has the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow and the amount of virtual water output has increased from 3 79 billion m3 in 1997 to 18 11 billion m3 in 2013 the provinces with relatively higher outflow also include jilin inner mongolia henan anhui and jiangsu although western regions such as xinjiang ningxia and central china regions such as hubei and hunan also export grain virtual water to guangdong the amount is relatively small among them the amount of virtual water outflow of jiangsu hubei and hunan showed a decreasing trend year by year 3 2 2 estimation results of trade gravity model for heilongjiang and guangdong the estimation results of the trade gravity model of heilongjiang s grain virtual water outflow are shown in table 1 the estimation results show that the common variables used to evaluate the influencing factors of grain virtual water trade also have significant explanatory power in the mixed gravity model we established and with the increase in the number of explanatory variables the degree of explanation of the model is also higher and the value of r2 increased from 0 58 to 0 65 the estimation results show that the population per capita gdp and per capita disposable income in the areas with virtual water inflow have a significant positive driving effect on grain virtual water flow which are all in confidence interval of 99 this means that with the further increase of the population and gdp of the grain input areas the amount of grain virtual water flow will further increase the distance between the input and output provinces with virtual water flow is not a factor that restricts grain transfer areas with large populations and relatively insufficient grain can import grain from areas with more grain surpluses and use virtual water strategy to ensure effective local grain supply and water security factors that are negatively related to the amount of grain virtual water flow include heilongjiang s population per capita gdp and per capita disposable income as well as the per capita arable land resources and grain yield per unit area of areas with virtual water inflow among them heilongjiang s per capita gdp and per capita disposable income as well the grain yield per unit area of areas with virtual water inflow have more significant effects the estimation results of the trade gravity model of guangdong s grain virtual water inflow are shown in table 2 the estimation results show that the common variables used to evaluate the influencing factors of grain virtual water trade also have significant explanatory power in the mixed gravity model we established and with the increase in the number of explanatory variables the degree of explanation of the model is also higher and the value of r2 increased from 0 85 to 0 88 the estimation results show that guangdong s population per capita disposable income and virtual water outflow provinces per capita water resources as well as the per capita arable land resources and grain output per unit area have a significant positive driving effect on bilateral virtual water flow among them variables are all in confidence interval of 99 except for guangdong s per capita disposable income this means that with the further increase of guangdong s population and the amount of water and land resources in the provinces with virtual water outflow the amount of grain virtual water input in guangdong will further increase similar to the estimation result of heilongjiang the geographic distance between the bilateral regions that generate virtual water flow is not a factor that restricts the virtual water flow factors that are negatively related to the amount of grain virtual water flow between guangdong and other provinces include population per capita disposable income of the exporting provinces and the amount of water and land resources in guangdong among them with the exception of the per capita disposable income of the exporting province the effects of other variables are more significant this shows that with the increase in the population of the exporting provinces and the amount of water and land resources in guangdong the quantity of virtual water inflow in guangdong will decrease 3 3 analysis of virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong the research results show that the grain virtual water output increases year by year under the condition that interannualvariation of the total amount of water resources in heilongjiang didn t change much in 2008 and 2011 heilongjiang s grain virtual water output accounted for 89 3 and 78 1 of its total water resources respectively therefore if this trend continues heilongjiang s water resources security will be threatened seriously fig 5 heilongjiang s grain yield has ranked first in chinese mainland for many years even though heilongjiang s grain crop is only grown once a year because of its location and climate it still plays the biggest and irreplaceable role in ensuring chinese mainland s grain security the reason for heilongjiang s high grain yield is that it has a large amount of black soil resources suitable for rice growth and the landform of heilongjiang is mostly plain which is convenient for the development of mechanized agriculture in addition compared with southern china heilongjiang has a large area with sparse population and its per capita grain yield is high therefore it will transfer grain to other provinces in chinese mainland while meeting its own grain needs at present the momentum of heilongjiang s virtual water outflow has not weakened combined with the implementation of strategy of revitalizing northeast china in recent years except for agricultural water consumption the water consumption of other industries in heilongjiang such as petrochemicals will also increase further it will undoubtedly further aggravate heilongjiang s water shortage problem and threaten the security of local ecological environment therefore chinese mainland should consider the use of water resources physical virtual water overall planning when implementing important national development strategies and ensure the security of resources and environment while vigorously developing the economy guangdong province the province with the largest amount of virtual water input in chinese mainland has different situations from that of heilongjiang the total amount of water resources in guangdong is much larger than that of heilongjiang almost twice that of heilongjiang even with abundant water resources the amount of virtual water input in guangdong is still increasing year by year since china s reform and opening up the market economy has gradually replaced the planned economy and driven by profit maximization guangdong s grain production has gradually lost its comparative advantage in addition due to the adjustment of the agricultural production structure guangdong s agricultural resources have been continuously transferred and the scale of grain production has been shrunk however guangdong is the most populous province in chinese mainland so it has to import grain from other provinces to ensure its own grain security therefore from the perspective of national level a country should overall plan the production roles of various regions to ensure the security of regional resources and environment from a regional perspective guangdong is rich in water resources and can try to change its industrial structure to achieve self supply of grain not only heilongjiang and guangdong but all provinces should appropriately adjust industrial structure and rationally implement virtual water strategies according to their own situation of socio economic and resource endowments 4 discussion 4 1 error shock analysis of influencing factors based on impulse response function besides analyzing the influencing factors of the grain virtual water flow in heilongjiang and guangdong from the perspective of supply and demand with trade gravity model we also used the impulse response function to further analyze the response trajectory of the virtual water flow to the change shock of each endogenous variable for heilongjiang fig 6 the fluctuation range of its grain virtual water output was approximately between 0 04 and 0 04 after making a shock on various influencing factors in the current period the virtual water output of heilongjiang is the most sensitive to the shock of per capita water resources and showed positive fluctuation in the first period the shock of population and per capita water resources have a greater impact on heilongjiang s virtual water output while the impact of cultivated land resources is small the influence of each variable on the virtual water output tends to zero after the 10th period indicating that heilongjiang s grain virtual water output is less restricted by local social economy and natural resources and its virtual water output phenomenon will continue to exist in the future for guangdong fig 7 the fluctuation range of its grain virtual water output was approximately between 0 1 and 0 1 after making a shock on various influencing factors in current period indicating that grain virtual water flow in guangdong is more susceptible than that in heilongjiang guangdong s virtual water input is more sensitive to the shock of local gdp and water resources the fluctuation lasts for a long time and tends to be stable after the 20th period and the effect is zero no matter in heilongjiang or guangdong the fluctuation of the amount of grain virtual water flow caused by the shock of social economy and resource endowment eventually tends to zero which further indicates that the pattern and trend of grain virtual water flow in chinese mainland will continue to exist note the solid line represents the impulse response function and the dashed line represents the deviation band of double plus minus standard deviation the horizontal axis represents the number of lag periods years of the shock effect and the vertical axis represents the response of the virtual water flow taking guangdong as an example fig 8 the industrial structure of guangdong changed significantly from 1997 to 2014 for the proportion of output of the three major industries the proportion of output of the primary industry agriculture gradually decreased while the tertiary industry increased significantly the change of industrial structure led to the reduction of the scale of agricultural production in guangdong the sown area of grain decreased from 3 429 million hectares in 1997 to 2 507 million hectares in 2014 then the grain yield also decreased significantly from 1 968 million tons to 13 573 million tons the grain yield decreased significantly while the population increased gradually so the self sufficiency rate of grain in guangdong constantly decreased and the supply and demand of grain gradually became out of balance therefore guangdong needs to transfer grain from other provinces to meet its own grain demand as a result the amount of grain virtual water inflow also increased year by year from 18 85 billion m3 in 1997 to 75 74 billion m3 in 2014 4 2 relevant regional development suggestions in terms of water resource the interregional grain virtual water flow realizes the strong coupling between grain producing regions and distant consumers the trans regional flow of grain virtual water not only promotes the secondary allocation of water resources but also affects the reallocation of land resources labor resources and ecological resources meanwhile a large number of labor and capital factors are transferred to the developed import regions with the industrial development which further increases the grain consumption demand in the developed regions it is not difficult to find that the grain virtual water flow between chinese provinces has become a common phenomenon and the amount of flow is increasing it is worth noting that chinese mainland s existing virtual water flow pattern is from north to south while the distribution pattern of water resources is roughly more in the south and less in the north so the water resources pressure of virtual water outflow areas may be aggravated and cause an unsustainable situation of water resources utilization it is unrealistic to immediately change the current grain virtual water flow pattern in chinese mainland but exploring the driving factors of its flow can provide a reference for the adjustments of future flow patterns the development proposals are as follows 1 in terms of water resource utilization the quantity of output areas will promote the flow of grain virtual water while the input areas will do the opposite grain is a water intensive product so the output areas should take their own water resources endowment into full consideration when exporting grain at the same time it is imperative to improve the efficiency of water resource utilization 2 in terms of interregional coordinated development water rich areas should increase investment in agricultural production factors water and arable land resources increase investment in agricultural science and technology improve the level of agricultural production and provide guarantee for meeting their own grain needs and alleviating the pressure of water resources in water poor areas 3 in the adjustment of industrial structure we should fully recognize our own ecological environment and resource endowment so as to realize efficient allocation of natural resources among different industrial sectors 4 in terms of relevant policy decisions firstly the necessity and feasibility of chinese mainland s implementation of interregional virtual water strategy should be considered then further improve policies and measures such as grain subsidies agricultural water prices ecological compensation and grain strategic projects appropriately participate in the international virtual water trade according to the domestic and international situation 4 3 study s limitations and directions for future research there are some limitations in this study the first is the dependent variable the acquisition of the amount of virtual water flow the research object of this paper is chinese mainland s inter provincial grain virtual water flow due to data limitations the way to obtain the amount of virtual water flow mainly depends on the method of social justice law based on the population of each province rather than the real inter regional grain transportation data therefore the research results may have a certain degree of error in addition in the trade gravity model institutional factors have always been regarded as important driving forces of commercial transactions such as product prices and trade agreements which are not considered in this study due to data limitations in many studies on the influencing factors of virtual water flow socio economic factors such as population and economic development level are usually considered as the main influencing factors tamea et al 2014 sun et al 2019b qian et al 2019 and it is similar to the results of this paper cai et al 2020 thought that compared with water resources the impact of regional land resources on agricultural virtual water flow in chinese mainland is more significant this conclusion can be used for virtual water inflow provinces but it may not be applicable to all regions therefore further research about the impact of resource endowment on agricultural virtual flow is needed to be carried out further in addition with regard to the important factor of geographic distance compared with many studies on influencing factors of global agricultural virtual water flow fracasso et al 2016 duarte et al 2019 the result of our study is contrary to the results of those studies it does not hinder the grain virtual water flow between chinese provinces therefore in the analysis of agricultural virtual water flow it is necessary to further discuss and study whether to select influencing factors according to the selected research area finally the future development direction is to further strengthen the combination of socio hydrology and virtual water flow and explore the driving factors and sustainability of virtual water flow based on socio hydrology to the maximum extent 5 conclusions in the case of imbalanced grain supply and demand in chinese mainland water resources embedded in the grain flow with the transportation of grain during the study period 1997 2014 the quantity of inter provincial grain virtual water flow increased year by year the total amount increased from 73 billion m3 to 124 64 billion m3 heilongjiang is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water outflow increasing from 24 36 billion m3 to 57 14 billion m3 guangdong is the province with the largest amount of grain virtual water inflow increasing from 18 85 billion m3 to 78 79 billion m3 in terms of the driving factors of grain virtual water flow the per capita water resources per capita cultivated land resources per unit area grain yield in the outflow areas and the population as well as the per capita gdp and per capita disposable income of urban residents in the inflow areas have a positive driving effect on the grain virtual water flow between regions among these influencing factors the promotion effect of per unit area grain yield in the outflow areas and population in the inflow areas is the most significant the negative effect of population in the outflow areas and per unit area grain yield in the inflow areas is the most obvious the amount of grain virtual water outflow in heilongjiang is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita water resources fluctuation and the amount of grain virtual water inflow in guangdong is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita gdp fluctuation chinese mainland s inter provincial grain virtual water flow pattern and trend will continue to exist in the future in the process of water resources management in addition to water resources social and economic factors need to be considered appropriately attached table the names of various regions in chinese mainland and their

3634,soil water and salt movement in freezing thawing periods play an important role in the agricultural ecological environment field experiments show a non synchronized movement of soil water and salt during the freezing thawing period with no definite mechanism in this study the non synchronization of water and salt movement in the frozen layer 0 1 m was analyzed from the perspective of soil salt composition combining with the convection diffusion theory field experiments were carried out during two freezing thawing periods from 2017 to 2019 in yonglian experimental station of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china the contents of soil moisture salt and its components na k ca mg co3 hco3 cl and so4 were measured the correlation analysis between storage increments of total salt and its components was carried out and the frezchem model was used to calculate the soluble and solid salt components during the freezing period the soil water storage increased by 5 42 on average while the soil salt storage decreased by 18 69 showing the different migration directions of soil water and salt the migration direction of each component of salt was not exactly the same with that of the total salt the main components causing the storage increment of soil salt were different in the three saline soils the solute concentration gradient of soluble salt reached 3 07 mol l m which caused stronger diffusion effect to result in downward salt migration while the convection effect drove the soil water and salt to move upwards this is the major reason for the non synchronization movement of soil water and salt during the freezing thawing period this study provides new data and perspective to understand the soil water and salt movement during the freezing thawing period in agricultural areas with shallow groundwater table depth keywords chemical components soil salt non synchronization movement of soil water and salt freezing thawing period frezchem 1 introduction soil freezing and thawing is a complex process accompanied by the migration and phase change of water and solute and the transfer of soil heat bing et al 2015 j√∫nior et al 2006 qi et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 soil freezing and thawing cycle has significant impacts on the engineering constructions in cold regions wang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2019 fuel or pollutants storage heiderscheidt et al 2020 soil remediation kim et al 2018 kreyling et al 2010 as well as the hydrological cycle dai et al 2019 koren et al 2014 wright and novakowski 2020 causing soil erosion ban et al 2017a ban et al 2017b and salinization wu et al 2018 seasonally frozen soil is widely distributed in north china accounting for 53 5 of the total land area xu and wang 2001 where arid and semi arid climate with low rainfall and high evaporation leads farmland to be vulnerable to salinization wu et al 2019 the study site hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china is a typical seasonally frozen soil area and is also located in arid region since the 1980 s the hetao irrigation district has adopted the autumn irrigation to leach soil salt out after harvest in october feng et al 2005 li et al 2012 followed by the freezing thawing period shallow groundwater table depth 0 5 to 1 5 m after the autumn irrigation event guo et al 2013 wu et al 2016 causes intense water and salt exchange between the vadose zone and the aquifer the freezing and thawing process affects the hydrothermal cycle and solute transport resulting in water and salt redistribution during the overwintering period chen et al 2013 hou et al 2020 zhang and wang 2001 the mechanism of water and salt exchange under the freezing condition is different from that in other periods ireson et al 2013 therefore it is important to study the soil water and salt movement in seasonally frozen soils for the agro ecological environment protection and water resources management brouchkov 2000 iwata et al 2010 yi et al 2014 yu et al 2020 many researches have been carried out to investigate the migration mechanism of soil water and its impact during the freezing process by carrying out the laboratory and field experiments or the numerical simulations ferguson et al 1964 gray et al 1985 tang et al 2019 wan et al 2021 wen et al 2012 xu et al 2018 the results show that a large amount of water migrates to the ice surface and the flux is mainly affected by soil moisture content soil texture and groundwater table depth hou et al 2019 nagare et al 2012 watanabe et al 2011 the direction of water migration in the freezing process is relatively identical to the soil water migrates from the unfrozen area to the frozen area causing the increase of soil moisture content in the frozen area the migration mechanism of soil salt is more complex than the soil water movement during the freezing period hu and wang 2021 liu et al 2021 ma et al 2019 sarsembayeva and collins 2017 wan et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 some researchers found the soil salt in the frozen layer accumulates during the freezing process by laboratory and field experiments for example the freezing tests in laboratory showed that soil salt continued to migrate upward and accumulate in the frozen layer of soil wan et al 2019 a similar phenomenon of the soil salt concentration increase after freezing was found in laboratory tests of open and closed systems zhang et al 2017 believed to be caused by the upward flow of liquid water from the unfrozen soil to the frozen soil another test on the sandy loam of songnen plain in the northeast china revealed increase in the surface soil salt with the freezing time increase hou et al 2020 however the opposite phenomenon of that the salt content decrease with the increase of water content in the frozen layer representing a downward movement was also found bing et al 2015 conducted unidirectional freezing experiments in the plexiglass cylinder with red silty clay soil and found that the total soil salinity in the frozen area changed little while the soil moisture content increased a lot baker and osterkamp 1989 carried out a downward freezing test with the freezing rates ranging 1 20 mm d on the sand column saturated with sodium chloride solution it was found that the salt elimination in the frozen area increases with the slower freezing rate however an increase in the salinity of the unfrozen soil arenson et al 2005 also found that the reduction of soil salinity of the frozen area with a lower freezing rate was easier the solutes were difficult to be removed at a high freezing rate it can be concluded that there is no agreement concerning the migration of soil salt during the freezing period the law of salt migration is more complicated than that of water and the migration of water and salt is not synchronized during the freezing period during the thawing period it is generally believed that the strong soil evaporation reduces the soil moisture and drives soil salt to move upwards to the surface soil and then accumulate qin et al 2021 wang et al 2009 some studies explain the non synchronized movement of soil water and salt by distinguishing the two main ways of solute transport e g the convection and the diffusion effects e g liu et al 2021 during the solution freezing at the temperatures below the melting point and above the eutectic point soil salt is expelled from the ice crystal and enriched in the remaining unfrozen water to increase the soil salt concentration halde 1980 petrenko and whitworth 1999 shafique et al 2016 vrbka and jungwirth 2005 the faster freezing rate results in larger amounts of salt included in the ice crystal and causes smaller salt concentration of liquid water kadlec et al 1988 konrad and mccammon 1990 found that more than 90 of the solute precipitated from the ice when the cooling rate was lower than 0 1 day corresponding to the most freezing conditions in the field the concentration gradient between the frozen layer and the non frozen layer was then formed to drive solute to diffuse downwards while the soil salt migrated upwards under the convection effect ireson et al 2013 stahli and stadler 1997 since the two effects cause soil salt migrate in opposite directions leung and carmichael 1984 wu et al 2018 the final distribution of soil salt depends on the relative value of the two effects the soil salts measured by these experiments were the total salt contents of different phases while the salts in the liquid or solid phase cannot be distinguished quantitatively which is necessary for estimating the diffusion effect the various salt compositions own significant important impact on the phase of salts during the freezing period lin et al 2019 bing and ma 2011 carried out laboratory experiments to figure out the effect of salt components on the freezing point of saline soil it was found that the order of the effect of anions on the freezing point was cl co2 3 so2 4 and the order in cations was k na ca2 hanley and rao 1982 inferred that the cations would be preferentially excluded from the frozen area to the unfrozen part at the freezing front different kinds of salts have different cryohydric points for example the eutectic temperatures of na2so4 mgso4 and nacl are 1 2 4 8 and 21 2 respectively deng et al 2013 which means that at different temperatures the salts with higher eutectic temperature in the solution precipitate while the salts with lower eutectic point temperature exist in the solution the interaction among different solute components should be considered as the temperature changes ireson et al 2013 therefore the migration characteristics of various salt components in soil are not the same and it is important to study the migration direction and amount of soil salt in the process of freezing and thawing from the aspects of soil salt components and their migration directions cary and mayland 1972 used cacl2 and k2so4 solutions to infiltrate the portneuf silt loam a ca saturated soil columns and then carried out the freezing experiments the increase of salt concentration was observed in the cacl2 infiltrated group but distributions of k concentration and water content in k2so4 infiltrated group were totally different the researchers believed that this was caused by the exchange of ca and k in the soil to form the precipitation of calcium sulfate while k was absorbed by soil particles and cannot move with the liquid water cofie and pleysier 2004 jardine and sparks 1984 korolyuk 2014 detected a large accumulation of sulfates of magnesium calcium and sodium in the gley soil of the valley during the freezing period zhang et al 2019 found that the high valence cations adsorbed on the surface of clay particles were easily replaced by the sodium ion when they contacted with salt solution the concentration gradient the diffusion ability under the negative temperature gradient the change of solubility with temperature and the adsorption and exchange with soil of various salt components were different chuvilin 1999 jessen et al 2014 sarsembayeva and collins 2017 therefore the migration law of total salt depends on the migration amount of each salt component most of the above studies were carried out in laboratories by using one or two kinds of salts and few field experiments were carried out under natural soil and climate conditions to monitor all common soil components this paper aimed to analyze the non synchronization of soil water and salt movement in the frozen layer 0 1 m from the perspective of salt compositions and the convection diffusion mechanism field experiments were implemented during two freezing thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 the soil temperature soil frozen depth groundwater salinity and its compositions soil moisture soil salinity and salt chemical components na k ca mg co3 hco3 c1 and so4 were measured 10 times during two freezing thawing periods according to the monitoring data of soil salinity and its components the proportion and variability of each component were analyzed to determine the main salt components in the frozen soil the correlation analysis of storage increment of total salt and its components in different types of saline soil was carried out to evaluate the influence of each component on total salt the frezchem model was used to quantitatively calculate the solute concentration in soil solution and each precipitate content and then the salt components susceptible to precipitation and dissolution reaction were analyzed and the convection diffusion theory was used to qualitatively analyze the driving forces of salt migration 2 materials and methods in this part sections 2 1 and 2 2

irrigation is carried out in late october every year to leach soil salt out and maintain soil moisture for the spring sowing of the next year the soil is mainly clay and loam and the average bulk density of non frozen soil is 1 48 g cm3 affected by irrigation and the process of freezing and thawing the groundwater table depth varies between 0 5 and 2 2 m autumn irrigation causes the groundwater table level to rise then gradually fall back by the frozen process and rise again after the infiltration of melt water there are 5 groundwater monitoring wells numbered a c e g and h as shown in fig 1 c 2 2 sampling schemes and test methods the experiment was carried out between september 2017 and may 2019 including two freezing thawing periods the samples were collected 5 times

within the depth of 0 60 2 00 m was set as 0 20 m in each monitoring site three replicates were collected for average the depth of frozen soil was estimated according to the actual sampling situation the soil moisture content was measured by the oven drying method according to analysis methods of soil agrochemistry lu 2000 the soil soluble salt was extracted by 1 5 soil water ratio to determine

of soil temperature at different depths and the frozen depth changing with time during the monitoring period are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 in the middle of november the surface soil temperature dropped below 0 approaching the freezing point and the soil began to freeze on november 29 2018 and december 06 2017 the average maximum freezing depth of the soil at each monitoring point was about 0 18 m and 0 26 m after that the surface soil temperature continued to decline under the influence of atmospheric temperature and reached to be coldest in early february regardless of the impact of the short term extreme weather the minimum surface soil temperature was about minus 10 and the average maximum freezing depth of soil reached 0 85 m the average maximum freezing depth was 0 84 m on february 2 2018 and 0 86 m on february 15 2019 then the surface soil temperature gradually rose to above 0 in the middle of march when the surface soil began to melt in the middle and late march the frozen layer depth reached to be maximum with an average of 1 0 m when the lower boundary of the frozen layer developed to be the deepest the frozen layer began to thaw in both directions and all melted in late april and the final melting surface was located about 0 70 m to 0 90 m below the ground surface the profiles of soil temperature at each sampling time are shown in fig 4 the soil temperature gradient was quite different above the depth of 1 0 m and below the depth of 1 0 m the temperature gradient was always positive from during the freezing thawing periods within the depth of 1 0 2 0 m which meant that the temperature increased with the increase of the soil depth and the value gradually decreased with time ranging from 2 99 to 5 49 m the temperature profiles within the depth of 1 0 2 0 m from early february to middle march were nearly identical with very slight change however the temperature gradient within the depth of 0 1 0 m changed from positive to negative from late november to late april and the value gradually changed from 8 22 c m to 7 8 c m the average difference of maximum and minimum soil temperature within the depth of 1 0 m from early february to late march was 6 52 in summary the soil temperature gradient varied greatly within the depth of 1 0 m and the maximum soil freezing depth monitored was 1 0 m therefore the soil frozen layer depth was chosen as 1 0 m in the test area the monitoring period was divided into three periods according to the change of soil temperature freezing and thawing characteristics and sampling time as shown in table 1 before late november or early december is the non freezing period and then the soil began to freeze until the surface soil began to melt in early march therefore the end of november to middle february was regarded as the freezing period and the middle february to mid late april was regarded as the thawing period 3 2 salinization grades and types of saline soil the average values of the total soil salinity within the depth of 0 3 m and salt components in the frozen layer 0 1 m at each monitoring point during the two freezing and thawing periods are shown in table 2 the soil salinization grades were divided based on the soil salinity within the depth of 0 3 m as suggested by chen et al 2006 the soil salinity within the depth of 0 3 m of monitoring points a and h were 5 39 g kg and 2 06 g kg respectively indicating the intensely and moderately salinized soils and the values in c e and g points were 1 15 g kg 1 17 g kg and 1 36 g kg all indicating the slightly salinized soil in terms of salt composition the carbonate content in the soil of points c e and g was higher and the values of hco3 2co3 2so4 cl were 0 68 0 81 and 0 65 respectively the value of cl 2so4 in the soil of point a was equal to 1 00 indicating that chloride was relatively dominant while the ratio in the point h was 0 78 indicating that the sulfate was relatively dominant the types of saline soil in the test area were quite different from southeast to northwest the soil salinity in general decreased and the carbonate content increased according to the ratio of each anion content of water soluble salt wang 1993 there were three types of saline soils in this area point a was the sulfate chloride soil point h the chloride sulfate soil and points c e and g the sulfate soda soil the box diagram of groundwater ion concentration of each monitoring well from september 2017 to april 2019 is shown in fig 5 and the statistical data of ph salinity and ion concentration in groundwater are shown in table 3 the ph of groundwater varied from 7 44 to 8 11 with an average of 7 85 and a time variation coefficient of 2 63 which was relatively stable the groundwater salinity varied from 1 10 g l to 2 18 g l with an average value of 1 51 g l and a time variation coefficient of 23 01 among all ions the concentration of na was the highest with an average of 12 16 10 3 mol l followed by cl and hco 3 the values of these two ions were similar with average values of 8 53 10 3 and 7 63 10 3 mol l respectively the concentrations of mg2 so2 4 and ca2 were low with mean values of 3 28 10 3 3 10 10 3 and 2 33 10 3 mol l respectively among all ions na and cl fluctuated most over time with time variation coefficients of 37 70 and 33 12 while ca2 was relatively stable with the time variation coefficient of 15 53 which was smaller than other ions 3 3 profiles of soil water soil salt and soil salt components contents the profiles of average content of soil water soil salt and soil salt components na ca mg hco3 cl and so4 in the depth of 0 2 m of three types of saline soil during the freezing thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the statistical data and the coefficients of variation in time and space of soil water soil salt and soil salt components in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 4 the soil water contents in the frozen layer 0 1 m were similar in the two freezing thawing periods with the mean values of 42 47 and 42 24 respectively mainly affected by irrigation and freezing thawing processes the soil moisture content changed with time and the average variation coefficient was 11 46 however the spatial variation of soil moisture content was low with the average variation coefficient of 5 33 the soil salinity varied strongly during the two freezing thawing periods the average soil salinity in the frozen layer 0 1 m was 2 10 g kg in the first period while it was 1 56 g kg in the second period reducing by 0 54 g kg the difference was mainly reflected in the contents of na and cl by comparing the contents of salt components in the frozen soil it showed that na cl hco3 and so4 were the main components of soil salt with the mean contents of 19 78 10 3 11 34 10 3 8 16 10 3 and 5 80 10 3 mol kg in 2017 2018 and the mean contents of 12 19 10 3 6 08 10 3 6 75 10 3 and 5 30 10 3 mol kg in 2018 2019 this is basically consistent with the main ionic composition in groundwater the contents of ca and mg were low with an average of 2 87 10 3 mol kg which could be negligible when compared with other salt components according to the variation coefficients of soil salt and its components contents in time and space the variability in space the spatial variation coefficient was about 44 85 on average was higher than that in time the temporal variation coefficient was about 24 54 on average and the spatial distribution of soil salt is uneven among the soil salt components cl content fluctuated the most with time with an average time variation coefficient of 35 17 while hco3 content was relatively stable with an average time variation coefficient of 19 77 which was similar to the time variation coefficient of cl and hco3 in groundwater however the fluctuation degree of na content in the frozen soil with time was lower than the value in groundwater 3 4 soil water and salt storage and storage increment in the frozen layer 0 1 m the storage of soil water and salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m of the three types of saline soil at each sampling time are shown in fig 8 during the two monitoring periods the soil water storage increased during the non freezing period from late september to late november or early december due to irrigation and then changed slightly during the freezing period from late november or early december to mid february and then decreased during the thawing period from mid february to mid late april during the whole period the soil moisture in the frozen layer 0 1 m was replenished during the two monitoring periods the soil salt storage changed greatly during the non freezing period and then changed slightly during the freezing period and then increased during the thawing period the soil salt storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the whole freezing thawing period showed different trends indicating salt increased in the monitoring period of 2017 2018 and decreased in the monitoring period of 2018 2019 this difference was mainly caused by the change of salt in the non freezing period in the period of 2017 2018 the average soil salt storage of the frozen layer 0 1 m increased from 2 97 kg m2 to 4 57 kg m2 while it decreased from 3 45 kg m2 to 2 37 kg m2 on average in the period of 2018 2019 this may be caused by the lower atmospheric temperature after autumn irrigation in 2018 2019 resulting in smaller soil evaporation the average soil water storage of 0 1 m in 2017 2018 increased from 0 35 m to 0 43 m which meant the average water storage increased by 0 08 m which was 0 11 m in 2018 2019 the measured data showed that the groundwater table depth was 1 19 m on december 6 2017 and this value was 0 91 m on november 29 2018 although the irrigation time and water quantity of the two years being similar the evaporation after autumn irrigation in 2017 2018 was higher which led to more phreatic water evaporation supply and faster decline of groundwater level resulting in higher upward migration of groundwater salt to the unsaturated soil and an increase trend of soil salt the storage increments of soil water and soil salt in the three types of saline soil during the freezing and thawing periods in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in table 5 the soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m mostly showed the increasing trend during the freezing period and decreasing trend during the thawing period which increased and decreased by 1 47 10 2 m and 3 36 10 2 m respectively in 2017 2018 and increased and decreased by 2 09 10 2 m and 5 76 10 2 m respectively in 2018 2019 among them the increment of soil water storage in the sulfate chloride soil 4 21 10 2 m on average was higher than that in the other two types of soil 0 72 10 2 m and 0 41 10 2 m on average respectively the soil salt storage of the three saline soils in the frozen layer 0 1 m mostly showed the decreasing trend during the freezing period and increasing trend during the thawing period which decreased and increased by 1 26 kg m2 and 0 21 kg m2 respectively in 2017 2018 and decreased and increased by 0 23 kg m2 and 0 64 kg m2 respectively in 2018 2019 during the freezing period the increase of soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m was caused by higher negative soil water potential of the frozen soil driving the soil in the lower unfrozen layer to migrate to the upper frozen layer 0 1 m the experimental results showed that the soil water storage increased by 3 39 and 7 45 while the soil salt storage decreased by 27 57 and 9 80 respectively during the freezing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 indicating that the change rates of soil water and soil salt storage were not positively correlated this suggested that there was an inconsistency in the directions of soil water and salt movement during the freezing period and the movement of soil salt in the frozen soil was not only affected by the convection mechanism the similar inconsistency was also observed by other researchers in their experiments that the soil water content in the frozen area increased while the soil salinity remained basically unchanged or decreased gray and granger 1986 during the soil thawing period the soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m decreased because of the evaporation consumption of meltwater after the upper soil thawing and the upward migration of soil salt with water resulted in the accumulation of salt in the surface soil this phenomenon is identical to most other researches qin et al 2021 wang et al 2009 3 5 the storage and storage increment of major soil salt components in the frozen layer 0 1 m the storage of main soil salt components at each monitoring time are shown in fig 9 and the storage increment of main salt components na hco3 cl and so4 in the three types of saline soil during the freezing and thawing periods in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in table 5 the migration directions of salt components and total salt in all three types of saline soil in the freezing period and thawing period were quite different taking the sulfate chloride soil in the freezing thawing period of 2018 2019 as an example the storage of na cl and so4 decreased by 6 50 10 06 and 2 30 mol m2 respectively while the storage of hco3 increased by 1 88 mol m2 during the freezing period during the thawing period the total soil salt storage increased by 1 53 kg m2 and the storage of na cl and so4 increased by 24 44 15 79 and 9 25 mol m2 respectively while the storage of hco3 decreased by 2 12 mol m2 this indicated that the migration directions of na cl and so4 in the sulfate chloride soil during the freezing thawing period of 2018 2019 were identical with that of the total salt while the migration direction of hco3 was opposite to that of the total salt the different migration mechanisms were also observed by other researchers korolyuk 2014 observed the common soil salt components by field experiments and found that a large amount of caso4 mgso4 and na2so4 accumulated in the frozen soil during the freezing period while the chloride increment was much lower the experimental results of chuvilin 1999 showed that during the freezing process in the fine grained soil light metal ions such as sodium calcium and magnesium accumulated in the frozen part while the contents of copper and zinc remained basically unchanged in general understanding the different migration mechanisms of different soil salt components can help to predict the change of the total salt storage the correlation matrix between the soil salt storage increment and the storage change of the major components are shown in table 6 according to the correlation coefficients between different salt components the correlation degrees between na and cl na and so4 in the three types of saline soil were higher than that between na and hco3 the correlation coefficients between na and cl or so4 ranged from 0 847 to 0 937 p 0 01 in the sulfate chloride soil and the chloride sulfate soil showing a highly strong correlation while the values were 0 656 and 0 420 in the sulfate soda soil showing a strong correlation and a moderate correlation respectively the correlation coefficients between na and hco3 were 0 594 0 115 and 0 115 in the three types of saline soil respectively this was caused by the low solubility of the carbonate at the low temperature and it was easy to precipitate resulting in the stable hco3 storage this was consistent with the conclusion that hco3 owned the lowest spatiotemporal variation coefficient among all the components the storage increment of salt had high correlation with na cl and so4 in the sulfate chloride soil and chloride sulfate soil and the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0 811 in the sulfate soda soil there was a strong correlation between the storage increment of the total soil salt and na r 0 783 which may be caused by the higher quantity of na in this type of soil than cl and so4 and the influence on the change of total salt storage was also higher than those of other salt components the storage increment of the total soil salt and hco3 showed a high correlation only in the sulfate chloride soil r 0 681 while it was the weak correlation in the other two types of soil in conclusion the salt components that caused the change of soil salt storage are different in different types of saline soil in the sulfate chloride soil it was mainly depending on na cl so4 and hco3 in the chloride sulfate soil was mainly na cl and so4 while in the sulfate soda soil was mainly na in the study area 3 6 influence of the precipitation and dissolution on various salt components according to the calculation results of the chemical equilibrium of soil solution by the frezchem model each precipitate storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freezing and thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 were calculated as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 there were 6 kinds of salt precipitates that may exist in the soil they were caco3 calcite na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o camg co3 2 2h2o mgco3 and nahco3 nahco3 only appeared in the sulfite soda salinized soil during the freezing thawing period from 2017 to 2018 and the quantity was low with the maximum storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m of 0 00188 mol m2 which can be ignored the other 5 kinds of salt precipitates were analyzed below the changes of the salt precipitate storage with time were different the na2so4 10h2o content in the frozen layer 0 1 m was the highest when the soil temperature became to be the lowest in early to mid february with a maximum value of 11 2 mol m2 while its amount was very small at other sampling times the reason could be that the solubility of sodium sulfate is greatly affected by the temperature the solubility of na2so4 is 19 5 g at 20 while this value decreases to 4 5 g at 0 in addition the eutectic temperature of na2so4 in the sodium sulfate solution is 1 2 which means that na2so4 10h2o is easy to crystallize and precipitate in the freezing period therefore the amount of na2so4 10h2o at the lowest temperature was quite higher than those at other times due to the high content of na and so4 the na2so4 10h2o storage was also much higher than other precipitates in addition under the influence of low temperature the mgco3 storage increased significantly with the average value of 0 42 mol m2 and 0 68 mol m2 in early to mid february of the two years while the storage values at other sampling times were low with the highest value of 0 18 mol m2 the average storage of caso4 2h2o changed along the temperature as the temperature decreased the precipitate increased and as the temperature rose it gradually dissolved into the solution caco3 calcite and camg co3 2 2h2o were not sensitive to low negative temperature and no significant increase was observed when the temperature decreased the caco3 calcite storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m had different trends over time in various salinized soils the significant storage increment occurred at the beginning of the freezing period in 2017 2018 december 06 2017 and the initial period of thawing in 2018 2019 march 23 2019 in the chloride sulfate soil with the value of 2 34 mol m2 and 2 30 mol m2 respectively the camg co3 2 2h2o storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m at each sampling time was similar and changed slightly compared to other precipitates along time with the time variation coefficient of 23 2 on average in summary the soil precipitates during the freezing thawing period were mainly caco3 calcite na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o camg co3 2 2h2o and mgco3 the sodium sulfate was largely precipitated at the low temperature due to its solubility changed greatly with the temperature and the low eutectic temperature other precipitates are difficult to dissolve in water and the solubility varies little with the temperature among them mgco3 and caso4 2h2o were relatively affected more by the temperature so there were more precipitates at the low temperature while camg co3 2 2h2o was less affected therefore among the main salt components the migration of hco3 during each period was greatly affected by the precipitation and dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonates which was consistent with the above conclusion that the correlation between hco3 and the total salt storage increment was low while the amounts of precipitates related to so4 changed greatly in the freezing period 3 7 the convection diffusion mechanism of the salt transport in the frozen soil layer the average salt concentrations of soil solution in the frozen area and unfrozen area in the three types of saline soil at the beginning of freezing period late november or early december and at the end of the freezing period early or middle february calculated by the frezchem model are shown in table 7 the soil solution concentrations in the frozen area of three types of saline soil were very similar with the average deviation of 0 04 mol l when the soil temperature dropped slowly most salt was discharged from the ice crystals during the freezing process and accumulated in the liquid water with the very low content resulting in the saturation of salt concentration in the soil solution the profiles of the average soil solution concentration at the beginning of freezing period december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the end of the freezing period february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 and the end of the thawing period april 13 2018 and april 30 2019 are shown in fig 12 at the beginning of freezing period and at the end of the thawing period the depth of the frozen area were very samll even can be neglected and the soil solution concentration were close on november 29 2018 the soil was frozen for 0 1 m with the soil solution concentration in this range of 0 36 mol l while on april 30 2019 all frozen soil had melted and the soil solution concentration within 0 0 1 m was 0 35 mol l at the end of the freezing period significant difference of the soil solution concentration between the frozen area and the unfrozen area can be observed the soil solution concentrations in the frozen area and the bottom unfrozen area during the two monitoring periods were 1 167 0 212 mol l and 0 358 0 094 mol l respectively at the beginning of the freezing period and were 3 263 0 120 mol l and 2 317 0 096 mol l respectively at the end of the freezing period as shown in table 7 in the soil near the freezing front the convection makes the soil salt move upwards from the bottom unfrozen area to the frozen area while the concentration gradient of the soil liquid water between the frozen area and the unfrozen area drives the soil salt to migrate downwards it means that the convection and diffusion mechanisms make soil solutes move in the opposite direction and the final migration direction of soil salt would be determined by both of the convection and diffusion effects on november 29 2018 and december 6 2017 the absolute values of soil solution concentration gradient between the frozen and unfrozen area were 0 27 and 0 98 mol l m while on february 2 2018 and february 15 2019 they reached 3 07 and 2 17 mol l m respectively which would result in strong downward movement of soil salt during the freezing and thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 the soil water storage of the frozen layer 0 1 m increased while the salt storage decreased which indicated the fact that the migration amount to the unfrozen layer caused by the diffusion effect was higher than that into the frozen layer 0 1 m caused by the convection effect 4 conclusion in this paper field experiments were used to estimate the mechanism of non synchronization movement of soil water and salt during the freezing thawing period based on the analysis of soil salt chemical components the main salt components and its influence on total soil salt were evaluated the salt components susceptible to precipitation and dissolution reaction were analyzed and the convection diffusion theory was used to qualitatively analyze the driving forces of salt migration the main conclusions are as follows 1 during the soil freezing period soil water storage increases while soil salt storage decreases in the frozen layer indicating the non synchronous movement of soil water and salt 2 the main salt components causing the storage change of soil salt in different types of saline soil are diverse 3 the migration of soil salt during the freezing period is greatly affected by precipitation dissolution reaction those salt components with higher eutectic points are easily to crystallize and precipitate in the freezing period which could hinder the salt transport 4 the solute concentration of soil solution in frozen soil is much higher than that in unfrozen soil the diffusion effect caused by the concentration gradient is stronger than the convection effect to result in the decrease of

3634,soil water and salt movement in freezing thawing periods play an important role in the agricultural ecological environment field experiments show a non synchronized movement of soil water and salt during the freezing thawing period with no definite mechanism in this study the non synchronization of water and salt movement in the frozen layer 0 1 m was analyzed from the perspective of soil salt composition combining with the convection diffusion theory field experiments were carried out during two freezing thawing periods from 2017 to 2019 in yonglian experimental station of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china the contents of soil moisture salt and its components na k ca mg co3 hco3 cl and so4 were measured the correlation analysis between storage increments of total salt and its components was carried out and the frezchem model was used to calculate the soluble and solid salt components during the freezing period the soil water storage increased by 5 42 on average while the soil salt storage decreased by 18 69 showing the different migration directions of soil water and salt the migration direction of each component of salt was not exactly the same with that of the total salt the main components causing the storage increment of soil salt were different in the three saline soils the solute concentration gradient of soluble salt reached 3 07 mol l m which caused stronger diffusion effect to result in downward salt migration while the convection effect drove the soil water and salt to move upwards this is the major reason for the non synchronization movement of soil water and salt during the freezing thawing period this study provides new data and perspective to understand the soil water and salt movement during the freezing thawing period in agricultural areas with shallow groundwater table depth keywords chemical components soil salt non synchronization movement of soil water and salt freezing thawing period frezchem 1 introduction soil freezing and thawing is a complex process accompanied by the migration and phase change of water and solute and the transfer of soil heat bing et al 2015 j√∫nior et al 2006 qi et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 soil freezing and thawing cycle has significant impacts on the engineering constructions in cold regions wang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2019 fuel or pollutants storage heiderscheidt et al 2020 soil remediation kim et al 2018 kreyling et al 2010 as well as the hydrological cycle dai et al 2019 koren et al 2014 wright and novakowski 2020 causing soil erosion ban et al 2017a ban et al 2017b and salinization wu et al 2018 seasonally frozen soil is widely distributed in north china accounting for 53 5 of the total land area xu and wang 2001 where arid and semi arid climate with low rainfall and high evaporation leads farmland to be vulnerable to salinization wu et al 2019 the study site hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china is a typical seasonally frozen soil area and is also located in arid region since the 1980 s the hetao irrigation district has adopted the autumn irrigation to leach soil salt out after harvest in october feng et al 2005 li et al 2012 followed by the freezing thawing period shallow groundwater table depth 0 5 to 1 5 m after the autumn irrigation event guo et al 2013 wu et al 2016 causes intense water and salt exchange between the vadose zone and the aquifer the freezing and thawing process affects the hydrothermal cycle and solute transport resulting in water and salt redistribution during the overwintering period chen et al 2013 hou et al 2020 zhang and wang 2001 the mechanism of water and salt exchange under the freezing condition is different from that in other periods ireson et al 2013 therefore it is important to study the soil water and salt movement in seasonally frozen soils for the agro ecological environment protection and water resources management brouchkov 2000 iwata et al 2010 yi et al 2014 yu et al 2020 many researches have been carried out to investigate the migration mechanism of soil water and its impact during the freezing process by carrying out the laboratory and field experiments or the numerical simulations ferguson et al 1964 gray et al 1985 tang et al 2019 wan et al 2021 wen et al 2012 xu et al 2018 the results show that a large amount of water migrates to the ice surface and the flux is mainly affected by soil moisture content soil texture and groundwater table depth hou et al 2019 nagare et al 2012 watanabe et al 2011 the direction of water migration in the freezing process is relatively identical to the soil water migrates from the unfrozen area to the frozen area causing the increase of soil moisture content in the frozen area the migration mechanism of soil salt is more complex than the soil water movement during the freezing period hu and wang 2021 liu et al 2021 ma et al 2019 sarsembayeva and collins 2017 wan et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 some researchers found the soil salt in the frozen layer accumulates during the freezing process by laboratory and field experiments for example the freezing tests in laboratory showed that soil salt continued to migrate upward and accumulate in the frozen layer of soil wan et al 2019 a similar phenomenon of the soil salt concentration increase after freezing was found in laboratory tests of open and closed systems zhang et al 2017 believed to be caused by the upward flow of liquid water from the unfrozen soil to the frozen soil another test on the sandy loam of songnen plain in the northeast china revealed increase in the surface soil salt with the freezing time increase hou et al 2020 however the opposite phenomenon of that the salt content decrease with the increase of water content in the frozen layer representing a downward movement was also found bing et al 2015 conducted unidirectional freezing experiments in the plexiglass cylinder with red silty clay soil and found that the total soil salinity in the frozen area changed little while the soil moisture content increased a lot baker and osterkamp 1989 carried out a downward freezing test with the freezing rates ranging 1 20 mm d on the sand column saturated with sodium chloride solution it was found that the salt elimination in the frozen area increases with the slower freezing rate however an increase in the salinity of the unfrozen soil arenson et al 2005 also found that the reduction of soil salinity of the frozen area with a lower freezing rate was easier the solutes were difficult to be removed at a high freezing rate it can be concluded that there is no agreement concerning the migration of soil salt during the freezing period the law of salt migration is more complicated than that of water and the migration of water and salt is not synchronized during the freezing period during the thawing period it is generally believed that the strong soil evaporation reduces the soil moisture and drives soil salt to move upwards to the surface soil and then accumulate qin et al 2021 wang et al 2009 some studies explain the non synchronized movement of soil water and salt by distinguishing the two main ways of solute transport e g the convection and the diffusion effects e g liu et al 2021 during the solution freezing at the temperatures below the melting point and above the eutectic point soil salt is expelled from the ice crystal and enriched in the remaining unfrozen water to increase the soil salt concentration halde 1980 petrenko and whitworth 1999 shafique et al 2016 vrbka and jungwirth 2005 the faster freezing rate results in larger amounts of salt included in the ice crystal and causes smaller salt concentration of liquid water kadlec et al 1988 konrad and mccammon 1990 found that more than 90 of the solute precipitated from the ice when the cooling rate was lower than 0 1 day corresponding to the most freezing conditions in the field the concentration gradient between the frozen layer and the non frozen layer was then formed to drive solute to diffuse downwards while the soil salt migrated upwards under the convection effect ireson et al 2013 stahli and stadler 1997 since the two effects cause soil salt migrate in opposite directions leung and carmichael 1984 wu et al 2018 the final distribution of soil salt depends on the relative value of the two effects the soil salts measured by these experiments were the total salt contents of different phases while the salts in the liquid or solid phase cannot be distinguished quantitatively which is necessary for estimating the diffusion effect the various salt compositions own significant important impact on the phase of salts during the freezing period lin et al 2019 bing and ma 2011 carried out laboratory experiments to figure out the effect of salt components on the freezing point of saline soil it was found that the order of the effect of anions on the freezing point was cl co2 3 so2 4 and the order in cations was k na ca2 hanley and rao 1982 inferred that the cations would be preferentially excluded from the frozen area to the unfrozen part at the freezing front different kinds of salts have different cryohydric points for example the eutectic temperatures of na2so4 mgso4 and nacl are 1 2 4 8 and 21 2 respectively deng et al 2013 which means that at different temperatures the salts with higher eutectic temperature in the solution precipitate while the salts with lower eutectic point temperature exist in the solution the interaction among different solute components should be considered as the temperature changes ireson et al 2013 therefore the migration characteristics of various salt components in soil are not the same and it is important to study the migration direction and amount of soil salt in the process of freezing and thawing from the aspects of soil salt components and their migration directions cary and mayland 1972 used cacl2 and k2so4 solutions to infiltrate the portneuf silt loam a ca saturated soil columns and then carried out the freezing experiments the increase of salt concentration was observed in the cacl2 infiltrated group but distributions of k concentration and water content in k2so4 infiltrated group were totally different the researchers believed that this was caused by the exchange of ca and k in the soil to form the precipitation of calcium sulfate while k was absorbed by soil particles and cannot move with the liquid water cofie and pleysier 2004 jardine and sparks 1984 korolyuk 2014 detected a large accumulation of sulfates of magnesium calcium and sodium in the gley soil of the valley during the freezing period zhang et al 2019 found that the high valence cations adsorbed on the surface of clay particles were easily replaced by the sodium ion when they contacted with salt solution the concentration gradient the diffusion ability under the negative temperature gradient the change of solubility with temperature and the adsorption and exchange with soil of various salt components were different chuvilin 1999 jessen et al 2014 sarsembayeva and collins 2017 therefore the migration law of total salt depends on the migration amount of each salt component most of the above studies were carried out in laboratories by using one or two kinds of salts and few field experiments were carried out under natural soil and climate conditions to monitor all common soil components this paper aimed to analyze the non synchronization of soil water and salt movement in the frozen layer 0 1 m from the perspective of salt compositions and the convection diffusion mechanism field experiments were implemented during two freezing thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 the soil temperature soil frozen depth groundwater salinity and its compositions soil moisture soil salinity and salt chemical components na k ca mg co3 hco3 c1 and so4 were measured 10 times during two freezing thawing periods according to the monitoring data of soil salinity and its components the proportion and variability of each component were analyzed to determine the main salt components in the frozen soil the correlation analysis of storage increment of total salt and its components in different types of saline soil was carried out to evaluate the influence of each component on total salt the frezchem model was used to quantitatively calculate the solute concentration in soil solution and each precipitate content and then the salt components susceptible to precipitation and dissolution reaction were analyzed and the convection diffusion theory was used to qualitatively analyze the driving forces of salt migration 2 materials and methods in this part sections 2 1 and 2 2

density of non frozen soil is 1 48 g cm3 affected by irrigation and the process of freezing and thawing the groundwater table depth varies between 0 5 and 2 2 m autumn irrigation causes the groundwater table level to rise then gradually fall back by the frozen process and rise again after the infiltration of melt water there are 5 groundwater monitoring wells numbered a c e g and h as shown in fig 1 c 2 2 sampling schemes and test methods the experiment was carried out between september 2017 and may 2019 including two freezing thawing periods the samples were collected 5 times

coefficient cov x y is the covariance of x and y and var x and var y are the variances of x and y 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring results of soil temperature and the frozen depth the changes of soil temperature at different depths and the frozen depth changing with time during the monitoring period are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 in the middle of november the surface soil temperature dropped below 0 approaching the freezing point and the soil began to freeze on november 29 2018 and december 06 2017 the average maximum freezing depth of the soil at each monitoring point was about 0 18 m and 0 26 m after that the surface soil temperature continued to decline under the influence of atmospheric temperature and reached to be coldest in early february regardless of the impact of the short term extreme weather the minimum surface soil temperature was about minus 10 and the average maximum freezing depth of soil reached 0 85 m the average maximum freezing depth was 0 84 m on february 2 2018 and 0 86 m on february 15 2019 then the surface soil temperature gradually rose to above 0 in the middle of march when the surface soil began to melt in the middle and late march the frozen layer depth reached to be maximum with an average of 1 0 m when the lower boundary of the frozen layer developed to be the deepest the frozen layer began to thaw in both directions and all melted in late april and the final melting surface was located about 0 70 m to 0 90 m below the ground surface the profiles of soil temperature at each sampling time are shown in fig 4 the soil temperature gradient was quite different above the depth of 1 0 m and below the depth of 1 0 m the temperature gradient was always positive from during the freezing thawing periods within the depth of 1 0 2 0 m which meant that the temperature increased with the increase of the soil depth and the value gradually decreased with time ranging from 2 99 to 5 49 m the temperature profiles within the depth of 1 0 2 0 m from early february to middle march were nearly identical with very slight change however the temperature gradient within the depth of 0 1 0 m changed from positive to negative from late november to late april and the value gradually changed from 8 22 c m to 7 8 c m the average difference of maximum and minimum soil temperature within the depth of 1 0 m from early february to late march was 6 52 in summary the soil temperature gradient varied greatly within the depth of 1 0 m and the maximum soil freezing depth monitored was 1 0 m therefore the soil frozen layer depth was chosen as 1 0 m in the test area the monitoring period was divided into three periods according to the change of soil temperature freezing and thawing characteristics and sampling time as shown in table 1 before late november or early december is the non freezing period and then the soil began to freeze until the surface soil began to melt in early march therefore the end of november to middle february was regarded as the freezing period and the middle february to mid late april was regarded as the thawing period 3 2 salinization grades and types of saline soil the average values of the total soil salinity within the depth of 0 3 m and salt components in the frozen layer 0 1 m at each monitoring point during the two freezing and thawing periods are shown in table 2 the soil salinization grades were divided based on the soil salinity within the depth of 0 3 m as suggested by chen et al 2006 the soil salinity within the depth of 0 3 m of monitoring points a and h were 5 39 g kg and 2 06 g kg respectively indicating the intensely and moderately salinized soils and the values in c e and g points were 1 15 g kg 1 17 g kg and 1 36 g kg all indicating the slightly salinized soil in terms of salt composition the carbonate content in the soil of points c e and g was higher and the values of hco3 2co3 2so4 cl were 0 68 0 81 and 0 65 respectively the value of cl 2so4 in the soil of point a was equal to 1 00 indicating that chloride was relatively dominant while the ratio in the point h was 0 78 indicating that the sulfate was relatively dominant the types of saline soil in the test area were quite different from southeast to northwest the soil salinity in general decreased and the carbonate content increased according to the ratio of each anion content of water soluble salt wang 1993 there were three types of saline soils in this area point a was the sulfate chloride soil point h the chloride sulfate soil and points c e and g the sulfate soda soil the box diagram of groundwater ion concentration of each monitoring well from september 2017 to april 2019 is shown in fig 5 and the statistical data of ph salinity and ion concentration in groundwater are shown in table 3 the ph of groundwater varied from 7 44 to 8 11 with an average of 7 85 and a time variation coefficient of 2 63 which was relatively stable the groundwater salinity varied from 1 10 g l to 2 18 g l with an average value of 1 51 g l and a time variation coefficient of 23 01 among all ions the concentration of na was the highest with an average of 12 16 10 3 mol l followed by cl and hco 3 the values of these two ions were similar with average values of 8 53 10 3 and 7 63 10 3 mol l respectively the concentrations of mg2 so2 4 and ca2 were low with mean values of 3 28 10 3 3 10 10 3 and 2 33 10 3 mol l respectively among all ions na and cl fluctuated most over time with time variation coefficients of 37 70 and 33 12 while ca2 was relatively stable with the time variation coefficient of 15 53 which was smaller than other ions 3 3 profiles of soil water soil salt and soil salt components contents the profiles of average content of soil water soil salt and soil salt components na ca mg hco3 cl and so4 in the depth of 0 2 m of three types of saline soil during the freezing thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the statistical data and the coefficients of variation in time and space of soil water soil salt and soil salt components in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 4 the soil water contents in the frozen layer 0 1 m were similar in the two freezing thawing periods with the mean values of 42 47 and 42 24 respectively mainly affected by irrigation and freezing thawing processes the soil moisture content changed with time and the average variation coefficient was 11 46 however the spatial variation of soil moisture content was low with the average variation coefficient of 5 33 the soil salinity varied strongly during the two freezing thawing periods the average soil salinity in the frozen layer 0 1 m was 2 10 g kg in the first period while it was 1 56 g kg in the second period reducing by 0 54 g kg the difference was mainly reflected in the contents of na and cl by comparing the contents of salt components in the frozen soil it showed that na cl hco3 and so4 were the main components of soil salt with the mean contents of 19 78 10 3 11 34 10 3 8 16 10 3 and 5 80 10 3 mol kg in 2017 2018 and the mean contents of 12 19 10 3 6 08 10 3 6 75 10 3 and 5 30 10 3 mol kg in 2018 2019 this is basically consistent with the main ionic composition in groundwater the contents of ca and mg were low with an average of 2 87 10 3 mol kg which could be negligible when compared with other salt components according to the variation coefficients of soil salt and its components contents in time and space the variability in space the spatial variation coefficient was about 44 85 on average was higher than that in time the temporal variation coefficient was about 24 54 on average and the spatial distribution of soil salt is uneven among the soil salt components cl content fluctuated the most with time with an average time variation coefficient of 35 17 while hco3 content was relatively stable with an average time variation coefficient of 19 77 which was similar to the time variation coefficient of cl and hco3 in groundwater however the fluctuation degree of na content in the frozen soil with time was lower than the value in groundwater 3 4 soil water and salt storage and storage increment in the frozen layer 0 1 m the storage of soil water and salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m of the three types of saline soil at each sampling time are shown in fig 8 during the two monitoring periods the soil water storage increased during the non freezing period from late september to late november or early december due to irrigation and then changed slightly during the freezing period from late november or early december to mid february and then decreased during the thawing period from mid february to mid late april during the whole period the soil moisture in the frozen layer 0 1 m was replenished during the two monitoring periods the soil salt storage changed greatly during the non freezing period and then changed slightly during the freezing period and then increased during the thawing period the soil salt storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the whole freezing thawing period showed different trends indicating salt increased in the monitoring period of 2017 2018 and decreased in the monitoring period of 2018 2019 this difference was mainly caused by the change of salt in the non freezing period in the period of 2017 2018 the average soil salt storage of the frozen layer 0 1 m increased from 2 97 kg m2 to 4 57 kg m2 while it decreased from 3 45 kg m2 to 2 37 kg m2 on average in the period of 2018 2019 this may be caused by the lower atmospheric temperature after autumn irrigation in 2018 2019 resulting in smaller soil evaporation the average soil water storage of 0 1 m in 2017 2018 increased from 0 35 m to 0 43 m which meant the average water storage increased by 0 08 m which was 0 11 m in 2018 2019 the measured data showed that the groundwater table depth was 1 19 m on december 6 2017 and this value was 0 91 m on november 29 2018 although the irrigation time and water quantity of the two years being similar the evaporation after autumn irrigation in 2017 2018 was higher which led to more phreatic water evaporation supply and faster decline of groundwater level resulting in higher upward migration of groundwater salt to the unsaturated soil and an increase trend of soil salt the storage increments of soil water and soil salt in the three types of saline soil during the freezing and thawing periods in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in table 5 the soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m mostly showed the increasing trend during the freezing period and decreasing trend during the thawing period which increased and decreased by 1 47 10 2 m and 3 36 10 2 m respectively in 2017 2018 and increased and decreased by 2 09 10 2 m and 5 76 10 2 m respectively in 2018 2019 among them the increment of soil water storage in the sulfate chloride soil 4 21 10 2 m on average was higher than that in the other two types of soil 0 72 10 2 m and 0 41 10 2 m on average respectively the soil salt storage of the three saline soils in the frozen layer 0 1 m mostly showed the decreasing trend during the freezing period and increasing trend during the thawing period which decreased and increased by 1 26 kg m2 and 0 21 kg m2 respectively in 2017 2018 and decreased and increased by 0 23 kg m2 and 0 64 kg m2 respectively in 2018 2019 during the freezing period the increase of soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m was caused by higher negative soil water potential of the frozen soil driving the soil in the lower unfrozen layer to migrate to the upper frozen layer 0 1 m the experimental results showed that the soil water storage increased by 3 39 and 7 45 while the soil salt storage decreased by 27 57 and 9 80 respectively during the freezing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 indicating that the change rates of soil water and soil salt storage were not positively correlated this suggested that there was an inconsistency in the directions of soil water and salt movement during the freezing period and the movement of soil salt in the frozen soil was not only affected by the convection mechanism the similar inconsistency was also observed by other researchers in their experiments that the soil water content in the frozen area increased while the soil salinity remained basically unchanged or decreased gray and granger 1986 during the soil thawing period the soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m decreased because of the evaporation consumption of meltwater after the upper soil thawing and the upward migration of soil salt with water resulted in the accumulation of salt in the surface soil this phenomenon is identical to most other researches qin et al 2021 wang et al 2009 3 5 the storage and storage increment of major soil salt components in the frozen layer 0 1 m the storage of main soil salt components at each monitoring time are shown in fig 9 and the storage increment of main salt components na hco3 cl and so4 in the three types of saline soil during the freezing and thawing periods in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in table 5 the migration directions of salt components and total salt in all three types of saline soil in the freezing period and thawing period were quite different taking the sulfate chloride soil in the freezing thawing period of 2018 2019 as an example the storage of na cl and so4 decreased by 6 50 10 06 and 2 30 mol m2 respectively while the storage of hco3 increased by 1 88 mol m2 during the freezing period during the thawing period the total soil salt storage increased by 1 53 kg m2 and the storage of na cl and so4 increased by 24 44 15 79 and 9 25 mol m2 respectively while the storage of hco3 decreased by 2 12 mol m2 this indicated that the migration directions of na cl and so4 in the sulfate chloride soil during the freezing thawing period of 2018 2019 were identical with that of the total salt while the migration direction of hco3 was opposite to that of the total salt the different migration mechanisms were also observed by other researchers korolyuk 2014 observed the common soil salt components by field experiments and found that a large amount of caso4 mgso4 and na2so4 accumulated in the frozen soil during the freezing period while the chloride increment was much lower the experimental results of chuvilin 1999 showed that during the freezing process in the fine grained soil light metal ions such as sodium calcium and magnesium accumulated in the frozen part while the contents of copper and zinc remained basically unchanged in general understanding the different migration mechanisms of different soil salt components can help to predict the change of the total salt storage the correlation matrix between the soil salt storage increment and the storage change of the major components are shown in table 6 according to the correlation coefficients between different salt components the correlation degrees between na and cl na and so4 in the three types of saline soil were higher than that between na and hco3 the correlation coefficients between na and cl or so4 ranged from 0 847 to 0 937 p 0 01 in the sulfate chloride soil and the chloride sulfate soil showing a highly strong correlation while the values were 0 656 and 0 420 in the sulfate soda soil showing a strong correlation and a moderate correlation respectively the correlation coefficients between na and hco3 were 0 594 0 115 and 0 115 in the three types of saline soil respectively this was caused by the low solubility of the carbonate at the low temperature and it was easy to precipitate resulting in the stable hco3 storage this was consistent with the conclusion that hco3 owned the lowest spatiotemporal variation coefficient among all the components the storage increment of salt had high correlation with na cl and so4 in the sulfate chloride soil and chloride sulfate soil and the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0 811 in the sulfate soda soil there was a strong correlation between the storage increment of the total soil salt and na r 0 783 which may be caused by the higher quantity of na in this type of soil than cl and so4 and the influence on the change of total salt storage was also higher than those of other salt components the storage increment of the total soil salt and hco3 showed a high correlation only in the sulfate chloride soil r 0 681 while it was the weak correlation in the other two types of soil in conclusion the salt components that caused the change of soil salt storage are different in different types of saline soil in the sulfate chloride soil it was mainly depending on na cl so4 and hco3 in the chloride sulfate soil was mainly na cl and so4 while in the sulfate soda soil was mainly na in the study area 3 6 influence of the precipitation and dissolution on various salt components according to the calculation results of the chemical equilibrium of soil solution by the frezchem model each precipitate storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freezing and thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 were calculated as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 there were 6 kinds of salt precipitates that may exist in the soil they were caco3 calcite na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o camg co3 2 2h2o mgco3 and nahco3 nahco3 only appeared in the sulfite soda salinized soil during the freezing thawing period from 2017 to 2018 and the quantity was low with the maximum storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m of 0 00188 mol m2 which can be ignored the other 5 kinds of salt precipitates were analyzed below the changes of the salt precipitate storage with time were different the na2so4 10h2o content in the frozen layer 0 1 m was the highest when the soil temperature became to be the lowest in early to mid february with a maximum value of 11 2 mol m2 while its amount was very small at other sampling times the reason could be that the solubility of sodium sulfate is greatly affected by the temperature the solubility of na2so4 is 19 5 g at 20 while this value decreases to 4 5 g at 0 in addition the eutectic temperature of na2so4 in the sodium sulfate solution is 1 2 which means that na2so4 10h2o is easy to crystallize and precipitate in the freezing period therefore the amount of na2so4 10h2o at the lowest temperature was quite higher than those at other times due to the high content of na and so4 the na2so4 10h2o storage was also much higher than other precipitates in addition under the influence of low temperature the mgco3 storage increased significantly with the average value of 0 42 mol m2 and 0 68 mol m2 in early to mid february of the two years while the storage values at other sampling times were low with the highest value of 0 18 mol m2 the average storage of caso4 2h2o changed along the temperature as the temperature decreased the precipitate increased and as the temperature rose it gradually dissolved into the solution caco3 calcite and camg co3 2 2h2o were not sensitive to low negative temperature and no significant increase was observed when the temperature decreased the caco3 calcite storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m had different trends over time in various salinized soils the significant storage increment occurred at the beginning of the freezing period in 2017 2018 december 06 2017 and the initial period of thawing in 2018 2019 march 23 2019 in the chloride sulfate soil with the value of 2 34 mol m2 and 2 30 mol m2 respectively the camg co3 2 2h2o storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m at each sampling time was similar and changed slightly compared to other precipitates along time with the time variation coefficient of 23 2 on average in summary the soil precipitates during the freezing thawing period were mainly caco3 calcite na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o camg co3 2 2h2o and mgco3 the sodium sulfate was largely precipitated at the low temperature due to its solubility changed greatly with the temperature and the low eutectic temperature other precipitates are difficult to dissolve in water and the solubility varies little with the temperature among them mgco3 and caso4 2h2o were relatively affected more by the temperature so there were more precipitates at the low temperature while camg co3 2 2h2o was less affected therefore among the main salt components the migration of hco3 during each period was greatly affected by the precipitation and dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonates which was consistent with the above conclusion that the correlation between hco3 and the total salt storage increment was low while the amounts of precipitates related to so4 changed greatly in the freezing period 3 7 the convection diffusion mechanism of the salt transport in the frozen soil layer the average salt concentrations of soil solution in the frozen area and unfrozen area in the three types of saline soil at the beginning of freezing period late november or early december and at the end of the freezing period early or middle february calculated by the frezchem model are shown in table 7 the soil solution concentrations in the frozen area of three types of saline soil were very similar with the average deviation of 0 04 mol l when the soil temperature dropped slowly most salt was discharged from the ice crystals during the freezing process and accumulated in the liquid water with the very low content resulting in the saturation of salt concentration in the soil solution the profiles of the average soil solution concentration at the beginning of freezing period december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the end of the freezing period february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 and the end of the thawing period april 13 2018 and april 30 2019 are shown in fig 12 at the beginning of freezing period and at the end of the thawing period the depth of the frozen area were very samll even can be neglected and the soil solution concentration were close on november 29 2018 the soil was frozen for 0 1 m with the soil solution concentration in this range of 0 36 mol l while on april 30 2019 all frozen soil had melted and the soil solution concentration within 0 0 1 m was 0 35 mol l at the end of the freezing period significant difference of the soil solution concentration between the frozen area and the unfrozen area can be observed the soil solution concentrations in the frozen area and the bottom unfrozen area during the two monitoring periods were 1 167 0 212 mol l and 0 358 0 094 mol l respectively at the beginning of the freezing period and were 3 263 0 120 mol l and 2 317 0 096 mol l respectively at the end of the freezing period as shown in table 7 in the soil near the freezing front the convection makes the soil salt move upwards from the bottom unfrozen area to the frozen area while the concentration gradient of the soil liquid water between the frozen area and the unfrozen area drives the soil salt to migrate downwards it means that the convection and diffusion mechanisms make soil solutes move in the opposite direction and the final migration direction of soil salt would be determined by both of the convection and diffusion effects on november 29 2018 and december 6 2017 the absolute values of soil solution concentration gradient between the frozen and unfrozen area were 0 27 and 0 98 mol l m while on february 2 2018 and february 15 2019 they reached 3 07 and 2 17 mol l m respectively which would result in strong downward movement of soil salt during the freezing and thawing periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 the soil water storage of the frozen layer 0 1 m increased while the salt storage decreased which indicated the fact that the migration amount to the unfrozen layer caused by the diffusion effect was higher than that into the frozen layer 0 1 m caused by the convection effect 4 conclusion in this paper field experiments were used to estimate the mechanism of non synchronization movement of soil water and salt during the freezing thawing period based on the analysis of soil salt chemical components the main salt components and its influence on total soil salt were evaluated the salt components susceptible to precipitation and dissolution reaction were analyzed and the convection diffusion theory was used to qualitatively analyze the driving forces of salt migration the main conclusions are as follows 1 during the soil freezing period soil water storage increases while soil salt storage decreases in the frozen layer indicating the non synchronous movement of soil water and salt 2 the main salt components causing the storage change of soil salt in different types of saline soil are diverse 3 the migration of soil salt during the freezing period is greatly affected by precipitation dissolution reaction those salt components with higher eutectic points are easily to crystallize and precipitate in the freezing period which could hinder the salt transport 4 the solute concentration of soil solution in frozen soil is much higher than that in unfrozen soil the diffusion effect caused by the concentration gradient is stronger than the convection effect to result in the decrease of soil salt storage in frozen layer credit authorship contribution statement mengqin wang conceptualization methodology investigation validation writing original draft yan zhu methodology investigation
