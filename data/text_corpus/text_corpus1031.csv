5155,water storage dynamics modulate fluxes within catchments control the rainfall runoff response and regulate the velocity of water particles through mixing associated processes tracer aided models are useful tools for tracking the interactions between catchment storage and fluxes as they can capture both the celerity of the runoff response and the velocity of water particles revealed by tracer dynamics the phase space reconstruction of modelled systems can help in this regard it traces the evolution of a dynamic system from a known initial state as phase trajectories in response to inputs in this study we compared the modelled storage flux dynamics obtained from the application of a spatially distributed tracer aided hydrological model starr in five contrasting long term research catchments with varying degrees of snow influence the models were calibrated using a consistent multivariate methodology based on discharge isotope composition and snowpack water equivalent analysis of extracted modelled storage dynamics gave insights into the system functioning large volumes of total stored water needed to be invoked at most sites to reconcile celerity and travel times to match observe discharge and isotope responses this is because changes in dynamic storage from water balance considerations are small when compared to volume of storage necessary for observed tracer dampening in the phase space diagrams the rates of storage change gave insights into the relative storage volume and seasonal catchment functioning the storage increase was dominated by hydroclimatic inputs thus it presented a stochastic response furthermore depending on the dominance of snow or rainfall inputs catchments had different seasonal responses in storage dynamics decreases in storage were more predictable and reflected the efficiency of catchment drainage yet at lower storages the influence of et was also evident activation of flow paths due to overland and near surface flows resulted in non linearity of catchment functioning largely at high storage states the storage discharge relationships generally showed a non linear distribution with more scattered states during wettest condition in turn all the catchments exhibited an inverse storage effect with modelled water ages decreasing with increasing storage as lateral flow paths were activated insights from this inter comparison of storage flux age dynamics show the benefits of tracer aided hydrological models in exploring their interactions at well instrumented sites to better understand hydrological functioning of contrasting catchments keywords storage water ages storage discharge hydroclimatic forces phase space non linearity 1 introduction the hydrological function of catchment systems integrates complex physical processes across a range of temporal and spatial scales giving rise to typically non linear rainfall runoff responses e g tsonis et al 1993 jayawardena and lai 1994 koutsoyiannis and pachakis 1996 sivakumar et al 2009 and review by sivakumar 2000 this complexity has been simplified through the exploration of storage discharge dynamics which provides a useful way of understanding how climatic forcing antecedent conditions and catchment characteristics interact to produce rather consistent rainfall runoff responses kirchner 2009 such dynamics also provide a powerful basis for inter catchment comparison though this is largely unrealised mcnamara et al 2011 still the nature of catchment storage discharge interactions is complex and difficult to quantify by direct observation hydroclimatic dynamics which represent the input to catchment systems are intrinsically stochastic and non linear often exhibiting marked seasonality as well as interannual variability e g rodriguez iturbe and de power 1989 sharifi et al 1990 houghton 1991 lorenz 1991 georgakakos et al 1995 puente and obregn 1996 sivakumar et al 1999 furthermore many hydrologic processes that depend on catchment attributes e g geology topography soils land use etc and on the initial catchment conditions i e initial wetness contribute to the non linearity in the rainfall runoff transformation and may cause hysteresis in the storage discharge relationship in addition catchment size determines the relative influence of hillslope flow processes and routing through channel networks in determining the timing of the hydrological response robinson et al 1995 characterising all these factors is challenging and physically quantifying storage is difficult though geophysical and remote sensing methods are proving increasingly useful rodell et al 2009 soulsby et al 2016 given these uncertainties various hydrological models have recently been highlighted as tools to explore the non linearities of storage discharge interactions in complex catchments beven and davies 2015 harman 2015 soulsby et al 2015 in order to be used to explore catchment dynamics it is fundamental that hydrological models correctly represent the non linearities of the catchment rainfall runoff response traditionally estimating storage dynamics in models has been a means to understanding how antecedent conditions regulate the volume and celerity i e how fast perturbations are transmitted through the flow domain of the runoff response dooge 1967 this has usually been based on calibration to runoff responses alone increasingly however it is recognised that the dynamic storage needed to produce observed catchment responses is much less than the total storage that controls the velocity of water particles and often produce surprisingly long catchment travel times soulsby et al 2011 staudinger et al 2017 insights from conservative tracers such as stable isotopes have shown that larger volumes of stored water need to be invoked to produce the mixing needed to damp and lag the dynamics of the rainfall runoff transformation of conservative tracers kirchner et al 2000 birkel et al 2011 thus if hydrological models are able to capture both input output transformations of rainfall runoff and conservative tracers they can characterise the celerity of the runoff response as well as providing estimates of the velocity of water particles and associated ages weiler et al 2003 mcdonnell and beven 2014 this capacity of hydrologic models allows the interactions between catchment storage flux and age dynamics to be explored birkel and soulsby 2015 and can help explain how catchments respond to rainfall or snowmelt events in a matter of minutes and hours but release water that has been stored for many months or years kirchner 2003 models can also help distinguish the non linearities in catchment responses that are due to variable forcing inputs and those related to intrinsic catchment conditions in models inputs are controllable each internal variable can be individually observed and the sensitivity of the response to external inputs and internal model states can be assessed an additional advantage of using models is that they permit us to track individual solutions corresponding to specified forcing inputs and initial conditions therefore an ensemble of model runs simulating a large range of forcing inputs and initial conditions can be used to reconstruct an approximation of the phase portrait that reveals all feasible solutions and states of a catchment i e total water storage the rate at which changes in storage occur and an indication of the model uncertainty this shape of the phase portrait can be interpreted in terms of the behaviour of the dynamic system maneta et al 2018 the region of these trajectories and the visualisation of potential system attractors can give qualitative insights into the complexity dynamic stability and non linearity of the system although approaches for analysing hydrological systems on the phase space reconstruction using streamflow time series have been investigated in the past e g jayawardena and lai 1994 porporato and ridolfi 2003 sivakumar et al 2007 sivakumar and singh 2012 relatively few applications have used modelled storages especially using tracers as additional constraints duffy 1996 brandes et al 1998 beven and davies 2015 although models portray virtual environments they can help us understand the dynamics of real systems and provide a standardised tool for inter comparison of the hydrological functioning of catchments with contrasting landscape characteristics and different hydroclimatic regimes beven and davies 2015 recent advances in tracer aided modelling have elucidated some of these dynamics in terms of celerity of response and particle velocities in contrasting geographical environments and hydroclimatic settings e g hrachowitz et al 2013 birkel et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018b in these types of models the inclusion of conservative tracers can help to better constrain the model and obtain a more plausible response although calibration based solely on the hydrograph remains the most common practice in hydrological modelling several studies showed how models that combine tracers and hydrology can increase understanding of internal catchment processes beven 1993 kirchner 2006 rinaldo et al 2011 these analyses have used a full range of modelling approaches from lumped models iorgulescu et al 2005 stadnyk et al 2005 dunn et al 2008 fenicia et al 2008a b birkel et al 2016 to semi distributed conceptual models uhlenbrook et al 2004 stadnyk et al 2013 van huijgevoort et al 2016a delavau et al 2017 and more physically based models kuppel et al 2018 smith et al 2019 the range of catchment conditions considered vary from those with high storage 1000 mm long travel times 5 years and attenuated hydrological response to others with low storage 200 mm short travel times 0 5 years and closer coupling between celerity and water travel times hrachowitz et al 2010 the interaction between catchment characteristics and climate affect storage flux age interactions ala aho et al 2017b this is particularly evident in terms of high precipitation inputs which drive shorter travel times e g dehaspe et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or low precipitation inputs and high evapotranspiration rates that drive longer travel times douinot et al 2019 the motivation behind this study was to use tracer aided models as a basis for comparing the storage flux age interactions of contrasting experimental catchments crucially the tracer aided nature of the modelling gives much more realistic characterisation of the catchment storage activated in tracer damping which in turn determines the velocity of water particles and the resulting ages of catchment storage compartments and associated fluxes we used the spatially distributed tracer aided rainfall runoff starr model across a range of northern montane catchments such catchments tend to be under studied compared to the temperate region and have an additional complexity which relates to varying characteristics of snowpack influence and melt and the different degree of snowmelt influence on storage dynamics and runoff tetzlaff et al 2015a many such catchments are also experiencing rapid climatic warming which will change flux storage dynamics with widespread implications for water management tetzlaff et al 2015b specifically we compare standardised starr simulations for these catchments for an inter comparison of to examine how storage changes relate to the dominant input and output fluxes and associated water ages across multiple years of simulation starr was originally developed for an upland catchment in scotland van huijgevoort et al 2016a and subsequently adapted to capture the influence of snowmelt processes ala aho et al 2017a and frozen ground piovano et al 2019 on hydrological and isotope dynamics the model has been successfully applied to a range of catchments e g ala aho et al 2017b dehaspe et al 2018 whilst there are obvious limitations in using modelled rather than observed systems behaviour the common approach used here provides a means for a unique catchment inter comparison when direct observations are unavailable beven and davies 2015 the specific objectives of the study are to 1 use a tracer aided semi distributed rainfall runoff model as a common framework for comparing storage dynamics in contrasting catchments 2 identify how hydroclimatic forcing and catchment characteristics interact to produce stochastic deterministic and linear nonlinear behaviours by examining the storage dynamics in phase space diagrams and 3 identify inter catchment differences in how storage dynamics control runoff generation and mixing interactions which determine the age of stream water 2 data methods 2 1 study sites five catchments encompassing a range of geological topographic and hydroclimate characteristics across northern latitudes were included in the study fig 1 bogus creek bg part of the dry creek experimental watershed dcew in idaho usa bruntland burn bb in scotland plastic lake in the dorset d watersheds in ontario canada sub catchment c7 of the krycklan research catchment kr in sweden and granger basin a sub catchment of wolf creek wc in the yukon territory canada all the study sites are established long term experimental catchments details of which are available elsewhere e g tetzlaff et al 2015a b the study catchments range in size from 0 23 km2 at d to 7 8 km2 at wc with bg and kr also having smaller areas 1 km2 but bb being larger 3 2 km2 the catchments except for bb have a strong snow melt influence in their hydrological response with at least 25 of precipitation falling as snow table 1 and span a relatively wide range of climatic conditions wc has the coldest and driest conditions typical of a subarctic climate hydrographs at wc are therefore highest during snowmelt and usually peak in may while low flows occur under ice between autumn and late spring fig 2 conversely bb shows the wettest conditions with all monthly average temperatures above 0 c seasonality of evapotranspiration at bb gives rise to lower summer flows and discharge peaks between november and february however high flows can occur throughout the year bg and kr have similar cumulative precipitation over the year with around half falling as snow at kr laudon and löfvenius 2016 and more than 50 at bg average temperatures at bg are higher than at kr but both catchments have sub zero monthly mean temperature between november and march the hydrologic response is also different at bg snowmelt dominates the hydrograph from march to june typically peaking in may while low flows occur during the rest of the year snowmelt at kr peaks in april may though high flows of similar magnitude can occur in response to summer rainfall while flows are lower in the cold winter d has a humid continental climate with sub zero monthly mean temperatures from december to march the hydrograph peaks occur usually during snowmelt with rainfall generated summer peaks and occasional cessation of flow during summer droughts topography and geology also exert strong controls on the hydrological behaviour of the study sites bg presents a v shaped fluvial valley with the highest elevations across all sites it is characterized by fractured granodiorite covered by a thin layer 1 m of permeable sands mcnamara et al 2005 conversely wc has a similar elevation range to bg but limited capacity for water storage due to extensive discontinuous permafrost around 70 of the area that acts in a similar way to impermeable bedrock piovano et al 2019 the deeper geology of wc is sedimentary overlain by a mantle of glacial till the bb d and kr sites have similar combinations of riparian peatlands overlying drift deposits dillon and lazerte 1992 laudon et al 2013 tetzlaff et al 2014 however bb has much steeper topography compared to the flat kr and the gently sloping d catchments at bb steep hillslopes are covered by podzolic soils and the wide glaciated valley bottoms are covered by organic soils capable of generating overland flow and are underlain by up to 30 m of glacial drift with significant groundwater storage soulsby et al 2016 at the flatter d and kr basins the presence of wetlands impact their hydropedological properties a minerogenic mire covers 18 of kr and a conifer wetland occupies 7 10 of d in the mire at kr overland flow takes place during periods of intense rain or snowmelt peralta tapia et al 2015b while subsurface flow paths dominate the rest of the catchment where podzolic soils are formed above compact basal till weakly developed podzols have formed on thin sandy basal tills at d kirkwood and nesbitt 1991 leading to thin 0 5 m soil cover with bedrock outcrops comprising 10 of the area dillon and lazerte 1992 the bedrock limits groundwater contributions and the dominant runoff mechanisms is lateral flow at the soil bedrock interface vegetation across the catchments ranges from forests to sphagnum bogs in particular bg is mainly covered by shrubs prunus spp and ceanothus spp with a small fraction of taller tree canopies pseudotsuga menziesii and pinus ponderosa near the stream at bb the steep slopes are dominated by heather calluna vulgaris with patches of scots pine pinus sylvestris forests while the valley bottom is covered by sphagnum dominated peatlands most of d is forested with white pine pinus strobus hemlock tsuga canadensis and some red oak while the wetland area is forested with birch betula spp and black spruce picea mariana devito et al 1996 kr is covered by conifer boreal forest picea abies and pinus sylvestris except for the canopy free minerogenic mire with sphangnum moss at wc the vegetation consists predominantly of willow salix and birch betula shrubs 2 2 the starr model starr is a spatially explicit hydrological model that simulates water fluxes storage dynamics isotope ratios and water ages fig 3 originally developed for the bb catchment van huijgevoort et al 2016a b it has a structure similar to the hbv light model lindström et al 1997 and a scheme for tracer tracking and mixing similar to tracer aided lumped models birkel et al 2011 the original model has been modified by ala aho et al 2017a to include a snowmelt routine that simulates the isotopic composition of the snowpack and melt water further adaptation by piovano et al 2019 allows the model to simulate the dynamics of frozen ground as full details are in these original papers only a brief summary follows starr is driven by input time series including precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and precipitation isotope composition a digital elevation model is used to route water downslope temperature and precipitation are spatially distributed according to an elevation factor while radiation terms are adjusted for the influence of slope aspect and canopy sheltering the model is usually applied at a daily time step though more recently sub daily scales have been used dehaspe et al 2018 water balance modelling equations are applied on grid cells and fluxes from each cell are routed to the neighbouring cell according to the local drainage direction based on topography fig 3 the spatial scale of the grid in the model applications spanned from 10x10 m2 to 100x100 m2 depending on catchment size ala aho et al 2017b for each model routine water fluxes storages are estimated according to the mass balance while isotope ratios are estimated according to mixing equations under the assumption of complete mixing in each cell for each compartment though this integrates to partial mixing in terms of stream flow generation at the catchment scale incoming precipitation is partitioned between liquid pliq or solid pice precipitation according to calibrated temperature thresholds an interception compartment accounts for the fraction of precipitation intercepted by vegetation int the fraction of throughfall pthru and evaporation from vegetation eint for the snow fraction snow tree canopy interception int and unloading sunl account for the assumption that interception efficiency decreases with canopy snow load and increases with canopy density and that snow unloading from vegetation increases with time ala aho et al 2017a the snow compartment is energy based hence for each time step an energy balance is solved on net radiation latent and sensible heat heat advection from precipitation and heat storage in the snowpack therefore sublimation esnow or melt smelt fluxes from snow storage can be simulated for the isotopes the energy basis of the snow routine accounts for sublimation fractionation of snow isotope composition both of canopy intercepted snow and the ground level snowpack water as well as the isotopic depletion of snowmelt ala aho et al 2017a effective precipitation sum of contribution from int and snow routine either enters the soil compartment or is routed as direct discharge qstorm if the maximum soil storage is exceeded water that enters soil storage can either generate discharge and be routed to the total discharge qtot as qsoil be stored in the soil sto evaporate et or contribute to groundwater recharge seep the storage discharge relationship in the soil box is modelled as a power law through calibrated parameters see ala aho et al 2017b for details the field capacity is modelled as the amount of water that is retained in the soil defined by parameters for volumetric field capacity and soil depth this conceptualisation allows a physically based parametrisation and non linear seepage and outflow processes with high soil storage values in addition the soil module has a passive storage stopas accounting for a fraction of stored water that does not contribute to discharge but increases the total mixing volume for isotopes the inclusion of the passive storage conceptualises the storage needed to damp the tracer signal in addition to the dynamic storage needed to generate discharge in the groundwater routine a recession parameter calibrated regulates the linear contribution to the outflow qgw while it can contribute an upward flux to soil storage cap under a prevailing hydraulic gradient a lateral flow term qlf in out allows the water from a cell to flow to neighbouring cells in the groundwater compartment according to slope and elevation unlike the soil storage that has a limited storage capacity the groundwater storage gw is unconfined parameters regulating the soil sub routine were subdivided into hillslope and valley bottom cells at bb and into forest and wetland cells at d and kr details in ala aho et al 2017b piovano et al 2018 at wc a similar differentiation has been made with a subdivision between properties of the lower and upper basins however a critical difference at wc is that the field capacity parameter has been modelled as time variant based on the day of the year in order to include the influence of thaw dynamics piovano et al 2019 for each routine water ages are estimated by tracking input fluxes similar to the tracers specifically when precipitation enters the system it has an age of 1 day stored water in the compartments get 1 day older at each daily time step through the mixing and water exchanges between model routines and model cells water ages evolve dynamically in time and space in a similar way to the water isotope composition commonly a spin up period is necessary to initialise the modelled storages and isotope compositions table 1 some of the model parameters are prescribed while some others usually around 15 are randomly sampled using a monte carlo approach see van huijgevoort et al 2016a b for details the performance of the model parameters was evaluated by comparing simulated and observed hydrological and isotopic responses see calibration details each model simulation includes information on storages fluxes and water age in each model compartment evaporation soil storage etc at each time step 2 3 model calibration the data we used in the analysis to compare storage flux age dynamics across the study catchments were obtained from earlier calibrated simulations of starr described in earlier works ala aho et al 2017b piovano et al 2018 2019 fig 2 shows three years of simulated and observed discharge and isotope composition of streamflow for each of the study catchments for each site the model was calibrated using an identical monte carlo approach to sample the parameter space multi variate calibration ala aho et al 2017b was conducted over the period of available data to select the best performing parameters from 10 000 monte carlo runs that match simultaneously observed timeseries of discharge snow water equivalent swe and best available stream water isotope δ18o for bb bg and kr δ2h for d and wc for each simulation three efficiency metrics were used kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 for evaluating discharge and swe and mean absolute error mae for evaluating isotope simulations except for bb for which the calibration included only discharge and isotopes due to the very limited swe amounts the selection of best parameter ensemble was achieved by calculating the empirical cumulative distribution functions of these three efficiency metrics and recording the n best simulations that concurrently had the highest values of kge for discharge and swe and the lowest value of mae for stream water isotopes in the results presented here the best five simulations n 5 are used to give an indication of model uncertainties induced by alternative parameterizations whilst still allowing differences of individual parameter sets to be observed in the resulting plots earlier exploration of the best 10 or 25 simulations showed a similar spread of results but the density of data points made the phase space plots difficult to interpret hence 5 was selected as a compromise to show the degree of uncertainty whilst allowing the trajectories of individual parameter sets to be shown details of the calibration are reported in earlier papers ala aho et al 2017b for bb bc kr piovano et al 2018 for d piovano et al 2019 for wc reasonable results for flow isotopes and swe allowed cautious inferences about storages flux interactions to be made and compared across sites table 2 2 4 data analysis in order to assess and compare storage flux age dynamics for each catchment we considered some of the following starr model outputs specifically for each catchment we used time series of a catchment averaged soil storage sto and groundwater storage gw b discharge q at the outlet cell c streamflow water age age at the outlet cell and d catchment evapotranspiration et to conduct the comparative analysis we aggregated grid cell scale soil and groundwater storage values as well as et fluxes to produce catchment averaged time series secondly in order to compare the behaviour of modelled storage between the catchments we took into account three metrics the soil storage stoi total storage tsi at each simulated day i which is the sum of soil storage and groundwater storage tsi stoi gwi and the mean total storage ts i which is the sum of soil storage stoi and temporally averaged mean groundwater storage estimate over the calibration periods gw ts i sto i gw the latter metric was used because it damps the large uncertainty in gw estimates and makes the analysis and inter site differences clearer this is because the storage in groundwater storage is poorly identified giving wide variations in the volume of the possible groundwater store at some sites despite this the annual variability in the store is typically small 10 mm so that the effect on the day to day catchment storage dynamics is minor as these are mainly dominated by the variation in the soil store which can vary by 300 mm we did not average across the parameter sets on a daily basis because at dry creek the large groundwater store had not stabilized despite the reasonable flow and isotope simulations the water stored in the snow pack was not included in these storage metrics as it is only considered to contribute to the catchment storage dynamics once it has melted and infiltrated the soil we analysed the temporal storage dynamics of et and the three storage metrics using raw values mm or mm day and also scaling the time series by mean storage scaled values are identified with a for instance the scaled mean total storage is ts i is defined as ts i ts i μ ts where μ is the mean and i refers to simulated day to analyse q and age dynamics we used the time series of simulated values at the outlet cell of each catchment without further averaging storage fluxes and water ages are the system states that we have considered to investigate differences between catchments the state of the catchment e g its storage at a given point in time and the velocity at which such state is changing time derivative of the state were represented by a point in the phase plane spanned by these two variables fig 4 changes in a catchment over time i e the catchment dynamics are represented by trajectories in this phase plane the collection of these trajectories produces an empirical portrait of the dynamic system compactness asymmetry angles spikes and seasonal patterns emerging in the portrait can give insights into the hydrology of the catchment function sivakumar et al 2007 maneta et al 2018 specifically for instance in the case of scaled mean total storage dynamics ts vs d ts dt positive values of the time derivative indicate filling states driven by hydroclimatic forcing and antecedent states of the catchment are more likely to be stochastic conversely the side of phase space plot with negative time derivates shows the catchment efficiency in draining the excess water in particular the slope of the negative lower boundary of the cloud of trajectories gives a direct indication of the catchment tendency to quickly release water furthermore the structure of all possible states compactness or presence of prominent spikes can give an indication about predominant hydroclimatic conditions or preferential flow generation mechanisms 3 results 3 1 storage dynamics box plots of the total storage ts in mm show the ranges of sum of soil and groundwater storage estimated by the starr model for each of the study sites fig 5 the resulting mean and range have been derived from the simulated storages at each timestep from the five best monte carlo simulations over the modelled periods table 2 uncertainty in total storage is high especially at bg and d mostly due to the high sensitivity of simulated groundwater store to alternative parameterizations we note that the ranges shown in fig 5 account both for the variability in the catchment dynamics as well as the variability of the ensemble induced by the alternative best 5 models the ts is highest in bg 2500 mm and lowest at wc 100 mm intermediate ts 500 1000 mm were modelled for bb and d whilst ts is also low in kr 200 mm the time series of sto soil storage and ts mean total storage are shown for three years of each of the modelled periods fig 6 the catchments have distinct storage dynamics mainly driven by changes in the soil storage compartment the uncertainty in upper and lower groundwater contributions to total storage is large but the upper and lower limits show the influence of soil store in dominating the overall dynamics the storage dynamics have a strong hydroclimatic imprint in bg sto increases with the spring melt and declines in the summer before re wetting with late summer rains prior to remaining stable during the cold winter period in contrast at bb sto dynamics are much more variable generally being highest in the winter but summer storage depletion is modest and re filling can occur all year round the dynamics of d are similar to bb but a clear spring sto peak occurs after snowmelt and the potential for depletion e g summer 2012 is much greater kr is similar to bg in terms of a dominant spring snowmelt event but also summer peaks from large rainfall events are evident changes in sto and ts are small or modest at all sites with the exception of wc here sto and ts are lowest in winter as both are impeded by the presence of permafrost but some storage slowly depletes as some stream flow is maintained spring melt increases sto with storage capacity also increasing with the thaw however overall changes in sto and ts are very small at wc 3 2 phase planes the scaled mean total storage ts is plotted against the daily variation of scaled mean total storage d ts dt in fig 7 as suggested this can be seen as a portrait of the modelled states for each system during the calibration periods fig 7 all sites apart from wc show limited variability in ts due to the high groundwater storage which produces relatively compact portraits namely the spread around the d ts dt 0 line ts increases at bg bb and d are all 15 relative to the mean however at kr it increases by 80 in contrast after the prolonged winter period at wc ts increases by a factor of 5 reflecting non stationarity in storage capacity in the thaw layer for the lower storage states ts decreases by 5 relative to the mean at bg and bb and by 20 at d and kr ts stays below the mean at wc in winter early spring and late autumn as the storage changes little for 8 months d kr and wc have the largest variations in ts and they can get relatively drier in terms of their mean storage than the other catchments bg has quite small variation in storage despite having similar annual p as kr the temporal dynamics shown in fig 7 underline the dominant role of soil storage dynamics driving those observed in fig 6 with the highest storages in spring for bb d and kr after snowmelt though warmer temperatures and rainfall creates the winter peak in bb and the thaw layer regulates the peak at wc all sites have lowest storages in summer except wc which is at its driest during winter the range of the rate of changes of storage d ts dt shows only small daily increases of 2 at bg which are focused in spring whilst increases of 5 occur at bb d and kr and can occur at any time of year again at wc much bigger daily increases can occur given the non linear nature of the storage capacity this suggests that for most catchments only a very small portion of water is actually flowing in or out of storage at any point in time overall the most apparent features of these figures reflect the climatic forcing of precipitation or snowmelt during the wetting cycle of the catchment positive d ts dt and catchment characteristics that regulate the rainfall runoff response and control drainage negative d ts dt all catchments are asymmetrical around the d ts dt 0 line catchment states in the positive d ts dt section of the plane are driven by the hydroclimatology rainfall snowmelt events seasonality and the antecedent state of the catchment and therefore shows higher stochasticity bg is perhaps an exception wetting of catchment is mainly driven by a more gradual melt resulting in a more symmetrical diagram and a more orderly configuration in the positive d ts dt section negative d ts dt responses in the state space reflect the drainage efficiency of a catchment the shape of the lower limit of the cloud is mostly driven by the hydrologic processes that drain excess water from the catchment the line enveloping the lower end of the cloud gently slopes toward the d ts dt 0 line the slope of this line is inversely related to the residence time of water and indicates that rate at which excess storage is removed from the catchment the non linearity of catchment functioning is most obvious during high storage states mainly for negative values of ts most likely when rapid flow paths e g overland flow are activated and the drainage efficiency increases especially at bb and d in particular inflection points in the bottom boundary slope around ts 1 04 are evident at bb and d while they are not apparent at the other sites there are also differences in the rates at which the catchments fill and empty i e the minimum value of ts resulting in a variation of d ts dt in d higher storage is necessary for activating flow paths except for a few summer events with a faster response bb storage dynamics also show that it takes a relatively high amount of storage build up before water starts to drain while both bg kr and wc activation of draining mechanisms occur as soon as the catchment gains from its lowest storage differences in the structure compactness and spikes of the phase space diagrams are apparent in different seasons within each of the diagrams prominent spikes are apparent in periods that are mostly rain driven for bb all year wc and kr in summer d in spring and summer which results in less compacts diagrams than catchments that are mostly snowmelt driven where regular daily energy inputs melt the snow and slowly fill the catchment rain storms provide faster rates of filling high d ts dt during discrete events producing large spikes in the diagrams compared to snowmelt events which are reflected in the lower but continuous positive d ts dt the smooth filling trajectories are most clear in the spring for all catchments except bb also d can have marked rain on snow events resulting in spring time high storage increases the dynamics of total storage in fig 7 primarily reflect soil moisture dynamics including the influence of the snow melt dynamics fig 8 a shows the actual soil storage sto change in mm versus the daily variation of the storage dsto dt i e without the mean groundwater storage included the changes are asymmetrical and greater for the storage increases and more linear on the decreasing side of 0 change seasonal pattern in all catchments are similar to fig 7 except for d that here presents high sto and high dsto dt during summer which is absent in ts plot fig 7 bg shows more scattered values of dsto dt than in the case of ts plot fig 8b shows the same relationships but for each ensemble parameter set in general the parameter sets give broadly similar results though the high storage of one parameter set at d reflects the uncertainty in the groundwater storage at this site cf fig 6 and the compensatory effects on soil parameterisation when the former is low to explore the role of et in depleting catchment storage fig 9 shows the pattern of modelled et against the daily variation of scaled mean total storage d ts dt the expected relationship would varyin symmetry around the d ts dt 0 depending on the dynamics of storage in relation to evaporative demand the role of et in reducing catchment storage is apparent in the figure although et can be high both when storage is increasing particularly notable at bg the highest et at most sites tends to be when storage is most slowly decreasing the effect of et is evident in d as expected from the vegetation characteristics and warmer summers and kr which presents a similar seasonal response at bb there are less distinct seasonal patterns and low rates overall and a smaller influence of et on storage rates throughout the year in wc despite the overall coldest conditions and the predominance of short shrub a summer influence of et in storage dynamics is also apparent bg is the only case where there is a lack of seasonal asymmetry around the d ts dt 0 line which presumably reflects its dry nature and that moisture is limiting in summer 3 3 storage fluxes and storage ages dynamics the relationship between scaled mean total storage ts and simulated daily discharge q for each catchment is shown in fig 10 all catchments show a non linear relationship except for linear relationship at wc with increased scatter at high ts for bb and kr this would be consistent with the activation of flow pathways such as extensive overland flow and the development of high hydrologic connectivity within the catchment as storage increases the higher variance of q when the catchment is wet also reflects the higher sensitivity of q to the five different parameters sets in the calibration ensemble when the catchment is at high storage levels there is a clear non linear relationship at bg but the variance of the spread increases when ts increases at d streamflow seems less sensitive to storage but shows more scatter when ts increases the relationship is more linear for wc though is more clearly hysteretic with higher discharges for a given storage in the spring and with linear response to the thaw and re freeze however this likely reflects simply the time varying storage which increases with the thaw to better investigate the possible presence of hysteresis in these storage discharge relationships fig 11 shows the mean total storage ts vs discharge for only one year and for only one of the 5 best simulations at bg and d the storage discharge relationship follows an anticlockwise hysteretic pattern during spring when higher values of storage and discharge occurred hysteresis at bb and kr is much weaker or non evident again wc showed two hysteretic paths one in spring and one in summer due to the different seasonal response and soil parameterisation to allow a thaw layer to developed fig 12 shows the relationship between scaled mean total storage ts and simulated stream water age at the outlet cell the figure shows the ubiquity of inverse storage effects whereby the wetter the catchment the more likely it is that younger water reaches the streams more quickly via lateral flow paths given that water ages are derived by flux tracking within the model calibrated to the stream isotopes they should be considered only indicative especially regarding ages older than a few years in general the overall behaviour is similar with all catchments showing a non linear decline in the age of streamflow as storage increases the patterns of seasonality are similar for bg d and kr in these catchments spring snowmelt reduces the age of stream flow as ts increases as inputs of younger water decline after the melt the modelled ages of water in the summer increase ts decreases and groundwater sustains the modelled flow different modelled responses are evident at bb as winter rainfall generated higher ts and low stream water ages occur wc shows a threshold with ages steadily increasing during winter low flows but rapidly decreasing as thaw occurs again some of the scatter reflects variability induced by uncertainty in the model parametrisation most obviously in the case of d during the summer 4 discussion 4 1 storage dynamics mcnamara et al 2011 argued that hydrologists have traditionally focused more on quantifying fluxes than storage in catchment systems resulting in a distorted view of catchment functioning over the past decade this has changed and different empirical and modelling based approaches have been used to quantify storage and characterise storage dynamics and associated interrelationship with different water fluxes and associated ages kirchner 2009 heidbüchel et al 2012 benettin et al 2015 harman 2015 the use of tracer aided models has important potential in this regard although such modelling exercises provide storage estimates that are not real or actual but a simplification isotopes or other conservative tracers provide important constraints of minimal storage needed to damp and lag the tracer input output transformation kirchner et al 2000 crucially this usually shows that such storages are at least an order of magnitude larger than dynamic storage changes needed to close the annual water balance staudinger et al 2017 consequently this provides a more comprehensive understanding of the filling and emptying of storage in catchments in response to snowmelt and rainfall events as well as insight into the associated age distributions of both stores and fluxes in the context of the current study such modelled storage provides a useful set of metrics for inter comparison of catchment behaviour and sensitivity to change e g figs 5 and 6 that is not possible from more conventional rainfall runoff modelling also given the rich observational data sets at each of the sites the plausibility of the modelling results can be assessed for example the high total storage ts and long age distributions at bg are consistent with the geological conditions and high levels of mountain block groundwater recharge in the area mcnamara et al 2018 similarly the critical role of snowmelt in governing soil water replenishment of plant water transpirations sources ground recharge and stream flow responses has been documented mcnamara et al 2005 sprenger et al 2018a at bb previous work has shown how saturated valley bottom wetlands rapidly respond to precipitation events but damp tracer signals because of their large near surface storage capacity in sto soulsby et al 2015 the generally wet summers and low radiation in the scottish highlands limit evapotranspiration fluxes and gravity drainage in the steep catchment dominates the dynamic storage responses to precipitation inputs tetzlaff et al 2014 however the effects of high groundwater storage in deeper drift deposits were also captured by the model in terms of sustaining the quantify and isotopic composition of baseflows soulsby et al 2016 d and kr show similarities in their storage dynamics due to the dominance of the spring snowmelt in re filling storage but also the effects of summer rainfall events however at kr a relatively low storage is inferred as near surface hydrological processes in perennially wet organic soils dominate storm runoff generation peralta tapia et al 2015a thus both runoff responses and isotope damping can be adequately captured with relatively low volumes of active storage laudon et al 2007 in d however most parameter sets infer that a significant large store is needed to do the same buttle 1994 though as figs 6 and 8b show it is uncertain whether this is mainly in the soils or groundwater this result is consistent with the presence of the conifer dominated wetland and the role that exerts on catchment streamflow response devito et al 1996 the wetland acts as an additional store when the water table has been drawn down and thus no streamflow response is recorded while in case of summer rainfall events on wet wetland area generates flow peaks in wc the extensive presence of permafrost means that storage is largely regulated by the development of a thaw layers in the organic soils as the summer evolves mccartney et al 2006 this mediates the translation of snowmelt into runoff as well as the impact of late summer rainfall quinton et al 2004 dornes et al 2008 of course at wc the permafrost is also a water store though one that does not actively contribute runoff when frozen though thaw layers are likely to penetrate deeper and active greater volumes of such storage in the future as the climate warms piovano et al 2019 overall the value of such storage based catchment inter comparison is that it highlights the role of both hydroclimatic drivers and catchment characteristics in determining the sensitivity of storage dynamics beven and davies 2015 this in turn can provide insight into the likely resilience of storage to climate and other environmental change carey et al 2010 in this regard the likely reduced influence of the snowpack as climatic warming advances will shift the runoff regime at these sites which might increase winter runoff from rainfall and reduce storage at the start of the growing season which is currently dependably supplied by spring snowmelt 4 2 storage phase changes the reconstruction of the phase portraits for each catchment provides a framework for catchment inter comparison by showing the unique filling and emptying trajectories that reflect responses to climate inputs and internal function apart from wc the scaled plots in fig 7 highlight just how small the dynamic storage changes are relative to the total active storage estimated from the starr applications the critical role of the wet organic soils at all sites apart from bg in modulating these phases changes is apparent from fig 8a the positive change in storage section of the plot in fig 7 show the stochastic effect of rainfall events in the data spread at b d and kr whilst much more systematic melt effects at bg and wc produce a more compact plot on the other hand the negative change in storage section of the plot which represents the drying of the catchment is more predictable the drying is dominated by gravity drainage when the catchments are in wetter conditions although the role of et is also important at some of the sites as conditions become drier fig 9 in the wettest conditions sites like bb d and wc the drying trajectories in the phase space show distinct non linearity presumably because hydrological connectivity is greatest during wet conditions and rapid flow paths can drain the catchment more effectively in the initial stages of drying the uncertainty in the phase space plots is indicated for the soil storage in fig 8b although this is similar for most sites d which has the greatest groundwater uncertainty fig 6 has some variation reflecting the compensatory effect of calibration producing a larger groundwater store smaller soil water store or in the case of parameter set 5 vice versa 4 3 storage fluxes and storage ages dynamics the non linear storage discharge relationships for the catchments generally show more scatter at higher storages see example year in fig 11 in part this reflects the non linearity of the catchment function and the higher sensitivity in responses of catchments when they are wet harman 2015 but also highlights that model outputs can be more sensitive to parameterization errors when at high storage fig 8b the non stationary but more linear relationship at wc reflects the shifting storage capacity as thaw develops and then ends the modelled storage discharge relationship shows anticlockwise hysteresis at bg and d showing storage replenishment while the relationships for bb and kr lack hysteresis at wc some hysteresis is evident in larger late summer rainfall where some storage has developed in the thaw layer interestingly the modelled results support the inverse storage effect at multiple sites in that higher storages result in younger streamflow this is consistent with increased lateral water movement in the surface and near surface and transport of younger water into the streams harman 2015 all sites show that baseflows are a few years old whilst in the wettest conditions water ages are typically 1 year old the sites show similarities especially bb and kr whilst bg is an outlier in terms of the much older baseflows associated with the large storage and relatively low fluxes wc is also unique in terms of the binary switch when the thaw layer develops in summer meanwhile d shows the effect of a wide spread of modelled results mostly in summer this underlines the utility of tracer aided modelling in terms of providing plausible characterisation of storage dynamics that can then provide age estimates of stream flow this more comprehensive perspective on the catchment rainfall runoff response that reconciles both the response celerity and velocity of water particles provides a much firmer evidence base for assessing the likely implications of both climate and land use change e g smith et al 2020 5 conclusion we used the spatially distributed tracer aided starr model to examine the storage dynamics of contrasting long term research catchments in northern latitudes this enabled us to understand storage controls on the magnitude seasonality and age of stream water fluxes multi calibration of models on both hydrometric and stream isotope data revealed that total storage in all catchments was much greater than the dynamic storage inferred by water balance considerations phase space diagrams were found to be useful tools to observe and compare distinctive features of storage dynamics clear in the diagrams were the nature of water inputs rainfall and or snowmelt and how the internal catchment drainage mechanisms and et demands regulated storage dynamics in each catchment the results demonstrated that the storage discharge relationships are increasingly non linear as catchments become wetter and rainfall rather than snowmelt forms the dominant input furthermore we found that hydrological connectivity increases surface and near surface runoff processes during wetter conditions but these processes often cease rapidly after inputs stop this explains the ubiquity of the inverse storage effect whereby conditions of higher storage selectively move younger water to streams the study highlights the potential benefits of cautious use of multi calibrated tracer aided models to understand storage flux age interactions in northern catchments which in turn

5155,water storage dynamics modulate fluxes within catchments control the rainfall runoff response and regulate the velocity of water particles through mixing associated processes tracer aided models are useful tools for tracking the interactions between catchment storage and fluxes as they can capture both the celerity of the runoff response and the velocity of water particles revealed by tracer dynamics the phase space reconstruction of modelled systems can help in this regard it traces the evolution of a dynamic system from a known initial state as phase trajectories in response to inputs in this study we compared the modelled storage flux dynamics obtained from the application of a spatially distributed tracer aided hydrological model starr in five contrasting long term research catchments with varying degrees of snow influence the models were calibrated using a consistent multivariate methodology based on discharge isotope composition and snowpack water equivalent analysis of extracted modelled storage dynamics gave insights into the system functioning large volumes of total stored water needed to be invoked at most sites to reconcile celerity and travel times to match observe discharge and isotope responses this is because changes in dynamic storage from water balance considerations are small when compared to volume of storage necessary for observed tracer dampening in the phase space diagrams the rates of storage change gave insights into the relative storage volume and seasonal catchment functioning the storage increase was dominated by hydroclimatic inputs thus it presented a stochastic response furthermore depending on the dominance of snow or rainfall inputs catchments had different seasonal responses in storage dynamics decreases in storage were more predictable and reflected the efficiency of catchment drainage yet at lower storages the influence of et was also evident activation of flow paths due to overland and near surface flows resulted in non linearity of catchment functioning largely at high storage states the storage discharge relationships generally showed a non linear distribution with more scattered states during wettest condition in turn all the catchments exhibited an inverse storage effect with modelled water ages decreasing with increasing storage as lateral flow paths were activated insights from this inter comparison of storage flux age dynamics show the benefits of tracer aided hydrological models in exploring their interactions at well instrumented sites to better understand hydrological functioning of contrasting catchments keywords storage water ages storage discharge hydroclimatic forces phase space non linearity 1 introduction the hydrological function of catchment systems integrates complex physical processes across a range of temporal and spatial scales giving rise to typically non linear rainfall runoff responses e g tsonis et al 1993 jayawardena and lai 1994 koutsoyiannis and pachakis 1996 sivakumar et al 2009 and review by sivakumar 2000 this complexity has been simplified through the exploration of storage discharge dynamics which provides a useful way of understanding how climatic forcing antecedent conditions and catchment characteristics interact to produce rather consistent rainfall runoff responses kirchner 2009 such dynamics also provide a powerful basis for inter catchment comparison though this is largely unrealised mcnamara et al 2011 still the nature of catchment storage discharge interactions is complex and difficult to quantify by direct observation hydroclimatic dynamics which represent the input to catchment systems are intrinsically stochastic and non linear often exhibiting marked seasonality as well as interannual variability e g rodriguez iturbe and de power 1989 sharifi et al 1990 houghton 1991 lorenz 1991 georgakakos et al 1995 puente and obregn 1996 sivakumar et al 1999 furthermore many hydrologic processes that depend on catchment attributes e g geology topography soils land use etc and on the initial catchment conditions i e initial wetness contribute to the non linearity in the rainfall runoff transformation and may cause hysteresis in the storage discharge relationship in addition catchment size determines the relative influence of hillslope flow processes and routing through channel networks in determining the timing of the hydrological response robinson et al 1995 characterising all these factors is challenging and physically quantifying storage is difficult though geophysical and remote sensing methods are proving increasingly useful rodell et al 2009 soulsby et al 2016 given these uncertainties various hydrological models have recently been highlighted as tools to explore the non linearities of storage discharge interactions in complex catchments beven and davies 2015 harman 2015 soulsby et al 2015 in order to be used to explore catchment dynamics it is fundamental that hydrological models correctly represent the non linearities of the catchment rainfall runoff response traditionally estimating storage dynamics in models has been a means to understanding how antecedent conditions regulate the volume and celerity i e how fast perturbations are transmitted through the flow domain of the runoff response dooge 1967 this has usually been based on calibration to runoff responses alone increasingly however it is recognised that the dynamic storage needed to produce observed catchment responses is much less than the total storage that controls the velocity of water particles and often produce surprisingly long catchment travel times soulsby et al 2011 staudinger et al 2017 insights from conservative tracers such as stable isotopes have shown that larger volumes of stored water need to be invoked to produce the mixing needed to damp and lag the dynamics of the rainfall runoff transformation of conservative tracers kirchner et al 2000 birkel et al 2011 thus if hydrological models are able to capture both input output transformations of rainfall runoff and conservative tracers they can characterise the celerity of the runoff response as well as providing estimates of the velocity of water particles and associated ages weiler et al 2003 mcdonnell and beven 2014 this capacity of hydrologic models allows the interactions between catchment storage flux and age dynamics to be explored birkel and soulsby 2015 and can help explain how catchments respond to rainfall or snowmelt events in a matter of minutes and hours but release water that has been stored for many months or years kirchner 2003 models can also help distinguish the non linearities in catchment responses that are due to variable forcing inputs and those related to intrinsic catchment conditions in models inputs are controllable each internal variable can be individually observed and the sensitivity of the response to external inputs and internal model states can be assessed an additional advantage of using models is that they permit us to track individual solutions corresponding to specified forcing inputs and initial conditions therefore an ensemble of model runs simulating a large range of forcing inputs and initial conditions can be used to reconstruct an approximation of the phase portrait that reveals all feasible solutions and states of a catchment i e total water storage the rate at which changes in storage occur and an indication of the model uncertainty this shape of the phase portrait can be interpreted in terms of the behaviour of the dynamic system maneta et al 2018 the region of these trajectories and the visualisation of potential system attractors can give qualitative insights into the complexity dynamic stability and non linearity of the system although approaches for analysing hydrological systems on the phase space reconstruction using streamflow time series have been investigated in the past e g jayawardena and lai 1994 porporato and ridolfi 2003 sivakumar et al 2007 sivakumar and singh 2012 relatively few applications have used modelled storages especially using tracers as additional constraints duffy 1996 brandes et al 1998 beven and davies 2015 although models portray virtual environments they can help us understand the dynamics of real systems and provide a standardised tool for inter comparison of the hydrological functioning of catchments with contrasting landscape characteristics and different hydroclimatic regimes beven and davies 2015 recent advances in tracer aided modelling have elucidated some of these dynamics in terms of celerity of response and particle velocities in contrasting geographical environments and hydroclimatic settings e g hrachowitz et al 2013 birkel et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018b in these types of models the inclusion of conservative tracers can help to better constrain the model and obtain a more plausible response although calibration based solely on the hydrograph remains the most common practice in hydrological modelling several studies showed how models that combine tracers and hydrology can increase understanding of internal catchment processes beven 1993 kirchner 2006 rinaldo et al 2011 these analyses have used a full range of modelling approaches from lumped models iorgulescu et al 2005 stadnyk et al 2005 dunn et al 2008 fenicia et al 2008a b birkel et al 2016 to semi distributed conceptual models uhlenbrook et al 2004 stadnyk et al 2013 van huijgevoort et al 2016a delavau et al 2017 and more physically based models kuppel et al 2018 smith et al 2019 the range of catchment conditions considered vary from those with high storage 1000 mm long travel times 5 years and attenuated hydrological response to others with low storage 200 mm short travel times 0 5 years and closer coupling between celerity and water travel times hrachowitz et al 2010 the interaction between catchment characteristics and climate affect storage flux age interactions ala aho et al 2017b this is particularly evident in terms of high precipitation inputs which drive shorter travel times e g dehaspe et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or low precipitation inputs and high evapotranspiration rates that drive longer travel times douinot et al 2019 the motivation behind this study was to use tracer aided models as a basis for comparing the storage flux age interactions of contrasting experimental catchments crucially the tracer aided nature of the modelling gives much more realistic characterisation of the catchment storage activated in tracer damping which in turn determines the velocity of water particles and the resulting ages of catchment storage compartments and associated fluxes we used the spatially distributed tracer aided rainfall runoff starr model across a range of northern montane catchments such catchments tend to be under studied compared to the temperate region and have an additional complexity which relates to varying characteristics of snowpack influence and melt and the different degree of snowmelt influence on storage dynamics and runoff tetzlaff et al 2015a many such catchments are also experiencing rapid climatic warming which will change flux storage dynamics with widespread implications for water management tetzlaff et al 2015b specifically we compare standardised starr simulations for these catchments for an inter comparison of to examine how storage changes relate to the dominant input and output fluxes and associated water ages across multiple years of simulation starr was originally developed for an upland catchment in scotland van huijgevoort et al 2016a and subsequently adapted to capture the influence of snowmelt processes ala aho et al 2017a and frozen ground piovano et al 2019 on hydrological and isotope dynamics the model has been successfully applied to a range of catchments e g ala aho et al 2017b dehaspe et al 2018 whilst there are obvious limitations in using modelled rather than observed systems behaviour the common approach used here provides a means for a unique catchment inter comparison when direct observations are unavailable beven and davies 2015 the specific objectives of the study are to 1 use a tracer aided semi distributed rainfall runoff model as a common framework for comparing storage dynamics in contrasting catchments 2 identify how hydroclimatic forcing and catchment characteristics interact to produce stochastic deterministic and linear nonlinear behaviours by examining the storage dynamics in phase space diagrams and 3 identify inter catchment differences in how storage dynamics control runoff generation and mixing interactions which determine the age of stream water 2 data methods 2 1 study sites five catchments encompassing a range of geological topographic and hydroclimate characteristics across northern latitudes were included in the study fig 1 bogus creek bg part of the dry creek experimental watershed dcew in idaho usa bruntland burn bb in scotland plastic lake in the dorset d watersheds in ontario canada sub catchment c7 of the krycklan research catchment kr in sweden and granger basin a sub catchment of wolf creek wc in the yukon territory canada all the study sites are established long term experimental catchments details of which are available elsewhere e g tetzlaff et al 2015a b the study catchments range in size from 0 23 km2 at d to 7 8 km2 at wc with bg and kr also having smaller areas 1 km2 but bb being larger 3 2 km2 the catchments except for bb have a strong snow melt influence in their hydrological response with at least 25 of precipitation falling as snow table 1 and span a relatively wide range of climatic conditions wc has the coldest and driest conditions typical of a subarctic climate hydrographs at wc are therefore highest during snowmelt and usually peak in may while low flows occur under ice between autumn and late spring fig 2 conversely bb shows the wettest conditions with all monthly average temperatures above 0 c seasonality of evapotranspiration at bb gives rise to lower summer flows and discharge peaks between november and february however high flows can occur throughout the year bg and kr have similar cumulative precipitation over the year with around half falling as snow at kr laudon and löfvenius 2016 and more than 50 at bg average temperatures at bg are higher than at kr but both catchments have sub zero monthly mean temperature between november and march the hydrologic response is also different at bg snowmelt dominates the hydrograph from march to june typically peaking in may while low flows occur during the rest of the year snowmelt at kr peaks in april may though high flows of similar magnitude can occur in response to summer rainfall while flows are lower in the cold winter d has a humid continental climate with sub zero monthly mean temperatures from december to march the hydrograph peaks occur usually during snowmelt with rainfall generated summer peaks and occasional cessation of flow during summer droughts topography and geology also exert strong controls on the hydrological behaviour of the study sites bg presents a v shaped fluvial valley with the highest elevations across all sites it is characterized by fractured granodiorite covered by a thin layer 1 m of permeable sands mcnamara et al 2005 conversely wc has a similar elevation range to bg but limited capacity for water storage due to extensive discontinuous permafrost around 70 of the area that acts in a similar way to impermeable bedrock piovano et al 2019 the deeper geology of wc is sedimentary overlain by a mantle of glacial till the bb d and kr sites have similar combinations of riparian peatlands overlying drift deposits dillon and lazerte 1992 laudon et al 2013 tetzlaff et al 2014 however bb has much steeper topography compared to the flat kr and the gently sloping d catchments at bb steep hillslopes are covered by podzolic soils and the wide glaciated valley bottoms are covered by organic soils capable of generating overland flow and are underlain by up to 30 m of glacial drift with significant groundwater storage soulsby et al 2016 at the flatter d and kr basins the presence of wetlands impact their hydropedological properties a minerogenic mire covers 18 of kr and a conifer wetland occupies 7 10 of d in the mire at kr overland flow takes place during periods of intense rain or snowmelt peralta tapia et al 2015b while subsurface flow paths dominate the rest of the catchment where podzolic soils are formed above compact basal till weakly developed podzols have formed on thin sandy basal tills at d kirkwood and nesbitt 1991 leading to thin 0 5 m soil cover with bedrock outcrops comprising 10 of the area dillon and lazerte 1992 the bedrock limits groundwater contributions and the dominant runoff mechanisms is lateral flow at the soil bedrock interface vegetation across the catchments ranges from forests to sphagnum bogs in particular bg is mainly covered by shrubs prunus spp and ceanothus spp with a small fraction of taller tree canopies pseudotsuga menziesii and pinus ponderosa near the stream at bb the steep slopes are dominated by heather calluna vulgaris with patches of scots pine pinus sylvestris forests while the valley bottom is covered by sphagnum dominated peatlands most of d is forested with white pine pinus strobus hemlock tsuga canadensis and some red oak while the wetland area is forested with birch betula spp and black spruce picea mariana devito et al 1996 kr is covered by conifer boreal forest picea abies and pinus sylvestris except for the canopy free minerogenic mire with sphangnum moss at wc the vegetation consists predominantly of willow salix and birch betula shrubs 2 2 the starr model starr is a spatially explicit hydrological model that simulates water fluxes storage dynamics isotope ratios and water ages fig 3 originally developed for the bb catchment van huijgevoort et al 2016a b it has a structure similar to the hbv light model lindström et al 1997 and a scheme for tracer tracking and mixing similar to tracer aided lumped models birkel et al 2011 the original model has been modified by ala aho et al 2017a to include a snowmelt routine that simulates the isotopic composition of the snowpack and melt water further adaptation by piovano et al 2019 allows the model to simulate the dynamics of frozen ground as full details are in these original papers only a brief summary follows starr is driven by input time series including precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and precipitation isotope composition a digital elevation model is used to route water downslope temperature and precipitation are spatially distributed according to an elevation factor while radiation terms are adjusted for the influence of slope aspect and canopy sheltering the model is usually applied at a daily time step though more recently sub daily scales have been used dehaspe et al 2018 water balance modelling equations are applied on grid cells and fluxes from each cell are routed to the neighbouring cell according to the local drainage direction based on topography fig 3 the spatial scale of the grid in the model applications spanned from 10x10 m2 to 100x100 m2 depending on catchment size ala aho et al 2017b for each model routine water fluxes storages are estimated according to the mass balance while isotope ratios are estimated according to mixing equations under the assumption of complete mixing in each cell for each compartment though this integrates to partial mixing in terms of stream flow generation at the catchment scale incoming precipitation is partitioned between liquid pliq or solid pice precipitation according to calibrated temperature thresholds an interception compartment accounts for the fraction of precipitation intercepted by vegetation int the fraction of throughfall pthru and evaporation from vegetation eint for the snow fraction snow tree canopy interception int and unloading sunl account for the assumption that interception efficiency decreases with canopy snow load and increases with canopy density and that snow unloading from vegetation increases with time ala aho et al 2017a the snow compartment is energy based hence for each time step an energy balance is solved on net radiation latent and sensible heat heat advection from precipitation and heat storage in the snowpack therefore sublimation esnow or melt smelt fluxes from snow storage can be simulated for the isotopes the energy basis of the snow routine accounts for sublimation fractionation of snow isotope composition both of canopy intercepted snow and the ground level snowpack water as well as the isotopic depletion of snowmelt ala aho et al 2017a effective precipitation sum of contribution from int and snow routine either enters the soil compartment or is routed as direct discharge qstorm if the maximum soil storage is exceeded water that enters soil storage can either generate discharge and be routed to the total discharge qtot as qsoil be stored in the soil sto evaporate et or contribute to groundwater recharge seep the storage discharge relationship in the soil box is modelled as a power law through calibrated parameters see ala aho et al 2017b for details the field capacity is modelled as the amount of water that is retained in the soil defined by parameters for volumetric field capacity and soil depth this conceptualisation allows a physically based parametrisation and non linear seepage and outflow processes with high soil storage values in addition the soil module has a passive storage stopas accounting for a fraction of stored water that does not contribute to discharge but increases the total mixing volume for isotopes the inclusion of the passive storage conceptualises the storage needed to damp the tracer signal in addition to the dynamic storage needed to generate discharge in the groundwater routine a recession parameter calibrated regulates the linear contribution to the outflow qgw while it can contribute an upward flux to soil storage cap under a prevailing hydraulic gradient a lateral flow term qlf in out allows the water from a cell to flow to neighbouring cells in the groundwater compartment according to slope and elevation unlike the soil storage that has a limited storage capacity the groundwater storage gw is unconfined parameters regulating the soil sub routine were subdivided into hillslope and valley bottom cells at bb and into forest and wetland cells at d and kr details in ala aho et al 2017b piovano et al 2018 at wc a similar differentiation has been made with a subdivision between properties of the lower and upper basins however a critical difference at wc is that the field capacity parameter has been modelled as time variant based on the day of the year in order to include the influence of thaw dynamics piovano et al 2019 for each routine water ages are estimated by tracking input fluxes similar to the tracers specifically when precipitation enters the system it has an age of 1 day stored water in the compartments get 1 day older at each daily time step through the mixing and water exchanges between model routines and model cells water ages evolve dynamically in time and space in a similar way to the water isotope composition commonly a spin up period is necessary to initialise the modelled storages and isotope compositions table 1 some of the model parameters are prescribed while some others usually around 15 are randomly sampled using a monte carlo approach see van huijgevoort et al 2016a b for details the performance of the model parameters was evaluated by comparing simulated and observed hydrological and isotopic responses see calibration details each model simulation includes information on storages fluxes and water age in each model compartment evaporation soil storage etc at each time step 2 3 model calibration the data we used in the analysis to compare storage flux age dynamics across the study catchments were obtained from earlier calibrated simulations of starr described in earlier works ala aho et al 2017b piovano et al 2018 2019 fig 2 shows three years of simulated and observed discharge and isotope composition of streamflow for each of the study catchments for each site the model was calibrated using an identical monte carlo approach to sample the parameter space multi variate calibration ala aho et al 2017b was conducted over the period of available data to select the best performing parameters from 10 000 monte carlo runs that match simultaneously observed timeseries of discharge snow water equivalent swe and best available stream water isotope δ18o for bb bg and kr δ2h for d and wc for each simulation three efficiency metrics were used kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 for evaluating discharge and swe and mean absolute error mae for evaluating isotope simulations except for bb for which the calibration included only discharge and isotopes due to the very limited swe amounts the selection of best parameter ensemble was achieved by calculating the empirical cumulative distribution functions of these three efficiency metrics and recording the n best simulations that concurrently had the highest values of kge for discharge and swe and the lowest value of mae for stream water isotopes in the results presented here the best five simulations n 5 are used to give an indication of model uncertainties induced by alternative parameterizations whilst still allowing differences of individual parameter sets to be observed in the resulting plots earlier exploration of the best 10 or 25 simulations showed a similar spread of results but the density of data points made the phase space plots difficult to interpret hence 5 was selected as a compromise to show the degree of uncertainty whilst allowing the trajectories of individual parameter sets to be shown details of the calibration are reported in earlier papers ala aho et al 2017b for bb bc kr piovano et al 2018 for d piovano et al 2019 for wc reasonable results for flow isotopes and swe allowed cautious inferences about storages flux interactions to be made and compared across sites table 2 2 4 data analysis in order to assess and compare storage flux age dynamics for each catchment we considered some of the following starr model outputs specifically for each catchment we used time series of a catchment averaged soil storage sto and groundwater storage gw b discharge q at the outlet cell c streamflow water age age at the outlet cell and d catchment evapotranspiration et to conduct the comparative analysis we aggregated grid cell scale soil and groundwater storage values as well as et fluxes to produce catchment averaged time series secondly in order to compare the behaviour of modelled storage between the catchments we took into account three metrics the soil storage stoi total storage tsi at each simulated day i which is the sum of soil storage and groundwater storage tsi stoi gwi and the mean total storage ts i which is the sum of soil storage stoi and temporally averaged mean groundwater storage estimate over the calibration periods gw ts i sto i gw the latter metric was used because it damps the large uncertainty in gw estimates and makes the analysis and inter site differences clearer this is because the storage in groundwater storage is poorly identified giving wide variations in the volume of the possible groundwater store at some sites despite this the annual variability in the store is typically small 10 mm so that the effect on the day to day catchment storage dynamics is minor as these are mainly dominated by the variation in the soil store which can vary by 300 mm we did not average across the parameter sets on a daily basis because at dry creek the large groundwater store had not stabilized despite the reasonable flow and isotope simulations the water stored in the snow pack was not included in these storage metrics as it is only considered to contribute to the catchment storage dynamics once it has melted and infiltrated the soil we analysed the temporal storage dynamics of et and the three storage metrics using raw values mm or mm day and also scaling the time series by mean storage scaled values are identified with a for instance the scaled mean total storage is ts i is defined as ts i ts i μ ts where μ is the mean and i refers to simulated day to analyse q and age dynamics we used the time series of simulated values at the outlet cell of each catchment without further averaging storage fluxes and water ages are the system states that we have considered to investigate differences between catchments the state of the catchment e g its storage at a given point in time and the velocity at which such state is changing time derivative of the state were represented by a point in the phase plane spanned by these two variables fig 4 changes in a catchment over time i e the catchment dynamics are represented by trajectories in this phase plane the collection of these trajectories produces an empirical portrait of the dynamic system compactness asymmetry angles spikes and seasonal patterns emerging in the portrait can give insights into the hydrology of the catchment function sivakumar et al 2007 maneta et al 2018 specifically for instance in the case of scaled mean total storage dynamics ts vs d ts dt positive values of the time derivative indicate filling states driven by hydroclimatic forcing and antecedent states of the catchment are more likely to be stochastic conversely the side of phase space plot with negative time derivates shows the catchment efficiency in draining the excess water in particular the slope of the negative lower boundary of the cloud of trajectories gives a direct indication of the catchment tendency to quickly release water furthermore the structure of all possible states compactness or presence of prominent spikes can give an indication about predominant hydroclimatic conditions or preferential flow generation mechanisms 3 results 3 1 storage dynamics box plots of the total storage ts in mm show the ranges of sum of soil and groundwater storage estimated by the starr model for each of the study sites fig 5 the resulting mean and range have been derived from the simulated storages at each timestep from the five best monte carlo simulations over the modelled periods table 2 uncertainty in total storage is high especially at bg and d mostly due to the high sensitivity of simulated groundwater store to alternative parameterizations we note that the ranges shown in fig 5 account both for the variability in the catchment dynamics as well as the variability of the ensemble induced by the alternative best 5 models the ts is highest in bg 2500 mm and lowest at wc 100 mm intermediate ts 500 1000 mm were modelled for bb and d whilst ts is also low in kr 200 mm the time series of sto soil storage and ts mean total storage are shown for three years of each of the modelled periods fig 6 the catchments have distinct storage dynamics mainly driven by changes in the soil storage compartment the uncertainty in upper and lower groundwater contributions to total storage is large but the upper and lower limits show the influence of soil store in dominating the overall dynamics the storage dynamics have a strong hydroclimatic imprint in bg sto increases with the spring melt and declines in the summer before re wetting with late summer rains prior to remaining stable during the cold winter period in contrast at bb sto dynamics are much more variable generally being highest in the winter but summer storage depletion is modest and re filling can occur all year round the dynamics of d are similar to bb but a clear spring sto peak occurs after snowmelt and the potential for depletion e g summer 2012 is much greater kr is similar to bg in terms of a dominant spring snowmelt event but also summer peaks from large rainfall events are evident changes in sto and ts are small or modest at all sites with the exception of wc here sto and ts are lowest in winter as both are impeded by the presence of permafrost but some storage slowly depletes as some stream flow is maintained spring melt increases sto with storage capacity also increasing with the thaw however overall changes in sto and ts are very small at wc 3 2 phase planes the scaled mean total storage ts is plotted against the daily variation of scaled mean total storage d ts dt in fig 7 as suggested this can be seen as a portrait of the modelled states for each system during the calibration periods fig 7 all sites apart from wc show limited variability in ts due to the high groundwater storage which produces relatively compact portraits namely the spread around the d ts dt 0 line ts increases at bg bb and d are all 15 relative to the mean however at kr it increases by 80 in contrast after the prolonged winter period at wc ts increases by a factor of 5 reflecting non stationarity in storage capacity in the thaw layer for the lower storage states ts decreases by 5 relative to the mean at bg and bb and by 20 at d and kr ts stays below the mean at wc in winter early spring and late autumn as the storage changes little for 8 months d kr and wc have the largest variations in ts and they can get relatively drier in terms of their mean storage than the other catchments bg has quite small variation in storage despite having similar annual p as kr the temporal dynamics shown in fig 7 underline the dominant role of soil storage dynamics driving those observed in fig 6 with the highest storages in spring for bb d and kr after snowmelt though warmer temperatures and rainfall creates the winter peak in bb and the thaw layer regulates the peak at wc all sites have lowest storages in summer except wc which is at its driest during winter the range of the rate of changes of storage d ts dt shows only small daily increases of 2 at bg which are focused in spring whilst increases of 5 occur at bb d and kr and can occur at any time of year again at wc much bigger daily increases can occur given the non linear nature of the storage capacity this suggests that for most catchments only a very small portion of water is actually flowing in or out of storage at any point in time overall the most apparent features of these figures reflect the climatic forcing of precipitation or snowmelt during the wetting cycle of the catchment positive d ts dt and catchment characteristics that regulate the rainfall runoff response and control drainage negative d ts dt all catchments are asymmetrical around the d ts dt 0 line catchment states in the positive d ts dt section of the plane are driven by the hydroclimatology rainfall snowmelt events seasonality and the antecedent state of the catchment and therefore shows higher stochasticity bg is perhaps an exception wetting of catchment is mainly driven by a more gradual melt resulting in a more symmetrical diagram and a more orderly configuration in the positive d ts dt section negative d ts dt responses in the state space reflect the drainage efficiency of a catchment the shape of the lower limit of the cloud is mostly driven by the hydrologic processes that drain excess water from the catchment the line enveloping the lower end of the cloud gently slopes toward the d ts dt 0 line the slope of this line is inversely related to the residence time of water and indicates that rate at which excess storage is removed from the catchment the non linearity of catchment functioning is most obvious during high storage states mainly for negative values of ts most likely when rapid flow paths e g overland flow are activated and the drainage efficiency increases especially at bb and d in particular inflection points in the bottom boundary slope around ts 1 04 are evident at bb and d while they are not apparent at the other sites there are also differences in the rates at which the catchments fill and empty i e the minimum value of ts resulting in a variation of d ts dt in d higher storage is necessary for activating flow paths except for a few summer events with a faster response bb storage dynamics also show that it takes a relatively high amount of storage build up before water starts to drain while both bg kr and wc activation of draining mechanisms occur as soon as the catchment gains from its lowest storage differences in the structure compactness and spikes of the phase space diagrams are apparent in different seasons within each of the diagrams prominent spikes are apparent in periods that are mostly rain driven for bb all year wc and kr in summer d in spring and summer which results in less compacts diagrams than catchments that are mostly snowmelt driven where regular daily energy inputs melt the snow and slowly fill the catchment rain storms provide faster rates of filling high d ts dt during discrete events producing large spikes in the diagrams compared to snowmelt events which are reflected in the lower but continuous positive d ts dt the smooth filling trajectories are most clear in the spring for all catchments except bb also d can have marked rain on snow events resulting in spring time high storage increases the dynamics of total storage in fig 7 primarily reflect soil moisture dynamics including the influence of the snow melt dynamics fig 8 a shows the actual soil storage sto change in mm versus the daily variation of the storage dsto dt i e without the mean groundwater storage included the changes are asymmetrical and greater for the storage increases and more linear on the decreasing side of 0 change seasonal pattern in all catchments are similar to fig 7 except for d that here presents high sto and high dsto dt during summer which is absent in ts plot fig 7 bg shows more scattered values of dsto dt than in the case of ts plot fig 8b shows the same relationships but for each ensemble parameter set in general the parameter sets give broadly similar results though the high storage of one parameter set at d reflects the uncertainty in the groundwater storage at this site cf fig 6 and the compensatory effects on soil parameterisation when the former is low to explore the role of et in depleting catchment storage fig 9 shows the pattern of modelled et against the daily variation of scaled mean total storage d ts dt the expected relationship would varyin symmetry around the d ts dt 0 depending on the dynamics of storage in relation to evaporative demand the role of et in reducing catchment storage is apparent in the figure although et can be high both when storage is increasing particularly notable at bg the highest et at most sites tends to be when storage is most slowly decreasing the effect of et is evident in d as expected from the vegetation characteristics and warmer summers and kr which presents a similar seasonal response at bb there are less distinct seasonal patterns and low rates overall and a smaller influence of et on storage rates throughout the year in wc despite the overall coldest conditions and the predominance of short shrub a summer influence of et in storage dynamics is also apparent bg is the only case where there is a lack of seasonal asymmetry around the d ts dt 0 line which presumably reflects its dry nature and that moisture is limiting in summer 3 3 storage fluxes and storage ages dynamics the relationship between scaled mean total storage ts and simulated daily discharge q for each catchment is shown in fig 10 all catchments show a non linear relationship except for linear relationship at wc with increased scatter at high ts for bb and kr this would be consistent with the activation of flow pathways such as extensive overland flow and the development of high hydrologic connectivity within the catchment as storage increases the higher variance of q when the catchment is wet also reflects the higher sensitivity of q to the five different parameters sets in the calibration ensemble when the catchment is at high storage levels there is a clear non linear relationship at bg but the variance of the spread increases when ts increases at d streamflow seems less sensitive to storage but shows more scatter when ts increases the relationship is more linear for wc though is more clearly hysteretic with higher discharges for a given storage in the spring and with linear response to the thaw and re freeze however this likely reflects simply the time varying storage which increases with the thaw to better investigate the possible presence of hysteresis in these storage discharge relationships fig 11 shows the mean total storage ts vs discharge for only one year and for only one of the 5 best simulations at bg and d the storage discharge relationship follows an anticlockwise hysteretic pattern during spring when higher values of storage and discharge occurred hysteresis at bb and kr is much weaker or non evident again wc showed two hysteretic paths one in spring and one in summer due to the different seasonal response and soil parameterisation to allow a thaw layer to developed fig 12 shows the relationship between scaled mean total storage ts and simulated stream water age at the outlet cell the figure shows the ubiquity of inverse storage effects whereby the wetter the catchment the more likely it is that younger water reaches the streams more quickly via lateral flow paths given that water ages are derived by flux tracking within the model calibrated to the stream isotopes they should be considered only indicative especially regarding ages older than a few years in general the overall behaviour is similar with all catchments showing a non linear decline in the age of streamflow as storage increases the patterns of seasonality are similar for bg d and kr in these catchments spring snowmelt reduces the age of stream flow as ts increases as inputs of younger water decline after the melt the modelled ages of water in the summer increase ts decreases and groundwater sustains the modelled flow different modelled responses are evident at bb as winter rainfall generated higher ts and low stream water ages occur wc shows a threshold with ages steadily increasing during winter low flows but rapidly decreasing as thaw occurs again some of the scatter reflects variability induced by uncertainty in the model parametrisation most obviously in the case of d during the summer 4 discussion 4 1 storage dynamics mcnamara et al 2011 argued that hydrologists have traditionally focused more on quantifying fluxes than storage in catchment systems resulting in a distorted view of catchment functioning over the past decade this has changed and different empirical and modelling based approaches have been used to quantify storage and characterise storage dynamics and associated interrelationship with different water fluxes and associated ages kirchner 2009 heidbüchel et al 2012 benettin et al 2015 harman 2015 the use of tracer aided models has important potential in this regard although such modelling exercises provide storage estimates that are not real or actual but a simplification isotopes or other conservative tracers provide important constraints of minimal storage needed to damp and lag the tracer input output transformation kirchner et al 2000 crucially this usually shows that such storages are at least an order of magnitude larger than dynamic storage changes needed to close the annual water balance staudinger et al 2017 consequently this provides a more comprehensive understanding of the filling and emptying of storage in catchments in response to snowmelt and rainfall events as well as insight into the associated age distributions of both stores and fluxes in the context of the current study such modelled storage provides a useful set of metrics for inter comparison of catchment behaviour and sensitivity to change e g figs 5 and 6 that is not possible from more conventional rainfall runoff modelling also given the rich observational data sets at each of the sites the plausibility of the modelling results can be assessed for example the high total storage ts and long age distributions at bg are consistent with the geological conditions and high levels of mountain block groundwater recharge in the area mcnamara et al 2018 similarly the critical role of snowmelt in governing soil water replenishment of plant water transpirations sources ground recharge and stream flow responses has been documented mcnamara et al 2005 sprenger et al 2018a at bb previous work has shown how saturated valley bottom wetlands rapidly respond to precipitation events but damp tracer signals because of their large near surface storage capacity in sto soulsby et al 2015 the generally wet summers and low radiation in the scottish highlands limit evapotranspiration fluxes and gravity drainage in the steep catchment dominates the dynamic storage responses to precipitation inputs tetzlaff et al 2014 however the effects of high groundwater storage in deeper drift deposits were also captured by the model in terms of sustaining the quantify and isotopic composition of baseflows soulsby et al 2016 d and kr show similarities in their storage dynamics due to the dominance of the spring snowmelt in re filling storage but also the effects of summer rainfall events however at kr a relatively low storage is inferred as near surface hydrological processes in perennially wet organic soils dominate storm runoff generation peralta tapia et al 2015a thus both runoff responses and isotope damping can be adequately captured with relatively low volumes of active storage laudon et al 2007 in d however most parameter sets infer that a significant large store is needed to do the same buttle 1994 though as figs 6 and 8b show it is uncertain whether this is mainly in the soils or groundwater this result is consistent with the presence of the conifer dominated wetland and the role that exerts on catchment streamflow response devito et al 1996 the wetland acts as an additional store when the water table has been drawn down and thus no streamflow response is recorded while in case of summer rainfall events on wet wetland area generates flow peaks in wc the extensive presence of permafrost means that storage is largely regulated by the development of a thaw layers in the organic soils as the summer evolves mccartney et al 2006 this mediates the translation of snowmelt into runoff as well as the impact of late summer rainfall quinton et al 2004 dornes et al 2008 of course at wc the permafrost is also a water store though one that does not actively contribute runoff when frozen though thaw layers are likely to penetrate deeper and active greater volumes of such storage in the future as the climate warms piovano et al 2019 overall the value of such storage based catchment inter comparison is that it highlights the role of both hydroclimatic drivers and catchment characteristics in determining the sensitivity of storage dynamics beven and davies 2015 this in turn can provide insight into the likely resilience of storage to climate and other environmental change carey et al 2010 in this regard the likely reduced influence of the snowpack as climatic warming advances will shift the runoff regime at these sites which might increase winter runoff from rainfall and reduce storage at the start of the growing season which is currently dependably supplied by spring snowmelt 4 2 storage phase changes the reconstruction of the phase portraits for each catchment provides a framework for catchment inter comparison by showing the unique filling and emptying trajectories that reflect responses to climate inputs and internal function apart from wc the scaled plots in fig 7 highlight just how small the dynamic storage changes are relative to the total active storage estimated from the starr applications the critical role of the wet organic soils at all sites apart from bg in modulating these phases changes is apparent from fig 8a the positive change in storage section of the plot in fig 7 show the stochastic effect of rainfall events in the data spread at b d and kr whilst much more systematic melt effects at bg and wc produce a more compact plot on the other hand the negative change in storage section of the plot which represents the drying of the catchment is more predictable the drying is dominated by gravity drainage when the catchments are in wetter conditions although the role of et is also important at some of the sites as conditions become drier fig 9 in the wettest conditions sites like bb d and wc the drying trajectories in the phase space show distinct non linearity presumably because hydrological connectivity is greatest during wet conditions and rapid flow paths can drain the catchment more effectively in the initial stages of drying the uncertainty in the phase space plots is indicated for the soil storage in fig 8b although this is similar for most sites d which has the greatest groundwater uncertainty fig 6 has some variation reflecting the compensatory effect of calibration producing a larger groundwater store smaller soil water store or in the case of parameter set 5 vice versa 4 3 storage fluxes and storage ages dynamics the non linear storage discharge relationships for the catchments generally show more scatter at higher storages see example year in fig 11 in part this reflects the non linearity of the catchment function and the higher sensitivity in responses of catchments when they are wet harman 2015 but also highlights that model outputs can be more sensitive to parameterization errors when at high storage fig 8b the non stationary but more linear relationship at wc reflects the shifting storage capacity as thaw develops and then ends the modelled storage discharge relationship shows anticlockwise hysteresis at bg and d showing storage replenishment while the relationships for bb and kr lack hysteresis at wc some hysteresis is evident in larger late summer rainfall where some storage has developed in the thaw layer interestingly the modelled results support the inverse storage effect at multiple sites in that higher storages result in younger streamflow this is consistent with increased lateral water movement in the surface and near surface and transport of younger water into the streams harman 2015 all sites show that baseflows are a few years old whilst in the wettest conditions water ages are typically 1 year old the sites show similarities especially bb and kr whilst bg is an outlier in terms of the much older baseflows associated with the large storage and relatively low fluxes wc is also unique in terms of the binary switch when the thaw layer develops in summer meanwhile d shows the effect of a wide spread of modelled results mostly in summer this underlines the utility of tracer aided modelling in terms of providing plausible characterisation of storage dynamics that can then provide age estimates of stream flow this more comprehensive perspective on the catchment rainfall runoff response that reconciles both the response celerity and velocity of water particles provides a much firmer evidence base for assessing the likely implications of both climate and land use change e g smith et al 2020 5 conclusion we used the spatially distributed tracer aided starr model to examine the storage dynamics of contrasting long term research catchments in northern latitudes this enabled us to understand storage controls on the magnitude seasonality and age of stream water fluxes multi calibration of models on both hydrometric and stream isotope data revealed that total storage in all catchments was much greater than the dynamic storage inferred by water balance considerations phase space diagrams were found to be useful tools to observe and compare distinctive features of storage dynamics clear in the diagrams were the nature of water inputs rainfall and or snowmelt and how the internal catchment drainage mechanisms and et demands regulated storage dynamics in each catchment the results demonstrated that the storage discharge relationships are increasingly non linear as catchments become wetter and rainfall rather than snowmelt forms the dominant input furthermore we found that hydrological connectivity increases surface and near surface runoff processes during wetter conditions but these processes often cease rapidly after inputs stop this explains the ubiquity of the inverse storage effect whereby conditions of higher storage selectively move younger water to streams the study highlights the potential benefits of cautious use of multi calibrated tracer aided models to understand storage flux age interactions in northern catchments which in turn

5156,canopy interception is an important component of the hydrological cycle of forested catchments and is influenced by variations in the canopy structure extreme meteorological events can have a destructive impact on forest density and structure and affect the rainfall partitioning by the canopies despite extensive investigation of throughfall and stemflow the response of rainfall interception loss to post disturbance vegetation recovery is still poorly understood in this work we examined the variations in the canopy structure and rainfall interception recovery after a destructive ice and snow storm that occurred in southern china in 2008 rainfall partitioning into throughfall and stemflow were measured for multiple years at two damaged sites on nanling mountain while the interception loss was modeled using the revised gash model the results showed that the vegetation leaf area index lai doubled from 2010 to 2014 this recovery caused the throughfall rate to decrease and the interception rate to increase the application of the revised gash model indicates that the vegetation canopy storage capacity s and vegetation cover factor c increased with the lai resulting in an increase in the interception loss and variations in its components the interception recovery at the study plots provide a biophysical explanation for the threshold behaviors of runoff generation at catchment scale comparisons with canopy interception measurements from nearby undamaged secondary forests suggest that interception capacity in the study plots was not fully recovered for the first 5 7 years after the disturbance indicating that measurements for a longer duration are needed to evaluate the interception recovery from that great disturbance keywords interception loss

bragg et al 2003 for instance ice storms are primarily phenomena of north america lafon 2004 across the united states on average 16 ice storms occurred each year from 1982 to 1994 and caused an annual

whereas only a few studies investigated canopy interception recovery processes for a long time period e g two years in cisneros vaca et al 2018 for forest ecology and catchment water resource

the temporal changes in rainfall interception and partitioning in response to forest regrowth in the nanling mountain region of china where almost all of the trees at altitudes between 500 and 1000 m

secondary forest that regrew naturally after logging activities during the 1960s 1980s field surveys conducted after the 2008 ice and snow storm revealed that vegetation at the two sites fig 1 was severely damaged by the storm zhao et al 2008 li 2008 sustained snow pressure freezing and frost heaving and subsequent salvage logging left trees prone to physiological damage such as decapitation bending uprooting and stem and branch breakage splitting shao et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 wang 2012 sun et al 2012 hence plots at two sites a and b were chosen for post disturbance observations fig 1

a diameter at a breast height dbh of less than 5 cm were mainly bent whereas trees with dbhs of 5 10 cm were mainly damaged by crown or trunk breakage and uprooting the vegetation at site a with a smaller mean dbh was more severely damaged than that at site b zhao et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 starting in 2009 throughfall and stemflow were measured manually event by event in a plot at site a

funnel of each container was converted to the throughfall depth mm stemflow was measured on six trees considered to be representative of the dominant species in the plots after 2010 each setup consisted of a halved plastic tube wrapped around the tree stem in a spiral fashion the gaps between the stem and the plastic tube were filled with a silicone sealant to avoid stemflow loss the end of the tube was connected to a container for measurement stemflow at the plot level was calculated with respect to a unit ground area by multiplying the average stemflow per species by the corresponding density of the trees using the same method as for the plot at site a tf and sf were initially measured manually for a plot at site b site b 1 in table 1 from 2010 because site b 1 is relatively remote

this study ic was modeled using the revised gash model gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 the analysis method used in the gash model is simple flexible and has relatively few parameter requirements the model assumes that rainfall occurs as a series of discrete events with sufficient time between them to completely dry the canopy and the trunk the gash model differentiates among three phases in a rainfall event i the wetting up phase during which pg is less than the threshold value required to saturate the canopy pg in mm ii the saturation phase during which the average rainfall intensity r in mm h exceeds the average evaporation rate e in mm h from the fully wetted canopy and iii the drying phase after the rainfall has ceased table 2 briefly summarizes the respective equations used in the model detailed descriptions are provided in gash et al 1995 the revised gash model introduces as an input parameter a free throughfall coefficient p which reflects the amount of rain that falls directly to the forest floor without touching the canopy gash et al 1995 in practice p is often assumed to be 1 c the parameter c is the canopy cover fraction which is calculated as a function of lai

on the hourly average penman monteith estimates of the evaporation rate under saturated conditions considering a rainfall threshold of 0 5 mm h assuming zero canopy conductance gash and morton 1978 hereinafter referred to as e p in the second method the mean evaporation rate e t was derived from the value of e t r as estimated from the linear regression relationship between pg and ic gash 1979 in the third method the mean evaporation rate e o was optimized by minimizing the root mean square error between the simulated and observed interception losses for all rainfall events ghimire et al 2017 the model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse the closer the model efficiency is to 1 the more accurate the model is krause et al 2005 the values of the parameters s c e r pt and st were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values to assess the sensitivity of the modeled results to the parameters in the present case study the modeled results were compared to the measured ic 3 results 3 1 temporal changes in canopy structure the vegetation structure was characterized by the vegetation co and lai fig 2 at the measurement sites a and b the annual average co decreased by 2 3 from 2010 to 2014 i e from 0 32 and 0 22 to 0 1 and 0 07 for sites a and b respectively during the same period the lai values increased from 1 7 and 1 9 to 2 8 and 3 3 for sites a and b respectively i e nearly doubling by 2014 the variations in co were larger at site a and decreased from 2010 to 2014 at both sites as expected based on co measurements the annual gli value decreased from approximately 0 40 to 0 17 and 0 12 for sites a and b respectively based on eq 2 and the relationship between ln gli and lai fig s1 the estimated values of k at sites a and b were 0 64 and 0 66 respectively 3 2 measured rainfall partitioning tf and sf were manually measured at site a from 2009 to 2011 table 3 pg ranged from 18 8 mm to 131 8 mm and was less than 50 mm for half of the events fig 3 the maximum of annual average cv of tf measured using individual gauges was 36 7 sf was measured starting in may 2010 given that sf was very low table 3 the unmeasured proportion of stemflow in 2009 was assumed to be the same as in 2010 to calculate the ic the three year average ratios of throughfall tf pg stemflow sf pg and calculated interception loss ic pg were 82 1 6 and 16 4 respectively annual ic pg increased and tf pg decreased from 2009 to 2011 the trend was more obvious for smaller rainfall events 60 mm fig 3 table 3 also lists the manual measurements of pg and partitioning into tf sf and ic for 30 events at site b 1 in 2011 the pg ranged from 16 2 to 100 5 mm with an average value of 41 8 mm 83 4 pg reached the ground as tf and the interception ratio was 13 0 the cv of tf was 23 7 which was slightly smaller than that at site a sf was also very small and only accounted for 2 7 of pg rainfall and throughfall were automatically recorded from june 2011 to may 2012 and from march to september 2014 table 3 pg of 213 events ranged from 0 1 to 71 9 mm with an average of 10 6 mm sf was only measured in 2011 and was assumed to have the same value in 2012 and 2014 the three years average tf pg and ic pg were 83 8 and 14 3 respectively from 2011 to 2014 tf pg decreased from 85 2 to 81 8 and ic pg increased from 12 8 to 16 4 fig 4 shows the comparisons of the tf and ic in the same seasons between the first june 2011 may 2012 and second periods march 2014 september 2014 decreases in tf and increases in ic are evident in these comparisons as described above both manual and automated tf measurements were conducted in this study for the manual measurements durations of the monitored rainfall events ranged from one to several days and did not include small events fig 2 and table 4 fig s2 shows the selected datasets with comparable pg values 15 mm pg less than 60 mm obtained by manual and automated measurements at site b in 2011 the manually measured tf values were slightly smaller and those of ic were slightly larger than those obtained from the automated measurements fig s2 for the full datasets the differences in tf pg and ic pg were similar table 3 given that sites b and b 1 are very similar table 1 both the manually and automatically measured tf values provide reliable information for evaluating the canopy interception loss at the site 3 3 model application the values of all the parameters in the model are listed in table 4 s was determined from the regression line fitted to the scatter plot of tf versus pg for saturated rainfall events 0 5 mm fig 6 a and b for all of the 2009 datasets for site a the intercept of the fitted regression line was larger than 0 i e the relationship is ic 0 8476 pg 1 1446 it is questionable that ic is 1 1446 when there is no rain pg 0 thus only small rainfall events pg less than 60 mm were used to determine the value of s at site a fig 5a the regression lines fitted to the scatter plot of sf versus pg are shown in fig 5c and d based on these results values of st and pt were obtained and are listed in table 4 st and pt at site b were not measured in 2012 and 2014 therefore they were assumed to have the same values as in 2011 at site b similarly their values in 2009 were assumed to be the same as those in 2010 at site a the average evaporation rates for three different methods as described in section 2 3 are listed in table 4 the model run with wet evaporation rates calculated using the penman monteith method e p underestimated the cumulative ics for three years by 37 53 and 35 at site a and by 55 57 and 24 at site b respectively fig 6 except for 2009 and 2011 at site a the differences between the measurements and the results predicted by the model with e t derived from tf versus pg were less than 5 with the optimized e o the model was expected to yield satisfactory results the results simulated using e p are plotted against the measurements in fig 7 the nses of the model results were greater than 0 60 except at site a in 2009 table 5 summarizes the different components of ic predicted by the gash model using e o the results reveal that the majority of the interception loss occurred during the stage of evaporation from the saturated canopy during rainfall wsc at both sites 55 2 77 2 at site a and 50 6 83 3 at site b the second largest component occurred during the stage of evaporation after rainfall has ceased wa the events had enough total rainfall to saturate the canopy pg 18 8 mm correspondingly evaporation from the unsaturated canopy was 0 at site a the evaporation from the unsaturated canopy at site b was also smaller 0 5 5 7 the fractions of wetting up the canopy ww and evaporation from trunks wt were also very small the annual variations in the components indicated that evaporation from the unsaturated canopy after rainfall ceased and wetting up of the canopy increased whereas evaporation from the saturated canopy during rainfall decreased at the two sites in this study the revised gash model was most sensitive to the variations in e r at both sites fig 8 an increase or decrease of 50 in e r resulted in an increase or decrease of 35 and 37 in simulated ic at sites a and b respectively the model was found to be highly sensitive to the canopy parameter s an increase or decrease of 50 in s resulted in an increase or decrease of 12 and 9 in simulated ic at sites a and b respectively changes of 50 in the other parameters c sf pt resulted in changes of less than 5 in the simulated ic which indicates that the model is fairly insensitive to these variables 4 discussion 4 1 vegetation regrowth the trees at site a are younger than those at site b therefore the mean dbh basal area and above ground biomass are smaller at site a table 1 this may explain the greater standard errors in measured co and lai at site a than at site b see the error bars in fig 2 although the trees were older and lai was higher at site b than at site a the interception loss was generally larger at site a note that the tree species are different at both sites table 1 which may have resulted in the differences observed in the interception loss after the storm disturbance the vegetation recovered gradually many bent stems regrew and terminal and sprouting shoots grew on damaged trees new trees also grew in the area wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 the recovery in canopy structure resulted in an increasing lai and a decreasing co fig 2 until 2012 the changes in co and lai were rapid likely due to the quick regrowth of bent stems after 2012 the recovery slowed down and subsequent changes in co and lai were less pronounced however although lai increased during the 2010 2011 period the canopy openness was stable at site b zhang et al 2012 reported that a great number of large trees died at this site the death and regrowth of the trees may have been responsible for the different variation patterns of co and lai observed at the two sites 4 2 the effect of vegetation regrowth on interception the regrowth of the vegetation altered the values of the related interception parameters such as s c and e r thereby influencing ic at both sites s was tripled table 3 which is consistent with the variations in lai observed during the study periods fig 2 the results support the finding that lai is the main factor that determines the interception loss van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 some previous studies reported that s and lai are linearly related spittlehouse and black 1981 deguchi et al 2006 however in the present study positive but nonlinear relationships were observed in three years of comparisons the sensitivity of model parameters as shown in fig 8 are consistent with those reported in previous studies e g fathizadeh et al 2018 ma et al 2019 during the study period c increased slightly at both sites although the model was less sensitive to parameter c the most sensitive parameters i e s were strongly related to c reflecting its implicit effect on ic at site a the average rainfall intensity r in 2010 was smaller than in the other two years table 4 however the r values during the study years at site b were similar table 4 the average e p values in the study period were considerably smaller than the fitted e t and optimized e o similar large discrepancies have been reported in other interception studies ghimire et al 2012 2017 mużyło et al 2012a wallace and mcjannet 2006 and were attributed to the underestimation of ga in areas of rugged topography or to the assumption of single big leaf characteristics which ignored complicated vegetation structures in the penman monteith equation holwerda et al 2012 ghimire et al 2012 however unlike parameters s and c the evaporation rates e p e t and e o were not found to increase with vegetation regrowth implying that evaporation rates are affected by not only vegetation but also climate conditions for the same values of parameters s and c as in the first year the interception loss was modeled for three years at sites a and b fig 9 if the vegetation conditions were constant the cumulative interception loss for the three years would be lower i e 88 and 87 of the measurements for sites a and b respectively the fractions of the components of ic also varied during the vegetation recovery periods table 5 wa dramatically increased table 5 because the saturated vegetation stored a large amount of water i e s increased table 4 wuc and ww slightly increased although these fractions were not detected at site a owing to the absence of smaller events consequently the largest fraction i e wsc decreased the interception loss is an important component of the water cycle in forest ecosystems and affects the amount of water entering the soil profile the vegetation water uptake and microclimate conditions hormann et al 1996 komatsu et al 2007 sun et al 2015 therefore a detailed understanding of the variations of the components of interception loss would help to improve the understanding of the ecohydrological functions in this recovered ecosystem 4 3 interception recovery from the disturbance the interception recovery from the disturbance table 3 depends on the increase in the canopy cover and water storage due to vegetation regrowth table 4 the responses of interception loss to vegetation changes determined in this study are compared with the other reported causes such as seasonal leaf cycles of deciduous forests forest successions and forest thinning table 6 for instance the ic pg increased by 23 1 owing to the lai increase of 161 2 from dormant to growing season in a deciduous broad leaved secondary forest in japan deguchi et al 2006 although the differences are comparable with this study the seasonal lai variation was greater indicating the less sensitivity of seasonal ic to lai the previous results indicate a significant response of ic to forest thinning for instance limousin et al 2008 found that after thinning in a quercus ilex forest in southern france the lai decreased by 48 4 and correspondingly ic pg decreased of 34 6 molina and del campo 2012 reported a 64 6 reduction in ic pg caused by 80 8 lai decrease after heavy thinning in pinus halepensis forests mazza et al 2011 demonstrated that lai decreased by 62 8 and 44 4 within two subplots in a pinewood forest in italy and this resulted in 57 7 and 35 5 ic respectively meanwhile it was found that the interception and throughfall during the recovery periods were more sensitive to smaller storms see figs 4 and 5 during small rainfall events most of the pg is stored in the canopy as a result of small rainfall intensities and long rainfall durations for several events in contrast the canopy is saturated during larger storms and a considerable portion of pg drips through the canopy as throughfall increasing the canopy drip fraction fathizadeh et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2015 thus the effect of canopy structure on rainfall partitioning is more significant for small rainfall events loustau et al 1992 deguchi et al 2006 rainfall interception losses have also been shown to increase with the age of regrowth and lai ghimire et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2013 inferred that major increases of ic pg occurred during the first 10 years of forest recovery in panamá however in other areas e g eastern amazonia brazil interception values were observed to be already similar to those in old growth forests after less than 5 years of regrowth hölscher et al 1998 with respect to the interception loss in subtropical areas in southern china liu et al 2016 reported that the canopy interception in the subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest in dinghushan in southern guangdong province accounted for 26 3 of the total rainfall observations at a distance of 2 km from the study area revealed that the secondary evergreen broadleaf forest could intercept 21 of the total rainfall qiu et al 2011 during the last year of measurements in our study the ic pg increased to 18 6 and 16 4 at sites a and b respectively which suggests that the interception capacity was not fully recovered within the first 5 7 years after the disturbance our findings differ from other studies regarding post disturbance interception recovery for instance zhang et al 2019 found the interception of 23 year old multi species reforest was 18 of precipitation before typhoon haiyan 12 for the period with the most extensive canopy damage and 17 5 after initial canopy recovery between june 2013 and may 2014 in the central philippines scatena et al 1996 reported rainfall and throughfall measurements for the bisley forest in puerto rico indicating a return to normal tf pg ratios within a year after forest wreckage by hurricane hugo hence compared to other post disturbance studies our results highlight the need for future long term monitoring studies to evaluate the interception recovery from the 2008 ice and snow storm in southern china 4 4 implications of interception recovery on catchment hydrological response the interception loss increase and throughfall decrease during the monitored period possibly impacted the hydrological cycles at the catchment scale more water stored in the canopy and less sunlight penetrating through the canopy could alter the potential canopy and floor evaporation and the transpiration rates furthermore less water reaching the ground and high water retention in the floor layers could reduce infiltration and result in slow soil saturation wang et al 2013 reduced throughfall amounts infiltrating in the soil layers falling on the channel network or on saturated areas close to the stream can affect the relation between event stormflow with pg tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 or the sum of pg and an antecedent soil moisture index pg asi detty and mcguire 2010 in a previous work we measured streamflow at the outlet of the small catchment 2 85 km2 where the site b used in this study is located wei et al 2019 we observed that the thresholds of pg and pg asi within top 100cm soil layer required to trigger stormflow slightly increased from 2011 to 2015 particularly for small rainfall events pg 40 mm or pg asi 230 mm wei et al 2019 this was possibly attributed to enhanced canopy interception as indicated in this study and slow soil saturation in the topsoil during the vegetation regrowth however the pg required for transition from slow to rapid responses of stormflow did not increase implying that the vegetation regrowth had limited effect on the quick response of streamflow i e the rise in thresholds or peak discharge during large storms wei et al 2019 thus the biophysical characteristics at the study plots helped to better understand the threshold behaviors of runoff generation in this catchment 5 conclusions in this study the rainfall interception loss in a recovering evergreen forest area in southern china was evaluated using multiple year field measurements and the revised gash model the vegetation exhibited gradual regrowth after the severe ice and snow storm event that occurred in 2008 as evidenced by the doubling of lai from 2010 to 2014 the canopy regrowth caused the throughfall rate to decrease by 7 5 from 2009 to 2011 at site a and by 3 5 from 2011 to 2014 at site b and resulted in the interception rate to increase by 6 2 and 3 6 at sites a and b respectively the quantification of the variations in ic and its components conducted in this study is useful for assessing the vegetation regrowth and the interactions with hydrological processes in headwater catchments the results obtained by the application of the revised gash model showed that the vegetation canopy storage capacity s and the vegetation cover factor c increased with increasing lai resulting in an increase in the interception loss and in the variation of its components the rise in the interception loss likely affected the increase in the threshold total gross precipitation and in the threshold sum of precipitation and an antecedent soil moisture index required for runoff generation during small rainfall events at site b comparisons with ic estimated in nearby undamaged secondary forests suggest that the interception capacity in the study sites was not fully recovered in the first 5 7 years following the storm disaster the results of this study imply that further investigations for a longer monitoring period are needed to evaluate the interception recovery from the disastrous ice and snow storm that

5156,canopy interception is an important component of the hydrological cycle of forested catchments and is influenced by variations in the canopy structure extreme meteorological events can have a destructive impact on forest density and structure and affect the rainfall partitioning by the canopies despite extensive investigation of throughfall and stemflow the response of rainfall interception loss to post disturbance vegetation recovery is still poorly understood in this work we examined the variations in the canopy structure and rainfall interception recovery after a destructive ice and snow storm that occurred in southern china in 2008 rainfall partitioning into throughfall and stemflow were measured for multiple years at two damaged sites on nanling mountain while the interception loss was modeled using the revised gash model the results showed that the vegetation leaf area index lai doubled from 2010 to 2014 this recovery caused the throughfall rate to decrease and the interception rate to increase the application of the revised gash model indicates that the vegetation canopy storage capacity s and vegetation cover factor c increased with the lai resulting in an increase in the interception loss and variations in its components the interception recovery at the study plots provide a biophysical explanation for the threshold behaviors of runoff generation at catchment scale comparisons with canopy interception measurements from nearby undamaged secondary forests suggest that interception capacity in the study plots was not fully recovered for the first 5 7 years after the disturbance indicating that measurements for a longer duration are needed to evaluate the interception recovery from that great disturbance keywords interception loss

disturbances e g insect infestation extreme flooding or drought climate shifts mirus et al 2017 snow and ice storms are the most frequent and damaging disturbances in mountain forests irland 2000 bragg et al 2003 for instance ice storms are primarily phenomena of north america lafon 2004 across the united states on average 16 ice storms occurred each year from 1982 to 1994 and caused an annual

research towards the impact of ice and snow storms on the ecology and biodiversity of forests the effects on ecohydrological processes are seldom considered ice and snow storms can damage various vegetation layers including forest canopies which partition gross precipitation pg measured in mm into three fractions interception loss ic in mm throughfall tf in mm and stemflow sf in mm forest canopy interception has long been recognized as important to ecohydrological and biogeochemical processes as 10 50 of the total precipitation is temporarily stored by and evaporated from the canopy dykes 1997 llorens et al 1997 klaassen et al 1998 schellekens et al 1999 iida et al 2017 van stan et al 2016 the canopy structure has been identified as an important driver of interception ma et al 2019 crockford and richardson 2000 canopy structures are non stationary due to seasonal variations van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 deguchi et al 2006 mużyło et al 2012b fathizadeh et al 2018 vegetation destruction and regrowth also determine the structural characteristics of forests which in turn affect canopy interception and hence the hydrological functioning of secondary forests zhang et al 2012 zimmermann et al 2013 however previous studies that investigated disturbance hydrology mainly compared canopy interception at a short time scale e g before and after the disturbances sun et al 2015 whereas only a few studies investigated canopy interception recovery processes for a long time period e g two years in cisneros vaca et al 2018 for forest ecology and catchment water resource management it is important to quantify the severity of the impacts of disturbances on hydrologic properties and relevant ecohydrological processes and to assess the return period and the duration of hydrologic drivers in comparison to potential timescales of recovery ebel and mirus 2014 hallema et al 2017 ebel et al 2016 hence in this study we investigated the rainfall interception recovery i e the temporal changes in rainfall interception and partitioning in response to forest regrowth in the nanling mountain region of china where almost all of the trees at altitudes between 500 and 1000 m were damaged after the 2008 ice and snow storm li 2008 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 assess the forest canopy regrowth up to 7 years after the storm 2 quantify how the changes in the canopy structure impact on rainfall partitioning and 3 evaluate the rainfall interception recovery during the study period 2 methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in the yangdongshan and shierdushui provincial natural reserve yspnr along the southern slope of the nanling mountain range the region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoonal climate the rainy season is from april to september with a mean annual precipitation of 1700 1800 mm the coolest month is january with an average temperature of 8 10 c qiu et al 2011 the land use in the study area is an evergreen broadleaf secondary forest that regrew naturally after logging activities during the 1960s 1980s field surveys conducted after the 2008 ice and snow storm revealed that vegetation at the two sites fig 1 was severely damaged by the storm zhao et al 2008 li 2008 sustained snow pressure freezing and frost heaving and subsequent salvage logging left trees prone to physiological damage such as decapitation bending uprooting and stem and branch breakage splitting shao et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 wang 2012 sun et al 2012 hence plots at two sites a and b were chosen for post disturbance observations fig 1 2 2 field measurements rainfall partitions were measured in one plot at each site the characteristics of the trees in the plots are summarized in table 1 the dominant tree species at the two sites are daphniphyllum macropodum castanopsis carlesii castanopsis eyrei and castanopsis fordii approximately 90 of the trees within the plots were damaged zhang et al 2012 among the damaged trees trunks with a diameter at a breast height dbh of less than 5 cm were mainly bent whereas trees with dbhs of 5 10 cm were mainly damaged by crown or trunk breakage and uprooting the vegetation at site a with a smaller mean dbh was more severely damaged than that at site b zhao et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 starting in 2009 throughfall and stemflow were measured manually event by event in a plot at site a table 1 the values of various meteorological parameters including gross precipitation wind speed humidity air temperature and radiation were recorded in a nearby clearing approximately 80 m away from the plot using an automated meteorological station pc 3 jinzhou sunshine co ltd china thirty storage type rain containers 100 cm 20 cm 60 cm equipped with funnels were distributed within the plot 25 m 30 m at fixed positions after a preliminary analysis of the spatial heterogeneity using the coefficient of variation cv of the throughfall in the study area the measured throughfall volume ml in the funnel of each container was converted to the throughfall depth mm stemflow was measured on six trees considered to be representative of the dominant species in the plots after 2010 each setup consisted of a halved plastic tube wrapped around the tree stem in a spiral fashion the gaps between the stem and the plastic tube were filled with a silicone sealant to avoid stemflow loss the end of the tube was connected to a container for measurement stemflow at the plot level was calculated with respect to a unit ground area by multiplying the average stemflow per species by the corresponding density of the trees using the same method as for the plot at site a tf and sf were initially measured manually for a plot at site b site b 1 in table 1 from 2010 because site b 1 is relatively remote and hard to access in 2011 a new plot site b in table 1 15 m 25 m was set at approximately 200 m to the east of site b 1 the vegetation at site b was similar to that at site b 1 table 1 the values of meteorological parameters e g air temperature wind velocity humidity radiation at heights of 7 15 22 and 30 m on a 30 m meteorological tower were automatically monitored at 15 30 min intervals cr3000

used at site b 1 rainfall events at site b were defined as events with more than 0 1 mm of rainfall separated by at least six hours of no precipitation the total interception loss was assumed to be

fisheye lens canopy openness co in m2 m2 lai in m2 m2 and gap light index gli were calculated from the digital photographs with gap light analyzer beaudet and messier 2002 2 3 revised gash model in this study ic was modeled using the revised gash model gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 the analysis method used in the gash model is simple flexible and has relatively few parameter requirements the model assumes that rainfall occurs as a series of discrete events with sufficient time between them to completely dry the canopy and the trunk the gash model differentiates among three phases in a rainfall event i the wetting up phase during which pg is less than the threshold value required to saturate the canopy pg in mm ii the saturation phase during which the average rainfall intensity r in mm h exceeds the average evaporation rate e in mm h from the fully wetted canopy and iii the drying phase after the rainfall has ceased table 2 briefly summarizes the respective equations used in the model detailed descriptions are provided in gash et al 1995 the revised gash model introduces as an input parameter a free throughfall coefficient p which reflects the amount of rain that falls directly to the forest floor without touching the canopy gash et al 1995 in practice p is often assumed to be 1 c the parameter c is the canopy cover fraction which is calculated as a function of lai using the beer lambert equation van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 1 c 1 e k l a i where k is the extinction coefficient which is the ratio between the foliage area projected on the horizontal plane and the total foliage area above the horizontal region oker blom and kellomäki 1982 the gli a measure of light extinction through the canopy e g photosynthetically active radiation can be used to assess lai based on the relationship between lai and forest light conditions maass et al 1995 beaudet and messier 2002 2 gli e k l a i the value of k can be estimated from measured gli and lai and the value of c can be estimated using eq 1 as no lai data were obtained in 2009 at site a c for this year was linearly extrapolated based on the measurements at that site the forest canopy capacity s in mm is defined as the amount of water left on the canopy in zero evaporation conditions when rainfall and throughfall have ceased gash and morton 1978 in the present study s is determined from the negative intercept of the regression line fitted to the scatter plot of throughfall versus incident rainfall for saturating events i e s tf when pg 0 gash and morton 1978 similarly the trunk storage capacity st in mm and stemflow partitioning coefficient pt were estimated as the negative intercept and the slope respectively of the linear regression line between the stemflow and gross precipitation gash 1979 the amount of water needed to saturate the canopy is calculated as follows gash et al 1995 3 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r where sc in mm is the canopy storage capacity per unit area of ground cover defined as sc s c and e c in mm h is the mean evaporation rate from the saturated canopy during rainfall defined as e c e c in this study e was estimated using three methods the first method is based on the hourly average penman monteith estimates of the evaporation rate under saturated conditions considering a rainfall threshold of 0 5 mm h assuming zero canopy conductance gash and morton 1978 hereinafter referred to as e p in the second method the mean evaporation rate e t was derived from the value of e t r as estimated from the linear regression relationship between pg and ic gash 1979 in the third method the mean evaporation rate e o was optimized by minimizing the root mean square error between the simulated and observed interception losses for all rainfall events ghimire et al 2017 the model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse the closer the model efficiency is to 1 the more accurate the model is krause et al 2005 the values of the parameters s c e r pt and st were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values to assess the sensitivity of the modeled results to the parameters in the present case study the modeled results were compared to the measured ic 3 results 3 1 temporal changes in canopy structure the vegetation structure was characterized by the vegetation co and lai fig 2 at the measurement sites a and b the annual average co decreased by 2 3 from 2010 to 2014 i e from 0 32 and 0 22 to 0 1 and 0 07 for sites a and b respectively during the same period the lai values increased from 1 7 and 1 9 to 2 8 and 3 3 for sites a and b respectively i e nearly doubling by 2014 the variations in co were larger at site a and decreased from 2010 to 2014 at both sites as expected based on co measurements the annual gli value decreased from approximately 0 40 to 0 17 and 0 12 for sites a and b respectively based on eq 2 and the relationship between ln gli and lai fig s1 the estimated values of k at sites a and b were 0 64 and 0 66 respectively 3 2 measured rainfall partitioning tf and sf were manually measured at site a from 2009 to 2011 table 3 pg ranged from 18 8 mm to 131 8 mm and was less than 50 mm for half of the events fig 3 the maximum of annual average cv of tf measured using individual gauges was 36 7 sf was measured starting in may 2010 given that sf was very low table 3 the unmeasured proportion of stemflow in 2009 was assumed to be the same as in 2010 to calculate the ic the three year average ratios of throughfall tf pg stemflow sf pg and calculated interception loss ic pg were 82 1 6 and 16 4 respectively annual ic pg increased and tf pg decreased from 2009 to 2011 the trend was more obvious for smaller rainfall events 60 mm fig 3 table 3 also lists the manual measurements of pg and partitioning into tf sf and ic for 30 events at site b 1 in 2011 the pg ranged from 16 2 to 100 5 mm with an average value of 41 8 mm 83 4 pg reached the ground as tf and the interception ratio was 13 0 the cv of tf was 23 7 which was slightly smaller than that at site a sf was also very small and only accounted for 2 7 of pg rainfall and throughfall were automatically recorded from june 2011 to may 2012 and from march to september 2014 table 3 pg of 213 events ranged from 0 1 to 71 9 mm with an average of 10 6 mm sf was only measured in 2011 and was assumed to have the same value in 2012 and 2014 the three years average tf pg and ic pg were 83 8 and 14 3 respectively from 2011 to 2014 tf pg decreased from 85 2 to 81 8 and ic pg increased from 12 8 to 16 4 fig 4 shows the comparisons of the tf and ic in the same seasons between the first june 2011 may 2012 and second periods march 2014 september 2014 decreases in tf and increases in ic are evident in these comparisons as described above both manual and automated tf measurements were conducted in this study for the manual measurements durations of the monitored rainfall events ranged from one to several days and did not include small events fig 2 and table 4 fig s2 shows the selected datasets with comparable pg values 15 mm pg less than 60 mm obtained by manual and automated measurements at site b in 2011 the manually measured tf values were slightly smaller and those of ic were slightly larger than those obtained from the automated measurements fig s2 for the full datasets the differences in tf pg and ic pg were similar table 3 given that sites b and b 1 are very similar table 1 both the manually and automatically measured tf values provide reliable information for evaluating the canopy interception loss at the site 3 3 model application the values of all the parameters in the model are listed in table 4 s was determined from the regression line fitted to the scatter plot of tf versus pg for saturated rainfall events 0 5 mm fig 6 a and b for all of the 2009 datasets for site a the intercept of the fitted regression line was larger than 0 i e the relationship is ic 0 8476 pg 1 1446 it is questionable that ic is 1 1446 when there is no rain pg 0 thus only small rainfall events pg less than 60 mm were used to determine the value of s at site a fig 5a the regression lines fitted to the scatter plot of sf versus pg are shown in fig 5c and d based on these results values of st and pt were obtained and are listed in table 4 st and pt at site b were not measured in 2012 and 2014 therefore they were assumed to have the same values as in 2011 at site b similarly their values in 2009 were assumed to be the same as those in 2010 at site a the average evaporation rates for three different methods as described in section 2 3 are listed in table 4 the model run with wet evaporation rates calculated using the penman monteith method e p underestimated the cumulative ics for three years by 37 53 and 35 at site a and by 55 57 and 24 at site b respectively fig 6 except for 2009 and 2011 at site a the differences between the measurements and the results predicted by the model with e t derived from tf versus pg were less than 5 with the optimized e o the model was expected to yield satisfactory results the results simulated using e p are plotted against the measurements in fig 7 the nses of the model results were greater than 0 60 except at site a in 2009 table 5 summarizes the different components of ic predicted by the gash model using e o the results reveal that the majority of the interception loss occurred during the stage of evaporation from the saturated canopy during rainfall wsc at both sites 55 2 77 2 at site a and 50 6 83 3 at site b the second largest component occurred during the stage of evaporation after rainfall has ceased wa the events had enough total rainfall to saturate the canopy pg 18 8 mm correspondingly evaporation from the unsaturated canopy was 0 at site a the evaporation from the unsaturated canopy at site b was also smaller 0 5 5 7 the fractions of wetting up the canopy ww and evaporation from trunks wt were also very small the annual variations in the components indicated that evaporation from the unsaturated canopy after rainfall ceased and wetting up of the canopy increased whereas evaporation from the saturated canopy during rainfall decreased at the two sites in this study the revised gash model was most sensitive to the variations in e r at both sites fig 8 an increase or decrease of 50 in e r resulted in an increase or decrease of 35 and 37 in simulated ic at sites a and b respectively the model was found to be highly sensitive to the canopy parameter s an increase or decrease of 50 in s resulted in an increase or decrease of 12 and 9 in simulated ic at sites a and b respectively changes of 50 in the other parameters c sf pt resulted in changes of less than 5 in the simulated ic which indicates that the model is fairly insensitive to these variables 4 discussion 4 1 vegetation regrowth the trees at site a are younger than those at site b therefore the mean dbh basal area and above ground biomass are smaller at site a table 1 this may explain the greater standard errors in measured co and lai at site a than at site b see the error bars in fig 2 although the trees were older and lai was higher at site b than at site a the interception loss was generally larger at site a note that the tree species are different at both sites table 1 which may have resulted in the differences observed in the interception loss after the storm disturbance the vegetation recovered gradually many bent stems regrew and terminal and sprouting shoots grew on damaged trees new trees also grew in the area wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 the recovery in canopy structure resulted in an increasing lai and a decreasing co fig 2 until 2012 the changes in co and lai were rapid likely due to the quick regrowth of bent stems after 2012 the recovery slowed down and subsequent changes in co and lai were less pronounced however although lai increased during the 2010 2011 period the canopy openness was stable at site b zhang et al 2012 reported that a great number of large trees died at this site the death and regrowth of the trees may have been responsible for the different variation patterns of co and lai observed at the two sites 4 2 the effect of vegetation regrowth on interception the regrowth of the vegetation altered the values of the related interception parameters such as s c and e r thereby influencing ic at both sites s was tripled table 3 which is consistent with the variations in lai observed during the study periods fig 2 the results support the finding that lai is the main factor that determines the interception loss van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 some previous studies reported that s and lai are linearly related spittlehouse and black 1981 deguchi et al 2006 however in the present study positive but nonlinear relationships were observed in three years of comparisons the sensitivity of model parameters as shown in fig 8 are consistent with those reported in previous studies e g fathizadeh et al 2018 ma et al 2019 during the study period c increased slightly at both sites although the model was less sensitive to parameter c the most sensitive parameters i e s were strongly related to c reflecting its implicit effect on ic at site a the average rainfall intensity r in 2010 was smaller than in the other two years table 4 however the r values during the study years at site b were similar table 4 the average e p values in the study period were considerably smaller than the fitted e t and optimized e o similar large discrepancies have been reported in other interception studies ghimire et al 2012 2017 mużyło et al 2012a wallace and mcjannet 2006 and were attributed to the underestimation of ga in areas of rugged topography or to the assumption of single big leaf characteristics which ignored complicated vegetation structures in the penman monteith equation holwerda et al 2012 ghimire et al 2012 however unlike parameters s and c the evaporation rates e p e t and e o were not found to increase with vegetation regrowth implying that evaporation rates are affected by not only vegetation but also climate conditions for the same values of parameters s and c as in the first year the interception loss was modeled for three years at sites a and b fig 9 if the vegetation conditions were constant the cumulative interception loss for the three years would be lower i e 88 and 87 of the measurements for sites a and b respectively the fractions of the components of ic also varied during the vegetation recovery periods table 5 wa dramatically increased table 5 because the saturated vegetation stored a large amount of water i e s increased table 4 wuc and ww slightly increased although these fractions were not detected at site a owing to the absence of smaller events consequently the largest fraction i e wsc decreased the interception loss is an important component of the water cycle in forest ecosystems and affects the amount of water entering the soil profile the vegetation water uptake and microclimate conditions hormann et al 1996 komatsu et al 2007 sun et al 2015 therefore a detailed understanding of the variations of the components of interception loss would help to improve the understanding of the ecohydrological functions in this recovered ecosystem 4 3 interception recovery from the disturbance the interception recovery from the disturbance table 3 depends on the increase in the canopy cover and water storage due to vegetation regrowth table 4 the responses of interception loss to vegetation changes determined in this study are compared with the other reported causes such as seasonal leaf cycles of deciduous forests forest successions and forest thinning table 6 for instance the ic pg increased by 23 1 owing to the lai increase of 161 2 from dormant to growing season in a deciduous broad leaved secondary forest in japan deguchi et al 2006 although the differences are comparable with this study the seasonal lai variation was greater indicating the less sensitivity of seasonal ic to lai the previous results indicate a significant response of ic to forest thinning for instance limousin et al 2008 found that after thinning in a quercus ilex forest in southern france the lai decreased by 48 4 and correspondingly ic pg decreased of 34 6 molina and del campo 2012 reported a 64 6 reduction in ic pg caused by 80 8 lai decrease after heavy thinning in pinus halepensis forests mazza et al 2011 demonstrated that lai decreased by 62 8 and 44 4 within two subplots in a pinewood forest in italy and this resulted in 57 7 and 35 5 ic respectively meanwhile it was found that the interception and throughfall during the recovery periods were more sensitive to smaller storms see figs 4 and 5 during small rainfall events most of the pg is stored in the canopy as a result of small rainfall intensities and long rainfall durations for several events in contrast the canopy is saturated during larger storms and a considerable portion of pg drips through the canopy as throughfall increasing the canopy drip fraction fathizadeh et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2015 thus the effect of canopy structure on rainfall partitioning is more significant for small rainfall events loustau et al 1992 deguchi et al 2006 rainfall interception losses have also been shown to increase with the age of regrowth and lai ghimire et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2013 inferred that major increases of ic pg occurred during the first 10 years of forest recovery in panamá however in other areas e g eastern amazonia brazil interception values were observed to be already similar to those in old growth forests after less than 5 years of regrowth hölscher et al 1998 with respect to the interception loss in subtropical areas in southern china liu et al 2016 reported that the canopy interception in the subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest in dinghushan in southern guangdong province accounted for 26 3 of the total rainfall observations at a distance of 2 km from the study area revealed that the secondary evergreen broadleaf forest could intercept 21 of the total rainfall qiu et al 2011 during the last year of measurements in our study the ic pg increased to 18 6 and 16 4 at sites a and b respectively which suggests that the interception capacity was not fully recovered within the first 5 7 years after the disturbance our findings differ from other studies regarding post disturbance interception recovery for instance zhang et al 2019 found the interception of 23 year old multi species reforest was 18 of precipitation before typhoon haiyan 12 for the period with the most extensive canopy damage and 17 5 after initial canopy recovery between june 2013 and may 2014 in the central philippines scatena et al 1996 reported rainfall and throughfall measurements for the bisley forest in puerto rico indicating a return to normal tf pg ratios within a year after forest wreckage by hurricane hugo hence compared to other post disturbance studies our results highlight the need for future long term monitoring studies to evaluate the interception recovery from the 2008 ice and snow storm in southern china 4 4 implications of interception recovery on catchment hydrological response the interception loss increase and throughfall decrease during the monitored period possibly impacted the hydrological cycles at the catchment scale more water stored in the canopy and less sunlight penetrating through the canopy could alter the potential canopy and floor evaporation and the transpiration rates furthermore less water reaching the ground and high water retention in the floor layers could reduce infiltration and result in slow soil saturation wang et al 2013 reduced throughfall amounts infiltrating in the soil layers falling on the channel network or on saturated areas close to the stream can affect the relation between event stormflow with pg tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 or the sum of pg and an antecedent soil moisture index pg asi detty and mcguire 2010 in a previous work we measured streamflow at the outlet of the small catchment 2 85 km2 where the site b used in this study is located wei et al 2019 we observed that the thresholds of pg and pg asi within top 100cm soil layer required to trigger stormflow slightly increased from 2011 to 2015 particularly for small rainfall events pg 40 mm or pg asi 230 mm wei et al 2019 this was possibly attributed to enhanced canopy interception as indicated in this study and slow soil saturation in the topsoil during the vegetation regrowth however the pg required for transition from slow to rapid responses of stormflow did not increase implying that the vegetation regrowth had limited effect on the quick response of streamflow i e the rise in thresholds or peak discharge during large storms wei et al 2019 thus the biophysical characteristics at the study plots helped to better understand the threshold behaviors of runoff generation in this catchment 5 conclusions in this study the rainfall interception loss in a recovering evergreen forest area in southern china was evaluated using multiple year field measurements and the revised gash model the vegetation exhibited gradual regrowth after the severe ice and snow storm event that occurred in 2008 as evidenced by the doubling of lai from 2010 to 2014 the canopy regrowth caused the throughfall rate to decrease by 7 5 from 2009 to 2011 at site a and by 3 5 from 2011 to 2014 at site b and resulted in the interception rate to increase by 6 2 and 3 6 at sites a and b respectively the quantification of the variations in ic and its components conducted in this study is useful for assessing the vegetation regrowth and the interactions with hydrological processes in headwater catchments the results obtained by the application of the revised gash model showed that the vegetation canopy storage capacity s and the vegetation cover factor c increased with increasing lai resulting in an increase in the interception loss and in the variation of its components the rise in the interception loss likely affected the increase in the threshold total gross precipitation and in the threshold sum of precipitation and an antecedent soil moisture index required for runoff generation during small rainfall events at site b comparisons with ic estimated in nearby undamaged secondary forests suggest that the interception capacity in the study sites was not fully recovered in the first 5 7 years following the storm disaster the results of this study imply that further investigations for a longer monitoring period are needed to evaluate the interception recovery from the disastrous ice and snow storm that occurred in southern china in 2008 credit authorship contribution statement lezhang wei conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing zhijun qiu investigation

5157,in this study a convolutional neural network cnn based approach is proposed to assess flood susceptibility for urban catchment nine explanatory factors covering precipitation topographical and anthropogenic aspects were selected and two cnns scnn and lenet 5 were implemented to identify the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 in the dahongmen catchment in beijing china the performance of the cnns was compared with that of support vector machine svm and random forest rf models for three model input strategies point based array based and imaged based strategies the results showed that 1 the two cnns performed better than the svm and rf with an accuracy of 0 90 for scnn and 0 88 for lenet 5 in the testing period 2 the cnn based approach provided more reliable flood susceptibility maps than the comparative models with the highest area under the curve auc index of 0 9 validating by another flood inventory 3 the upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurately identified by using point based and array based strategies these errors were corrected by considering topographical information using the imaged based cnn approach 4 the fixed architecture lenet 5 produced satisfactory results and avoided the time consuming process of architecture selection of cnn we conclude that the proposed cnn based approach is a valid approach and provides a high quality susceptibility map for urban mitigation and flood management keywords flood susceptibility urban catchment convolutional neural network 1 introduction flooding is regarded as one of the most destructive disasters for cities dhiman et al 2018 yin et al 2014 urban flooding typically causes significant loss of life and severe economic impact for the concentrated population and assets in cities ward et al 2017 hammond et al 2013 flood susceptibility assessment identifies potential flood prone areas and has played an important role in flood management and hazard mitigation zhao et al 2019b tehrany et al 2015 however compared with rural areas flood detection in urban areas is still at an early stage because of the complicated topographic features and drainage infrastructure mason et al 2010 hoang and fenner 2015 urban hydrodynamic models such as infoworks icm cheng et al 2020 mike urban bisht et al 2016 and swmm lisflood fp wu et al 2017 have been successfully applied for flood prone area detection in urban catchments these models simulate the physical process of floodwater generation and flow routing but require a large amount of data for model development and validation some data such as sewer system information and long term observed discharge data are difficult to collect in urban areas which limits the use of these physical models zhao et al 2019b as an alternative approach in data scarce areas machine learning models such as logistic regression pradhan 2010 artificial neural networks tehrany et al 2014a b support vector machines svms tehrany et al 2015 k nearest neighbor costache et al 2019 and random forest rf wang et al 2015 have been introduced in flood susceptibility assessment these models assess flood susceptibility by developing a point to point relationship between flood occurrences and their corresponding explanatory factors at flooded non flooded sites this point based strategy has achieved success for flood susceptibility assessment in several catchments worldwide tehrany et al 2014a b tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 romulus et al 2020 flooding is rarely an at a point phenomenon quinn et al 2019 floodwater generation and flow routing are highly influenced by the distribution of land use land cover and the topographical characteristics of the surrounding terrain naef et al 2002 zhao et al 2019a huang et al 2019 previous machine learning based assessment approaches did not consider the explanatory factors of the surrounding environment for model development because of the assumption that the factors at a point are sufficiently representative to describe the characteristics of its surrounding environment this assumption works well in natural homogeneous catchments but may be dangerous to apply in an urban catchment where the catchment surface is covered by a heterogeneous mixture of natural and artificial materials jilge et al 2017 a simple solution is to adopt all factors within the surrounding environment reshaping from images to arrays for model development however this array based strategy loses topological information during the reshaping process significantly increases the dimensions of the model inputs and easily leads to overfitting and poor model performance therefore an efficient image based classification model is required for flood susceptibility assessment for urban catchments the image based classification model has played an important role in the field of image recognition early image recognition techniques adopted the scale invariant feature transform lindeberg 2012 or histogram of oriented gradients rybski et al 2010 to extract topological information from the inputted images and then entering to machine learning models the poor generalization ability of these techniques was the main challenge until the emergence of the convolutional neural network cnn lecun et al 1998 by introducing convolutional layers to a fully connected neural network the cnns can automatically extract image features and greatly reduce the dimensions of neural network parameters during the training period cnns became dominant in image classification tasks after the success of lenet 5 an architecture of cnn for handwriting recognition lecun et al 1998 with the increase in computing power some deep cnn architectures such as alexnet ciresan et al 2011 vgg 16 simonyan and zisserman 2015 and googlenet russakovsky et al 2015 have been proposed and successfully applied to big data and complicated classification problems recently cnns have been introduced in precipitation data assimilation wu et al 2020 disaster detection amit et al 2016 landslide debris flow and also flood susceptibility assessment wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 based on remote sensing images and field survey to date wang et al 2020 compared three image based classification model frameworks cnn classifier with feature extraction svm classifier with feature extraction and svm classifier without feature extraction and revealed that the cnn produced more reliable flood susceptibility map than others despite wang et al 2020 successfully adopted the image based models in flood susceptibility assessment there are still unresolved research questions on the one hand most previous flood susceptibility assessments are developed based on the point based strategy tehrany et al 2014a b tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b the differences between the point based array based and image based strategies for flood susceptibility assessment are still lacking on the other hand wang et al s research identified the susceptibility of fluvial flood and high susceptibility areas were mainly distributed in the floodplain near river networks however pluvial flood is the main reason for urban flooding and the inundation sites in urban areas are mainly distributed in the local depressions sunken areas below the surrounding elevated terrain zhang and pan 2014 therefore topographical information of surrounding environments is important in urban inundation simulation zhao et al 2019a huang et al 2019 the cnns could use topographical information from surrounding environments and are introduced to assess the susceptibility of urban pluvial flood for this research the objective of this study is to propose a cnn based approach for flood susceptibility assessment in an urban catchment this approach can identify flood prone areas induced by pluvial flood considering topographical information in the surrounding environment nine explanatory factors and a historical flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 were used for model training and testing the results of the cnn models were compared with those of two widely used machine learning models svm and rf and the accuracy of the urban flood susceptibility maps was validated using another flood inventory from a heavy storm in the study area 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area description the dahongmen catchment is a representative urbanized catchment in beijing china the catchment area is 131 km2 and more than 90 of the catchment area has been modified from the rural to the urban area in the last two decades xu and zhao 2016 the dahongmen catchment is located upstream of the liangshui river and the river flows from northwest to southeast fig 1 the annual precipitation in this catchment is approximately 520 mm and approximately 80 of precipitation is distributed between july and october shi et al 2020 this catchment is one of the most flood prone areas in beijing during the storm of july 21 2012 note that this storm was the most disastrous in beijing in the last two decades approximately 30 of the inundation sites in beijing were distributed in this catchment 2 2 flood inventories two flood inventories from different data sources were adopted for model development and map validation inventory 1 comprised 202 flooded sites and 160 non flooded sites in the study area the flooded sites in inventory 1 were provided by the national disaster reduction centre of china this data were collected using a field survey after the flooding events the non flooded sites in the inventory 1 were selected from local elevated and high drainage capacity areas by zhao et al 2019a inventory 2 comprised 14 historical flooded sites during the heavy storm of july 21 2012 in beijing inventory 2 was collected from websites and georeferenced by zhao et al 2019b using a high resolution satellite image in the dahongmen catchment the distribution of historical flooded sites from inventories 1 and 2 is shown in fig 1 as shown in the fig 1 most inundations are distributed in local depressions of catchment this reveals that pluvial flood is the main reason of inundation in the dahongmen catchment in this study 60 and 40 of sites from inventory 1 were randomly selected for model training and testing respectively inventory 2 was used to validate the accuracy of the flood susceptibility maps simulated by different models 2 3 explanatory factors nine factors that described the precipitation topographical and anthropogenic characteristics of the catchment were collected for model development these nine factors were successfully proposed for urban flood susceptibility mapping in the metropolitan areas of beijing by zhao et al 2019b the explanatory factors are described as follows 1 the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation have a significant influence on the flood hydrograph singh and woolhiser 2002 and should be considered in flood susceptibility assessment wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the two precipitation factors are annual maximum daily precipitation ap and frequency of heavy rainstorms fp ap and fp describe the spatial distribution of the maximal value of daily precipitation and the frequency of heavy rainstorms daily precipitation 50 mm respectively the daily precipitation data for ap and fp estimation was collected from the china meteorological forcing dataset between 2004 and 2014 this dataset was created by fusing remote sensing products reanalyzed dataset and in situ observation data and provides high spatial temporal resolution gridded precipitation data chen et al 2011 yang et al 2010 nashwan et al 2019 2 the topographical factors were elevation ev slope sl topographic wetness index twi and distance to the river dri the ev was directly provided by the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem product tachikawa et al 2011 the sl was calculated using an average maximum technique burrough et al 2015 which represents the maximum rate of change of a value from that site to its neighbors the twi was proposed by beven and kirkby 1979 within the topmodel hydrological model and is defined as eq 1 it is commonly used to quantify topographic control on the hydrological process as well as biological processes sørensen et al 2006 the dri describes the euclidean distance to the nearest river and is one of the crucial factors in determining flood risk perception oneill et al 2016 the distribution of the river network in the dahongmen catchment was provided by the hydrographic station of beijing 1 twi l n a tan b where a is the upslope area per unit contour length and b is the local gradient in radians 3 the anthropogenic factors were the distance to the road dro drainage density dd and normalized difference built up index ndbi the immediate impact of an urban flood is that a road becomes the preferential path for floodwater yin et al 2016 singh et al 2018 the dro describes the euclidean distance to the nearest road the distribution of roads was collected from a basic dataset of roads in beijing the dd was proposed to describe the river density in a natural catchment horton 1945 zhao et al 2018 and was successfully extended to represent the drainage capacity in an urban catchment zhao et al 2019b the dd is defined as the total sewer length per unit area given in eq 2 the distribution of the sewer system in the study area was provided by the beijing municipal institute of city planning and design the ndbi is widely used to identify urban rural areas from satellite images zha et al 2003 varshney 2013 the ndbi was computed using eq 3 and based on landsat tm etm images between 2004 and 2014 as described in zhao et al 2019b 2 dd 1 s i 1 i l i s where s is the area of each grid and i is the number of major pipes in the grid additionally l is the total length of the major pipe within the grid 3 ndbi mir n i r mir n i r where mir is a middle infrared band and nir is a near infrared band in the landsat images the nine explanatory factors for model development are shown in fig 2 3 methods description as shown in fig 3 this study consists of three parts in part 1 the data preparation procedure for model training and testing is described nine explanatory factors representing precipitation topographical and anthropogenic characteristics and a historical flood inventory from 2004 to 2014 inventory 1 are adopted for model development 60 and 40 of samples in the inventory 1 were randomly selected for model training and testing respectively in part 2 the model implementation procedure and a comparison are presented in this part different types of machine learning models are developed based on three input strategies and five indices are applied for model evaluation the architecture of two cnns and two comparative models svm and rf are described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 respectively three model input strategies are described in section 3 3 in part 3 the validation procedure for flood susceptibility maps is explained flood susceptibility maps under different input strategies are compared at two representative areas in the catchment another online published flood inventory from a heavy storm in the dahongmen catchment inventory 2 is used to evaluate the map accuracy based on the area under the curve auc index the five indices for model evaluation in part 2 and the auc index for map validation in part 3 are described in section 3 4 3 1 convolutional neural networks cnn models originally invented for computer vision have achieved high accuracy for image related problems such as facial recognition and action recognition bhandare et al 2016 with the increase in computational power different cnn architectures have been established to solve increasingly complicated nonlinear problems in this study two cnn architectures simple cnn scnn and lenet 5 are adopted and described as follows 3 1 1 scnn model an scnn largely has five layers and can be regarded as the simplest architecture among all cnns the generalized architecture of an scnn is shown in fig 4 and includes one inputted layer one convolutional layer one pooling layer one fully connected neural network layer and one output layer unlike traditional neural networks an scnn uses a filter to extract features from inputted images and produce the convolutional layer to simplify the problem the shape of the input images and the filters is set to a square three architectures image width iw width of filters wf and number of filters nf mainly affect the capacity of feature extraction and determine the dimension of the convolutional layer in this study these architectures are selected using a trial and error method that depends on the model performance in the testing period the scnn was customized for flood susceptibility assessment by selecting the optimal architecture of convolutional layer the pooling size and number of neurons are set to 2 and 15 respectively to avoid overfitting a drop out strategy is applied to the fully connected layer and the drop rate is set to 0 2 3 1 2 lenet 5 model for deeper cnn architectures it is difficult to determine the optimal architectures of all layers therefore some fixed structure cnns such as lenet 5 alexnet vgg 16 and resnet 50 were proposed and demonstrated high generalization ability in image detection tasks lenet 5 proposed by lecun et al 1998 has a deeper architecture than an scnn the architecture and parameters in each layer of lenet 5 are shown in fig 5 it has one inputted layer two convolutional layers each followed by one pooling layer two fully connected neural network layers and one output layer the architecture of lenet 5 was firstly proposed for handwriting recognition el sawy et al 2016 and has been successfully extended to other image based classification problems li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 this research for the first time adopted lenet 5 for flood susceptibility assessment and compared with the scnn model the same drop out strategy used for the scnn is applied to the fully connected layer for lenet 5 3 2 comparative models two widely used machine learning models for flood susceptibility assessment that is svm and rf are adopted as comparative models tehrany et al 2014a b tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b the standard svm model was proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 and has been widely used in flood susceptibility assessment in several studies tehrany et al 2015 tehrany et al 2014a b choubin et al 2019 the svm rbf model adopted in this research was proposed by tehrany et al 2015 with a radial basis kernel function and outperformed linear polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions in flood susceptibility assessment the svm rbf model is implemented based on the fitsvm function in matlab https www mathworks com help stats fitrsvm html rf is a representative ensemble machine learning model and has shown advantages over traditional machine learning models in flood susceptibility mapping in several areas wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 by adopting the bootstrapping technique the input samples of the rf model are resampled into several subsets and the tree models are developed for each subset the final result of the rf model is determined by the majority results of all the tree models which avoids noise outliers and overfitting problems the rf model in this study is implemented based on the randomforest package in r software https cran r project org web packages randomforest randomforest pdf 3 3 input images traditional machine learning models such as rf and svm use a 1 n dimension array as the input sample where n is the number of factors for each sample each sample describes the point to point relationship between the flood occurrence and the explanatory factors at flooded or non flooded sites however for cnns the inputted samples are usually images and the dimensions of the inputted sample are iw iw n where iw is the width of the square images each sample in the cnn describes the characteristics at flooded or non flooded sites and their surrounding environment to better compare the model accuracy between svm rf and the two cnns three model input strategies are proposed as shown in fig 6 strategies 1 and 2 explain the process of two types of model inputs for the svm and rf models strategy 1 only uses the factors at flooded sites and non flooded sites this point based strategy is widely used in flood susceptibility assessment however the spatial information of surrounding environment is totally ignored in the point based strategy strategy 2 not only uses the factors at the flooded and non flooded sites but also included factors surrounding the flooded and non flooded sites for model implementation to satisfy the dimensions of the model inputs for the rf and svm models the input sample is reshaped from an image iw iw n to an array 1 niw 2 as shown in fig 6 2 the topological and geospatial information from the images are partly lost and significantly increase the dimension of the model inputs during the reshaping process strategy 3 describes the model input preparation for cnns cnns can directly use images as model inputs without the reshaping process and extract topological and geospatial information by convolutional layers 3 4 evaluation methods five widely used indices accuracy a precision p recall r f score f and kappa k were applied to evaluate model performance for the training and testing datasets selected from inventory 1 these indices were computed as eqs 4 to 8 respectively 4 a tp t n tp f p t n f n 5 p tp tp f p 6 r tp tp f n 7 f 2 p r p r 8 k a p e 1 p e where tp denotes true positive which is the number of samples correctly classified as flooded sites tn denotes true negative which is the number of samples correctly classified as non flooded sites fp denotes false positive which is the number of samples incorrectly classified as flooded sites fn denotes false negative which is the number of samples incorrectly classified as non flooded sites and pe denotes the hypothetical probability of chance agreement described in viera and garrett 2005 additionally an auc index was used to evaluate the accuracy of the flood susceptibility maps by comparing them with the observed flooded sites in the inventory 2 this auc index is widely used to evaluate the accuracy of susceptibility maps tehrany et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 althuwaynee et al 2012 bui et al 2012 the curve was created by plotting the cumulative percentage of flood susceptible areas on the x axis versus the cumulative percentage of flood events on the y axis the higher the value of the auc the greater the number of flooded sites that fall into the most susceptible areas 4 results analysis 4 1 model comparison in this section the performance of the cnns is compared with that of the two comparative models svm and rf under three model input strategies the results of these models under three strategies s1 s2 and s3 are shown in table 1 we observe that the model accuracies of s2 and s3 were obviously higher than that of s1 the accuracies of the svm and rf models increased from 0 71 and 0 78 in s1 to 0 84 and 0 86 in s2 as a result of considering the surrounding environment variables this shows that the factors around the location of flooded and non flooded sites play an important role for flood susceptibility assessment s3 achieved a higher accuracy than s2 with the same input factors the scnn and lenet 5 in s3 extracted topographical information from the input images in the convolutional process however this information was partly lost during the reshaping process in s2 and led to worse performance of the svm and rf models than cnns the rf model was more accurate than the svm model under both s1 and s2 which is consistent with the results of wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2018 according to the evaluation criteria of kappa k by landis and koch 1977 the svm and rf models in s1 demonstrated moderate performance 0 4 k 0 6 in the testing period the svm and rf models under s2 and the lenet 5 model under s3 demonstrated substantial performance 0 6 k 0 8 with a of 0 84 0 86 and 0 88 respectively the scnn achieved the highest performance among all the comparative models with the highest a of 0 90 and k of 0 81 in the testing period the high precision p 0 95 of the scnn and lenet 5 show that more than 95 of flooded sites were successfully identified in the testing period the flood susceptibility maps simulated by the six models under three strategies are shown as fig 7 the susceptibility maps were classified into five groups lowest low moderate high and highest using the natural break method in arcgis software as shown in fig 7 there are obvious differences in the susceptibility maps for different scenarios the flood susceptibility maps simulated under s1 have an obvious trend increase from upstream to downstream this trend is consistent with the change of elevation and this phenomenon is often observed in a fluvial flood which is flooding that typically occurs in the floodplain however for an urban catchment flooding caused by a pluvial flood in upstream depressed areas cannot be accurately explained under s1 as shown in the flood susceptibility maps under s2 this trend still exists but is less obvious more high susceptibility areas around road networks could be identified under s2 the flood susceptibility maps simulated using scnn and lenet 5 under s3 are similar the high susceptibility areas around road and in the depressions upstream are successfully simulated by two cnns under s3 4 2 map validation three flood susceptibility maps simulated using the best model in each strategy rf models in s1 and s2 and the scnn model in s3 were further validated by comparing them with the observed flooded sites from a heavy storm in the catchment the auc index was applied to the evaluation and the results are shown in fig 8 we found that the map simulated using scnn had the highest accuracy auc 0 90 the map under s2 provided satisfactory accuracy with an auc of 0 78 and the map under s1 provided the lowest accuracy with an auc of 0 68 this trend was similar to the model evaluation in section 4 1 the image based strategy significantly improved the accuracy of flood susceptibility map compared with the maps under point based and array based strategies two representative areas a1 and a2 located upstream and downstream of the catchment respectively were selected to further compare the flood susceptibility maps under different strategies three maps for each strategy were selected for comparison as shown in fig 9 we found that the maps under s1 and s2 underestimated the flood susceptibility and could not identify flooded sites in a1 however almost all of a2 was identified as highly susceptible in the map under s1 the maps under s2 and s3 successfully identified flooded sites in a2 with much smaller high susceptibility areas this indicates that the point to point strategy underestimated the upstream urban susceptibility and overestimated it in the downstream the image based cnn approach was superior in this circumstance 5 discussion as described in section 3 1 image width iw width wf and number of filters nf are three important architectures that affect the production of the convolutional layer for cnns the impact of these architectures on the scnn model performance was analyzed and is shown in fig 10 we found that iw was more sensitive than wf and nf for scnn performance iw determines the amount of information in each sample and the sample became more informative as iw increased the model accuracy in the testing period increased from 0 70 to 0 85 with a large iw at the start and became stable when iw was larger than 40 wf and nf describe the dimensions of the convolution filters which determine the capacity of information extraction the scnn accuracy fluctuated between 0 84 and 0 90 as wf and nf increased wf and nf were set to the best values of 2 and 6 respectively according to the highest model accuracy in the testing period the sensitive of iw indicated the size of input images played an important role in urban flood susceptibility assessment the inundations of urban flooding were mainly distributed in local depressions where the rainfall intensity exceeded the capacity of the drainage system jamali et al 2018 these depressions are sunken areas below the elevated terrain and can be identified considering the topographical information of surrounding environments zhao et al 2019b huang et al 2019 this is the main reason in contrast to those presented by wang et al 2020 who found that the model performance decrease with a larger iw in wang el al s research the inundations were induced by fluvial flood and the high susceptibility areas are mainly distributed in the floodplain near river networks by adopting the point to point strategy the floodplain in urban catchment can also be identified however this strategy is not suitable for urban flood susceptibility assessment as most urban pluvial flooding damage are claimed outside the mapped floodplain winters et al 2015 the image based cnn model could identify the depressions and are highly suitable for assessing the pluvial flood susceptibility in the heterogeneous urban catchment the scnn was designed for flood susceptibility assessment and achieved the highest accuracy among all models although the architecture of the scnn is simple it is still a time consuming task to find the optimal architectures for all layers the optimal filter size changes for different learning problems han et al 2018b zhang and wallace 2015 other architectures of the scnn such as the pooling strategy types of activation function and regularization strategies also affect model performance in this study the fixed architecture lenet 5 which was designed for handwriting recognition was applied for flood susceptibility assessment without an architecture selection process although lenet 5 underperformed the customized scnn model it outperformed the traditional rf and svm models for different model inputs this shows that the lenet 5 could be applied for flood susceptibility assessment and avoids the time consuming process of parameter selection in application different architectures of cnns from shallow to deep architectures were developed and has shown advantages in image based classification problems ciresan et al 2011 simonyan and zisserman 2015 russakovsky et al 2015 however deep cnns were not applied for this research by considering a trade off between the complication of model structure and training problem belkin et al 2019 most deep cnns were proposed for large images and multi class classification when shallow cnns are not works han et al 2018a flood susceptibility assessment can be regarded as a binary problem flooded and non flooded classification and the image size of this research 47 47 is small as the shallow cnns scnn and lenet 5 have shown high accuracy it is high risk to use a deep cnn model for flood susceptibility assessment also deep cnns e g alexnet vgg 16 and googlenet require a large amount of training samples because of the huge number of parameters needed to be tuned najafabadi et al 2015 however the flood inventories were usually collected from historical flooding events by field surveys and are insufficient for model training of deep cnns future studies should explore the effective utilization of flood inventories from satellite images or data augmentation techniques to improve the accuracy of deep cnns salamon and bello 2017 shahabi et al 2020 6 conclusions two cnns scnn and lenet 5 were developed and validated for urban flood susceptibility assessment based on nine explanatory factors and historical flood inventories two widely used models svm and rf were selected as comparative models and the results were compared under three model input strategies the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the proposed cnn based approach successfully identified the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood occurrence and it outperformed the comparative rf and svm models the scnn model had the highest prediction ability a 0 9 and k 0 81 in the testing period and outperformed the lenet 5 rf and svm models 2 the map produced by image based strategy provided the highest accuracy auc 0 90 than the maps produced by point based auc 0 68 and array based strategies auc 0 78 this shows that the image based strategy significantly improved the accuracy of flood susceptibility map 3 the upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurate identified by the point based and array based strategies these errors were corrected by the proposed image based cnn approach considering topographical information of surrounding environments overall the cnn based approach shows considerable promise for the assessment of flood susceptibility in an urban catchment and is a marked improvement over previous models considering the time consuming architecture selection for cnns the fixed architecture lenet 5 also achieved satisfactory results in this study the advantages of cnns for flood susceptibility mapping in urban areas was demonstrated the influence of the deep architecture of cnns on a flood susceptibility map should be further explored in the future study credit

5157,in this study a convolutional neural network cnn based approach is proposed to assess flood susceptibility for urban catchment nine explanatory factors covering precipitation topographical and anthropogenic aspects were selected and two cnns scnn and lenet 5 were implemented to identify the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 in the dahongmen catchment in beijing china the performance of the cnns was compared with that of support vector machine svm and random forest rf models for three model input strategies point based array based and imaged based strategies the results showed that 1 the two cnns performed better than the svm and rf with an accuracy of 0 90 for scnn and 0 88 for lenet 5 in the testing period 2 the cnn based approach provided more reliable flood susceptibility maps than the comparative models with the highest area under the curve auc index of 0 9 validating by another flood inventory 3 the upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurately identified by using point based and array based strategies these errors were corrected by considering topographical information using the imaged based cnn approach 4 the fixed architecture lenet 5 produced satisfactory results and avoided the time consuming process of architecture selection of cnn we conclude that the proposed cnn based approach is a valid approach and provides a high quality susceptibility map for urban mitigation and flood management keywords flood susceptibility urban catchment convolutional neural network 1 introduction flooding is regarded as one of the most destructive disasters for cities dhiman et al 2018 yin et al 2014 urban flooding typically causes significant loss of life and severe economic impact for the concentrated population and assets in cities ward et al 2017 hammond et al 2013 flood susceptibility assessment identifies potential flood prone areas and has played an important role in flood management and hazard mitigation zhao et al 2019b tehrany et al 2015 however compared with rural areas flood detection in urban areas is still at an early stage because of the complicated topographic features and drainage infrastructure mason et al 2010 hoang and fenner 2015 urban hydrodynamic models such as infoworks icm cheng et al 2020 mike urban bisht et al 2016 and swmm lisflood fp wu et al 2017 have been successfully applied for flood prone area detection in urban catchments these models simulate the physical process of floodwater generation and flow routing but require a large amount of data for model development and validation some data such as sewer system information and long term observed discharge data are difficult to collect in urban areas which limits the use of these physical models zhao et al 2019b as an alternative approach in data scarce areas machine learning models such as logistic regression pradhan 2010 artificial neural networks tehrany et al 2014a b support vector machines svms tehrany et al 2015 k nearest neighbor costache et al 2019 and random forest rf wang et al 2015 have been introduced in flood susceptibility assessment these models assess flood susceptibility by developing a point to point relationship between flood occurrences and their corresponding explanatory factors at flooded non flooded sites this point based strategy has achieved success for flood susceptibility assessment in several catchments worldwide tehrany et al 2014a b tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 romulus et al 2020 flooding is rarely an at a point phenomenon quinn et al 2019 floodwater generation and flow routing are highly influenced by the distribution of land use land cover and the topographical characteristics of the surrounding terrain naef et al 2002 zhao et al 2019a huang et al 2019 previous machine learning based assessment approaches did not consider the explanatory factors of the surrounding environment for model development because of the assumption that the factors at a point are sufficiently representative to describe the characteristics of its surrounding environment this assumption works well in natural homogeneous catchments but may be dangerous to apply in an urban catchment where the catchment surface is covered by a heterogeneous mixture of natural and artificial materials jilge et al 2017 a simple solution is to adopt all factors within the surrounding environment reshaping from images to arrays for model development however this array based strategy loses topological information during the reshaping process significantly increases the dimensions of the model inputs and easily leads to overfitting and poor model performance therefore an efficient image based classification model is required for flood susceptibility assessment for urban catchments the image based classification model has played an important role in the field of image recognition early image recognition techniques adopted the scale invariant feature transform lindeberg 2012 or histogram of oriented gradients rybski et al 2010 to extract topological information from the inputted images and then entering to machine learning models the poor generalization ability of these techniques was the main challenge until the emergence of the convolutional neural network cnn lecun et al 1998 by introducing convolutional layers to a fully connected neural network the cnns can automatically extract image features and greatly reduce the dimensions of neural network parameters during the training period cnns became dominant in image classification tasks after the success of lenet 5 an architecture of cnn for handwriting recognition lecun et al 1998 with the increase in computing power some deep cnn architectures such as alexnet ciresan et al 2011 vgg 16 simonyan and zisserman 2015 and googlenet russakovsky et al 2015 have been proposed and successfully applied to big data and complicated classification problems recently cnns have been introduced in precipitation data assimilation wu et al 2020 disaster detection amit et al 2016 landslide debris flow and also flood susceptibility assessment wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 based on remote sensing images and field survey to date wang et al 2020 compared three image based classification model frameworks cnn classifier with feature extraction svm classifier with feature extraction and svm classifier without feature extraction and revealed that the cnn produced more reliable flood susceptibility map than others despite wang et al 2020 successfully adopted the image based models in flood susceptibility assessment there are still unresolved research questions on the one hand most previous flood susceptibility assessments are developed based on the point based strategy tehrany et al 2014a b tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b the differences between the point based array based and image based strategies for flood susceptibility assessment are still lacking on the other hand wang et al s research identified the susceptibility of fluvial flood and high susceptibility areas were mainly distributed in the floodplain near river networks however pluvial flood is the main reason for urban flooding and the inundation sites in urban areas are mainly distributed in the local depressions sunken areas below the surrounding elevated terrain zhang and pan 2014 therefore topographical information of surrounding environments is important in urban inundation simulation zhao et al 2019a huang et al 2019 the cnns could use topographical information from surrounding environments and are introduced to assess the susceptibility of urban pluvial flood for this research the objective of this study is to propose a cnn based approach for flood susceptibility assessment in an urban catchment this approach can identify flood prone areas induced by pluvial flood considering topographical information in the surrounding environment nine explanatory factors and a historical flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 were used for model training and testing the results of the cnn models were compared with those of two widely used machine learning models svm and rf and the accuracy of the urban flood susceptibility maps was validated using another flood inventory from a heavy storm in the study area 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area description the dahongmen catchment is a representative urbanized catchment in beijing china the catchment area is 131 km2 and more than 90 of the catchment area has been modified from the rural to the urban area in the last two decades xu and zhao 2016 the dahongmen catchment is located upstream of the liangshui river and the river flows from northwest to southeast fig 1 the annual precipitation in this catchment is approximately 520 mm and approximately 80 of precipitation is distributed between july and october shi et al 2020 this catchment is one of the most flood prone areas in beijing during the storm of july 21 2012 note that this storm was the most disastrous in beijing in the last two decades approximately 30 of the inundation sites in beijing were distributed in this catchment 2 2 flood inventories two flood inventories from different data sources were adopted for model development and map validation inventory 1 comprised 202 flooded sites and 160 non flooded sites in the study area the flooded sites in inventory 1 were provided by the national disaster reduction centre of china this data were collected using a field survey after the flooding events the non flooded sites in the inventory 1 were selected from local elevated and high drainage capacity areas by zhao et al 2019a inventory 2 comprised 14 historical flooded sites during the heavy storm of july 21 2012 in beijing inventory 2 was collected from websites and georeferenced by zhao et al 2019b using a high resolution satellite image in the dahongmen catchment the distribution of historical flooded sites from inventories 1 and 2 is shown in fig 1 as shown in the fig 1 most inundations are distributed in local depressions of catchment this reveals that pluvial flood is the main reason of inundation in the dahongmen catchment in this study 60 and 40 of sites from inventory 1 were randomly selected for model training and testing respectively inventory 2 was used to validate the accuracy of the flood susceptibility maps simulated by different models 2 3 explanatory factors nine factors that described the precipitation topographical and anthropogenic characteristics of the catchment were collected for model development these nine factors were successfully proposed for urban flood susceptibility mapping in the metropolitan areas of beijing by zhao et al 2019b the explanatory factors are described as follows 1 the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation have a significant influence on the flood hydrograph singh and woolhiser 2002 and should be considered in flood susceptibility assessment wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the two precipitation factors are annual maximum daily precipitation ap and frequency of heavy rainstorms fp ap and fp describe the spatial distribution of the maximal value of daily precipitation and the frequency of heavy rainstorms daily precipitation 50 mm respectively the daily precipitation data for ap and fp estimation was collected from the china meteorological forcing dataset between 2004 and 2014 this dataset was created by fusing remote sensing products reanalyzed dataset and in situ observation data and provides high spatial temporal resolution gridded precipitation data chen et al 2011 yang et al 2010 nashwan et al 2019 2 the topographical factors were elevation ev slope sl topographic wetness index twi and distance to the river dri the ev was directly provided by the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem product tachikawa et al 2011 the sl was calculated using an average maximum technique burrough et al 2015 which represents the maximum rate of change of a value from that site to its neighbors the twi was proposed by beven and kirkby 1979 within the topmodel hydrological model and is defined as eq 1 it is commonly used to quantify topographic control on the hydrological process as well as biological processes sørensen et al 2006 the dri describes the euclidean distance to the nearest river and is one of the crucial factors in determining flood risk perception oneill et al 2016 the distribution of the river network in the dahongmen catchment was provided by the hydrographic station of beijing 1 twi l n a tan b where a is the upslope area per unit contour length and b is the local gradient in radians 3 the anthropogenic factors were the distance to the road dro drainage density dd and normalized difference built up index ndbi the immediate impact of an urban flood is that a road becomes the preferential path for floodwater yin et al 2016 singh et al 2018 the dro describes the euclidean distance to the nearest road the distribution of roads was collected from a basic dataset of roads in beijing the dd was proposed to describe the river density in a natural catchment horton 1945 zhao et al 2018 and was successfully extended to represent the drainage capacity in an urban catchment zhao et al 2019b the dd is defined as the total sewer length per unit area given in eq 2 the distribution of the sewer system in the study area was provided by the beijing municipal institute of city planning and design the ndbi is widely used to identify urban rural areas from satellite images zha et al 2003 varshney 2013 the ndbi was computed using eq 3 and based on landsat tm etm images between 2004 and 2014 as described in zhao et al 2019b 2 dd 1 s i 1 i l i s where s is the area of each grid and i is the number of major pipes in the grid additionally l is the total length of the major pipe within the grid 3 ndbi mir n i r mir n i r where mir is a middle infrared band and nir is a near infrared band in the landsat images the nine explanatory factors for model development are shown in fig 2 3 methods description as shown in fig 3 this study consists of three parts in part 1 the data preparation procedure for model training and testing is described nine explanatory factors representing precipitation topographical and anthropogenic characteristics and a historical flood inventory from 2004 to 2014 inventory 1 are adopted for model development 60 and 40 of samples in the inventory 1 were randomly selected for model training and testing respectively in part 2 the model implementation procedure and a comparison are presented in this part different types of machine learning models are developed based on three input strategies and five indices are applied for model evaluation the architecture of two cnns and two comparative models svm and rf are described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 respectively three model input strategies are described in section 3 3 in part 3 the validation procedure for flood susceptibility maps is explained flood susceptibility maps under different input strategies are compared at two representative areas in the catchment another online published flood inventory from a heavy storm in the dahongmen catchment inventory 2 is used to evaluate the map accuracy based on the area under the curve auc index the five indices for model evaluation in part 2 and the auc index for map validation in part 3 are described in section 3 4 3 1 convolutional neural networks cnn models originally invented for computer vision have achieved high accuracy for image related problems such as facial recognition and action recognition bhandare et al 2016 with the increase in computational power different cnn architectures have been established to solve increasingly complicated nonlinear problems in this study two cnn architectures simple cnn scnn and lenet 5 are adopted and described as follows 3 1 1 scnn model an scnn largely has five layers and can be regarded as the simplest architecture among all cnns the generalized architecture of an scnn is shown in fig 4 and includes one inputted layer one convolutional layer one pooling layer one fully connected neural network layer and one output layer unlike traditional neural networks an scnn uses a filter to extract features from inputted images and produce the convolutional layer to simplify the problem the shape of the input images and the filters is set to a square three architectures image width iw width of filters wf and number of filters nf mainly affect the capacity of feature extraction and determine the dimension of the convolutional layer in this study these architectures are selected using a trial and error method that depends on the model performance in the testing period the scnn was customized for flood susceptibility assessment by selecting the optimal architecture of convolutional layer the pooling size and number of neurons are set to 2 and 15 respectively to avoid overfitting a drop out strategy is applied to the fully connected layer and the drop rate is set to 0 2 3 1 2 lenet 5 model for deeper cnn architectures it is difficult to determine the optimal architectures of all layers therefore some fixed structure cnns such as lenet 5 alexnet vgg 16 and resnet 50 were proposed and demonstrated high generalization ability in image detection tasks lenet 5 proposed by lecun et al 1998 has a deeper architecture than an scnn the architecture and parameters in each layer of lenet 5 are shown in fig 5 it has one inputted layer two convolutional layers each followed by one pooling layer two fully connected neural network layers and one output layer the architecture of lenet 5 was firstly proposed for handwriting recognition el sawy et al 2016 and has been successfully extended to other image based classification problems li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 this research for the first time adopted lenet 5 for flood susceptibility assessment and compared with the scnn model the same drop out strategy used for the scnn is applied to the fully connected layer for lenet 5 3 2 comparative models two widely used machine learning models for flood susceptibility assessment that is svm and rf are adopted as comparative models tehrany et al 2014a b tehrany et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b the standard svm model was proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 and has been widely used in flood susceptibility assessment in several studies tehrany et al 2015 tehrany et al 2014a b choubin et al 2019 the svm rbf model adopted in this research was proposed by tehrany et al 2015 with a radial basis kernel function and outperformed linear polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions in flood susceptibility assessment the svm rbf model is implemented based on the fitsvm function in matlab https www mathworks com help stats fitrsvm html rf is a representative ensemble machine learning model and has shown advantages over traditional machine learning models in flood susceptibility mapping in several areas wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 by adopting the bootstrapping technique the input samples of the rf model are resampled into several subsets and the tree models are developed for each subset the final result of the rf model is determined by the majority results of all the tree models which avoids noise outliers and overfitting problems the rf model in this study is implemented based on the randomforest package in r software https cran r project org web packages randomforest randomforest pdf 3 3 input images traditional machine learning models such as rf and svm use a 1 n dimension array as the input sample where n is the number of factors for each sample each sample describes the point to point relationship between the flood occurrence and the explanatory factors at flooded or non flooded sites however for cnns the inputted samples are usually images and the dimensions of the inputted sample are iw iw n where iw is the width of the square images each sample in the cnn describes the characteristics at flooded or non flooded sites and their surrounding environment to better compare the model accuracy between svm rf and the two cnns three model input strategies are proposed as shown in fig 6 strategies 1 and 2 explain the process of two types of model inputs for the svm and rf models strategy 1 only uses the factors at flooded sites and non flooded sites this point based strategy is widely used in flood susceptibility assessment however the spatial information of surrounding environment is totally ignored in the point based strategy strategy 2 not only uses the factors at the flooded and non flooded sites but also included factors surrounding the flooded and non flooded sites for model implementation to satisfy the dimensions of the model inputs for the rf and svm models the input sample is reshaped from an image iw iw n to an array 1 niw 2 as shown in fig 6 2 the topological and geospatial information from the images are partly lost and significantly increase the dimension of the model inputs during the reshaping process strategy 3 describes the model input preparation for cnns cnns can directly use images as model inputs without the reshaping process and extract topological and geospatial information by convolutional layers 3 4 evaluation methods five widely used indices accuracy a precision p recall r f score f and kappa k were applied to evaluate model performance for the training and testing datasets selected from inventory 1 these indices were computed as eqs 4 to 8 respectively 4 a tp t n tp f p t n f n 5 p tp tp f p 6 r tp tp f n 7 f 2 p r p r 8 k a p e 1 p e where tp denotes true positive which is the number of samples correctly classified as flooded sites tn denotes true negative which is the number of samples correctly classified as non flooded sites fp denotes false positive which is the number of samples incorrectly classified as flooded sites fn denotes false negative which is the number of samples incorrectly classified as non flooded sites and pe denotes the hypothetical probability of chance agreement described in viera and garrett 2005 additionally an auc index was used to evaluate the accuracy of the flood susceptibility maps by comparing them with the observed flooded sites in the inventory 2 this auc index is widely used to evaluate the accuracy of susceptibility maps tehrany et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 althuwaynee et al 2012 bui et al 2012 the curve was created by plotting the cumulative percentage of flood susceptible areas on the x axis versus the cumulative percentage of flood events on the y axis the higher the value of the auc the greater the number of flooded sites that fall into the most susceptible areas 4 results analysis 4 1 model comparison in this section the performance of the cnns is compared with that of the two comparative models svm and rf under three model input strategies the results of these models under three strategies s1 s2 and s3 are shown in table 1 we observe that the model accuracies of s2 and s3 were obviously higher than that of s1 the accuracies of the svm and rf models increased from 0 71 and 0 78 in s1 to 0 84 and 0 86 in s2 as a result of considering the surrounding environment variables this shows that the factors around the location of flooded and non flooded sites play an important role for flood susceptibility assessment s3 achieved a higher accuracy than s2 with the same input factors the scnn and lenet 5 in s3 extracted topographical information from the input images in the convolutional process however this information was partly lost during the reshaping process in s2 and led to worse performance of the svm and rf models than cnns the rf model was more accurate than the svm model under both s1 and s2 which is consistent with the results of wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2018 according to the evaluation criteria of kappa k by landis and koch 1977 the svm and rf models in s1 demonstrated moderate performance 0 4 k 0 6 in the testing period the svm and rf models under s2 and the lenet 5 model under s3 demonstrated substantial performance 0 6 k 0 8 with a of 0 84 0 86 and 0 88 respectively the scnn achieved the highest performance among all the comparative models with the highest a of 0 90 and k of 0 81 in the testing period the high precision p 0 95 of the scnn and lenet 5 show that more than 95 of flooded sites were successfully identified in the testing period the flood susceptibility maps simulated by the six models under three strategies are shown as fig 7 the susceptibility maps were classified into five groups lowest low moderate high and highest using the natural break method in arcgis software as shown in fig 7 there are obvious differences in the susceptibility maps for different scenarios the flood susceptibility maps simulated under s1 have an obvious trend increase from upstream to downstream this trend is consistent with the change of elevation and this phenomenon is often observed in a fluvial flood which is flooding that typically occurs in the floodplain however for an urban catchment flooding caused by a pluvial flood in upstream depressed areas cannot be accurately explained under s1 as shown in the flood susceptibility maps under s2 this trend still exists but is less obvious more high susceptibility areas around road networks could be identified under s2 the flood susceptibility maps simulated using scnn and lenet 5 under s3 are similar the high susceptibility areas around road and in the depressions upstream are successfully simulated by two cnns under s3 4 2 map validation three flood susceptibility maps simulated using the best model in each strategy rf models in s1 and s2 and the scnn model in s3 were further validated by comparing them with the observed flooded sites from a heavy storm in the catchment the auc index was applied to the evaluation and the results are shown in fig 8 we found that the map simulated using scnn had the highest accuracy auc 0 90 the map under s2 provided satisfactory accuracy with an auc of 0 78 and the map under s1 provided the lowest accuracy with an auc of 0 68 this trend was similar to the model evaluation in section 4 1 the image based strategy significantly improved the accuracy of flood susceptibility map compared with the maps under point based and array based strategies two representative areas a1 and a2 located upstream and downstream of the catchment respectively were selected to further compare the flood susceptibility maps under different strategies three maps for each strategy were selected for comparison as shown in fig 9 we found that the maps under s1 and s2 underestimated the flood susceptibility and could not identify flooded sites in a1 however almost all of a2 was identified as highly susceptible in the map under s1 the maps under s2 and s3 successfully identified flooded sites in a2 with much smaller high susceptibility areas this indicates that the point to point strategy underestimated the upstream urban susceptibility and overestimated it in the downstream the image based cnn approach was superior in this circumstance 5 discussion as described in section 3 1 image width iw width wf and number of filters nf are three important architectures that affect the production of the convolutional layer for cnns the impact of these architectures on the scnn model performance was analyzed and is shown in fig 10 we found that iw was more sensitive than wf and nf for scnn performance iw determines the amount of information in each sample and the sample became more informative as iw increased the model accuracy in the testing period increased from 0 70 to 0 85 with a large iw at the start and became stable when iw was larger than 40 wf and nf describe the dimensions of the convolution filters which determine the capacity of information extraction the scnn accuracy fluctuated between 0 84 and 0 90 as wf and nf increased wf and nf were set to the best values of 2 and 6 respectively according to the highest model accuracy in the testing period the sensitive of iw indicated the size of input images played an important role in urban flood susceptibility assessment the inundations of urban flooding were mainly distributed in local depressions where the rainfall intensity exceeded the capacity of the drainage system jamali et al 2018 these depressions are sunken areas below the elevated terrain and can be identified considering the topographical information of surrounding environments zhao et al 2019b huang et al 2019 this is the main reason in contrast to those presented by wang et al 2020 who found that the model performance decrease with a larger iw in wang el al s research the inundations were induced by fluvial flood and the high susceptibility areas are mainly distributed in the floodplain near river networks by adopting the point to point strategy the floodplain in urban catchment can also be identified however this strategy is not suitable for urban flood susceptibility assessment as most urban pluvial flooding damage are claimed outside the mapped floodplain winters et al 2015 the image based cnn model could identify the depressions and are highly suitable for assessing the pluvial flood susceptibility in the heterogeneous urban catchment the scnn was designed for flood susceptibility assessment and achieved the highest accuracy among all models although the architecture of the scnn is simple it is still a time consuming task to find the optimal architectures for all layers the optimal filter size changes for different learning problems han et al 2018b zhang and wallace 2015 other architectures of the scnn such as the pooling strategy types of activation function and regularization strategies also affect model performance in this study the fixed architecture lenet 5 which was designed for handwriting recognition was applied for flood susceptibility assessment without an architecture selection process although lenet 5 underperformed the customized scnn model it outperformed the traditional rf and svm models for different model inputs this shows that the lenet 5 could be applied for flood susceptibility assessment and avoids the time consuming process of parameter selection in application different architectures of cnns from shallow to deep architectures were developed and has shown advantages in image based classification problems ciresan et al 2011 simonyan and zisserman 2015 russakovsky et al 2015 however deep cnns were not applied for this research by considering a trade off between the complication of model structure and training problem belkin et al 2019 most deep cnns were proposed for large images and multi class classification when shallow cnns are not works han et al 2018a flood susceptibility assessment can be regarded as a binary problem flooded and non flooded classification and the image size of this research 47 47 is small as the shallow cnns scnn and lenet 5 have shown high accuracy it is high risk to use a deep cnn model for flood susceptibility assessment also deep cnns e g alexnet vgg 16 and googlenet require a large amount of training samples because of the huge number of parameters needed to be tuned najafabadi et al 2015 however the flood inventories were usually collected from historical flooding events by field surveys and are insufficient for model training of deep cnns future studies should explore the effective utilization of flood inventories from satellite images or data augmentation techniques to improve the accuracy of deep cnns salamon and bello 2017 shahabi et al 2020 6 conclusions two cnns scnn and lenet 5 were developed and validated for urban flood susceptibility assessment based on nine explanatory factors and historical flood inventories two widely used models svm and rf were selected as comparative models and the results were compared under three model input strategies the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the proposed cnn based approach successfully identified the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood occurrence and it outperformed the comparative rf and svm models the scnn model had the highest prediction ability a 0 9 and k 0 81 in the testing period and outperformed the lenet 5 rf and svm models 2 the map produced by image based strategy provided the highest accuracy auc 0 90 than the maps produced by point based auc 0 68 and array based strategies auc 0 78 this shows that the image based strategy significantly improved the accuracy of flood susceptibility map 3 the upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurate identified by the point based and array based strategies these errors were corrected by the proposed image based cnn approach considering topographical information of surrounding environments overall the cnn based approach shows considerable promise for the assessment of flood susceptibility in an urban catchment and is a marked improvement over previous models considering the time consuming architecture selection for cnns the fixed architecture lenet 5 also achieved satisfactory results in this study the advantages of cnns for flood susceptibility mapping in urban areas was demonstrated the influence of the deep architecture of cnns on a flood susceptibility map should be further explored in the future study credit

5158,precipitation regionalization deals with an investigation of the seasonality and its temporal variability and is useful for a wide variety of applications in hydro meteorology the d homogeneous regions can be used as a basis for transforming the information from gauged to ungauged sites and can reduce the uncertainty in estimating the seasonal characteristics of precipitation across india despite several studies stressing the importance of seasonality and temporal variability to the environment there is a lack of studies on accounting for temporal variability in regionalization precipitation regionalization must account for both the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability at multiple time scales to extract the seasonality of a region representing coherent local and inter annual variability therefore in this study we propose a framework for precipitation regionalization considering both precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily precipitation time series over the period 1901 2013 from indian meteorological department imd was used for the evaluation of the framework first the historical daily time series was transformed into multiple time scales i e annual seasonal and monthly time scales entropy based standardized variability index was used to measure the inter annual variability of precipitation at each time scale regionalization of grid points was performed using self organizing maps an artificial neural network ten distinct regions were identified that can be tied back to two general categories such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics coupling of the self organizing map with standardized variability index reveals unique seasonal distribution of precipitation for each region the temporal evolution of clusters unravels a new emerging pattern across central india consideration of temporal variability plays an insignificant role in the shape size and stability of south central india south eastern coastlines and konkan coast intriguingly separate rain belt and rain shadow western himalayas are formed due to the difference in topography and seasonal characteristics of precipitation the temporal evolution of clusters unravels a significant change in the occurrence of the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across the north western region a significant increase in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across western india and decrease in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1980s in the north central region keywords precipitation regionalization spatiotemporal variability indian summer monsoon standardized variability index self organizing maps information theory 1 introduction regionalization a technique to identify homogenous regions in a particular aspect of a climate variable s of interest is crucial for numerous hydro meteorological applications brown et al 2010 these applications include regional flood frequency analysis sugahara et al 2009 yang et al 2010 zhang and singh 2006 precipitation forecasting and downscaling sehgal et al 2018 potential water resources availability maruyama et al 2005 climate dynamics deng et al 2019 geen et al 2018 jiménez esteve and domeisen 2019 zhao et al 2019 agricultural planning design of hydraulic structures adamowski 2000 among others regionalization can be used as a method to extend information beyond the gauge network and can provide planners and designers with a better alternative for the assessment of precipitation characteristics at ungauged sites than can traditional single site analysis alila 1999 however in many developing countries like india rain gauges are scarce information on the spatial distribution of precipitation as well as its temporal variability at ungauged sites can be gained by forming groups having similar precipitation characteristics hosking and wallis 1993 modarres 2008 saf 2009 there have been several attempts to delineate homogenous precipitation regions that include numerous statistical and conceptual techniques caliński and harabasz 1974 fraley 1998 rousseeuw 1987 these include correlation analysis gadgil et al 1993 saikranthi et al 2013 principal component analysis domroes et al 1998 iyengar and basak 1994 common factor analysis dinpashoh et al 2004 spectral analysis azad et al 2010 türkeş and tatlı 2011 hierarchical approach santos et al 2019 principal component analysis with hierarchical approach darand and mansouri daneshvar 2014 fazel et al 2018 k means carvalho et al 2016 and self organizing maps hsu and li 2010 among these the self organizing map som proposed by kohonen 2001 is found to be a robust clustering technique in creating soft boundaries and in handling large amounts of complex data lin and chen 2006 it is extensively used due to its competence in reducing high dimensional data to low dimensional data preferably to one or two while preserving the topology chen et al 2010 in the past som was used for the regionalization of catchments with similar hydrologic characteristics agarwal et al 2016a and grid points with similar precipitation and runoff events dilmi et al 2017 nourani et al 2013 wolski et al 2018 the key to all these methods is to define regions that need not be spatially contiguous but homogenous concerning the variable of interest and are sufficiently distinct from other regions the variable of interest could be a high intraregional correlation or low interregional correlation between members gadgil et al 1993 saikranthi et al 2013 statistical characteristics of daily precipitation such as standard deviation and skewness kulkarni 2017 geographical location principal components extracted from large scale atmospheric predictor variables satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 synchronicity of extremes agarwal et al 2018 periodicities in precipitation azad et al 2010 and variability at multiple time scales and their signature roushangar et al 2019 all these methods have contributed significantly to our understanding however there exists an enormous scope for advancement by accounting for the temporal variability of precipitation in delineating homogenous regions for instance homogenous regions developed by prior studies bharath and srinivas 2015 fukushima et al 2019 mannan et al 2018 saikranthi et al 2013 satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 used either the mean or total precipitation for identifying homogeneous regions on the contrary a few studies krstanovic and singh 1992 maruyama et al 2005 roushangar et al 2019 considered only the variability associated with precipitation parameters while disregarding the precipitation amount they were thus resulting in zones with similar variability but different precipitation magnitudes in recent decades a multitude of studies have reported a significant increase in the complexity of indian precipitation in terms of temporal variability as well as its uncertainty ghosh et al 2012 goswami et al 2006 paul et al 2018 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 besides there has been a significant increase in the magnitude of total annual precipitation rajeevan et al 2008 vul and mishra 2019 yadav and roxy 2019 motivated by these realizations we argue that regionalization studies must account for both the temporal variability and precipitation magnitude for robust identification of homogeneous regions therefore this study attempted to develop a regionalization framework accounting for both temporal variability and magnitude of precipitation in general temporal variability is defined as a measure of the unevenness of a random variable over different class intervals sang et al 2013 there is a plethora of metrics for assessing the variability of a time series including variance diversity indices and various measures based on shannon entropy guntu et al 2020a mishra et al 2009 in the past decade shannon entropy has gained significant attention in surface and sub surface hydrology koutsoyiannis 2005 molini et al 2006 singh 2015 2013 one of the main advantages of using shannon entropy is that it does not make any assumption on the probability distribution or statistical properties of data besides it can be applied to any type of distribution whether it is known or unknown or if the nature of the underlying system is dynamic guntu et al 2020b pechlivanidis et al 2016 kawachi et al 2001 proposed shannon entropy as precipitation entropy for assessing the temporal precipitation apportionment later maruyama et al 2005 modified precipitation entropy into intensity entropy and apportionment entropy for quantifying the intra annual variability of precipitation further these measures are applied by mishra et al 2009 to assess the intra annual variability of monthly precipitation and proposed marginal entropy to investigate the inter annual variability furthermore to have a single measure to represent both inter annual and intra annual variability mishra et al 2009 proposed a disorder index based on the difference between maximum possible entropy and entropy obtained for a time series in continuation cheng et al 2017 rodrigues da silva et al 2016 roushangar et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 used the disorder index to assess precipitation variability for different regions around the globe very recently guntu et al 2020a highlighted that though the disorder index is indeed beneficial however it is limited to the time scale of evaluation as well as the length of the data they modified the disorder index and proposed a new standardized variability index svi with capabilities to overcome the limitations of the disorder index it is found robust in comparing the inter annual and intra annual variability of precipitation at different time scales and for regions with different temporal records using svi this study developed a framework for precipitation regionalization based on precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability besides we aim to analyze the effects of non stationarity on regionalization from an abruptly changing climate point of view this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the proposed methodology with a brief description of marginal entropy standardized variability index and som clustering technique details of the study area and gridded precipitation data are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the application of the proposed methodology followed by the discussion of results finally section 5 presents some of the essential conclusions and scope for further research 2 study area and data the present study focuses on improving the precipitation regionalization by accounting for temporal variability and precipitation magnitude in the indian subcontinent which lies approximately between 8 and 37 n latitude and 68 98 e longitude covering an area of 3 287 590 km2 the climate of india comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography making generalization indeed tricky in the present study we used the gridded data of mean daily precipitation in mm developed by pai et al 2014 with a high spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 for a spatial domain of 66 5 e to 100 e and 6 5 n to 38 5 n covering the mainland region of india see fig s1 the gridded data was generated from a diverse network of 6995 gauging stations across india using inverse distance weighted idw interpolation scheme proposed by shepard 1968 the daily data were obtained for a period of 113 years 1901 2013 which was available in the archive of national data centre india meteorological department imd pune link to data is given in data sources in the past several studies have used the same dataset which includes downscaling sehgal et al 2018 spatiotemporal variability of precipitation guntu et al 2020a sahany et al 2018 extreme precipitation analysis agarwal et al 2018 malik et al 2016 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 intrinsic predictability of indian precipitation guntu et al 2020b and spatial diversity of indian precipitation teleconnections kurths et al 2019 among others the application of imd gridded data in various applications shows that the data is highly accurate and capable of capturing the spatial distribution of precipitation over the country 3 methods and methodology in this section first we explain the data preparation and computation of time series at different scales following that the standardized variability index svi and kohonen self organizing maps som are discussed furthermore we illustrate the combination of svi and som to regionalize precipitation 3 1 data preparation and computing time series at different time scales this choice of clustering variable i e time series of gridded precipitation at different time scales means that homogeneous regions are defined based on coherent climate variability at different time scales monthly seasonal and annual rather than mean climate conditions this is important as seneviratne et al 2012 say seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year due to local variability also kurths et al 2019 suggest that coherent inter annual variability shows a common response to large scale climate drivers when regionalization is applied to observations at different time scales then the approach can help us identify regions of common seasonality climate sensitivity and mechanisms that drive variability for each region therefore in the present study climate data was analyzed for four seasons 1 summer season march april may mam 2 south west monsoon season form june july august jja 3 autumn fall season during which most of the northeast monsoon occurs september october november son and 4 winter season december january february djf we investigate the inter annual variability of precipitation at monthly jan dec seasonal spring summer fall winter and annual time scales variability of seasonal precipitation e g summer over the 113 year period in this study provides an understanding of how summer precipitation varies over time similarly monthly precipitation e g june over the years helps quantify the precipitation variability in that month over the 113 years this detailed investigation of the precipitation patterns would provide a comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal precipitation variability the method for creating the time series at multiple time scales is presented next 3 1 1 formation of monthly time series january december to form monthly time series sum all days in a particular month for the year 1901 and the process is repeated for all the years monthly time series consists of 113 values each value represents total monthly precipitation for that particular year 1st to 12th row in table 1 3 1 2 formation of seasonal time series spring summer fall winter to form seasonal time series sum all days in a particular season for the year 1901 and repeat the process for all the years seasonal time series consists of 113 values each value represents the total seasonal precipitation for that particular year 13th 6th row in table 1 3 1 3 formation of annual time series annual the gridded data is available at daily time step to get annual values sum all the 365 days in the year 1901 and repeat the process for all the years annual time series consists of 113 values each value represents the total annual precipitation for that particular year 17th row in table 1 3 2 standardized variability index to introduce standardized variability index svi a background on marginal entropy and shannon entropy is necessary 3 2 1 shannon entropy shannon 1948 formulated the entropy concerning a concept called a surprise i e information regarding the uncertainty of the random variable or its probability distribution singh 2015 2013 1997 discussed the strengths of shannon entropy se and its limitations and accredited it to be a decision making tool in surface and sub surface hydrology the se can be defined as eq 1 1 s e x i 1 n c p x i log 2 p x i where se x represents the average information content of the random variable x with probability distribution function p x i log 2 p x i directly represents the average surprise about the value x i occurring with probability p x i gong et al 2014 and n c is the number of class intervals the unit of se depends on the base of the logarithm for example a unit of se is bits when the base is 2 napier for base e and decibels for base 10 here we used the logarithm with base 2 and se was measured in bits for a deterministic single outcome system the probability for a specific event that will take on value is one and for any other value is zero in such a case the average surprise is zero and this case corresponds to absolute certainty on the contrary for uniform distribution the average surprise yields no information about the possible outcome since every outcome has the same probability of occurrence and therefore corresponds to absolute uncertainty thus the value of s e x varies from zero to log 2 n c i e from complete information to no information about the system s state viewed in this manner se captures the spread of data and can be used for measuring the variability associated with the precipitation time series kawachi et al 2001 gong et al 2014 discussed the four problems of distribution based estimation in hydrological time series that could result in biased entropy estimation these are optimal bin width zero values measurement error and skewness effect weijs et al 2013 suggested that the optimal bin width consideration for evaluating the probability density function depends on the question one wishes to answer 3 2 2 marginal entropy the marginal entropy me used by mishra et al 2009 as a measure of the randomness of a random variable x with the probability distribution p x is useful in calculating the variability of the distribution and can be extended to any type of dataset for instance we considered total annual seasonal and monthly precipitation time series and applied me to assess the inter annual variability associated with individual time series individual seasons are compared to examine the interannual variability of seasonal precipitation within the year and help understand the season s responsible for the annual variability the mathematical expression for evaluating me of precipitation amount can be given as 2 me i 1 n c q i q l o g 2 q i q where q i denotes the precipitation amount for the ith year q denotes the total precipitation for the period from 1901 to 2013 and nc is the number of class intervals depending on the length of data for a deterministic event hypothetical the probability p q i q is one and correspondingly to this me is nearer to zero and this case refers to absolute certainty on the other hand if the distribution is uniform then eq 2 yields maximum uncertainty since every outcome has the same probability of occurrence thus the value of me varies from zero to log 2 n c i e from absolute certainty to maximum uncertainty or complete information to no information about the system s state viewed in this manner intuitively me can be used for measuring the spatiotemporal variability associated with any geophysical time series 3 2 3 standardized variability index in this paper we employed svi proposed by guntu et al 2020a to calculate the variability associated with the individual time series defined as 3 svi me max m e me max where me max is the maximum me that can be obtained for a given distribution and me is the entropy obtained for the given time series from this description svi takes on a value within a finite range of 0 1 where zero corresponds to no variability and one represents high variability i e minimum uncertainty to maximum uncertainty it has an advantage in comparing the variability of precipitation series at multiple time scales and therefore in relatively addressing the uncertainty as svi increases the variability increases and vice versa since the range of svi is finite it has the competence of inter comparison of results for datasets with different lengths in regionalization we applied svi to 17 time series 12 monthly time series 4 seasonal and 1 annual time series to evaluate the inter annual variability at each time scale and use their signatures in the regionalization of precipitation the detailed procedure on how to calculate svi is given in appendix a 3 3 necessity for using both magnitude and variability to capture the precipitation characteristics of a region satisfactorily we argue that considering both the magnitude and variability is essential we illustrate this concept by considering four grid locations a b c and d see fig 1 a of imd gridded precipitation dataset location a and location b have different mean precipitation mm year but the same variability measured in terms of svia on the contrary location c and location d have the same mean precipitation mm year but different variability see fig 1b thus if variability alone is considered in the regionalization it delineates the regions having similar precipitation variability patterns on the contrary if only mean precipitation is considered regions will have similar mean precipitation and the intra cluster heterogeneity will be in terms of precipitation variability this study proposes to include both precipitation magnitude and its variability in terms of svi to improve precipitation regionalization besides precipitation time series is nonlinear and exhibits multi scale phenomenon rathinasamy et al 2014 thus mean precipitation and svi at multiple time scales monthly seasonal annual were used for precipitation regionalization 3 4 kohonen self organizing map kohonen self organizing map som is based on artificial neural network and has been successfully applied in hydro meteorological applications agarwal et al 2016a hsu and li 2010 mannan et al 2018 ohba et al 2016 som is a widely used tool for clustering visualization of high dimensional data and dimension reduction in various applications kohonen 2001 som is unsupervised and collection of neurons which are regularly arranged in a low dimensional one or two grid pattern in the output layer one of the advantages of som is to extract the inter relationship between inputs of a high dimensional dataset and classify the extracted pattern into a low dimensional one or two grid pattern where similar inputs stay close together while maintaining data structure vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 thus som can be interpreted as topology and can provide an insight into the system under transformation in topology the neurons can be connected based on the number of clusters using either hexagonal or rectangular lattice for visual display kohonen 2001 pointed out the hexagonal lattice is to be preferred because it does not favor horizontal and vertical directions as much as the rectangular lattice next a network is constructed trained in two phases using weight learning function detailed information is provided in vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 for every input weights will be calculated for each neuron correspondingly from the obtained weight distance from each input a weight map is obtained with bright and light colours the bright colour represents a smoother distribution of samples from cluster to cluster and on the other side the dark colour represents a high variation between the samples from cluster to cluster and only a few samples will be assigned to that particular cluster finally from the weight distances of each input sample hits will be obtained and it displays the numbers of samples assigned to each cluster respectively 3 5 proposed methodology the schematic of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 and the step by step procedure is described as follows step 1 daily data is converted to annual seasonal spring summer fall winter and monthly january to december time series as described in section 3 1 a total of 17 time series with a data length of 113 would be formed and data encloses the total precipitation of the particular time scale during the year and over the years see table 1 step 2 calculate the mean precipitation i e an average of the precipitation of 113 years is reported as mean precipitation and me for each time series respectively step 3 from the obtained me svi is calculated correspondingly for each time series for each grid point there are 37 inputs mean precipitation 17 svi 17 location parameters 3 different combinations of 37 inputs are tried not shown here and it is disclosed that all the 37 inputs play a useful role in regionalization step 4 regionalization using self organizing maps formation of the matrix with samples as rows and inputs as columns in the present study 4443 samples total number of grid points with 37 input vectors described in step 3 for each sample are considered thus the size of the matrix is 4443 37 based on the number of clusters the network is constructed trained and sample hits will be obtained for each cluster respectively further the obtained clusters are to be validated for homogeneity and thereby an optimum number of clusters is considered for further analysis 3 6 cluster validation index silhouette coefficient sc is employed to decide the optimum cluster number as it is robust in portioning the data into clusters by combing two techniques i e separation and cohesion the advantages and limitations of sc are nicely presented in rousseeuw 1987 silhouette coefficient of a cluster can specify the degree of similarity of grid points inside a cluster cohesion compared to other clusters separation cohesion measures the intra distance x i from one data point i to remaining data points within the cluster and separation measures the inter distance y i from the data point i to data points falling under other clusters for calculation procedure of x and y see supplementary information s1 for each data point i sc is calculated as 5 s c i 1 x i y i if x i y i 0 if x i y i y i x i 1 if x i y i from the above equation for every data point i the range of sc i is 1 to 1 it says that intra cluster distance should be less and inter cluster distance should be high to get well separated clusters positive values on the other hand more the intra cluster distance and less the inter cluster distance which leads to the formation of an incorrect cluster negative values i e presence of similar kinds of data points in different clusters sc for the cluster is represented by an average of all sc s obtained within the cluster and is denoted as average silhouette width the average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity and helpful in selecting the optimum number of clusters as the homogeneous regions are not known initially we applied som by changing the cluster number k from 3 to 25 following mannan et al 2018 and satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 3 7 assessment of clusters this section deals with the assessment of clusters in terms of seasonality timing and magnitude of 50th percentile pentad precipitation which can be applied in understanding the temporal evolution of clusters 3 7 1 seasonality the seasonality was explored in terms of pentad precipitation distribution throughout the year following shanmugasundaram and lee 2018 pentad time scale is used as an alternative of daily time scale to justify the formation of clusters since ruiz barradas and nigam 2013 pointed out that pentad time scale can suppress high daily variations and thereby highlight some key intra seasonal characteristics the pentad is the summation of 5 day s precipitation the 1st pentad corresponding to 1st to 5th january and 73rd pentad corresponding to 27th to 31st december in total 73 data points a k a pentads for a year dates corresponding to each pentad number is given in table s1 the calculation procedure for the formation of pentad time series over the years for all the grid points is given in appendix b 3 7 2 timing and magnitude of peak precipitation feng et al 2013 developed the concept of the first moment of area to estimate the magnitude and timing of peak precipitation used by pascale et al 2015 and sahany et al 2018 in order to understand the precipitation distribution and magnitudes of precipitation in a cluster we used the concept of the centroid of the pentad the centroid was computed using eq 6 and it would indicate the timing of occurrence of the 50th percentile precipitation in terms of pentad number and the corresponding precipitation amount mm pentad respectively fig 3 6 c i p 1 73 pr p p 1 73 r p in eq 3 p represents the pentad number from 1 to 73 and r p represents the corresponding amount of precipitation during the pentad number 4 results first we demonstrate the potential of svi to unravel the precipitation variability at different time scales following that the identification of an optimal number of clusters is presented we further analyze each identified cluster for its geographical and climatological characteristics besides seasonality and temporal variability of the clusters are highlighted lastly the temporal evolution of clusters is presented 4 1 svi revealed precipitation variability at different time scales to quantify the inter annual variability of annual seasonal and monthly precipitation the marginal entropy and svi respectively are calculated based on the amount of precipitation over the period 1901 2013 for every single grid location svi provides an easy inter comparison of variability across different time scales the spatial distribution of mean precipitation is plotted in figs s2 s6 and a brief description is provided in supplementary information s2 fig 4 a shows the spatial representation of ten randomly selected grid points scattered all over the indian mainland to compare the svi values fig 4b at annual seasonal and monthly time scales for each station we observed that the variability at annual time scale was comparatively low and was almost similar for all the locations at seasonal time scale the variability was more than annual and less than the monthly time scale and it was in congruence with the general understanding that the variability dampens from finer to coarser time scales on comparing individual seasons svi reveals that the precipitation of summer season contributed less and that of winter contributed the highest to the annual variability this is an interesting observation to quantify the annual variability of indian precipitation in its seasonal components the lowest contribution to annual variability is because summer precipitation contributes 75 to the annual precipitation malik et al 2016 yadav and roxy 2019 and winter being the driest season of the year makes a low contribution to the annual precipitation in the winter season except for the southern region example grid point 10 in fig 4 and himalayan region example grid point 1 in fig 4 the rest of the country has high variability this is also in congruence with the general understanding the variability is low in the southern part since it receives regular precipitation from the northeast monsoon rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2012 and in the case of the himalayan region trade winds travel from the mediterranean sea western disturbances causing significant precipitation during the winter season shukla et al 2019 however the other parts of the country grid point 2 8 in fig 4 irregularly receive unseasonal rains with no uniform pattern causing high variability rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2012 further intra variability of months within season helps in understanding the months responsible for the variability of that particular season there is a distinct variation of variability for the same month except jjas at different locations due to the intricate climatological pattern of precipitation comparison of svi in the box plot discloses that the variability of seasonal time series is always lower than that of its constituent months see fig 5 for instance the mean of svi for the spring season 0 09 is lower than that of its constituent months i e march 0 232 april 0 193 may 0 143 a similar pattern is seen in other seasons variability dampens from finer to coarser time scales hence considering finer time scales variability information can be captured in clustering and forms well separated clusters 4 2 optimal number of clusters for spatial clustering of gridded data over india the mean precipitation and corresponding svi values at multiple time scales were used as a basis for the clustering of grid points the average silhouette width revealed see fig 6 that probable cluster number was either 6 10 or 14 with the corresponding values 0 4589 0 4647 and 0 4499 respectively it is observed that on working with a total of 14 clusters some of the clusters have very few one or two stations this can be one of the reasons that make the average silhouette value fall to a low value suddenly also on running the algorithm multiple times the clusters were highly unstable now the remaining two likelihoods for the optimal number of clusters was thoroughly investigated for seasonality and svi pattern in the case of selecting total 6 clusters we noticed that the interregional heterogeneity was missing i e properties of grid points within one cluster were matching the grid points in other clusters on selecting 10 clusters the intraregional homogeneity and interregional heterogeneity of grid points were maintained and in earlier studies fukushima et al 2019 mannan et al 2018 also the chosen cluster number was nearer to ten besides the 10 clusters represent different climate regimes that exist in india therefore we chose ten as the optimum number of clusters also this choice was having the highest silhouette coefficient as well as the clusters were highly stable 4 3 geographical and climatological characteristics of clusters based on the 37 input vectors as described in the step 3 of section 3 5 grid points were segregated into 10 clusters fig 7 the cluster structure identified by precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability analysis shared specific elements which can be tied back to two general categories such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics therefore the number of clusters reflects the climatological diversity of indian subcontinent and the number of grid points per cluster sets the extent to which each distinct climatology family is sampled the spatial extent of the grid points in the regions prominently shows the ability of the method to capture the underlying driving forces for instance we do not impose any spatial constrains on the cluster classification there is no guarantee that the region will be geographically cohesive but as shown in fig 7 this is often the case the geographical representation of cluster structure fig 7 confirms some similar patterns to those provided by earlier studies fukushima et al 2019 mannan et al 2018 it is also essential to emphasize that the formation of clusters using self organizing maps is based on a similar kind of neurons representing precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability rather than on our traditional measures like nearest neighbor s and linear correlations precipitation grid points belonging to clusters 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 see fig 6 are concentrated i e exhibit geographical contiguity on the other hand certain grid points specifically belonging to clusters 1 4 8 and 10 are geographically separated demonstrating that apart from geographical contiguity the approach accounts for other additional governing mechanisms temporal variability of precipitation or its magnitude at multiple time scales local variability and large scale climate drivers which might influence the precipitation pattern table 2 shows the number of grid points topographical climate regime and statistical analysis of resultant clusters that include the mean and standard deviation of annual precipitation for each cluster as per koppen climate classification the climate regimes existing in india are warm hot desert semi arid humid subtropical tropical savannah semi arid tropical monsoon and alpine the type of elevation and climate regime are interpreted as per the literature agarwal et al 2018 beck et al 2018 dimitrova and bora 2020 high mean precipitation illustrates the total amount of precipitation and higher standard deviation indicates greater variation among the grid points in the cluster hsu and li 2010 from statistical analysis clusters 1 and 2 in fig 7 have comparable precipitation characteristics but are differentiated by elevation and coastlines features have warm desert and semi arid climate regime western and north western india cluster 3 in fig 7 is the largest cluster enclosing 1058 grid points in that region and receives mean annual precipitation 1135 mm almost nearer to all india average precipitation 1119 mm with a variation of 216 mm among the grid points in that cluster has moderate elevation covering humid subtropical climate regime north central india cluster 4 in fig 7 receives a high amount of mean annual precipitation 1470 mm with the lowest variation among the clusters 190 mm and has a tropical savannah climate regime eastern india cluster 5 in fig 7 receives low mean annual precipitation 795 mm with low variation 226 mm has moderate elevation and semi arid type of climate regime south central india cluster 6 in fig 7 receives high mean annual precipitation 1003 mm with a variation of 296 mm has low elevation and warm and humid subtropical climate regime south eastern coastline cluster 7 in fig 7 is the smallest cluster having only 84 grid points has low elevation and has tropical monsoon climate regime konkan coast has the highest mean annual precipitation 3169 mm with highest variation 712 mm in that cluster table 2 one likely reason for high variation could be that this cluster is positioned nearer to coastlines and lee side of western ghats cluster 8 in fig 7 receives 2nd highest mean annual precipitation 2775 mm with a variation of 586 mm among the grid points in that cluster and covers humid subtropical climate regime north eastern india meanwhile cluster 10 in fig 7 covering alpine climate regime rain shadow western himalayan shows the lowest mean annual precipitation 460 mm with a variation of 269 mm comparing the mean annual precipitation of clusters 9 and 10 in fig 7 rain belt western himalayan receives high mean annual precipitation than rain shadow western himalayas in general most of the regionalization approaches agarwal et al 2018 fukushima et al 2019 classified the entire western himalayas as one however in the present study western himalayas become two distinct regions rain belt and rain shadow due to the differences in the mean annual precipitation 4 4 seasonality and temporal variability of the clusters the grid points within the individual clusters were further analyzed for any common characteristics in terms of seasonality and temporal variability they may have among themselves following agarwal et al 2016b fig 8 shows the pentad precipitation for 50th percentile and interquartile 25th 75th percentile range for each cluster it is interesting to note that the shape of seasonality is unique for each cluster the precipitation pattern of every cluster during the indian summer monsoon ism i e in between pentad numbers 31 31st may 4th june and 54 23rd 27th september and retreat phase of monsoon northeast monsoon nem i e in between pentad numbers 55 23rd 27th september and 69 7th 11th dec is discussed further in detail the ism influence is visible in all the regions fig 8 the peak points of pentad precipitation can be seen in all the regions except in the south eastern coastlines c6 and highest elevation rain shadow western himalayas c10 in continuation the influence is strongest and phenomenal for the konkan coast c7 this is in line with a general understanding that the inflow of the south west monsoon into india brings about a total change in the weather early in this season the windward side of the konkan coast receives very high precipitation during the ism june september with mean precipitation over some parts exceeding 2500 mm extreme events with precipitation more than 150 mm per day at one or more grid points along this region occur frequently and cause considerable damage during the onset phase of ism over the coastal area of arabian sea there will be heavy precipitation when compared to other regions and it is one of the prominent characteristics of ism ananthakrishnan and soman 1988 similarly western india c1 north western india c2 north central india c3 and eastern india c4 receives significant precipitation during the ism malik et al 2016 also the magnitudes of the pentad are similar in the three regions except north western india c2 where magnitudes of the pentad in that region are almost half of north central india c3 but the seasonality pattern of both the regions is nearly similar further rain belt western himalayas c9 and rain shadow western himalayas c10 receive high precipitation during january to march when comparing with ism months yadav et al 2007 reported western disturbances travelling from mediterranean sea towards tibetan plateau obstructed by himalayas arc causing precipitation in this region furthermore we observe that nem dominates only in the south eastern coastlines c6 and this is the unique region where the contribution of nem to annual budget is more than ism the average quantity of precipitation of nem in south eastern coastlines is nearly one fifth of ism in konkan coast south central india c5 which has moderate elevation and semi arid climate regime also experienced some part of nem in addition to swm there is a unique region i e north eastern india c8 that receives precipitation in nine months march to november in a year the seasonality pattern of the region is similar to the shape of a normal distribution having a high magnitude in july and covers pre monsoon ism and nem to further understand the clusters mean monthly precipitation mm of january to december and corresponding svi from 1901 to 2013 was calculated for all the regions see tables s2 and s3 fig 9 illustrates the average monthly bars precipitation and along with the corresponding svi asterisk marker and these can be considered as typical values for that region the distribution of monthly precipitation is unique and explicitly regional characteristics are captured for each region during january february and march rain belt western himalayas fig 9 receives the highest precipitation from western disturbances with low variability in april may and september north eastern india fig 9 is dominant in receiving the highest precipitation in conjunction with low variability during monsoon and its retreat phase in the case of june july and august monsoon months konkan coast fig 9 is the dominant cluster among others and in particular in july this region receives the highest precipitation of 1125 mm with svi 0 017 during the post monsoon months i e in october november and december the south eastern coastline fig 9 receives the highest amount of precipitation concurrently with low variability in fig 9 north western india and north central india have similar svi patterns across months but different magnitudes of monthly precipitation making the two regions distinct similarly the svi pattern of eastern india and north eastern india south central india and konkan coast and rain belt and rain shadow western himalayas are similar but their corresponding monthly precipitation magnitudes are different forming well separated clusters on the other side western india and north western india have similar monthly precipitation patterns and different svi magnitudes and thereby it says considering svi in regionalization also plays a vital role in forming homogeneous regions 4 5 the temporal evolution of clusters the complete data set i e 1901 2013 was divided into three time windows the span of the first two time windows was 40 years each and the remaining 33 years was the third time window following agarwal et al 2016a and mannan et al 2018 the same clustering approach was followed for each window and results were compared to unravel the time varying characteristics of precipitation and the stability of clusters fig 10 compares the spatial representation of regions formed in the clustering analysis interestingly there was no change in the cluster characteristics for south eastern coastlines cluster 6 north eastern india cluster 8 rain belt and rain shadow western himalayas clusters 9 and10 in the three temporal windows while there was a movement of grid points across south central india cluster 5 western india cluster 1 north western india cluster 2 north central india cluster 3 eastern india cluster 4 and konkan coast cluster 7 to examine the stability of clusters across western india north western india north central india eastern india three hotspots a b and c were identified see fig 11 based on the shifting of grids between the clusters from 1st time window to 3rd time window in fig 9a c further investigation was for all the grids which shifted however the results are shown for 12 grid points in each hotspot for every grid point in the identified hotspot the pentad distribution during the indian summer monsoon months was plotted for the three temporal windows figs 12 14 illustrate the shifting and fluctuating pentad distribution in the three temporal windows 1901 1940 black line 1941 1980 blue line and 1981 2013 red line and it revealed an essential facet of the indian summer monsoon in hotspot a fig 12 there was a shift in the pentad distribution from 1st temporal window to 3rd temporal window in the 1st temporal window the highest pentad precipitation was observed in august but in the 2nd and 3rd temporal window the highest shifted towards july disclosing changes in intra annual variability in hotspot b fig 13 there was an increase in the strength of monsoon from 1st temporal window to last on the contrary there was a decrease in the strength of monsoon in hotspot c fig 14 further the first moment of area centroid was calculated for every grid point following feng et al 2013 fig 15 shows the plot of the average values over each time window of time of occurrence of the 50th percentile precipitation and the corresponding precipitation amount for all the three hotspots in hotspot a the time of occurrence of the 50th percentile shifted 10 days i e from pentad number 45 43 from 1st to 2nd time window and it was consistent in the 3rd time window the significance testing was done using the two tailed t test for testing the difference in the mean values obtained from the three time windows the results in terms of the p values from the t test table 3 revealed that the difference in the mean values from 1st to 2nd time window for all points was significant p 0 05 on the other side the p values for the magnitude of precipitation given in brackets indicated no statistically significant change in hotspot b fig 15 and table 3 there was no significant change in the time of occurrence of the 50th percentile over the three windows however the magnitude of 50th percentile showed a significant increase in the precipitation amount at all grid points from 1st to 2nd time window in hotspot c a different behavior was observed wherein there was no significant shift in the precipitation timing but a statistically significant decrease in the magnitude of 50th percentile in the 3rd time window 1980 2013 the observations on changes in the precipitation pattern were corroborating with the findings of guntu et al 2020a and sahany et al 2018 who showed a significant trend in the variability of precipitation both in terms of quantity and timing in central india these observations showed that the proposed approach was sensitive in capturing the temporal changes in the precipitation magnitude and its variability possibly due to changes in climate variability 5 discussion this study developed a regionalization framework accounting for both temporal variability and magnitude of precipitation we investigated the inter annual variability of precipitation at monthly jan dec seasonal spring summer fall winter and annual time scales the time series of gridded precipitation at different time scales was selected as a clustering variable this means that homogeneous regions were defined based on coherent climate variability at different time scales monthly seasonal and annual rather than mean climate conditions this is an essential step as an estimation of key variables and grouping of the precipitation time series fig 7 captures the local and inter annual variability at individual grid points respectively and allows regionalization irrespective of the contiguity of the grid points and the assumptions involved therein standardized variability index svi was used to quantify the precipitation variability at different scales and self organizing maps were employed to delineate homogeneous precipitation regions these were capable of identifying regions of common seasonality climate sensitivity and global mechanisms that drive variability for different regions the mean precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability using svi were assessed over 113 years 1901 2013 for the indian mainland it was found that the temporal variability increased from annual time scale to monthly timescale this is in congruence with the general understanding that the temporal variability dampens guntu et al 2020a mishra et al 2009 on coarser scales besides at each time scale the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability were spatially varying fig 4 owing to different climatic conditions and forms the basis for clustering based on this observation ten different clusters fig 7 were identified that could be tied back to two general categories such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics the number of clusters reflects the climatological diversity of the indian mainland and the number of grid points per cluster sets the extent to which each distinct climatology family is sampled the spatial extent of the grid points in the communities prominently shows the ability of the method to capture the underlying driving forces fukushima et al 2019 and mannan et al 2018 developed seven ten homogenous regions by considering the only magnitude of pentad precipitation only daily precipitation and employing hierarchical clustering and self organizing maps these studies pointed out the developed regions and well represented the seasonal characteristics of ism and nem on comparing clustered regions with the present study three regions i e south central india cluster 5 south eastern coastlines cluster 6 konkan coast cluster 7 were in almost good agreement however the remaining seven regions turned out to be spatially different a multitude of studies conducted in the past along these three regions did not show any indication for changes in precipitation characteristics ghosh et al 2012 goswami et al 2006 guntu et al 2020a roxy et al 2017 this is an interesting observation i e consideration of temporal variability plays an insignificant role in the shape size and stability of these three homogeneous regions further the discussion is limited to the remaining seven regions which are new and different from the previous studies intriguingly the separate rain belt cluster 9 and rain shadow cluster 10 himalayan cluster formed in the present study are different from the previous studies agarwal et al 2018 fukushima et al 2019 malik et al 2016 where the entire western himalayas was classified as a single homogeneous region however this finding is supported by shukla et al 2019 highlighting that the topography plays an important role in differentiating precipitation over rain shadow and rain belt western himalayas the orographic barrier pir panjan range divides the rain belt western himalayan and the rain shadow western himalayan i e the rain shadow region stands as a barrier to the moisture carrying monsoon winds crossing over to tibetan plateau thereby causing heavy to very heavy precipitation of short 3 4 h to long 10 14 h duration in the rain belt region nandargi and dhar 2011 the pir panjal range of the western himalayas successfully intercepts the moisture from the monsoon currents it acts as a rain belt region while the opposite side i e the rain shadow western himalayan region is a dry region the monsoon is extremely weak over this region hence the leh station located in rain shadow western himalayan merely receives 93 mm of precipitation in a whole year nandargi and dhar 2011 the temporal evolution of clusters fig 10a c discloses an interesting observation for instance grid points belonging to the central india region as a whole western india cluster 1 north western india cluster 2 north central india cluster 3 and eastern india cluster 4 are time variant during the three temporal windows figs 12 14 indicate the changes in the precipitation characteristics of central india with time in terms of changing seasonality and magnitude of ism goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2015 malik et al 2016 found that the grid points belonging to central india are contributing 90 100 of ism to the annual precipitation budget therefore fig 15 highlights that in central india the significant changes in precipitation characteristics can be attributed only to the increasing heterogeneity in ism in the last 50 years that has been reported in earlier studies ghosh et al 2012 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 mannan et al 2018 pointed out that spatial heterogeneity of climatic variables over central india is also one of the causes for changes in precipitation with time also roxy et al 2017 reported changes in frequency and magnitude of precipitation over these regions due to the increase in global warming recently kurths et al 2019 confirmed the emerging patterns and teleconnection in central indian due to north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the decrease of 10 days in the occurrence of 50th percentile monsoon in north western india cluster 2 after the 1940s an increase of precipitation by 5 mm corresponding to the 50th percentile monsoon in western india cluster 1 after the 1940s a decrease of 5 mm precipitation corresponding to the 50th percentile monsoon in north central india cluster 3 region after the 1980s were never reported in the previous studies there is an effect of non stationarity on the clusters in terms of varying magnitude and frequency with time interestingly our approach is capable of capturing that therefore as described in section 3 3 there is a necessity for using both precipitation magnitude and its inter annual variability for robust homogenous regions inclusion of precipitation magnitude and accounting for its temporal variability in the proposed regionalization offered more robust homogenous regions the method was tested on a gridded precipitation dataset for two reasons i the availability and the access to rain gauge data is limited and ii gridded datasets provide an effective platform to understand the precipitation dynamics the gridding process used to build the dataset might affect the relationships between grid points owing to the assumptions underlying the spatial interpolation however these effects can be neglected considering the extent of the study area besides the method is applicable to all sort of data found to be highly effective in capturing the seasonality 6 conclusions the present study has proposed a novel method for precipitation regionalization using self organizing map coupled with multi scale standardized variability index the time series of gridded precipitation at different time scales is selected as a clustering variable this means that homogeneous regions are defined based on coherent climate variability at different time scales monthly seasonal and annual rather than mean climate conditions this is important as seasonalityis a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year due to local variability besides coherent inter annual variability suggests a common response to large scale climate drivers when regionalization is applied to observations at different time scales then the approach can help identify regions of common seasonality climate sensitivity and identify mechanisms that drive variability for each region application of the method to indian precipitation offers promising results for regionalization the following concluding remarks can be made from the study a the multi scale standardized variability index measure captures the variability of precipitation dynamics at each grid point independently and then allows the formation of a homogeneous cluster that is not based on any prior assumptions b the svi som clustering approach for precipitation regionalization is found to be robust and overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by including uncertainties of precipitation magnitude in a multi scale approach and forms new clusters across central and northern india c the temporal evolution of clusters unravels a significant change in the occurrence of 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across north western region cluster 2 a significant increase of 5 mm precipitation of the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across western india cluster 1 and decrease of 5 mm of 50th percentile monsoon after the 1980s in north central region cluster 3 on the contrary south central india cluster 5 south eastern coastlines cluster 6 and konkan coast cluster 7 are stable independent of temporal variability and intriguingly separate eastern cluster 10 and western himalayas cluster 9 clusters formed due to the difference in the physiographic features d the atmospheric dynamics across central india regions could be forecasted by using a robust dynamical model to unravel large scale drivers to local climate variability and has important implications for high performing seasonal prediction system in ungauged sites applications of the proposed methodology to data from other parts of the world with different climatic and environmental characteristics would also help verify and possibly strengthen and confirm the conclusions drawn here credit authorship contribution statement ravi

5158,precipitation regionalization deals with an investigation of the seasonality and its temporal variability and is useful for a wide variety of applications in hydro meteorology the d homogeneous regions can be used as a basis for transforming the information from gauged to ungauged sites and can reduce the uncertainty in estimating the seasonal characteristics of precipitation across india despite several studies stressing the importance of seasonality and temporal variability to the environment there is a lack of studies on accounting for temporal variability in regionalization precipitation regionalization must account for both the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability at multiple time scales to extract the seasonality of a region representing coherent local and inter annual variability therefore in this study we propose a framework for precipitation regionalization considering both precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability high resolution 0 25

transformed into multiple time scales i e annual seasonal and monthly time scales entropy based standardized variability index was used to measure the inter annual variability of precipitation at each time scale regionalization of grid points was performed using self organizing maps an artificial neural network ten distinct regions were identified that can be tied back to two general categories

homogenous regions in a particular aspect of a climate variable s of interest is crucial for numerous hydro meteorological applications brown et al 2010 these applications include regional flood frequency analysis sugahara et al 2009 yang et al 2010 zhang and singh 2006 precipitation forecasting and downscaling sehgal et al 2018 potential water resources availability maruyama et al 2005 climate dynamics deng et al 2019 geen et al 2018 jiménez esteve and domeisen 2019 zhao et al 2019 agricultural planning design of hydraulic structures adamowski 2000 among others regionalization can be used as a method to extend information beyond the gauge network and can provide planners and designers with a better alternative for the assessment of precipitation characteristics at ungauged sites than can traditional single site analysis alila 1999 however in many developing countries like india rain gauges are scarce information on the spatial distribution of precipitation as well as its temporal variability at ungauged sites can be gained by forming groups having similar precipitation characteristics hosking and wallis 1993 modarres 2008 saf 2009 there have been several attempts to delineate homogenous precipitation regions that include numerous statistical and conceptual techniques caliński and harabasz 1974 fraley 1998 rousseeuw 1987 these include correlation analysis gadgil et al 1993 saikranthi et al 2013 principal component analysis domroes et al 1998 iyengar and basak 1994 common factor analysis dinpashoh et al 2004 spectral analysis azad et al 2010 türkeş and tatlı 2011 hierarchical approach santos et al 2019 principal component analysis with hierarchical approach darand and mansouri daneshvar 2014 fazel et al 2018 k means carvalho et al 2016 and self organizing maps hsu and li 2010 among these the self organizing map som proposed by kohonen 2001 is found to be a robust clustering technique in creating soft boundaries and in handling large amounts of complex data lin and chen 2006 it is extensively used due to its competence in reducing high dimensional data to low dimensional data preferably to one or two while preserving the topology chen et al 2010 in the past som was used for the regionalization of catchments with similar hydrologic characteristics agarwal et al 2016a and grid points with similar precipitation and runoff events dilmi et al 2017 nourani et al 2013 wolski et al 2018 the key to all these methods is to define regions that need not be spatially contiguous but homogenous concerning the variable of interest and are sufficiently distinct from other regions the variable of interest could be a high intraregional correlation or low interregional correlation between members gadgil et al 1993 saikranthi et al 2013 statistical characteristics of daily precipitation such as standard deviation and skewness kulkarni 2017 geographical location principal components extracted from large scale atmospheric predictor variables satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 synchronicity of extremes agarwal et al 2018 periodicities in precipitation azad et al 2010 and variability at multiple time scales and their signature roushangar et al 2019 all these methods have contributed significantly to our understanding however there exists an enormous scope for advancement by accounting for the temporal variability of precipitation in delineating homogenous regions for instance homogenous regions developed by prior studies bharath and srinivas 2015 fukushima et al 2019 mannan et al 2018 saikranthi et al 2013 satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 used either the mean or total precipitation for identifying homogeneous regions on the contrary a few studies krstanovic and singh 1992 maruyama et al 2005 roushangar et al 2019 considered only the variability associated with precipitation parameters while disregarding the precipitation amount they were thus resulting in zones with similar variability but different precipitation magnitudes in recent decades a multitude of studies have reported a significant increase in the complexity of indian precipitation in terms of temporal variability as well as its uncertainty ghosh et al 2012 goswami et al 2006 paul et al 2018 roxy et al 2017 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 besides there has been a significant increase in the magnitude of total annual precipitation rajeevan et al 2008 vul and mishra 2019 yadav and roxy 2019 motivated by these realizations we argue that regionalization studies must account for both the temporal variability and precipitation magnitude for robust identification of homogeneous regions therefore this study attempted to develop a regionalization framework accounting for both temporal variability and magnitude of precipitation in general temporal variability is defined as a measure of the unevenness of a random variable over different class intervals sang et al 2013 there is a plethora of metrics for assessing the variability of a time series including variance diversity indices and various measures based on shannon entropy guntu et al 2020a mishra et al 2009 in the past decade shannon entropy has gained significant attention in surface and sub surface hydrology koutsoyiannis 2005 molini et al 2006 singh 2015 2013 one of the main advantages of using shannon entropy is that it does not make any assumption on the probability distribution or statistical properties of data besides it can be applied to any type of distribution whether it is known or unknown or if the nature of the underlying system is dynamic guntu et al 2020b pechlivanidis et al 2016 kawachi et al 2001 proposed shannon entropy as precipitation entropy for assessing the temporal precipitation apportionment later maruyama et al 2005 modified precipitation entropy into intensity entropy and apportionment entropy for quantifying the intra annual variability of precipitation further these measures are applied by mishra et al 2009 to assess the intra annual variability of monthly precipitation and proposed marginal entropy to investigate the inter annual variability furthermore to have a single measure to represent both inter annual and intra annual variability mishra et al 2009 proposed a disorder index based on the difference between maximum possible entropy and entropy obtained for a time series in continuation cheng et al 2017 rodrigues da silva et al 2016 roushangar et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 used the disorder index to assess precipitation variability for different regions around the globe very recently guntu et al 2020a highlighted that though the disorder index is indeed beneficial however it is limited to the time scale of evaluation as well as the length of the data they modified the disorder index and proposed a new standardized variability index svi with capabilities to overcome the limitations of the disorder index it is found robust in comparing the inter annual and intra annual variability of precipitation at different time scales and for regions with different temporal records using svi this study developed a framework for precipitation regionalization based on precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability besides we aim to analyze the effects of non stationarity on regionalization from an abruptly changing climate point of view this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the proposed methodology with a brief description of marginal entropy standardized variability index and som clustering technique details of the study area and gridded precipitation data are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the application of the proposed methodology followed by the discussion of results finally section 5 presents some of the essential conclusions and scope for further research 2 study area and data the present study focuses on improving the precipitation regionalization by accounting for temporal variability and precipitation magnitude in the indian subcontinent which lies approximately between 8 and 37 n latitude and 68 98 e longitude covering an area of 3 287 590 km2 the climate of india comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography making generalization indeed tricky in the present study we used the gridded data of mean daily precipitation in mm developed by pai et al 2014 with a high spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 for a spatial domain of 66 5 e to 100 e and 6 5 n to 38 5 n covering the mainland region of india see fig s1 the gridded data was generated from a diverse network of 6995 gauging stations across india using inverse distance weighted idw interpolation scheme proposed by shepard 1968 the daily data were obtained for a period of 113 years 1901 2013 which was available in the archive of national data centre india meteorological department imd pune link to data is given in data sources in the past several studies have used the same dataset which includes downscaling sehgal et al 2018 spatiotemporal variability of precipitation guntu et al 2020a sahany et al 2018 extreme precipitation analysis agarwal et al 2018 malik et al 2016 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 intrinsic predictability of indian precipitation guntu et al 2020b and spatial diversity of indian precipitation teleconnections kurths et al 2019 among others the application of imd gridded data in various applications shows that the data is highly accurate and capable of capturing the spatial distribution of precipitation over the country 3 methods and methodology in this section first we explain the data preparation and computation of time series at different scales following that the standardized variability index svi and kohonen self organizing maps som are discussed furthermore we illustrate the combination of svi and som to regionalize precipitation 3 1 data preparation and computing time series at different time scales this choice of clustering variable i e time series of gridded precipitation at different time scales means that homogeneous regions are defined based on coherent climate variability at different time scales monthly seasonal and annual rather than mean climate conditions this is important as seneviratne et al 2012 say seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year due to local variability also kurths et al 2019 suggest that coherent inter annual variability shows a common response to large scale climate drivers when regionalization is applied to observations at different time scales then the approach can help us identify regions of common seasonality climate sensitivity and mechanisms that drive variability for each region therefore in the present study climate data was analyzed for four seasons 1 summer season march april may mam 2 south west monsoon season form june july august jja 3 autumn fall season during which most of the northeast monsoon occurs september october november son and 4 winter season december january february djf we investigate the inter annual variability of precipitation at monthly jan dec seasonal spring summer fall winter and annual time scales variability of seasonal precipitation e g summer over the 113 year period in this study provides an understanding of how summer precipitation varies over time similarly monthly precipitation e g june over the years helps quantify the precipitation variability in that month over the 113 years this detailed investigation of the precipitation patterns would provide a comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal precipitation variability the method for creating the time series at multiple time scales is presented next 3 1 1 formation of monthly time series january december to form monthly time series sum all days in a particular month for the year 1901 and the process is repeated for all the years monthly time series consists of 113 values each value represents total monthly precipitation for that particular year 1st to 12th row in table 1 3 1 2 formation of seasonal time series spring summer fall winter to form seasonal time series sum all days in a particular season for the year 1901 and repeat the process for all the years seasonal time series consists of 113 values each value represents the total seasonal precipitation for that particular year 13th 6th row in table 1 3 1 3 formation of annual time series annual the gridded data is available at daily time step to get annual values sum all the 365 days in the year 1901 and repeat the process for all the years annual time series consists of 113 values each value represents the total annual precipitation for that particular year 17th row in table 1 3 2 standardized variability index to introduce standardized variability index svi a background on marginal entropy and shannon entropy is necessary 3 2 1 shannon entropy shannon 1948 formulated the entropy concerning a concept called a surprise i e information regarding the uncertainty of the random variable or its probability distribution singh 2015 2013 1997 discussed the strengths of shannon entropy se and its limitations and accredited it to be a decision making tool in surface and sub surface hydrology the se can be defined as eq 1 1 s e x i 1 n c p x i log 2 p x i where se x represents the average information content of the random variable x with probability distribution function p x i log 2 p x i directly represents the average surprise about the value x i occurring with probability p x i gong et al 2014 and n c is the number of class intervals the unit of se depends on the base of the logarithm for example a unit of se is bits when the base is 2 napier for base e and decibels for base 10 here we used the logarithm with base 2 and se was measured in bits for a deterministic single outcome system the probability for a specific event that will take on value is one and for any other value is zero in such a case the average surprise is zero and this case corresponds to absolute certainty on the contrary for uniform distribution the average surprise yields no information about the possible outcome since every outcome has the same probability of occurrence and therefore corresponds to absolute uncertainty thus the value of s e x varies from zero to log 2 n c i e from complete information to no information about the system s state viewed in this manner se captures the spread of data and can be used for measuring the variability associated with the precipitation time series kawachi et al 2001 gong et al 2014 discussed the four problems of distribution based estimation in hydrological time series that could result in biased entropy estimation these are optimal bin width zero values measurement error and skewness effect weijs et al 2013 suggested that the optimal bin width consideration for evaluating the probability density function depends on the question one wishes to answer 3 2 2 marginal entropy the marginal entropy me used by mishra et al 2009 as a measure of the randomness of a random variable x with the probability distribution p x is useful in calculating the variability of the distribution and can be extended to any type of dataset for instance we considered total annual seasonal and monthly precipitation time series and applied me to assess the inter annual variability associated with individual time series individual seasons are compared to examine the interannual variability of seasonal precipitation within the year and help understand the season s responsible for the annual variability the mathematical expression for evaluating me of precipitation amount can be given as 2 me i 1 n c q i q l o g 2 q i q where q i denotes the precipitation amount for the ith year q denotes the total precipitation for the period from 1901 to 2013 and nc is the number of class intervals depending on the length of data for a deterministic event hypothetical the probability p q i q is one and correspondingly to this me is nearer to zero and this case refers to absolute certainty on the other hand if the distribution is uniform then eq 2 yields maximum uncertainty since every outcome has the same probability of occurrence thus the value of me varies from zero to log 2 n c i e from absolute certainty to maximum uncertainty or complete information to no information about the system s state viewed in this manner intuitively me can be used for measuring the spatiotemporal variability associated with any geophysical time series 3 2 3 standardized variability index in this paper we employed svi proposed by guntu et al 2020a to calculate the variability associated with the individual time series defined as 3 svi me max m e me max where me max is the maximum me that can be obtained for a given distribution and me is the entropy obtained for the given time series from this description svi takes on a value within a finite range of 0 1 where zero corresponds to no variability and one represents high variability i e minimum uncertainty to maximum uncertainty it has an advantage in comparing the variability of precipitation series at multiple time scales and therefore in relatively addressing the uncertainty as svi increases the variability increases and vice versa since the range of svi is finite it has the competence of inter comparison of results for datasets with different lengths in regionalization we applied svi to 17 time series 12 monthly time series 4 seasonal and 1 annual time series to evaluate the inter annual variability at each time scale and use their signatures in the regionalization of precipitation the detailed procedure on how to calculate svi is given in appendix a 3 3 necessity for using both magnitude and variability to capture the precipitation characteristics of a region satisfactorily we argue that considering both the magnitude and variability is essential we illustrate this concept by considering four grid locations a b c and d see fig 1 a of imd gridded precipitation dataset location a and location b have different mean precipitation mm year but the same variability measured in terms of svia on the contrary location c and location d have the same mean precipitation mm year but different variability see fig 1b thus if variability alone is considered in the regionalization it delineates the regions having similar precipitation variability patterns on the contrary if only mean precipitation is considered regions will have similar mean precipitation and the intra cluster heterogeneity will be in terms of precipitation variability this study proposes to include both precipitation magnitude and its variability in terms of svi to improve precipitation regionalization besides precipitation time series is nonlinear and exhibits multi scale phenomenon rathinasamy et al 2014 thus mean precipitation and svi at multiple time scales monthly seasonal annual were used for precipitation regionalization 3 4 kohonen self organizing map kohonen self organizing map som is based on artificial neural network and has been successfully applied in hydro meteorological applications agarwal et al 2016a hsu and li 2010 mannan et al 2018 ohba et al 2016 som is a widely used tool for clustering visualization of high dimensional data and dimension reduction in various applications kohonen 2001 som is unsupervised and collection of neurons which are regularly arranged in a low dimensional one or two grid pattern in the output layer one of the advantages of som is to extract the inter relationship between inputs of a high dimensional dataset and classify the extracted pattern into a low dimensional one or two grid pattern where similar inputs stay close together while maintaining data structure vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 thus som can be interpreted as topology and can provide an insight into the system under transformation in topology the neurons can be connected based on the number of clusters using either hexagonal or rectangular lattice for visual display kohonen 2001 pointed out the hexagonal lattice is to be preferred because it does not favor horizontal and vertical directions as much as the rectangular lattice next a network is constructed trained in two phases using weight learning function detailed information is provided in vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 for every input weights will be calculated for each neuron correspondingly from the obtained weight distance from each input a weight map is obtained with bright and light colours the bright colour represents a smoother distribution of samples from cluster to cluster and on the other side the dark colour represents a high variation between the samples from cluster to cluster and only a few samples will be assigned to that particular cluster finally from the weight distances of each input sample hits will be obtained and it displays the numbers of samples assigned to each cluster respectively 3 5 proposed methodology the schematic of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 and the step by step procedure is described as follows step 1 daily data is converted to annual seasonal spring summer fall winter and monthly january to december time series as described in section 3 1 a total of 17 time series with a data length of 113 would be formed and data encloses the total precipitation of the particular time scale during the year and over the years see table 1 step 2 calculate the mean precipitation i e an average of the precipitation of 113 years is reported as mean precipitation and me for each time series respectively step 3 from the obtained me svi is calculated correspondingly for each time series for each grid point there are 37 inputs mean precipitation 17 svi 17 location parameters 3 different combinations of 37 inputs are tried not shown here and it is disclosed that all the 37 inputs play a useful role in regionalization step 4 regionalization using self organizing maps formation of the matrix with samples as rows and inputs as columns in the present study 4443 samples total number of grid points with 37 input vectors described in step 3 for each sample are considered thus the size of the matrix is 4443 37 based on the number of clusters the network is constructed trained and sample hits will be obtained for each cluster respectively further the obtained clusters are to be validated for homogeneity and thereby an optimum number of clusters is considered for further analysis 3 6 cluster validation index silhouette coefficient sc is employed to decide the optimum cluster number as it is robust in portioning the data into clusters by combing two techniques i e separation and cohesion the advantages and limitations of sc are nicely presented in rousseeuw 1987 silhouette coefficient of a cluster can specify the degree of similarity of grid points inside a cluster cohesion compared to other clusters separation cohesion measures the intra distance x i from one data point i to remaining data points within the cluster and separation measures the inter distance y i from the data point i to data points falling under other clusters for calculation procedure of x and y see supplementary information s1 for each data point i sc is calculated as 5 s c i 1 x i y i if x i y i 0 if x i y i y i x i 1 if x i y i from the above equation for every data point i the range of sc i is 1 to 1 it says that intra cluster distance should be less and inter cluster distance should be high to get well separated clusters positive values on the other hand more the intra cluster distance and less the inter cluster distance which leads to the formation of an incorrect cluster negative values i e presence of similar kinds of data points in different clusters sc for the cluster is represented by an average of all sc s obtained within the cluster and is denoted as average silhouette width the average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity and helpful in selecting the optimum number of clusters as the homogeneous regions are not known initially we applied som by changing the cluster number k from 3 to 25 following mannan et al 2018 and satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 3 7 assessment of clusters this section deals with the assessment of clusters in terms of seasonality timing and magnitude of 50th percentile pentad precipitation which can be applied in understanding the temporal evolution of clusters 3 7 1 seasonality the seasonality was explored in terms of pentad precipitation distribution throughout the year following shanmugasundaram and lee 2018 pentad time scale is used as an alternative of daily time scale to justify the formation of clusters since ruiz barradas and nigam 2013 pointed out that pentad time scale can suppress high daily variations and thereby highlight some key intra seasonal characteristics the pentad is the summation of 5 day s precipitation the 1st pentad corresponding to 1st to 5th january and 73rd pentad corresponding to 27th to 31st december in total 73 data points a k a pentads for a year dates corresponding to each pentad number is given in table s1 the calculation procedure for the formation of pentad time series over the years for all the grid points is given in appendix b 3 7 2 timing and magnitude of peak precipitation feng et al 2013 developed the concept of the first moment of area to estimate the magnitude and timing of peak precipitation used by pascale et al 2015 and sahany et al 2018 in order to understand the precipitation distribution and magnitudes of precipitation in a cluster we used the concept of the centroid of the pentad the centroid was computed using eq 6 and it would indicate the timing of occurrence of the 50th percentile precipitation in terms of pentad number and the corresponding precipitation amount mm pentad respectively fig 3 6 c i p 1 73 pr p p 1 73 r p in eq 3 p represents the pentad number from 1 to 73 and r p represents the corresponding amount of precipitation during the pentad number 4 results first we demonstrate the potential of svi to unravel the precipitation variability at different time scales following that the identification of an optimal number of clusters is presented we further analyze each identified cluster for its geographical and climatological characteristics besides seasonality and temporal variability of the clusters are highlighted lastly the temporal evolution of clusters is presented 4 1 svi revealed precipitation variability at different time scales to quantify the inter annual variability of annual seasonal and monthly precipitation the marginal entropy and svi respectively are calculated based on the amount of precipitation over the period 1901 2013 for every single grid location svi provides an easy inter comparison of variability across different time scales the spatial distribution of mean precipitation is plotted in figs s2 s6 and a brief description is provided in supplementary information s2 fig 4 a shows the spatial representation of ten randomly selected grid points scattered all over the indian mainland to compare the svi values fig 4b at annual seasonal and monthly time scales for each station we observed that the variability at annual time scale was comparatively low and was almost similar for all the locations at seasonal time scale the variability was more than annual and less than the monthly time scale and it was in congruence with the general understanding that the variability dampens from finer to coarser time scales on comparing individual seasons svi reveals that the precipitation of summer season contributed less and that of winter contributed the highest to the annual variability this is an interesting observation to quantify the annual variability of indian precipitation in its seasonal components the lowest contribution to annual variability is because summer precipitation contributes 75 to the annual precipitation malik et al 2016 yadav and roxy 2019 and winter being the driest season of the year makes a low contribution to the annual precipitation in the winter season except for the southern region example grid point 10 in fig 4 and himalayan region example grid point 1 in fig 4 the rest of the country has high variability this is also in congruence with the general understanding the variability is low in the southern part since it receives regular precipitation from the northeast monsoon rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2012 and in the case of the himalayan region trade winds travel from the mediterranean sea western disturbances causing significant precipitation during the winter season shukla et al 2019 however the other parts of the country grid point 2 8 in fig 4 irregularly receive unseasonal rains with no uniform pattern causing high variability rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2012 further intra variability of months within season helps in understanding the months responsible for the variability of that particular season there is a distinct variation of variability for the same month except jjas at different locations due to the intricate climatological pattern of precipitation comparison of svi in the box plot discloses that the variability of seasonal time series is always lower than that of its constituent months see fig 5 for instance the mean of svi for the spring season 0 09 is lower than that of its constituent months i e march 0 232 april 0 193 may 0 143 a similar pattern is seen in other seasons variability dampens from finer to coarser time scales hence considering finer time scales variability information can be captured in clustering and forms well separated clusters 4 2 optimal number of clusters for spatial clustering of gridded data over india the mean precipitation and corresponding svi values at multiple time scales were used as a basis for the clustering of grid points the average silhouette width revealed see fig 6 that probable cluster number was either 6 10 or 14 with the corresponding values 0 4589 0 4647 and 0 4499 respectively it is observed that on working with a total of 14 clusters some of the clusters have very few one or two stations this can be one of the reasons that make the average silhouette value fall to a low value suddenly also on running the algorithm multiple times the clusters were highly unstable now the remaining two likelihoods for the optimal number of clusters was thoroughly investigated for seasonality and svi pattern in the case of selecting total 6 clusters we noticed that the interregional heterogeneity was missing i e properties of grid points within one cluster were matching the grid points in other clusters on selecting 10 clusters the intraregional homogeneity and interregional heterogeneity of grid points were maintained and in earlier studies fukushima et al 2019 mannan et al 2018 also the chosen cluster number was nearer to ten besides the 10 clusters represent different climate regimes that exist in india therefore we chose ten as the optimum number of clusters also this choice was having the highest silhouette coefficient as well as the clusters were highly stable 4 3 geographical and climatological characteristics of clusters based on the 37 input vectors as described in the step 3 of section 3 5 grid points were segregated into 10 clusters fig 7 the cluster structure identified by precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability analysis shared specific elements which can be tied back to two general categories such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics therefore the number of clusters reflects the climatological diversity of indian subcontinent and the number of grid points per cluster sets the extent to which each distinct climatology family is sampled the spatial extent of the grid points in the regions prominently shows the ability of the method to capture the underlying driving forces for instance we do not impose any spatial constrains on the cluster classification there is no guarantee that the region will be geographically cohesive but as shown in fig 7 this is often the case the geographical representation of cluster structure fig 7 confirms some similar patterns to those provided by earlier studies fukushima et al 2019 mannan et al 2018 it is also essential to emphasize that the formation of clusters using self organizing maps is based on a similar kind of neurons representing precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability rather than on our traditional measures like nearest neighbor s and linear correlations precipitation grid points belonging to clusters 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 see fig 6 are concentrated i e exhibit geographical contiguity on the other hand certain grid points specifically belonging to clusters 1 4 8 and 10 are geographically separated demonstrating that apart from geographical contiguity the approach accounts for other additional governing mechanisms temporal variability of precipitation or its magnitude at multiple time scales local variability and large scale climate drivers which might influence the precipitation pattern table 2 shows the number of grid points topographical climate regime and statistical analysis of resultant clusters that include the mean and standard deviation of annual precipitation for each cluster as per koppen climate classification the climate regimes existing in india are warm hot desert semi arid humid subtropical tropical savannah semi arid tropical monsoon and alpine the type of elevation and climate regime are interpreted as per the literature agarwal et al 2018 beck et al 2018 dimitrova and bora 2020 high mean precipitation illustrates the total amount of precipitation and higher standard deviation indicates greater variation among the grid points in the cluster hsu and li 2010 from statistical analysis clusters 1 and 2 in fig 7 have comparable precipitation characteristics but are differentiated by elevation and coastlines features have warm desert and semi arid climate regime western and north western india cluster 3 in fig 7 is the largest cluster enclosing 1058 grid points in that region and receives mean annual precipitation 1135 mm almost nearer to all india average precipitation 1119 mm with a variation of 216 mm among the grid points in that cluster has moderate elevation covering humid subtropical climate regime north central india cluster 4 in fig 7 receives a high amount of mean annual precipitation 1470 mm with the lowest variation among the clusters 190 mm and has a tropical savannah climate regime eastern india cluster 5 in fig 7 receives low mean annual precipitation 795 mm with low variation 226 mm has moderate elevation and semi arid type of climate regime south central india cluster 6 in fig 7 receives high mean annual precipitation 1003 mm with a variation of 296 mm has low elevation and warm and humid subtropical climate regime south eastern coastline cluster 7 in fig 7 is the smallest cluster having only 84 grid points has low elevation and has tropical monsoon climate regime konkan coast has the highest mean annual precipitation 3169 mm with highest variation 712 mm in that cluster table 2 one likely reason for high variation could be that this cluster is positioned nearer to coastlines and lee side of western ghats cluster 8 in fig 7 receives 2nd highest mean annual precipitation 2775 mm with a variation of 586 mm among the grid points in that cluster and covers humid subtropical climate regime north eastern india meanwhile cluster 10 in fig 7 covering alpine climate regime rain shadow western himalayan shows the lowest mean annual precipitation 460 mm with a variation of 269 mm comparing the mean annual precipitation of clusters 9 and 10 in fig 7 rain belt western himalayan receives high mean annual precipitation than rain shadow western himalayas in general most of the regionalization approaches agarwal et al 2018 fukushima et al 2019 classified the entire western himalayas as one however in the present study western himalayas become two distinct regions rain belt and rain shadow due to the differences in the mean annual precipitation 4 4 seasonality and temporal variability of the clusters the grid points within the individual clusters were further analyzed for any common characteristics in terms of seasonality and temporal variability they may have among themselves following agarwal et al 2016b fig 8 shows the pentad precipitation for 50th percentile and interquartile 25th 75th percentile range for each cluster it is interesting to note that the shape of seasonality is unique for each cluster the precipitation pattern of every cluster during the indian summer monsoon ism i e in between pentad numbers 31 31st may 4th june and 54 23rd 27th september and retreat phase of monsoon northeast monsoon nem i e in between pentad numbers 55 23rd 27th september and 69 7th 11th dec is discussed further in detail the ism influence is visible in all the regions fig 8 the peak points of pentad precipitation can be seen in all the regions except in the south eastern coastlines c6 and highest elevation rain shadow western himalayas c10 in continuation the influence is strongest and phenomenal for the konkan coast c7 this is in line with a general understanding that the inflow of the south west monsoon into india brings about a total change in the weather early in this season the windward side of the konkan coast receives very high precipitation during the ism june september with mean precipitation over some parts exceeding 2500 mm extreme events with precipitation more than 150 mm per day at one or more grid points along this region occur frequently and cause considerable damage during the onset phase of ism over the coastal area of arabian sea there will be heavy precipitation when compared to other regions and it is one of the prominent characteristics of ism ananthakrishnan and soman 1988 similarly western india c1 north western india c2 north central india c3 and eastern india c4 receives significant precipitation during the ism malik et al 2016 also the magnitudes of the pentad are similar in the three regions except north western india c2 where magnitudes of the pentad in that region are almost half of north central india c3 but the seasonality pattern of both the regions is nearly similar further rain belt western himalayas c9 and rain shadow western himalayas c10 receive high precipitation during january to march when comparing with ism months yadav et al 2007 reported western disturbances travelling from mediterranean sea towards tibetan plateau obstructed by himalayas arc causing precipitation in this region furthermore we observe that nem dominates only in the south eastern coastlines c6 and this is the unique region where the contribution of nem to annual budget is more than ism the average quantity of precipitation of nem in south eastern coastlines is nearly one fifth of ism in konkan coast south central india c5 which has moderate elevation and semi arid climate regime also experienced some part of nem in addition to swm there is a unique region i e north eastern india c8 that receives precipitation in nine months march to november in a year the seasonality pattern of the region is similar to the shape of a normal distribution having a high magnitude in july and covers pre monsoon ism and nem to further understand the clusters mean monthly precipitation mm of january to december and corresponding svi from 1901 to 2013 was calculated for all the regions see tables s2 and s3 fig 9 illustrates the average monthly bars precipitation and along with the corresponding svi asterisk marker and these can be considered as typical values for that region the distribution of monthly precipitation is unique and explicitly regional characteristics are captured for each region during january february and march rain belt western himalayas fig 9 receives the highest precipitation from western disturbances with low variability in april may and september north eastern india fig 9 is dominant in receiving the highest precipitation in conjunction with low variability during monsoon and its retreat phase in the case of june july and august monsoon months konkan coast fig 9 is the dominant cluster among others and in particular in july this region receives the highest precipitation of 1125 mm with svi 0 017 during the post monsoon months i e in october november and december the south eastern coastline fig 9 receives the highest amount of precipitation concurrently with low variability in fig 9 north western india and north central india have similar svi patterns across months but different magnitudes of monthly precipitation making the two regions distinct similarly the svi pattern of eastern india and north eastern india south central india and konkan coast and rain belt and rain shadow western himalayas are similar but their corresponding monthly precipitation magnitudes are different forming well separated clusters on the other side western india and north western india have similar monthly precipitation patterns and different svi magnitudes and thereby it says considering svi in regionalization also plays a vital role in forming homogeneous regions 4 5 the temporal evolution of clusters the complete data set i e 1901 2013 was divided into three time windows the span of the first two time windows was 40 years each and the remaining 33 years was the third time window following agarwal et al 2016a and mannan et al 2018 the same clustering approach was followed for each window and results were compared to unravel the time varying characteristics of precipitation and the stability of clusters fig 10 compares the spatial representation of regions formed in the clustering analysis interestingly there was no change in the cluster characteristics for south eastern coastlines cluster 6 north eastern india cluster 8 rain belt and rain shadow western himalayas clusters 9 and10 in the three temporal windows while there was a movement of grid points across south central india cluster 5 western india cluster 1 north western india cluster 2 north central india cluster 3 eastern india cluster 4 and konkan coast cluster 7 to examine the stability of clusters across western india north western india north central india eastern india three hotspots a b and c were identified see fig 11 based on the shifting of grids between the clusters from 1st time window to 3rd time window in fig 9a c further investigation was for all the grids which shifted however the results are shown for 12 grid points in each hotspot for every grid point in the identified hotspot the pentad distribution during the indian summer monsoon months was plotted for the three temporal windows figs 12 14 illustrate the shifting and fluctuating pentad distribution in the three temporal windows 1901 1940 black line 1941 1980 blue line and 1981 2013 red line and it revealed an essential facet of the indian summer monsoon in hotspot a fig 12 there was a shift in the pentad distribution from 1st temporal window to 3rd temporal window in the 1st temporal window the highest pentad precipitation was observed in august but in the 2nd and 3rd temporal window the highest shifted towards july disclosing changes in intra annual variability in hotspot b fig 13 there was an increase in the strength of monsoon from 1st temporal window to last on the contrary there was a decrease in the strength of monsoon in hotspot c fig 14 further the first moment of area centroid was calculated for every grid point following feng et al 2013 fig 15 shows the plot of the average values over each time window of time of occurrence of the 50th percentile precipitation and the corresponding precipitation amount for all the three hotspots in hotspot a the time of occurrence of the 50th percentile shifted 10 days i e from pentad number 45 43 from 1st to 2nd time window and it was consistent in the 3rd time window the significance testing was done using the two tailed t test for testing the difference in the mean values obtained from the three time windows the results in terms of the p values from the t test table 3 revealed that the difference in the mean values from 1st to 2nd time window for all points was significant p 0 05 on the other side the p values for the magnitude of precipitation given in brackets indicated no statistically significant change in hotspot b fig 15 and table 3 there was no significant change in the time of occurrence of the 50th percentile over the three windows however the magnitude of 50th percentile showed a significant increase in the precipitation amount at all grid points from 1st to 2nd time window in hotspot c a different behavior was observed wherein there was no significant shift in the precipitation timing but a statistically significant decrease in the magnitude of 50th percentile in the 3rd time window 1980 2013 the observations on changes in the precipitation pattern were corroborating with the findings of guntu et al 2020a and sahany et al 2018 who showed a significant trend in the variability of precipitation both in terms of quantity and timing in central india these observations showed that the proposed approach was sensitive in capturing the temporal changes in the precipitation magnitude and its variability possibly due to changes in climate variability 5 discussion this study developed a regionalization framework accounting for both temporal variability and magnitude of precipitation we investigated the inter annual variability of precipitation at monthly jan dec seasonal spring summer fall winter and annual time scales the time series of gridded precipitation at different time scales was selected as a clustering variable this means that homogeneous regions were defined based on coherent climate variability at different time scales monthly seasonal and annual rather than mean climate conditions this is an essential step as an estimation of key variables and grouping of the precipitation time series fig 7 captures the local and inter annual variability at individual grid points respectively and allows regionalization irrespective of the contiguity of the grid points and the assumptions involved therein standardized variability index svi was used to quantify the precipitation variability at different scales and self organizing maps were employed to delineate homogeneous precipitation regions these were capable of identifying regions of common seasonality climate sensitivity and global mechanisms that drive variability for different regions the mean precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability using svi were assessed over 113 years 1901 2013 for the indian mainland it was found that the temporal variability increased from annual time scale to monthly timescale this is in congruence with the general understanding that the temporal variability dampens guntu et al 2020a mishra et al 2009 on coarser scales besides at each time scale the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability were spatially varying fig 4 owing to different climatic conditions and forms the basis for clustering based on this observation ten different clusters fig 7 were identified that could be tied back to two general categories such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics the number of clusters reflects the climatological diversity of the indian mainland and the number of grid points per cluster sets the extent to which each distinct climatology family is sampled the spatial extent of the grid points in the communities prominently shows the ability of the method to capture the underlying driving forces fukushima et al 2019 and mannan et al 2018 developed seven ten homogenous regions by considering the only magnitude of pentad precipitation only daily precipitation and employing hierarchical clustering and self organizing maps these studies pointed out the developed regions and well represented the seasonal characteristics of ism and nem on comparing clustered regions with the present study three regions i e south central india cluster 5 south eastern coastlines cluster 6 konkan coast cluster 7 were in almost good agreement however the remaining seven regions turned out to be spatially different a multitude of studies conducted in the past along these three regions did not show any indication for changes in precipitation characteristics ghosh et al 2012 goswami et al 2006 guntu et al 2020a roxy et al 2017 this is an interesting observation i e consideration of temporal variability plays an insignificant role in the shape size and stability of these three homogeneous regions further the discussion is limited to the remaining seven regions which are new and different from the previous studies intriguingly the separate rain belt cluster 9 and rain shadow cluster 10 himalayan cluster formed in the present study are different from the previous studies agarwal et al 2018 fukushima et al 2019 malik et al 2016 where the entire western himalayas was classified as a single homogeneous region however this finding is supported by shukla et al 2019 highlighting that the topography plays an important role in differentiating precipitation over rain shadow and rain belt western himalayas the orographic barrier pir panjan range divides the rain belt western himalayan and the rain shadow western himalayan i e the rain shadow region stands as a barrier to the moisture carrying monsoon winds crossing over to tibetan plateau thereby causing heavy to very heavy precipitation of short 3 4 h to long 10 14 h duration in the rain belt region nandargi and dhar 2011 the pir panjal range of the western himalayas successfully intercepts the moisture from the monsoon currents it acts as a rain belt region while the opposite side i e the rain shadow western himalayan region is a dry region the monsoon is extremely weak over this region hence the leh station located in rain shadow western himalayan merely receives 93 mm of precipitation in a whole year nandargi and dhar 2011 the temporal evolution of clusters fig 10a c discloses an interesting observation for instance grid points belonging to the central india region as a whole western india cluster 1 north western india cluster 2 north central india cluster 3 and eastern india cluster 4 are time variant during the three temporal windows figs 12 14 indicate the changes in the precipitation characteristics of central india with time in terms of changing seasonality and magnitude of ism goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2015 malik et al 2016 found that the grid points belonging to central india are contributing 90 100 of ism to the annual precipitation budget therefore fig 15 highlights that in central india the significant changes in precipitation characteristics can be attributed only to the increasing heterogeneity in ism in the last 50 years that has been reported in earlier studies ghosh et al 2012 vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 mannan et al 2018 pointed out that spatial heterogeneity of climatic variables over central india is also one of the causes for changes in precipitation with time also roxy et al 2017 reported changes in frequency and magnitude of precipitation over these regions due to the increase in global warming recently kurths et al 2019 confirmed the emerging patterns and teleconnection in central indian due to north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the decrease of 10 days in the occurrence of 50th percentile monsoon in north western india cluster 2 after the 1940s an increase of precipitation by 5 mm corresponding to the 50th percentile monsoon in western india cluster 1 after the 1940s a decrease of 5 mm precipitation corresponding to the 50th percentile monsoon in north central india cluster 3 region after the 1980s were never reported in the previous studies there is an effect of non stationarity on the clusters in terms of varying magnitude and frequency with time interestingly our approach is capable of capturing that therefore as described in section 3 3 there is a necessity for using both precipitation magnitude and its inter annual variability for robust homogenous regions inclusion of precipitation magnitude and accounting for its temporal variability in the proposed regionalization offered more robust homogenous regions the method was tested on a gridded precipitation dataset for two reasons i the availability and the access to rain gauge data is limited and ii gridded datasets provide an effective platform to understand the precipitation dynamics the gridding process used to build the dataset might affect the relationships between grid points owing to the assumptions underlying the spatial interpolation however these effects can be neglected considering the extent of the study area besides the method is applicable to all sort of data found to be highly effective in capturing the seasonality 6 conclusions the present study has proposed a novel method for precipitation regionalization using self organizing map coupled with multi scale standardized variability index the time series of gridded precipitation at different time scales is selected as a clustering variable this means that homogeneous regions are defined based on coherent climate variability at different time scales monthly seasonal and annual rather than mean climate conditions this is important as seasonalityis a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year due to local variability besides coherent inter annual variability suggests a common response to large scale climate drivers when regionalization is applied to observations at different time scales then the approach can help identify regions of common seasonality climate sensitivity and identify mechanisms that drive variability for each region application of the method to indian precipitation offers promising results for regionalization the following concluding remarks can be made from the study a the multi scale standardized variability index measure captures the variability of precipitation dynamics at each grid point independently and then allows the formation of a homogeneous cluster that is not based on any prior assumptions b the svi som clustering approach for precipitation regionalization is found to be robust and overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by including uncertainties of precipitation magnitude in a multi scale approach and forms new clusters across central and northern india c the temporal evolution of clusters unravels a significant change in the occurrence of 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across north western region cluster 2 a significant increase of 5 mm precipitation of the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across western india cluster 1 and decrease of 5 mm of 50th percentile monsoon after the 1980s in north central region cluster 3 on the contrary south central india cluster 5 south eastern coastlines cluster 6 and konkan coast cluster 7 are stable independent of temporal variability and intriguingly separate eastern cluster 10 and western himalayas cluster 9 clusters formed due to the difference in the physiographic features d the atmospheric dynamics across central india regions could be forecasted by using a robust dynamical model to unravel large scale drivers to local climate variability and has important implications for high performing seasonal prediction system in ungauged sites applications of the proposed methodology to data from other parts of the world with different climatic and environmental characteristics would also help verify and possibly strengthen and confirm the conclusions drawn here credit authorship contribution statement ravi

5159,flood risk assessment and management typically rely on flood frequency analysis ffa such that planning and countermeasures can be designed based on the discharge that has to be expected at a given location for a given return period in mountain streams systematic flow time series are often very short or completely missing which significantly reduces the reliability of ffa in fast flowing mountain streams the inclusion of non systematic data obtained from botanical evidence be is seen as an optimal alternative to extend systematic data back in time however no comprehensive protocol has been defined so far to tackle ffa using be on the basis of recent case studies we present here an application oriented protocol with guidelines on how to combine systematic and non systematic data in ffa containing be this study is based on work realized in different mountain streams located in spain poland and india representing quite diverse physiographic characteristics and differing hydrological regimes we organize the protocol along the different steps that are typically realized in be based ffa i dating of floods from be ii estimation of flood flows from paleostage indicators psi and hydrodynamic modelling as well as iii ffa using the expected moments algorithm ema the ubiquity of trees growing along mountain streams their longevity and the often large number of flood affected trees makes them an almost unbeatable data source that can be employed readily and with reasonable efforts to improve the reliability of ffa especially in data scarce regions in addition the ema represents a highly efficient tool for the collection of information contained in be as it can be used with interval censored and binomial censored data and on any distributional family that can be operated with the method of moments accordingly we call for more work incorporating be into ffa in mountain streams such that flood hazard and risk assessment can be undertaken more robustly and therefore more effective risk mitigation measures can be envisaged keywords mountain rivers paleoflood data abrasion scars tree ring records expected moments algorithm ema flood frequency analysis ffa 1 introduction floods are among the most critical natural hazards and often have adverse impacts on the activities of human beings jonkman 2005 both the eu floods directive and the us national flood insurance program therefore underline the crucial role of flood frequency analysis ffa in the assessment and management of flood related risks with the aim to reduce the negative effects of floods on human health the environment economic activities and cultural heritage ntelekos et al 2010 madsen et al 2014 consequently an accurate estimation of flood magnitude and frequency are critically needed for an appropriate definition of ideal locations and an adequate design of structural and non structural measures aimed at mitigating flood risk hall and solomatine 2008 a series of problems often hamper the estimation of flood peak quantiles for a set of not exceedance probabilities these are primarily the result of i times series that are much shorter than the return periods that have to be obtained ii systematic error related to over or under estimation of rating curves iii uncertainties linked to the statistical model s used iv the misleading assumption that instantaneous peak flows are statistically independent and identically distributed and iv the non satisfied hypothesis of stationarity in the flow time series lópez and francés 2013 in connection with the shortness of flow time series historical and multi archive paleoflood data can complement or extend the length of a given time series thereby improving at site ffa wilhelm et al 2019 schulte et al 2019 historical information from oral descriptions newspapers and flood marks barriendos et al 2003 has been neatly documented across europe in the past with evidence sometimes dating back to ce 1500 brázdil et al 2006 information obtained from these sources has lately been integrated into ffa machado et al 2015 in comparison paleoflood hydrology has the capacity to establish flood flows that occurred recently or hundreds to ten thousands of years back thereby covering periods well prior to human observation baker 1987 2008 paleoflood hydrology uses geological geomorphological and botanical evidence be with the latter relying on the potential of tree ring records to store evidence of past floods in their growth rings and their ability to yield information that can be used for a hydrological characterization of paleoflood discharges bodoque et al 2015 all data sources used in paleoflood hydrology leave evidence known as paleoflood stages or paleostage indicators or psi webb and jarrett 2002 the lines of evidence of paleofloods that are commonly used as psi include slackwater deposits swd benito et al 2003 cobble and gravel flood bars fb jarrett and tomlinson 2000 abrasion scars on trees ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a as well as erosional features on channel margins bodoque et al 2011 in addition to psi one may also mention terraces next to rivers as they can be used to estimate flood thresholds in terms of non exceedance bounds benito et al 2004 all these lines of evidence can help to improve the dating of paleofloods but also allow quantitative characterization of their magnitude through the application of paleohydraulic techniques in mountain rivers whol 2000 be has become a valuable source of information for flood paleohydrology and an alternative to the use of historical geological and geomorphic evidence bodoque et al 2015 in mountain regions documentary records are often short and incomplete to such a degree that they cannot readily be used when it comes to the documentation of the largest floods this lack of information can be explained by the scarcity of human settlements or the late settlement of areas where villages only started to develop recently often as a result of increasing tourist activities ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a for the very same reasons systematic data such as annual peak discharge only rarely exist in a form i e regular prescribed measurement intervals at gaging station salas et al 1994 that can be exploited or are not significant from a statistical perspective brázdil et al 2006 at the same time mountain rivers are highly prone to produce high energy floods that are not usually leaving swd that could be used for a spatial characterization of past extreme events ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 conversely be often occurs in abundant numbers and across sections with such a spatial representation that the reconstruction of past flood flows in mountain rivers can be envisaged in terms of their magnitude and frequency bodoque et al 2015 studies based on be thereby mostly use trees growing in floodplains as floodplain trees present datable evidence of past flooding in their tree ring records sigafoos 1964 in fact several types of be provide hints to past floods díez herrero et al 2013 among these abrasion scars are the most frequently used type of evidence because they are easily detectable on the stem surface of trees in the field abrasion scars are readily datable as the impact of sediment and woody debris transported by the flood will cause growth disturbances in trees which in turn can be detected both macroscopically and microscopically in tree ring series scott et al 1996 copini et al 2016 it is assumed that both the height and location of these scars on stems represent psi of past floods in the following we will use the term psi to refer to scars on trees and will use them to estimate paleoflood flows these estimates are realized by combining the information contained in trees with hydraulic approaches the complexity of the approach used will thereby depend on the quality of available topographic data in cases where topographic data suffers from low spatial representation rather simplified hydraulic approaches will be employed such as the critical depth bodoque et al 2011 or slope area jarrett 1987 methods in cases where available topographic data is accurate and spatially representative flood mapping can be generated by applying 1d primarily step backwater method cook 1987a b or 2d hydraulic models ballesteros cánovas et al 2011 ballesteros et al 2011 but even if be evidently has a high potential for ffa in mountain rivers estimates of paleoflood flows have only occasionally been obtained through the coupling of information contained in psi with hydraulic modelling ballesteros et al 2011 past research also included regional ffa where information available from recent gauging station measurements has been combined with considerably older non systematic data i e information contained in historical biological or geological data england et al 2018 using bayesian markov monte carlo chain algorithms ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 however none of the published work has so far provided sufficient detail to allow ffa based on be to be reproduced at other sites by other teams of researchers this study therefore seeks to develop a protocol for the realization of ffa based on systematic and non systematic be data in such a way that the approach can be applied consistently and uniformly regardless of the physiographic context in other mountain regions to this end we have compiled information on flood flows from 6 mountain rivers in spain poland and india to nourish the protocol in terms of non systematic data the dating of floods was based on dendrochronological analyses of increment cores obtained from scarred tree stems depending on the quality of available topographic information paleoflood flows were estimated either with 2d hydrodynamic models in case of accurate spatially representative smooth and continuous topographic data e g lidar or by applying the step backwater method between cross sections if topographic data was accurate but not spatially continuous besides to characterize uncertainty paleoflood flows were integrated into annual maximum flow series in the form of ranges of values min max and censored data for the ffa we used pearson type iii distributions with a logarithmic transformation of the annual maximum series in a last analytical step we describe the expected moments algorithm ema cohn et al 1997 2001 which allows fitting of the distribution parameters 2 material and methods fig 1 illustrates the proposed protocol by showing its individual steps it has been validated in mountain rivers of spain poland and india representing diverse physiographic characteristics and varying hydrological regimes 2 1 study sites and datasets available the data used in this study are from three different mountain regions the spanish central system the polish tatra mountains and the western indian himalayas fig 2 drainage areas of river reaches under investigation range from 2 5 to 470 km2 whereas maximum elevations range from 1 800 to 6 348 m a s l in all catchments snow plays an important role in the seasonal hydrological balance in all domains hydrological response is influenced considerably by both surface and subsurface runoff due to the presence of leptosol type soils in all cases the hydrological regime of the reaches investigated in this study can be considered as unaffected in terms of human interventions at the two study sites in central spain alberche river and arroyo de los puentes lithology consist primarily of granitoids gneisses or schists whereas geomorphic features is unequivocally dominated by torrential footprints with levees lobes and well defined avulsion channels ballesteros et al 2011 ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b in the polish tatras flood flows were reconstructed at strążyski stream draining the northern slopes of the mountain chain geology consists of granitoid outcrops and metamorphic rocks covered by mesozoic sediments the most characteristic geomorphic features include pleistocene glacial and holocene mass movement forms and deposits with multiple sites with glacier abrasion glacial lakes moraine deposits as well as alluvial or colluvial fans ballesteros cánovas et al 2015c ballesteros cánovas et al 2016 the river reaches under investigation in the western indian himalayas are located in kullu district himachal pradesh in terms of geology the sites are characterized by granitoids gneisses schists shales and quartzites of the kullu formation the beas river flows from n to s through a wide u shaped valley with wide alluvial plains the beas river is fed by several tributaries among these are the sainj and thiertan rivers flowing through narrow valleys with steep hillsides ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 annual runoff coefficients at the study sites range from 0 45 to 0 6 with the lowest values observed in the arroyo de los puentes and strążyski catchments the highest values are calculated for the alberche river and the indian himalayan sites ballesteros et al 2011 ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b c 2016 2017 according to the world map of the köppen geiger climate classification köppen 2019 the spanish study sites can be characterized as mediterranean with humid continental climate with mild summers csb the polish tatras study site can be described as hemiboreal without a dry season but mild summers and cold winters dfb the western indian himalayas study sites are located in several climatic zones namely continental without dry season but hot summers and cold winters dfa subtropical without a dry season but hot summers cfa and tropical dry or savannah with dry winters aw in the alberche river sampled trees included alder alnus glutinosa l gaertn and ash fraxinus angustifolia vahl ballesteros et al 2011 at arroyo de los puentes scots pine pinus sylvestris l were sampled ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b at strążyski stream we used norway spruce picea abies l karst and silver fir abies alba mill ballesteros cánovas et al 2016 in the indian himalayan rivers trees sampled included himalayan white pine pinus wallichiana a b

et al 2017 for each study site systematic records were of annual maximum flows and peak flows were obtained from official repositories these records were supplemented with paleoflood data from be obtained in previous studies see table 1 detailed topographic data was generated from lidar data and used to reconstruct flood flows with 2d hydrodynamic models in the case that this data did not exist cross sections were surveyed in the field a step backwater method was then applied to transform the height of dated abrasion scars into flood flows 2 2 dating of floods based on tree ring records 2 2 1 field surveys and sampling strategies the selection of trees in the field is based on externally visible damage that has been undoubtedly induced by fluvial process activity fig 3 the different types of flooding evidence here referred to as be occur in the form of abrasion scars exposed roots or tilted stems ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a with abrasion scars on tree stems located in the direction of the flow being the key proxy being used to reconstructing both flood chronologies and maximum flood heights gottesfeld 1996 tree sampling that is aimed at dating flood events is normally based on the extraction of core samples from impacted stems using an increment borer stoffel and corona 2014 or on the extraction of small wedges or partial cross sections within and next to the wounded area with a handsaw each tree selected for analysis is conveniently located with a gps and coded in addition all characteristics of the tree i e species size diameter at breast height dbh social position and its growth environment e g lithology slope distance to the river are characterized díez herrero et al 2007 2 2 2 laboratory analyses tree ring samples are usually mounted on woody supports and allowed to air dry stoffel and bollschweiler 2008 samples are the sanded with increasingly fine sandpaper until tree rings become clearly visible such that the widths of rings can be measured reliably measurements can be done either by scanning the samples at high resolution and the use of a specific image processing software e g coorecorder windendro or by using high precision measurement tables that are coupled to a stereomicroscope and a programme that allows for cross dating and chronology building e g tsapwin stoffel and corona 2014 to distinguish clear flood signals from noise induced by other external processes tree ring based flood reconstruction rely on reference chronologies which are usually built from at least trees per species and for each species that has been sampled for flood reconstructions reference chronologies depict normal growth conditions in undisturbed trees and thus allow comparison with the growth ring records of flood impacted trees and the identification of growth anomalies or be graphical crossdating relies on the skeleton plotting method cropper 1979 by which anomalous growth conditions e g very narrow or wide rings are marked on a scale paper statistical crossdating is based on a combination of graphical and statistical functions available in tsapwin rinn 2003 more explanations on the construction of reference chronologies cross dating or the inclusion of tree ring series with missing or double rings can be found in fritts 1976 cook 1987a b cook et al 1990 or vaganov et al 2006 as soon as tree ring growth series are properly cross dated growth disturbances are analyzed in the trees affected by past floods the focus thereby is on injuries and the adjacent callus tissue allowing the dating of scars schneuwly et al 2009 it is also possible to investigate reaction wood that is formed as a reaction to tree tilting timell 1986 and abrupt changes in tree growth such as intense growth decreases or by contrast growth releases although these tree ring signals are only considered to support the dating of scars stoffel and corona 2014 growth anomalies are then summarized and weighted with a weighting index wit for a particular flood event this wit considers the number and intensity of growth disturbances within each tree ring series but also regarding the percentage of responding trees among all damaged trees that have been sampled fig 4 kogelnig mayer et al 2011 2 3 estimation of peak flows the accuracy peak flow estimates from be will depend on the type of topographic dataset and their resolution in cases where only few cross sections are available one should apply the step backwater method this approach allows calculation of a one dimensional energy balanced water surface profile for both steady and gradually varied flows as a function of discharge channel roughness and channel geometry cook 1987a b webb and jarrett 2002 implementation of this method requires an accurate representation of the geometry of several cross sections and their associated roughness coefficients besides it also needs the selection of river reaches in which the lithological configuration of the channel supports the assumption of invariant geometry over time the spacing between cross sections should correspond approximately to the channel width so that the assumption of gradually varied flow is still fulfilled further the approach assumes a discharge at the lowermost cross section using a trial and error approach the error in terms of differences in height between psi and simulated water surface profiles is calculated for the second lowest third lowest up to the uppermost cross section so that the energy balance can be fulfilled in this way friction losses can be estimated between successive cross sections by using the manning equation in cases where highly resolved continuous topographic datasets with x y and z values are available e g lidar data a two dimensional hydrodynamic model can be used fig 5 for the simulation of free surface flow bladé et al 2014 such models can usually compute turbulent flows in unsteady regimes they can also deal with subcritical and supercritical flows including mobile hydraulic jumps horritt and bates 2002 by solving the 2d saint venant equations bladé et al 2012 in an integrated way by employing explicit schemes of finite volumes on an unstructured mesh these explicit schemes are particularly appropriate for the simulation of hydraulics in mountain rivers where shocks and discontinuities can occur and where flood hydrographs are usually sharp bodoque et al 2015 information on friction can be derived by combining information existing in official land use maps or assessed in situ if not readily available with manning s n roughness coefficient chow 1959 uncertainty in the resulting flood flow estimate thereby presents the result of the initial assumption that the roughness coefficients manning s n follow a uniform probability distribution ballesteros et al 2011 2 4 flood frequency analysis 2 4 1 preliminary data analysis each ffa should start with an initial and exploratory data analysis before in depth analyses can be undertaken helsel and hirsch 2002 these initial procedures typically include the plotting of time series assessment of serial correlations and analysis of monotonic trends with the dual objective of detecting errors in the data as well as verifying that the data meet the assumptions inherent to ffa i e instantaneous peak flows are statistically independent and identically distributed plus the hypothesis of stationarity in the flow time series is fulfilled visual inspection of annual flood series allows detection of trends or occurrence of anomalously high or low flows serial correlation i e a measure of the degree of dependency for data values at varying time lags is tested using a correlogram in which autocorrelation coefficients are plotted against time lags salas 1993 the correlogram is an excellent proxy as it enables checking for randomness in a dataset if the dataset has random values white noise autocorrelations should be close to zero for all time lags if the data is non random the correlogram will show values close to one thereby indicating a deterministic process the ffa approach that is described in the following can only be applied if the assumption of stationarity in the annual flood series is met i e if the time series are free of any trends shifts or periodicity salas 1993 based on the examination of the correlograms one can then determine whether the year to year autocorrelation has an influence on the detection of monotonic trends in annual maximum flood peaks where monotonic trends exist in annual maximum peak flow time series villarini et al 2009 the non parametric mann kendall test is used kendall 1975 mann 1945 on the basis of kendall s tau as a metric of the statistical significance of monotonic relations between peak flows and the year in which they occurred furthermore sen s slope estimator should be employed to determine the significance of trends cunderlik and burn 2003 2 4 2 expected moments algorithm ema with the exception of the arroyo de los puentes study site where annual flood data was estimated only with be time series were obtained from official gauging stations and thereafter complemented with paleoflood data obtained from be for the ffa we employ the u s national flood frequency guidelines published in bulletin 17c england et al 2018 this ffa is based on a pearson type iii distribution with logarithmic transformation of flow data england et al 2003 for the estimation of pearson type iii distribution parameters an expected moments algorithm ema is employed on the basis of a generalized method of moments procedure cohn et al 1997 2001 ema is a comprehensive approach for the moments analysis as it uses skewed data and in addition to using systematic streamflow records for the ffa also allows adding non systematic data to the time series to this end positions are plotted for systematic and non systematic data hirsch and stedinger 1987 to assess how log pearson type iii distribution fits the data further the multiple grubbs beck statistic was used to identify multiple potentially influential low flows pilfs cohn et al 2013 the implementation of the ema is based on the identification and treatment of the information included in both recorded i e systematic and non systematic data sources and unrecorded values for floods defined by be each categorized event accordingly allows the flow time series to be extended in addition for each flow that has not been recorded or in the case of censored data stedinger and cohn 1986 one assumes that such flows would be larger than the perception threshold stedinger and baker 1987 above which a flood would have been recorded confidence intervals for flood quantile estimates can be included as well by providing analytical expressions for the asymptotic variance of the ema flood quantile estimator cohn et al 2001 moments estimation of the log pearson type iii distribution is based on the representation of flow data in intervals i e for a particular year y the flow q is represented as qylower and qyupper for systematic data one assumes that the flow is known accurately such that qylower qyupper qy if the flow is not known precisely which is the case of paleoflood data obtained from be intervals are used two scenarios were considered i a flood is known to have reached a maximum flow but the minimum is unknown i e censored data or ii the value of a flood flow is within a relatively wide range in the case of censored data one only has a conservative estimate of flow values associated with flooding qyupper whereas qylower has to be assumed equal to zero the ema also needs a determination of perception thresholds for the estimation of confidence intervals outside the time window s covered by systematic data these perception thresholds represent the potential range of flows tylower tyupper that are detectable in be in case of flood occurrences here tylower is assumed to be equal to the lowest flow estimated from be whereas tyupper is infinite in the case of systematic data tylower represents the smallest flood flow recorded based on gauge base discharge which is typically zero whereas tyupper is assumed to be infinite in the case of incomplete records perception thresholds were used to fill the gaps in the time series 3 results 3 1 flood quantile estimates based on botanical evidence 3 1 1 adequacy of time series used to perform ffa in the mountain rivers analysed in this study visual evaluation of the time series did not disclose any obvious increasing or decreasing trends in flows over time this qualitative appraisal is confirmed by the non parametric mann kendall test proving that all annual maximum flood time series are stationary over time at the 5 significance level table 2 the correlograms show that all autocorrelation coefficients are contained within the 95 probability limits thus confirming the absence of statistically significant correlation fig 6 therefore one can conclude that the annual flood time series used in this study are completely random white noise 3 1 2 ffa from implementing the ema approach the data available at all study sites with the sole exception of arroyo de los puentes central spain were categorised into systematic data as well as non systematic flow intervals and perception thresholds derived from be fig 7 in the case of arroyo de los puentes 15 paleoflood data derived from be were available table 3 in which the resulting time series lacked temporal continuity the available data in this study site were represented as perception threshold censored data points and intervals among the study sites for which systematic data was available only sainj river gauging station had a length of less than 30 water years i e 21 water years at the other study sites time series ranged from 32 thiertan river to 48 beas river water years at three study sites alberche beas and thiertan rivers the systematic data time series could be extended with 1 peak flood data derived from be whereas in the case of strążyski stream and sainj river the non systematic be data were 3 and 7 peak flood discharges respectively table 3 as a result the systematic time series of flow data were extended between one beas river and 48 years strążyski stream for the thiertan alberche and sainj rivers the extension of the time series was by 6 9 and 12 years respectively perception thresholds were then defined on the basis of the flood reconstructed for which be showed the smallest magnitude we used the lowest value that was available from the flow intervals as a reference in the case of strążyski stream for which systematic record was incomplete the perception threshold obtained in this way was also used to fill the gap in the discontinuous time series the ffa was obtained through a ema using a multiple grubbs beck statistic for the detection of potentially influential low flows pilfs station skew was used as the third moment to estimate parameters of the log pearson type iii distribution so as to allow to put the focus on the at site data accordingly the estimated final moments for arroyo de los puentes without systematic data were 2 024 mean 0 337 standard deviation and 0 197 at site skew table 4 shows the calculated final moments for the ffa analysis if based exclusively on systematic data and the one obtained when considering systematic and non systematic data jointly ffa was performed for two scenarios i gaged records only and ii all available data including paleoflood chronologies from be and perception thresholds the ensuing fitted frequency curves and the estimates of peak flow quantiles in m3 s 1 are shown in tables 5 and 6 as well as in fig 8 results of the ffa reveal that the log pearson type iii model fits well with the bulk of the data and sites under investigation though excluding the alberche river the approach seems to underestimate major floods as a result of the influence of paleoflood data this underestimation is explained by the fact that floods derived from be i e non systematic flow data yield values that are substantially larger than the largest flows existing in the systematic records the implementation of the multiple grubbs beck statistic allowed demonstrating the absence of pilfs at the study sites ffa results for the arroyo de los puentes are characterized by high uncertainty such that the set of 500 year quantile estimates range from 532 5 lower confidence limit and 8 930 m3 s 1 95 upper confidence limit for the 5 year quantile estimate the uncertainty band is between 123 5 lower confidence limit and 406 m3 s 1 95 upper confidence limit at the other study sites the extension of gaged time series with non systematic records yielded higher estimates for longer return period quantiles than those obtained with systematic data alone the largest differences are observed for the beas river where the 100 year quantile estimate increased by 387 from 500 to 2 437 m3 s 1 and the 500 year quantile estimate increased by 1 275 or from 678 to 9 325 m3 s 1 at the other indian sites differences were important as well but still more moderate in the case of the thiertan river the 100 and 500 year quantile estimates increased by 111 and 214 respectively whereas for sainj river the 100 and 500 year quantile estimates increased by 86 and 145 by contrast only minor increases were found for the strążyski stream and alberche river where the 100 year flood increased by 33 and 37 respectively and the 500 year flood was 52 larger at both sites than in the estimates based on systematic data alone the other significant benefit of incorporating all available data defined in scenario ii into the ffa is their impact on confidence intervals at all sites the inclusion of non systematic data into analyses has increased the 95 confidence intervals for the low probability quantile estimates 100 and 500 yr recurrence intervals as compared to a consideration of gaged records alone in the case of the alberche river the enlargement of the uncertainty band is not very significant representing 3 and 9 for the 500 and 100 year floods respectively similar results are found for the strążyski stream with zero variation in the uncertainty bandwidth for the 100 year flood but a 21 increase in the uncertainty bandwidth for the 500 year flood in the case of the three indian rivers the increase in the uncertainty bandwidth is much larger for the beas river the result of integrating both systematic and non systematic information into the ffa results in a change of the 500 year flood uncertainty bandwidth by 2 orders of magnitude as compared to the inclusion of systematic data alone for the thiertan and sainj rivers uncertainty bandwidths increase as well after the integration of all available information but the change is significantly smaller than at beas river with roughly 300 and 500 changes for uncertainty bandwidths of the 100 and 500 year floods respectively 4 discussion 4 1 goodness of be to be incorporated into ffa 4 1 1 obtaining flood chronologies the protocol presented in this study aimed at illustrating that the inclusion of flood information contained in be can play a very important role in the extension of systematic flow time series but also for the estimation of flow quantiles in cases where systematic data does not exist at all arroyo de los puentes tree ring based flood records also have several advantages over sediment based paleoflood studies as approaches based on be allow the dating of floods with annual accuracy thereby facilitating integration into systematic flood records ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a moreover and in the case of mountain rivers characterized by the occurrence of high energy floods paleostage indicators in the form of geomorphic evidence left in the field are not frequently conserved or regularly overprinted by subsequent events stoffel 2010 by contrast be often occurs in abundant numbers and across reaches such that the information that can be gathered from trees becomes spatially representative despite the rather vast potential that dendrogeomorphology has in boosting the reliability of ffa by far the largest number of studies published hitherto has been limited to the dating of flood evidence contained in trees sigafoos 1964 gottesfeld and johnson gottesfeld 1990 yanoski and jarrett 2002 zielonka et al 2008 ballesteros et al 2010a b rodriguez morata et al 2016 ruiz villanueva et al 2010 šilhán 2015 šilhán et al 2018 more recently however research has started to include estimates of flood magnitudes using botanical psi either by estimating flood flows with the help of simple equations webb and jarrett 2002 or by implementing complex 2d hydrodynamic models ballesteros cánovas et al 2011 ballesteros et al 2011 only few studies have hitherto added flood flows estimates from be to systematic data so as to perform regional ffa ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 several shortcomings remain when employing be in ffa the main limitation is related to the length of the time series that can be reconstructed from tree ring analysis in most riparian environments trees growing next to rivers are rather short lived either because of frequent removal by floods or as a result of the genetic make up and the limited lifespan of riparian species as compared to many other tree species growing on other geomorphic features such as debris flow cones or rockfall slopes where conifers can grow for centuries stoffel et al 2005 by contrast flood chronologies are often limited to the last few decades ballesteros et al 2010a b or in rather exceptional cases to a few centuries ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b extreme floods can destroy the forest cover especially near the channel or in sectors affected by avulsion ruiz villanueva et al 2016 destructive floods clearly affect the potential number and age of trees that are available for dendrogeomorphic studies bodoque et al 2015 in addition and due to their restriction to the riparian zone it is sometimes difficult to find undisturbed trees for the construction of reference chronologies of those species for which impacted trees with be have been sampled for analysis kames et al 2016 in addition and despite the fact that multiple papers have been published on flood series derived from tree ring records our knowledge about the response of tree species to floods remains incomplete in terms of wood anatomical responses ballesteros et al 2010b ballesteros cánovas et al 2015d or intra annual dating of scars in broadleaved trees e g arbellay et al 2010 stoffel et al 2019 thus and even if numerous studies have used tree ring response induced by flooding a purely mechanistic or plant physiological investigation of the impacts of floods on trees is yet to be realized 4 1 2 estimating flood flows from psi paleodischarges estimated from be can obviously suffer from uncertainties and errors one typical source of error is in the hydrodynamic behaviour inherent to the interference between the flood flow and trees during a flood trees often form an obstruction to the flow and thereby influence drag forces and turbulence which in turn result in energy losses and subsequent variations in the water level therefore and in situations in which the flow is subcritical the water surface upstream of a tree will increase whereas around of the trunk a local decrease in the water surface will form conversely in the case of supercritical flow a tree will cause an increase in the water surface downstream of the tree and a local increase in water surface around the trunk bodoque et al 2015 in this contribution approaches that can be used to estimate flood flows with be were divided with respect to the detail and quality of topographic datasets that are available for analysis the step backwater method shall be applied if analysis has to done with topographic data from only a few cross sections by contrast and at sites for which accurate digital elevation models exist 2d hydrodynamic models can be employed for the estimation of flood flows both approaches are very valuable tools and can assist the improvement of ffa in areas where series do not exist or where existing gage records or short or incomplete when using either of the approaches a certain number of limitations need to be kept in mind however as they can prevent proper analysis and or limit the validity of results as such the step backwater method is not necessarily accurate in high gradient streams as the pressure in the vertical direction may cease completely to become hydrostatic and as a result one of the principles on which the method is based may not be fulfilled bodoque et al 2011 in addition the method may be unreliable in cases where changes in the hydraulic regime occur as the approach does not consider the length of hydraulic jumps besides if flow velocity is in the order of 6 8 m s the method seems unable to reproduce the flow behaviour realistically as the flow will become unstable as a result of the very high froude and verdenikov numbers venutelli 2011 with such high flow velocities surface waves will generate especially if in addition to high velocities changes in cross sections and flow direction occur which the method does not reproduce properly in view of these limitations the critical depth method bodoque et al 2011 may offer greater reliability and precision however this approach is often not feasible as it requires both the existence of psi and local drops or narrow constrictions in channel geometry as well as an assumed subcritical regime upstream of the study reach i e conditions that are not always met the 2d hydrodynamic models are often affected by unconformities or just by a lack of uniformity in the algorithms that are used to solve the hydraulic equations as a rule of thumb and when it comes to support convergence between the model and the psi obtained from be the continuity equation usually represents the core component to be considered whereas the moment equation is often less relevant in addition one has to remember that 2d hydrodynamic models often neglect localised energy losses either as a result of flow contraction expansion or due to roughness neglecting these energy losses can lead to significant errors in estimates because flow velocity is usually high in mountain rivers and thus the energy losses are significant bodoque et al 2015 additionally when using 1 d or 2d hydrodynamic models changes in bed channel topography because of large sediment ladden floods can affect the reliability of peak discharges reconstruction ideally bed rock channels are targeted to assure the depth and width stability of the channel ballesteros cánovas et al 2011 bed rock channels present moreover a high transport capacity and limited deposition baker 1977 palucis and lamb 2017 which making hydraulic modelling easier other channel configurations such cascades plain bed or step pool could be also suitable as show lower spatial exchange rates in comparison with pool riffles or braided reach channels bisson et al 2017 yet when reconstructing the flood magnitude in these reach typologies geomorphic investigations on the stability of the channels are highly recommended in the case of colluvial channels the high connectivity to hillslope processes imply that the use of be for flood discharge should be considered with caution bodoque et al 2015 since the sediment transport could be highly affected by slope processes 4 2 integration of be in the ema approach the ffa illustrated in this study have been elaborated with the us national flood frequency guidelines bulletin 17c england et al 2018 using an approach that includes the application of an ema approach cohn et al 1997 2001 bulletin 17c also considers the integration of flood flows obtained with be in ffa or any other source of information on paleofloods such flows are characterized by a significantly higher uncertainty than those obtained from systematic series which due to their greater precision are represented as point values england et al 2018 paleoflood data derived from be are integrated in the flow time series as intervals censored data and perception thresholds stedinger and cohn 1986 stedinger and baker 1987 bulletin 17c also pays special attention to the identification of potentially influential low flows pilfs cohn et al 2013 so as to include low outliers and small observations with high leverage that might exert large influence on extreme quantile estimates the occurrence of pilfs is typical in rivers and streams found in arid and semi arid environments where very small flow values are common lamontagne et al 2016 as these climatic conditions were not met at any of the sites investigated in this study here we could not detect pilfs in flow series that could have had an impact on ffa in catchments where pilfs exist in the time series they can generate mathematical inconsistencies because zero value floods will define a logarithm of infinity whereas the logarithm of small flow values may define anomalous values as well moreover the presence of low flow values in the time series can have a substantial impact both on the adjustment of flood frequency distributions and flow quantiles of low and very low frequency floods the adjustment of the log pearson type iii distribution with an ema approach required estimation of the skew coefficient i e a metric defining the shape of the adjusted frequency distribution griffis and stedinger 2009 as this coefficient is one of the sample moments that are needed for the parameter estimation of such a distribution in the case of floods streamflow time series are used as a proxy to estimate skew provided that the existing time series was longer than 30 years stedinger et al 1993 with the exception of arroyo de los puentes 15 water years and sainj river 28 water years including systematic and non systematic data all sites analysed fulfilled this condition nonetheless and due to the high sensitivity of ffa to skew especially in cases where one is dealing with flow quantiles corresponding to low and very low frequency events it can be advisable to rely on regional skew data than on the values obtained for individual streams cohn et al 2001 the use of regional skew data is intended to render ffa more consistent even more so if a weighted skew coefficient is employed where both at site and regional data are considered griffis and stedinger 2007 last not least and as stated before flood chronologies that can be reconstructed from be are often limited to several decades and in some cases to the past few centuries their length nonetheless and in many instances allows considerable extension of systematic flow time series that are often very short i e ca 30 years or even less in mountain rivers accordingly flood flow information obtained from be can assist in achieving greater robustness in the estimation of flood quantiles especially also of the 100 year flood which is of paramount importance in flood risk management bubeck et al 2017 on the other hand uncertainties in flood quantile estimates for rare events with 500 year return periods or more remains difficult even with the addition of paleorecords from be 5 conclusions in this study ffa analyses have been realized at six study sites located in very different geographical regions with the aim to illustrate the various steps involved in ffa based on be and to showcase its benefits but also to pinpoint to possible caveats and remaining challenges the approach presented here is based on the combined use of systematic flow information with non systematic data obtained from be with the latter often providing information over timespans that exceed those of systematic measurements by decades and sometimes even by a few centuries we show that the inclusion of be has a high potential in ffa as it allows improving the characterization of the distribution timing and controls e g snowmelt soil moisture of past floods as a result of their fairly widespread occurrence in riparian environments trees with be not only occur in high numbers within a given reach thus allowing high spatial resolution but they also offer high temporal resolution enabling the dating of past floods with at least annual if not seasonal precision in addition be is usually the only non systematic data source that can be used in mountain streams to extend time series of systematic data or even the only existing source of information to estimate flood quantiles in the absence of systematic measurements as in the case of arroyo de los puentes in this study the ffa was based on the implementation of an ema approach that is based on the generalization of the method of moments which allows using different types of at site flood data i e systematic as well as non systematic data information on past flood flows can be accommodated as interval censored or binomial censored data and is treated in a single uniform and consistent analysis framework noteworthy the approach presented here does not require the use of algorithms other than ema to incorporate non systematic data during the adjustment of the flood frequency curve as a result no arbitrary adjustments need to be included in order to embed paleoflood data as a consequence the methodological proposal deployed here is thought to help improve the reliability of flood risk assessment and flood risk management significantly in particular in mountain streams where systematic data is not statistically significant in many instances or where such data does not exist at all and the only means of non systematic data has to be retrieved from be credit authorship contribution statement j m bodoque conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5159,flood risk assessment and management typically rely on flood frequency analysis ffa such that planning and countermeasures can be designed based on the discharge that has to be expected at a given location for a given return period in mountain streams systematic flow time series are often very short or completely missing which significantly reduces the reliability of ffa in fast flowing mountain streams the inclusion of non systematic data obtained from botanical evidence be is seen as an optimal alternative to extend systematic data back in time however no comprehensive protocol has been defined so far to tackle ffa using be on the basis of recent case studies we present here an application oriented protocol with guidelines on how to combine systematic and non systematic data in ffa containing be this study is based on work realized in different mountain streams located in spain poland and india representing quite diverse physiographic characteristics and differing hydrological regimes we organize the protocol along the different steps that are typically realized in be based ffa i dating of floods from be ii estimation of flood flows from paleostage indicators psi and hydrodynamic modelling as well as iii ffa using the expected moments algorithm ema the ubiquity of trees growing along mountain streams their longevity and the often large number of flood affected trees makes them an almost unbeatable data source that can be employed readily and with reasonable efforts to improve the reliability of ffa especially in data scarce regions in addition the ema represents a highly efficient tool for the collection of information contained in be as it can be used with interval censored and binomial censored data and on any distributional family that can be operated with the method of moments accordingly we call for more work incorporating be into ffa in mountain streams such that flood hazard and risk assessment can be undertaken more robustly and therefore more effective risk mitigation measures can be envisaged keywords mountain rivers paleoflood data abrasion scars tree ring records expected moments algorithm ema flood frequency analysis ffa 1 introduction floods are among the most critical natural hazards and often have adverse impacts on the activities of human beings jonkman 2005 both the eu floods directive and the us national flood insurance program therefore underline the crucial role of flood frequency analysis ffa in the assessment and management of flood related risks with the aim to reduce the negative effects of floods on human health the environment economic activities and cultural heritage ntelekos et al 2010 madsen et al 2014 consequently an accurate estimation of flood magnitude and frequency are critically needed for an appropriate definition of ideal locations and an adequate design of structural and non structural measures aimed at mitigating flood risk hall and solomatine 2008 a series of problems often hamper the estimation of flood peak quantiles for a set of not exceedance probabilities these are primarily the result of i times series that are much shorter than the return periods that have to be obtained ii systematic error related to over or under estimation of rating curves iii uncertainties linked to the statistical model s used iv the misleading assumption that instantaneous peak flows are statistically independent and identically distributed and iv the non satisfied hypothesis of stationarity in the flow time series lópez and francés 2013 in connection with the shortness of flow time series historical and multi archive paleoflood data can complement or extend the length of a given time series thereby improving at site ffa wilhelm et al 2019 schulte et al 2019 historical information from oral descriptions newspapers and flood marks barriendos et al 2003 has been neatly documented across europe in the past with evidence sometimes dating back to ce 1500 brázdil et al 2006 information obtained from these sources has lately been integrated into ffa machado et al 2015 in comparison paleoflood hydrology has the capacity to establish flood flows that occurred recently or hundreds to ten thousands of years back thereby covering periods well prior to human observation baker 1987 2008 paleoflood hydrology uses geological geomorphological and botanical evidence be with the latter relying on the potential of tree ring records to store evidence of past floods in their growth rings and their ability to yield information that can be used for a hydrological characterization of paleoflood discharges bodoque et al 2015 all data sources used in paleoflood hydrology leave evidence known as paleoflood stages or paleostage indicators or psi webb and jarrett 2002 the lines of evidence of paleofloods that are commonly used as psi include slackwater deposits swd benito et al 2003 cobble and gravel flood bars fb jarrett and tomlinson 2000 abrasion scars on trees ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a as well as erosional features on channel margins bodoque et al 2011 in addition to psi one may also mention terraces next to rivers as they can be used to estimate flood thresholds in terms of non exceedance bounds benito et al 2004 all these lines of evidence can help to improve the dating of paleofloods but also allow quantitative characterization of their magnitude through the application of paleohydraulic techniques in mountain rivers whol 2000 be has become a valuable source of information for flood paleohydrology and an alternative to the use of historical geological and geomorphic evidence bodoque et al 2015 in mountain regions documentary records are often short and incomplete to such a degree that they cannot readily be used when it comes to the documentation of the largest floods this lack of information can be explained by the scarcity of human settlements or the late settlement of areas where villages only started to develop recently often as a result of increasing tourist activities ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a for the very same reasons systematic data such as annual peak discharge only rarely exist in a form i e regular prescribed measurement intervals at gaging station salas et al 1994 that can be exploited or are not significant from a statistical perspective brázdil et al 2006 at the same time mountain rivers are highly prone to produce high energy floods that are not usually leaving swd that could be used for a spatial characterization of past extreme events ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 conversely be often occurs in abundant numbers and across sections with such a spatial representation that the reconstruction of past flood flows in mountain rivers can be envisaged in terms of their magnitude and frequency bodoque et al 2015 studies based on be thereby mostly use trees growing in floodplains as floodplain trees present datable evidence of past flooding in their tree ring records sigafoos 1964 in fact several types of be provide hints to past floods díez herrero et al 2013 among these abrasion scars are the most frequently used type of evidence because they are easily detectable on the stem surface of trees in the field abrasion scars are readily datable as the impact of sediment and woody debris transported by the flood will cause growth disturbances in trees which in turn can be detected both macroscopically and microscopically in tree ring series scott et al 1996 copini et al 2016 it is assumed that both the height and location of these scars on stems represent psi of past floods in the following we will use the term psi to refer to scars on trees and will use them to estimate paleoflood flows these estimates are realized by combining the information contained in trees with hydraulic approaches the complexity of the approach used will thereby depend on the quality of available topographic data in cases where topographic data suffers from low spatial representation rather simplified hydraulic approaches will be employed such as the critical depth bodoque et al 2011 or slope area jarrett 1987 methods in cases where available topographic data is accurate and spatially representative flood mapping can be generated by applying 1d primarily step backwater method cook 1987a b or 2d hydraulic models ballesteros cánovas et al 2011 ballesteros et al 2011 but even if be evidently has a high potential for ffa in mountain rivers estimates of paleoflood flows have only occasionally been obtained through the coupling of information contained in psi with hydraulic modelling ballesteros et al 2011 past research also included regional ffa where information available from recent gauging station measurements has been combined with considerably older non systematic data i e information contained in historical biological or geological data england et al 2018 using bayesian markov monte carlo chain algorithms ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 however none of the published work has so far provided sufficient detail to allow ffa based on be to be reproduced at other sites by other teams of researchers this study therefore seeks to develop a protocol for the realization of ffa based on systematic and non systematic be data in such a way that the approach can be applied consistently and uniformly regardless of the physiographic context in other mountain regions to this end we have compiled information on flood flows from 6 mountain rivers in spain poland and india to nourish the protocol in terms of non systematic data the dating of floods was based on dendrochronological analyses of increment cores obtained from scarred tree stems depending on the quality of available topographic information paleoflood flows were estimated either with 2d hydrodynamic models in case of accurate spatially representative smooth and continuous topographic data e g lidar or by applying the step backwater method between cross sections if topographic data was accurate but not spatially continuous besides to characterize uncertainty paleoflood flows were integrated into annual maximum flow series in the form of ranges of values min max and censored data for the ffa we used pearson type iii distributions with a logarithmic transformation of the annual maximum series in a last analytical step we describe the expected moments algorithm ema cohn et al 1997 2001 which allows fitting of the distribution parameters 2 material and methods fig 1 illustrates the proposed protocol by showing its individual steps it has been validated in mountain rivers of spain poland and india representing diverse physiographic characteristics and varying hydrological regimes 2 1 study sites and datasets available the data used in this study are from three different mountain regions the spanish central system the polish tatra mountains and the western indian himalayas fig 2 drainage areas of river reaches under investigation range from 2 5 to 470 km2 whereas maximum elevations range from 1 800 to 6 348 m a s l in all catchments snow plays an important role in the seasonal hydrological balance in all domains hydrological response is influenced considerably by both surface and subsurface runoff due to the presence of leptosol type soils in all cases the hydrological regime of the reaches investigated in this study can be considered as unaffected in terms of human interventions at the two study sites in central spain alberche river and arroyo de los puentes lithology consist primarily of granitoids gneisses or schists whereas geomorphic features is unequivocally dominated by torrential footprints with levees lobes and well defined avulsion channels ballesteros et al 2011 ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b in the polish tatras flood flows were reconstructed at strążyski stream draining the northern slopes of the mountain chain geology consists of granitoid outcrops and metamorphic rocks covered by mesozoic sediments the most characteristic geomorphic features include pleistocene glacial and holocene mass movement forms and deposits with multiple sites with glacier abrasion glacial lakes moraine deposits as well as alluvial or colluvial fans ballesteros cánovas et al 2015c ballesteros cánovas et al 2016 the river reaches under investigation in the western indian himalayas are located in kullu district himachal pradesh in terms of geology the sites are characterized by granitoids gneisses schists shales and quartzites of the kullu formation the beas river flows from n to s through a wide u shaped valley with wide alluvial plains the beas river is fed by several tributaries among these are the sainj and thiertan rivers flowing through narrow valleys with steep hillsides ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 annual runoff coefficients at the study sites range from 0 45 to 0 6 with the lowest values observed in the arroyo de los puentes and strążyski catchments the highest values are calculated for the alberche river and the indian himalayan sites ballesteros et al 2011 ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b c 2016 2017 according to the world map of the köppen geiger climate classification köppen 2019 the spanish study sites can be characterized as mediterranean with humid continental climate with mild summers csb the polish tatras study site can be described as hemiboreal without a dry season but mild summers and cold winters dfb the western indian himalayas study sites are located in several climatic zones namely continental without dry season but hot summers and cold winters dfa subtropical without a dry season but hot summers cfa and tropical dry or savannah with dry winters aw in the alberche river sampled trees included alder alnus glutinosa l gaertn and ash fraxinus angustifolia vahl ballesteros et al 2011 at arroyo de los puentes scots pine pinus sylvestris l were sampled ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b at strążyski stream we used norway spruce picea abies l karst and silver fir abies alba mill ballesteros cánovas et al 2016 in the indian himalayan rivers trees sampled included himalayan white pine pinus wallichiana a b jacks west himalayan alder alnus nitida spach endl gen elm ulmus sp poplar populus sp west hymalayan fir abies pindrow royle ex d don and himalayan cedar cedrus deodara roxb g don ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 for each study site systematic records were of annual maximum flows and peak flows were obtained from official repositories these records were supplemented with paleoflood data from be obtained in previous studies see table 1 detailed topographic data was generated from lidar data and used to reconstruct flood flows with 2d hydrodynamic models in the case that this data did not exist cross sections were surveyed in the field a step backwater method was then applied to transform the height of dated abrasion scars into flood flows 2 2 dating of floods based on tree ring records 2 2 1 field surveys and sampling strategies the selection of trees in the field is based on externally visible damage that has been undoubtedly induced by fluvial process activity fig 3 the different types of flooding evidence here referred to as be occur in the form of abrasion scars exposed roots or tilted stems ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a with abrasion scars on tree stems located in the direction of the flow being the key proxy being used to reconstructing both flood chronologies and maximum flood heights gottesfeld 1996 tree sampling that is aimed at dating flood events is normally based on the extraction of core samples from impacted stems using an increment borer stoffel and corona 2014 or on the extraction of small wedges or partial cross sections within and next to the wounded area with a handsaw each tree selected for analysis is conveniently located with a gps and coded in addition all characteristics of the tree i e species size diameter at breast height dbh social position and its growth environment e g lithology slope distance to the river are characterized díez herrero et al 2007 2 2 2 laboratory analyses tree ring samples are usually mounted on woody supports and allowed to air dry stoffel and bollschweiler 2008 samples are the sanded with increasingly fine sandpaper until tree rings become clearly visible such that the widths of rings can be measured reliably measurements can be done either by scanning the samples at high resolution and the use of a specific image processing software e g coorecorder windendro or by using high precision measurement tables that are coupled to a stereomicroscope and a programme that allows for cross dating and chronology building e g tsapwin stoffel and corona 2014 to distinguish clear flood signals from noise induced by other external processes tree ring based flood reconstruction rely on reference chronologies which are usually built from at least trees per species and for each species that has been sampled for flood reconstructions reference chronologies depict normal growth conditions in undisturbed trees and thus allow comparison with the growth ring records of flood impacted trees and the identification of growth anomalies or be graphical crossdating relies on the skeleton plotting method cropper 1979 by which anomalous growth conditions e g very narrow or wide rings are marked on a scale paper statistical crossdating is based on a combination of graphical and statistical functions available in tsapwin rinn 2003 more explanations on the construction of reference chronologies cross dating or the inclusion of tree ring series with missing or double rings can be found in fritts 1976 cook 1987a b cook et al 1990 or vaganov et al 2006 as soon as tree ring growth series are properly cross dated growth disturbances are analyzed in the trees affected by past floods the focus thereby is on injuries and the adjacent callus tissue allowing the dating of scars schneuwly et al 2009 it is also possible to investigate reaction wood that is formed as a reaction to tree tilting timell 1986 and abrupt changes in tree growth such as intense growth decreases or by contrast growth releases although these tree ring signals are only considered to support the dating of scars stoffel and corona 2014 growth anomalies are then summarized and weighted with a weighting index wit for a particular flood event this wit considers the number and intensity of growth disturbances within each tree ring series but also regarding the percentage of responding trees among all damaged trees that have been sampled fig 4 kogelnig mayer et al 2011 2 3 estimation of peak flows the accuracy peak flow estimates from be will depend on the type of topographic dataset and their resolution in cases where only few cross sections are available one should apply the step backwater method this approach allows calculation of a one dimensional energy balanced water surface profile for both steady and gradually varied flows as a function of discharge channel roughness and channel geometry cook 1987a b webb and jarrett 2002 implementation of this method requires an accurate representation of the geometry of several cross sections and their associated roughness coefficients besides it also needs the selection of river reaches in which the lithological configuration of the channel supports the assumption of invariant geometry over time the spacing between cross sections should correspond approximately to the channel width so that the assumption of gradually varied flow is still fulfilled further the approach assumes a discharge at the lowermost cross section using a trial and error approach the error in terms of differences in height between psi and simulated water surface profiles is calculated for the second lowest third lowest up to the uppermost cross section so that the energy balance can be fulfilled in this way friction losses can be estimated between successive cross sections by using the manning equation in cases where highly resolved continuous topographic datasets with x y and z values are available e g lidar data a two dimensional hydrodynamic model can be used fig 5 for the simulation of free surface flow bladé et al 2014 such models can usually compute turbulent flows in unsteady regimes they can also deal with subcritical and supercritical flows including mobile hydraulic jumps horritt and bates 2002 by solving the 2d saint venant equations bladé et al 2012 in an integrated way by employing explicit schemes of finite volumes on an unstructured mesh these explicit schemes are particularly appropriate for the simulation of hydraulics in mountain rivers where shocks and discontinuities can occur and where flood hydrographs are usually sharp bodoque et al 2015 information on friction can be derived by combining information existing in official land use maps or assessed in situ if not readily available with manning s n roughness coefficient chow 1959 uncertainty in the resulting flood flow estimate thereby presents the result of the initial assumption that the roughness coefficients manning s n follow a uniform probability distribution ballesteros et al 2011 2 4 flood frequency analysis 2 4 1 preliminary data analysis each ffa should start with an initial and exploratory data analysis before in depth analyses can be undertaken helsel and hirsch 2002 these initial procedures typically include the plotting of time series assessment of serial correlations and analysis of monotonic trends with the dual objective of detecting errors in the data as well as verifying that the data meet the assumptions inherent to ffa i e instantaneous peak flows are statistically independent and identically distributed plus the hypothesis of stationarity in the flow time series is fulfilled visual inspection of annual flood series allows detection of trends or occurrence of anomalously high or low flows serial correlation i e a measure of the degree of dependency for data values at varying time lags is tested using a correlogram in which autocorrelation coefficients are plotted against time lags salas 1993 the correlogram is an excellent proxy as it enables checking for randomness in a dataset if the dataset has random values white noise autocorrelations should be close to zero for all time lags if the data is non random the correlogram will show values close to one thereby indicating a deterministic process the ffa approach that is described in the following can only be applied if the assumption of stationarity in the annual flood series is met i e if the time series are free of any trends shifts or periodicity salas 1993 based on the examination of the correlograms one can then determine whether the year to year autocorrelation has an influence on the detection of monotonic trends in annual maximum flood peaks where monotonic trends exist in annual maximum peak flow time series villarini et al 2009 the non parametric mann kendall test is used kendall 1975 mann 1945 on the basis of kendall s tau as a metric of the statistical significance of monotonic relations between peak flows and the year in which they occurred furthermore sen s slope estimator should be employed to determine the significance of trends cunderlik and burn 2003 2 4 2 expected moments algorithm ema with the exception of the arroyo de los puentes study site where annual flood data was estimated only with be time series were obtained from official gauging stations and thereafter complemented with paleoflood data obtained from be for the ffa we employ the u s national flood frequency guidelines published in bulletin 17c england et al 2018 this ffa is based on a pearson type iii distribution with logarithmic transformation of flow data england et al 2003 for the estimation of pearson type iii distribution parameters an expected moments algorithm ema is employed on the basis of a generalized method of moments procedure cohn et al 1997 2001 ema is a comprehensive approach for the moments analysis as it uses skewed data and in addition to using systematic streamflow records for the ffa also allows adding non systematic data to the time series to this end positions are plotted for systematic and non systematic data hirsch and stedinger 1987 to assess how log pearson type iii distribution fits the data further the multiple grubbs beck statistic was used to identify multiple potentially influential low flows pilfs cohn et al 2013 the implementation of the ema is based on the identification and treatment of the information included in both recorded i e systematic and non systematic data sources and unrecorded values for floods defined by be each categorized event accordingly allows the flow time series to be extended in addition for each flow that has not been recorded or in the case of censored data stedinger and cohn 1986 one assumes that such flows would be larger than the perception threshold stedinger and baker 1987 above which a flood would have been recorded confidence intervals for flood quantile estimates can be included as well by providing analytical expressions for the asymptotic variance of the ema flood quantile estimator cohn et al 2001 moments estimation of the log pearson type iii distribution is based on the representation of flow data in intervals i e for a particular year y the flow q is represented as qylower and qyupper for systematic data one assumes that the flow is known accurately such that qylower qyupper qy if the flow is not known precisely which is the case of paleoflood data obtained from be intervals are used two scenarios were considered i a flood is known to have reached a maximum flow but the minimum is unknown i e censored data or ii the value of a flood flow is within a relatively wide range in the case of censored data one only has a conservative estimate of flow values associated with flooding qyupper whereas qylower has to be assumed equal to zero the ema also needs a determination of perception thresholds for the estimation of confidence intervals outside the time window s covered by systematic data these perception thresholds represent the potential range of flows tylower tyupper that are detectable in be in case of flood occurrences here tylower is assumed to be equal to the lowest flow estimated from be whereas tyupper is infinite in the case of systematic data tylower represents the smallest flood flow recorded based on gauge base discharge which is typically zero whereas tyupper is assumed to be infinite in the case of incomplete records perception thresholds were used to fill the gaps in the time series 3 results 3 1 flood quantile estimates based on botanical evidence 3 1 1 adequacy of time series used to perform ffa in the mountain rivers analysed in this study visual evaluation of the time series did not disclose any obvious increasing or decreasing trends in flows over time this qualitative appraisal is confirmed by the non parametric mann kendall test proving that all annual maximum flood time series are stationary over time at the 5 significance level table 2 the correlograms show that all autocorrelation coefficients are contained within the 95 probability limits thus confirming the absence of statistically significant correlation fig 6 therefore one can conclude that the annual flood time series used in this study are completely random white noise 3 1 2 ffa from implementing the ema approach the data available at all study sites with the sole exception of arroyo de los puentes central spain were categorised into systematic data as well as non systematic flow intervals and perception thresholds derived from be fig 7 in the case of arroyo de los puentes 15 paleoflood data derived from be were available table 3 in which the resulting time series lacked temporal continuity the available data in this study site were represented as perception threshold censored data points and intervals among the study sites for which systematic data was available only sainj river gauging station had a length of less than 30 water years i e 21 water years at the other study sites time series ranged from 32 thiertan river to 48 beas river water years at three study sites alberche beas and thiertan rivers the systematic data time series could be extended with 1 peak flood data derived from be whereas in the case of strążyski stream and sainj river the non systematic be data were 3 and 7 peak flood discharges respectively table 3 as a result the systematic time series of flow data were extended between one beas river and 48 years strążyski stream for the thiertan alberche and sainj rivers the extension of the time series was by 6 9 and 12 years respectively perception thresholds were then defined on the basis of the flood reconstructed for which be showed the smallest magnitude we used the lowest value that was available from the flow intervals as a reference in the case of strążyski stream for which systematic record was incomplete the perception threshold obtained in this way was also used to fill the gap in the discontinuous time series the ffa was obtained through a ema using a multiple grubbs beck statistic for the detection of potentially influential low flows pilfs station skew was used as the third moment to estimate parameters of the log pearson type iii distribution so as to allow to put the focus on the at site data accordingly the estimated final moments for arroyo de los puentes without systematic data were 2 024 mean 0 337 standard deviation and 0 197 at site skew table 4 shows the calculated final moments for the ffa analysis if based exclusively on systematic data and the one obtained when considering systematic and non systematic data jointly ffa was performed for two scenarios i gaged records only and ii all available data including paleoflood chronologies from be and perception thresholds the ensuing fitted frequency curves and the estimates of peak flow quantiles in m3 s 1 are shown in tables 5 and 6 as well as in fig 8 results of the ffa reveal that the log pearson type iii model fits well with the bulk of the data and sites under investigation though excluding the alberche river the approach seems to underestimate major floods as a result of the influence of paleoflood data this underestimation is explained by the fact that floods derived from be i e non systematic flow data yield values that are substantially larger than the largest flows existing in the systematic records the implementation of the multiple grubbs beck statistic allowed demonstrating the absence of pilfs at the study sites ffa results for the arroyo de los puentes are characterized by high uncertainty such that the set of 500 year quantile estimates range from 532 5 lower confidence limit and 8 930 m3 s 1 95 upper confidence limit for the 5 year quantile estimate the uncertainty band is between 123 5 lower confidence limit and 406 m3 s 1 95 upper confidence limit at the other study sites the extension of gaged time series with non systematic records yielded higher estimates for longer return period quantiles than those obtained with systematic data alone the largest differences are observed for the beas river where the 100 year quantile estimate increased by 387 from 500 to 2 437 m3 s 1 and the 500 year quantile estimate increased by 1 275 or from 678 to 9 325 m3 s 1 at the other indian sites differences were important as well but still more moderate in the case of the thiertan river the 100 and 500 year quantile estimates increased by 111 and 214 respectively whereas for sainj river the 100 and 500 year quantile estimates increased by 86 and 145 by contrast only minor increases were found for the strążyski stream and alberche river where the 100 year flood increased by 33 and 37 respectively and the 500 year flood was 52 larger at both sites than in the estimates based on systematic data alone the other significant benefit of incorporating all available data defined in scenario ii into the ffa is their impact on confidence intervals at all sites the inclusion of non systematic data into analyses has increased the 95 confidence intervals for the low probability quantile estimates 100 and 500 yr recurrence intervals as compared to a consideration of gaged records alone in the case of the alberche river the enlargement of the uncertainty band is not very significant representing 3 and 9 for the 500 and 100 year floods respectively similar results are found for the strążyski stream with zero variation in the uncertainty bandwidth for the 100 year flood but a 21 increase in the uncertainty bandwidth for the 500 year flood in the case of the three indian rivers the increase in the uncertainty bandwidth is much larger for the beas river the result of integrating both systematic and non systematic information into the ffa results in a change of the 500 year flood uncertainty bandwidth by 2 orders of magnitude as compared to the inclusion of systematic data alone for the thiertan and sainj rivers uncertainty bandwidths increase as well after the integration of all available information but the change is significantly smaller than at beas river with roughly 300 and 500 changes for uncertainty bandwidths of the 100 and 500 year floods respectively 4 discussion 4 1 goodness of be to be incorporated into ffa 4 1 1 obtaining flood chronologies the protocol presented in this study aimed at illustrating that the inclusion of flood information contained in be can play a very important role in the extension of systematic flow time series but also for the estimation of flow quantiles in cases where systematic data does not exist at all arroyo de los puentes tree ring based flood records also have several advantages over sediment based paleoflood studies as approaches based on be allow the dating of floods with annual accuracy thereby facilitating integration into systematic flood records ballesteros cánovas et al 2015a moreover and in the case of mountain rivers characterized by the occurrence of high energy floods paleostage indicators in the form of geomorphic evidence left in the field are not frequently conserved or regularly overprinted by subsequent events stoffel 2010 by contrast be often occurs in abundant numbers and across reaches such that the information that can be gathered from trees becomes spatially representative despite the rather vast potential that dendrogeomorphology has in boosting the reliability of ffa by far the largest number of studies published hitherto has been limited to the dating of flood evidence contained in trees sigafoos 1964 gottesfeld and johnson gottesfeld 1990 yanoski and jarrett 2002 zielonka et al 2008 ballesteros et al 2010a b rodriguez morata et al 2016 ruiz villanueva et al 2010 šilhán 2015 šilhán et al 2018 more recently however research has started to include estimates of flood magnitudes using botanical psi either by estimating flood flows with the help of simple equations webb and jarrett 2002 or by implementing complex 2d hydrodynamic models ballesteros cánovas et al 2011 ballesteros et al 2011 only few studies have hitherto added flood flows estimates from be to systematic data so as to perform regional ffa ballesteros cánovas et al 2017 several shortcomings remain when employing be in ffa the main limitation is related to the length of the time series that can be reconstructed from tree ring analysis in most riparian environments trees growing next to rivers are rather short lived either because of frequent removal by floods or as a result of the genetic make up and the limited lifespan of riparian species as compared to many other tree species growing on other geomorphic features such as debris flow cones or rockfall slopes where conifers can grow for centuries stoffel et al 2005 by contrast flood chronologies are often limited to the last few decades ballesteros et al 2010a b or in rather exceptional cases to a few centuries ballesteros cánovas et al 2015b extreme floods can destroy the forest cover especially near the channel or in sectors affected by avulsion ruiz villanueva et al 2016 destructive floods clearly affect the potential number and age of trees that are available for dendrogeomorphic studies bodoque et al 2015 in addition and due to their restriction to the riparian zone it is sometimes difficult to find undisturbed trees for the construction of reference chronologies of those species for which impacted trees with be have been sampled for analysis kames et al 2016 in addition and despite the fact that multiple papers have been published on flood series derived from tree ring records our knowledge about the response of tree species to floods remains incomplete in terms of wood anatomical responses ballesteros et al 2010b ballesteros cánovas et al 2015d or intra annual dating of scars in broadleaved trees e g arbellay et al 2010 stoffel et al 2019 thus and even if numerous studies have used tree ring response induced by flooding a purely mechanistic or plant physiological investigation of the impacts of floods on trees is yet to be realized 4 1 2 estimating flood flows from psi paleodischarges estimated from be can obviously suffer from uncertainties and errors one typical source of error is in the hydrodynamic behaviour inherent to the interference between the flood flow and trees during a flood trees often form an obstruction to the flow and thereby influence drag forces and turbulence which in turn result in energy losses and subsequent variations in the water level therefore and in situations in which the flow is subcritical the water surface upstream of a tree will increase whereas around of the trunk a local decrease in the water surface will form conversely in the case of supercritical flow a tree will cause an increase in the water surface downstream of the tree and a local increase in water surface around the trunk bodoque et al 2015 in this contribution approaches that can be used to estimate flood flows with be were divided with respect to the detail and quality of topographic datasets that are available for analysis the step backwater method shall be applied if analysis has to done with topographic data from only a few cross sections by contrast and at sites for which accurate digital elevation models exist 2d hydrodynamic models can be employed for the estimation of flood flows both approaches are very valuable tools and can assist the improvement of ffa in areas where series do not exist or where existing gage records or short or incomplete when using either of the approaches a certain number of limitations need to be kept in mind however as they can prevent proper analysis and or limit the validity of results as such the step backwater method is not necessarily accurate in high gradient streams as the pressure in the vertical direction may cease completely to become hydrostatic and as a result one of the principles on which the method is based may not be fulfilled bodoque et al 2011 in addition the method may be unreliable in cases where changes in the hydraulic regime occur as the approach does not consider the length of hydraulic jumps besides if flow velocity is in the order of 6 8 m s the method seems unable to reproduce the flow behaviour realistically as the flow will become unstable as a result of the very high froude and verdenikov numbers venutelli 2011 with such high flow velocities surface waves will generate especially if in addition to high velocities changes in cross sections and flow direction occur which the method does not reproduce properly in view of these limitations the critical depth method bodoque et al 2011 may offer greater reliability and precision however this approach is often not feasible as it requires both the existence of psi and local drops or narrow constrictions in channel geometry as well as an assumed subcritical regime upstream of the study reach i e conditions that are not always met the 2d hydrodynamic models are often affected by unconformities or just by a lack of uniformity in the algorithms that are used to solve the hydraulic equations as a rule of thumb and when it comes to support convergence between the model and the psi obtained from be the continuity equation usually represents the core component to be considered whereas the moment equation is often less relevant in addition one has to remember that 2d hydrodynamic models often neglect localised energy losses either as a result of flow contraction expansion or due to roughness neglecting these energy losses can lead to significant errors in estimates because flow velocity is usually high in mountain rivers and thus the energy losses are significant bodoque et al 2015 additionally when using 1 d or 2d hydrodynamic models changes in bed channel topography because of large sediment ladden floods can affect the reliability of peak discharges reconstruction ideally bed rock channels are targeted to assure the depth and width stability of the channel ballesteros cánovas et al 2011 bed rock channels present moreover a high transport capacity and limited deposition baker 1977 palucis and lamb 2017 which making hydraulic modelling easier other channel configurations such cascades plain bed or step pool could be also suitable as show lower spatial exchange rates in comparison with pool riffles or braided reach channels bisson et al 2017 yet when reconstructing the flood magnitude in these reach typologies geomorphic investigations on the stability of the channels are highly recommended in the case of colluvial channels the high connectivity to hillslope processes imply that the use of be for flood discharge should be considered with caution bodoque et al 2015 since the sediment transport could be highly affected by slope processes 4 2 integration of be in the ema approach the ffa illustrated in this study have been elaborated with the us national flood frequency guidelines bulletin 17c england et al 2018 using an approach that includes the application of an ema approach cohn et al 1997 2001 bulletin 17c also considers the integration of flood flows obtained with be in ffa or any other source of information on paleofloods such flows are characterized by a significantly higher uncertainty than those obtained from systematic series which due to their greater precision are represented as point values england et al 2018 paleoflood data derived from be are integrated in the flow time series as intervals censored data and perception thresholds stedinger and cohn 1986 stedinger and baker 1987 bulletin 17c also pays special attention to the identification of potentially influential low flows pilfs cohn et al 2013 so as to include low outliers and small observations with high leverage that might exert large influence on extreme quantile estimates the occurrence of pilfs is typical in rivers and streams found in arid and semi arid environments where very small flow values are common lamontagne et al 2016 as these climatic conditions were not met at any of the sites investigated in this study here we could not detect pilfs in flow series that could have had an impact on ffa in catchments where pilfs exist in the time series they can generate mathematical inconsistencies because zero value floods will define a logarithm of infinity whereas the logarithm of small flow values may define anomalous values as well moreover the presence of low flow values in the time series can have a substantial impact both on the adjustment of flood frequency distributions and flow quantiles of low and very low frequency floods the adjustment of the log pearson type iii distribution with an ema approach required estimation of the skew coefficient i e a metric defining the shape of the adjusted frequency distribution griffis and stedinger 2009 as this coefficient is one of the sample moments that are needed for the parameter estimation of such a distribution in the case of floods streamflow time series are used as a proxy to estimate skew provided that the existing time series was longer than 30 years stedinger et al 1993 with the exception of arroyo de los puentes 15 water years and sainj river 28 water years including systematic and non systematic data all sites analysed fulfilled this condition nonetheless and due to the high sensitivity of ffa to skew especially in cases where one is dealing with flow quantiles corresponding to low and very low frequency events it can be advisable to rely on regional skew data than on the values obtained for individual streams cohn et al 2001 the use of regional skew data is intended to render ffa more consistent even more so if a weighted skew coefficient is employed where both at site and regional data are considered griffis and stedinger 2007 last not least and as stated before flood chronologies that can be reconstructed from be are often limited to several decades and in some cases to the past few centuries their length nonetheless and in many instances allows considerable extension of systematic flow time series that are often very short i e ca 30 years or even less in mountain rivers accordingly flood flow information obtained from be can assist in achieving greater robustness in the estimation of flood quantiles especially also of the 100 year flood which is of paramount importance in flood risk management bubeck et al 2017 on the other hand uncertainties in flood quantile estimates for rare events with 500 year return periods or more remains difficult even with the addition of paleorecords from be 5 conclusions in this study ffa analyses have been realized at six study sites located in very different geographical regions with the aim to illustrate the various steps involved in ffa based on be and to showcase its benefits but also to pinpoint to possible caveats and remaining challenges the approach presented here is based on the combined use of systematic flow information with non systematic data obtained from be with the latter often providing information over timespans that exceed those of systematic measurements by decades and sometimes even by a few centuries we show that the inclusion of be has a high potential in ffa as it allows improving the characterization of the distribution timing and controls e g snowmelt soil moisture of past floods as a result of their fairly widespread occurrence in riparian environments trees with be not only occur in high numbers within a given reach thus allowing high spatial resolution but they also offer high temporal resolution enabling the dating of past floods with at least annual if not seasonal precision in addition be is usually the only non systematic data source that can be used in mountain streams to extend time series of systematic data or even the only existing source of information to estimate flood quantiles in the absence of systematic measurements as in the case of arroyo de los puentes in this study the ffa was based on the implementation of an ema approach that is based on the generalization of the method of moments which allows using different types of at site flood data i e systematic as well as non systematic data information on past flood flows can be accommodated as interval censored or binomial censored data and is treated in a single uniform and consistent analysis framework noteworthy the approach presented here does not require the use of algorithms other than ema to incorporate non systematic data during the adjustment of the flood frequency curve as a result no arbitrary adjustments need to be included in order to embed paleoflood data as a consequence the methodological proposal deployed here is thought to help improve the reliability of flood risk assessment and flood risk management significantly in particular in mountain streams where systematic data is not statistically significant in many instances or where such data does not exist at all and the only means of non systematic data has to be retrieved from be credit authorship contribution statement j m bodoque conceptualization methodology formal analysis
