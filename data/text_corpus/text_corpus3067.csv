15335,the recent discovery of comammox nitrospira performing complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate has overturned the long held dogma of two step nitrification on earth yet little is known about the effect of urbanization interference on their distribution using gene centric metagenomics we provided the first blueprints about comammox community biogeography and environmental drivers along a high elevation 2000 m river flowing through the largest city on the vulnerable qinghai tibetan plateau our study confirmed a wide presence and diversity of yet uncultured comammox clade b across wet and dry seasons with average 3 0 and 2 0 times as abundant as clade a amoa genes in water and sediments respectively species identified from freshwater and drinking water treatment plants dominated the comammox guilds 58 100 suggesting this plateau river shared a similar comammox assemblage with the above habitat types compared with the urban area harboring more abundant canonical nitrospira identified in wastewater average 24 the upstream suburban reach had a smaller human population but larger proportions of comammox in ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes 24 72 of abundances and nitrospira sublineages i ii higher contents of nitrate and nitrite in water and antibiotics in water and sediments may restrain comammox niches in nitrifiers over the urban area further random forest analysis revealed that lincosamides and quinolones were the most important antibiotic predictors for the niche differentiations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water while macrolides for those in sediments finally by incubation experiments we demonstrated higher activity contributions of benthic comammox in the suburban area 36 2 92 8 of potential ammonia oxidation rates than in the urban reach and that the contribution variation had significant negative relations with macrolides and their major components overall this study highlighted that anthropogenic activities hampered the advantage of riverine complete nitrifiers over the canonical two step ones keywords gene centric metagenomics complete nitrifier comammox biogeographic pattern urbanization antibiotics qinghai tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification the microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrate is a central process in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycling gruber and galloway 2008 since the end of 1800s nitrification was perceived as a two step reaction mediated by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing microorganisms separately santoro 2016 however the recent discovery of comammox bacteria who can completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate within their cells has overturned this 110 year old classical tenet of two step nitrification and been regarded as a milestone daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2016 based on phylogenies of concatenated conserved genes all the known comammox bacteria belong to nitrospira sublineage ii palomo et al 2019 s liu et al 2020 sakoula et al 2021 which was formerly thought as the most widely distributed clade of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2015 compared with strict nob comammox nitrospira possess a full series of ammonia monooxygenases amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenases hao that are phylogenetically divergent from those of canonical ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 comammox organisms can be divided into clades a and b based on the phylogenies of amo operons daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and these genes have become the ideal biomarkers for comammox identification and quantification metagenomics or amplicon sequencing based surveys have confirmed that comammox nitrospira as the third category of aerobic ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes aops are widely existed on earth they contribute great abundances to nitrifier guilds in a variety of natural systems including surface freshwater palomo et al 2019 s liu et al 2020 groundwater palomo et al 2019 soils hu and he 2017 palomo et al 2019 sediments zhao et al 2019 s liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and mudflats x wang et al 2021 many kinds of engineering facilities like rapid sand filters palomo et al 2016 fowler et al 2018 hu et al 2020 poghosyan et al 2020 drinking water systems wang et al 2017 x zhou et al 2021 and wastewater treatment systems daims et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 cotto et al 2020 x zhou et al 2021 also possess abundant comammox nitrospira outnumbering aoa or canonical nitrospira it should be noted that higher activity of comammox bacteria than those of either aoa or aob has been demonstrated in some soils and wetlands wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 besides the importance of comammox different environmental characters can lead to significant niche differentiations between comammox clades a and b or even among several subclades within a s liu et al 2020 this suggests a high diversity and complexity of comammox which requires a deeper level e g strain level profile with an increasing number of comammox genomes the preference analysis on basis of their habitat types is also possible but rarely performed such analysis may serve to quantify environmental attributes of ecological patches palomo et al 2022 and unveil the compositional pattern of comammox community the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp is well known as the world s third pole with high elevation low atmospheric pressure cold temperature strong solar radiation etc it is one of the most ecologically vulnerable areas and sensitive to climate changes and human activities xu et al 2022 the qtp typically functions as the asian water tower rivers originating from the qtp are the pipelines of this tower and of primary significance to circumjacent water cycling material transport as well as civilization formation it is noted that excessive urbanization together with rapid developments of agriculture and industry during the past years has brought more inorganic or organic pollutants into rivers on the qtp wu et al 2016a wu et al 2016b kuang et al 2020 dong et al 2021 xu et al 2022 such anthropogenic disturbance can alter riverine microbial communities wang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 and further pose threats to the fragile plateau ecology as the critical participants in global carbon and nitrogen cycling comammox bacteria have been confirmed with a broad existence in the qtp rivers like the yangtze and yellow source lancang nu and yarlung zangbo rivers s liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 but few measured their potential activities additionally due to that the sampling areas of the above studies are far from densely inhabited districts the sensitivity of comammox bacteria versus canonical nitrifiers to anthropogenic activity e g urbanization remains unknown along the qtp rivers this should be an indispensable part for biogeography studies focusing on spatiotemporal variations and the underlying factors planktonic and benthic microbes in plateau aquatic systems can be shaped by different environmental variables zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 under an integrated viewpoint it is necessary to contrast the major drivers of comammox variations in water and sediments along a qtp river subject to intense human activities to address the above issue we implemented a synchronous sampling campaign along the largest tributary of the upper yellow river the huangshui river it flows through xining the biggest city on the qtp and the capital of qinghai province with a population 2 000 000 we collected a total of 58 water and surface sediment samples during wet and dry seasons based on metagenomic shotgun sequencing physicochemical measurements and incubating experiments we aimed to a explore clade and strain level abundance profiles of comammox bacteria and their abundance activity importance in nitrifier guilds over this plateau river b investigate the influence of urbanization level on comammox niches in riverine nitrifiers and the main environmental pollutants driving such variations in water and sediments overall this study is of great help to comprehensively understand comammox ecological pattern under anthropogenic disturbance and develop an optimum nitrogen management strategy along a high altitude river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and physicochemical factor measurements the huangshui river is the first degree tributary of the yellow river and rises in haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture of qinghai province the total length of the

qinghai s mother river the huangshui river raises more than 60 of the population and harbors dense agricultural and industrial activities along its path dong et al 2021 with the development of xining urban agglomeration the ecological environment of the huangshui river watershed has been threatened dong et al 2021 for this study 17 representative monitoring sites were established along the huangshui river mainstream sites m1 m10 and four main tributaries sites t1 t7 fig s1 table s1 the longitude and latitude were recorded by a handheld gps magellan usa then the altitude was generated based on the coordinates using arcgis software all the sites are distributed in the plateau region with the elevations varying from 2158 to 2629 m these sites can be divided into urban and suburban area ones based on the geographic distance to xining city center and land use kuang et al 2020 six large domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps are around the urban sites in july wet season 2018

queried against the ncbi non redundant nr database using blastp for double check the amoa and amob instead of amo subunit c were used because they can exhibit stable and consistent phylogenetic clustering for easy identification daims et al 2015 cotto et al 2020 to ensure accuracy orfs with a sequence length 150 amino acids aa were excluded from the following phylogenetic analysis the

phylosift darling et al 2014 based on the parameter described previously s liu et al 2020 to lower the complexity and bias minor adjustments were conducted through removing a genome at a time until comammox clades a and b and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii and iv formed divergent clusters lastly 53 representative genomes recovering from freshwater drinking water treatment plant dwtp soils groundwater wastewater and ocean see the classification standard in palomo et al 2019 in nine countries of asia europe and america were retained to form the reference pool and the key nitrification related genes were identified table s3 the average nucleotide identity ani among pairwise whole genomes and emgs were calculated using orthoani lee et al 2016 bbmap https sourceforge net projects bbmap was applied to map the clean reads of each sample to the emgs with an identity cutoff of 90 the hit number was normalized by total length of emgs and sequencing depth s liu et al 2020 the community and strain level abundances were expressed as the hit number per 20 000 bp emgs per 2 5 108 clean reads to gain the relative abundance of the whole comammox community in each shotgun metagenome bbmap was used to map the clean reads of each sample to the 53 genomes with a minimum identity of 95 the abundance was expressed as the percentage of clean reads hitting all the comammox

rubber stopper and aluminum cap three treatments were executed for each sample as follows treatment i 1 5 ml of ddh2o was added into each serum bottle as a control group treatment ii 1 5 ml of 0 13 m kclo3 was added into the bottles to inhibit the nitrite oxidation group and comammox bacteria treatment iii 1 5 ml of 0 13 m kclo3 and 2 kpa of 1 octyne were added into the bottles to inhibit the nitrite oxidation group comammox bacteria and aob not influence aoa all the mixtures were stirred for blending and incubated in the dark at the in situ temperatures average 19 2 and 10 8 c in the wet and dry seasons respectively for each treatment no3 n and no2 n were fully extracted by 2 m kcl on days 0 1 2 and 4 after the beginning of incubation and the contents were measured via an aj 3700 gas phase molecular absorption spectrometer shanghai anjie zhichuang co china the toxicity of no2 n accumulation on microorganisms was ignored in this study detailed principles and calculation methods can be found in wang et al 2020 and yuan et al 2021 2 6 statistical analysis all the statistical analyses were performed using r language https www r project org and originpro2020 https www originlab com

diversity of comammox nitrospira to illustrate comammox presence and diversity along the huangshui river on the qtp their amo orfs were firstly assembled from the in situ metagenomic datasets a sum of 121 comammox amoa and amob orfs 150 aa were acquired from 14 water and 16 sediment samples through the kegg nr annotation and phylogenetic analysis fig 1 for comammox amoa 17 and 8 assembled orfs were affiliated with clades a and b separately fig 1a 14 amoa orfs in clade a had close relationships with the amoa of comammox nitrospira sp cg24b recovering from a denmark dwtp palomo et al 2018 and 6 clade b amoa orfs were closely related to the genes of lm bin98 thk bin2 or cg24a recovering from dwtp and freshwater ecosystems palomo et al 2018 palomo et al 2019 fig s2a table s3 for comammox amob 31 and 65 assembled orfs fell into clades a and b respectively fig 1b 27 and 4 amob orfs in clade a were separately close to the amob of cg24b and ga0074138 pinto et al 2016 identified from dwtps fig s2b table s3 24 and 12 amob orfs in clade b formed clusters with the counterpart genes of thk bin2 cg24a and lm bin98 respectively and another 20 amob orfs clustered with the genes of lppl bin249 freshwater palomo et al 2018 gww3 groundwater palomo et al 2019 and rcb soil poghosyan et al 2019 particularly five contigs i e m1 sw 1860061 m2 sd 1732020 m3 sw 1644348 m7 sw 3220719 and t2 sd 262687 owned both comammox amoa and amob orfs overall 23 and 98 comammox amoa b orfs were separately assembled in water and sediments at 11 sites out of 17 from the upper to the lower reach and clade b orfs outnumbered those of clade a at 10 sites fig 1c these observations confirmed a wide existence and diversity of comammox nitrospira especially the yet uncultured clade b to date zhu et al 2022 over this plateau river 3 2 comammox community structure and biogeographic pattern besides the qualitative analysis using the assembled data we employed the unassembled data for quantitative comparisons ju and zhang 2015 two categories of marker genes i e amoa and emgs were used to recruit comammox and canonical nitrifier like reads from each metagenomic dataset for comparisons of their abundances and biogeography fig s3 displayed that numbers of comammox like reads recruited by the amoa and emgs were significantly and positively correlated in water pearson s adjusted r 2 0 937 p 0 0001 and sediments pearson s adjusted r 2 0 988 p 0 0001 which was consistent with those obtained from the yangtze river s liu et al 2020 4838 comammox like amoa reads were detected in 57 out of 58 water and sediment samples during both seasons and clade b amoa reads outnumbered those of clade a at 74 1 of samples water 72 4 sediment 75 9 fig 2 a b fig s3 we also acquired a total of 76 838 comammox like emg reads and clade b reads outnumbered those of clade a in all the samples fig 2c d fig s3 these results demonstrated that clade b was the dominant comammox type across both temporal and spatial dimensions in this high elevation river the long emg sequences recruited more reads than the amoa genes which helped to fully compare the abundance between clades a and b when comammox belong to the rare biosphere for their abundance importance in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing guilds planktonic comammox constituted up to 24 9 13 0 mean standard deviation of aops clade a 6 2 5 4 clade b 18 7 11 7

sublineages i ii clade a 17 6 8 1 clade b 38 6 21 1 fig 2a d the abundance contributions of overall comammox to nitrifier communities showed no significant differences between water and sediments or two seasons however planktonic and benthic comammox clade a had significantly higher contributions in the wet season e g amoa 8 9 6 2 in water and 12 8 9 1 in sediments than in the dry season amoa 4 2 3 7 in water and 5 8 5 1 in sediments p 0 05 fig s4 suggesting a seasonal sensitivity of clade a instead of clade b intriguingly the spatial variance of urbanization level determined the niche differentiations between comammox community and canonical nitrifiers along this plateau river compared with the downstream urban reach the upstream suburban one possessed significantly higher comammox abundance contributions in overall water 27 3 56 3 of aops 70 2 84 1 of nitrospira sublineages i ii and sediments 24 6 71 6 of aops 68 7 87 6 of nitrospira sublineages i ii p 0 001 and similar results were obtained during two separate seasons p 0 05 fig 2e f contrasting the average abundance percentages of comammox bacteria in nitrifying guilds between the suburban and urban areas we found greater

subsequently investigated based on the emg hits under a species level cutoff of 95 genome wide ani richter and rosselló móra 2009 the 53 nitrospira reference bins constituted 19 comammox clade a 13 comammox clade b and 10 canonical nitrospira species fig s6 the results showed that the overall shannon wiener index of clade b water 1 86 0 26 sediment 1 87 0 17 was significantly higher than that of

b orfs closely related to the above species were also assembled fig 1 fig s2 this implied generally uniform results obtained by both read and orf based methods and that the emgs are also the ideal biomarkers to identify the majority of comammox species the distance decay effects of comammox were mostly insignificant p 0 05 except that in sediments of the dry season mantel spearman s r 0 31 or 0 33 p 0 05 fig s7 indicating that their community compositions were not quite varied spatially this was possibly due to that 94 8 of the samples were predominated by the above seven species occupying a mean of 80 4 of comammox abundance with less compositional variations we further summarized the abundance profile according to the ecosystem categories that nitrospira bins were firstly identified from fig 3a b and found that the freshwater and dwtp sourced groups prevailed in planktonic and benthic comammox communities during both seasons 58 100 for each sample with average 73 84 followed by those recovering from soils average 8 17 groundwater average 5 9 and wastewater average 1 2 1 8 the dwtp group was more abundant in sediments than in water the urban reach possessed significantly higher abundance percentages of the wastewater sourced canonical nitrospira species than the suburban area in water of the wet season p 0 01 and sediments of both seasons p 0 05 fig 3a c although comammox bacteria made up for 0 8 of the overall microbes in each sample water 0 07 0 04 sediment 0 19 0 17 fig s8 the spatial difference of urbanization level influenced nitrification by determining the niche separations between such minor group and canonical aops or nitrospira over this plateau river 3 3 environmental drivers for comammox abundance importance we investigated how the microscopic environmental factors determined the abundance variations of comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water and sediments over this plateau urban river correlation type analysis is a reliable tool to characterize the importance of environmental factors zhou and ning 2017 we found that whether in the wet season dry season or all the samples the percentage of planktonic comammox bacteria in aops and abundance ratio of planktonic comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii had significantly negative correlations with antibiotic and nitrogen concentrations instead of toc tp temperature do and ph fig 4 a table s6 specifically comparing the correlation coefficients lms spearman s r 0 65 0 81 p 0 01 and qns r 0 62 0 75 p 0 05 had more pronounced negative correlations with the above percentage and abundance ratio than any other antibiotic types like sas mls tcs β ls and pes during two separate seasons and across all the samples both were also the most important factors in the dry season no3 n tn and no2 n were more negatively correlated with the above percentage and abundance ratio in the wet season r 0 83 0 97 p 0 01 than in the dry season r 0 35 0 60 p 0 05 except tn and the most critical factors in the wet season the percentage of planktonic comammox clade b in aops had more evidently negative correlations with no3 n tn and no2 n r 0 64 0 79 p 0 01 than with other factors in the wet season while in the dry season lms qns and sas were the most important factors r 0 72 0 82 p 0 01 fig s9a table s7 for sediments whether in the wet season dry season or all the samples the percentage of comammox in aops and abundance ratio of comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii were only significantly and negatively related to antibiotics instead of nutrients and ph fig 4b table s6 mls or lms were the most crucial variables with more pronounced effects in the dry season r 0 73 0 84 p 0 01 mls or 0 05 lms than in the wet season r 0 36 0 69 p 0 05 except lms similar negative correlations were also obtained between the proportion of benthic comammox clade b in aops and mls or lms fig s9a table s7 the percentages of comammox clade a in aops were significantly and negatively correlated with very different factors between water e g no2 n and tn and sediments e g mls and sas fig s9b table s7 compared to the suburban area the urban area harbored average 1 5 23 5 fold higher contents of lms 1 1 36 3 ng l qns 1 1 37 4 ng l sas 12 2 1024 6 ng l no3 n 1 8 5 5 mg l tn 1 9 6 5 mg l and no2 n 0 3 2 9 mg l in water and mls 0 7 7 1 ng g in sediments across all the samples and during two separate seasons p 0 05 fig s10 and s11 suggesting that the effect of macroscopic urbanization level on riverine comammox biogeography was ascribed to the spatial differences of antibiotic and nitrogen compounds partially the concentrations of total antibiotics and the major antibiotic types in water and sediments were significantly higher in the urban sites than in the suburban ones which highlighted that the two areas differed a lot in anthropogenic activities random forest a machine learning algorithm was used to reveal the major predictors for the percentage of comammox bacteria in aops and abundance ratio of comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii antibiotic or nitrogen contents instead of other factors were the significant p 0 05 predictors in water and sediments of both seasons fig 5 which was generally in line with the correlation analysis for planktonic guilds lms and qns were the best antibiotics to predict the variations of the above percentage except in the wet season and abundance ratio both were better predictors in the dry season amoa 11 8 emgs 15 1 than in the wet season amoa 2 9 emgs 7 8 no3 n tn and no2 n were the best predictors in the wet season amoa 17 5 emgs 13 4 for benthic communities mls were the best predictor for the above percentage and abundance ratio across all the samples and during two respective seasons mls and lms were better predictors in the dry season amoa 20 1 emgs 19 9 than in the wet season amoa 7 9 emgs 5 3 we subsequently explored the relations between antibiotic available

potential comammox activity and the related contribution we finally determined the potential rates of comammox aoa and aob in 29 sediment samples fig 7 a and s12 the potential comammox rates varied

spearman s r 0 39 0 77 p 0 05 fig 7b this suggested analogous antibiotic drivers for the abundance and activity importance of benthic comammox in riverine nitrification 4 discussion based on gene centric metagenomics we developed a high resolution workflow to obtain the first integrated abundance profiles of planktonic and benthic comammox along a qtp river as well as their biogeographic patterns subject to anthropogenic factors significant and positive correlations were observed between the number of clean reads recruited by the comammox amoa and emgs we suggested that the amoa may share the similar characteristics with the emgs i e nearly ubiquitous conservative and present in single copy darling et al 2014 on comammox genomes of this river although we failed to reconstruct the comammox genomes due to the low clean read coverages fig s8 the identified dominant clade a and b reference bins fig 1 and 3a actually possess only one copy amoa meanwhile the amoa genes are not phylogenetically divergent from their close relatives palomo et al 2019 s liu et al 2020 palomo et al 2022 our study demonstrated a broad existence and diversity of clade b comammox across both temporal and spatial dimensions with larger abundances than clade a in water and sediments by analyzing amoa sequences from various systems zhu et al 2022 suggested that clade b is less widely distributed diverse and abundant than clade a and can be restricted to specific niches we summarized nearly all the articles reporting the advantage of clade b over clade a table 1 only rivers soils and rapid sand filters from dwtps possessed more abundant or active clade b which generally corresponded to the sourced ecosystems of clade b genomes table s3 four studies indicated that clade b in many qtp rivers could better adapt to the high elevations 2158 4535 m with relatively low temperature average 9 2 15 3 c and intense light irradiation e g uv http www geodata cn the non plateau river reaches had more abundant clade a than b s liu et al 2020 in this study higher abundance contributions of clade a were found in the wet season water temperature 19 2 1 8 c fig s10 than in the dry season 10 8 2 1 c these findings suggested that the two clades might differ in adaptabilities to natural fluctuations nitrospira genomes actually encode genes related to cold or heat shock liu et al 2021 and uv light induced stress response podowski et al 2022 however little is known about the functional differences between clades a and b another eight studies showed that clade b in soils or rapid sand filters preferred low nh3 n and cold habitats singleton 2018 also found more abundant clade b comammox in permafrost with scarce nitrogen the ammonia transporters encoded by clade b instead of a were previously found in aoa belonging to a large group of proteins referred to as methyl ammonia permeases mep offre et al 2014 the mep type transporter with a higher affinity for ammonia palomo et al 2018 can confer an advantage to survive in the nitrogen limited environment in general we proposed that clade b might outcompete clade a in cold oligotrophic and sun intense environments possibly with a slow growth rate giovannoni and stingl 2007 bakermans et al 2014 more experiments are needed to validate the physiological features despite such microbes are hard to cultivate the freshwater and dwtp identified species e g lm bin98 thk bin2 cg24a cg24c cg24b and ga0074138 dominated the comammox communities in water and sediments across two seasons tens of amo orfs closely related to them were also assembled this implied an analogous comammox assemblage between this high altitude river and other freshwater or dwtp systems the insignificant distance decay patterns of comammox bacteria might indicate similar niches shared by the dominant species here although these species were originally found in usa denmark or china heilongjiang table s3 we suggested that they have colonized here and evolved for a long time considering their high abundances broadly comammox from dwtps flourished in biofilter communities displaying preferences for surface attached growth koch et al 2019 which might be one reason for more abundant dwtp species found in sediments with easier formation of immobilized biofilms than in water palomo et al 2022 indicated that comammox genome evolutions are more affected by habitat types than by species identity highlighting the environmental dependency of evolutionary processes this could provide a theoretical basis that the major comammox taxa were shared by rivers freshwater and dwtps that harbor the similar growth media dynamic condition or nutrient level several canonical nitrospira taxa like aau mbr2 olb3 uw 2 cg24d and spc bin27 were also abundant and firstly discovered in wastewater in usa denmark netherlands or soil in china zhejiang fig 3a table s3 all the results hinted a metabolic versatility of nitrifying bacteria to acclimatize rapidly and strong dispersal capability to colonize widely as indicated by wilson et al 1997 planktonic and benthic comammox contributed higher abundances to nitrifier guilds in the upriver suburban area which is far from xining city center having a lower population intensity and urbanization rate kuang et al 2020 dong et al 2021 similarly larger proportions of comammox in aops or nob were observed in the upstream regions of the yangtze and tama urban rivers with less anthropogenic activities s liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 we thus hypothesized that the human related factors influenced the advantage of riverine comammox over canonical nitrifiers for this plateau river on one hand the urban reach received more nutrients and refractory organics from domestic or industrial wwtps than the rural one kuang et al 2020 dong et al 2021 which was not beneficial for comammox with an oligotrophic lifestyle hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 sakoula et al 2021 particularly the freshwater and dwtp groups on the other it is not surprising to observe more abundant canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii especially the wastewater sourced taxa in the urban reach as they are usually the key members in wwtps daims et al 2016 the thriving aob taxa like nitrosomonas ureae and oligotropha in the urban reach could also feed nob with nitrite from ammonia oxidation daims et al 2016 both of them have been found abundant in wwtps even in the case of low temperature zhang et al 2011 rodriguez caballero et al 2012 they were likely to become more abundant in the urban water and sediments of the plateau river severely subject to the effluents of wwtps besides the wastewater identified comammox were not detected vastly fig 3a on account of all the above the riverine comammox niches along the urban reach would be restrained by their potential competitors with a less n2o emission than that of aob comammox bacteria are thought as an environmentally friendly group kits et al 2019 considering the higher relative and absolute abundances of benthic comammox in the suburban reach fig 2b and s5 the nitrification dependent n2o emission amount from sediments might be lower therein requiring further monitoring and experimental validation nitrogen and antibiotics were the key environmental variables driving the above niche separations and planktonic and benthic communities had different drivers contrasts of the relative adaptations to environmental pressure among taxa are the foundation of niche based theory chesson 2000 75 9 of the water samples of this plateau river reached the worst quality due to nitrogen pollution level v tn 2 mg l environmental quality standards for surface water of china fig s10 higher contents of tn 3 6 1 1 mg l no3 n 3 1 0 9 mg l or no2 n 1 1 0 7 mg l restrained the niches of comammox two clades in nitrifiers in urban water pointing to their oligotrophic preferences compared with the canonical communities hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 sakoula et al 2021 similar results were obtained by s liu et al 2020 clades a and b have significantly lower genomic g c contents than canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii p 0 0001 table s3 also illustrating comammox adaptation to nitrogen deficiency grzymski and dussaq 2012 genomic transcriptomic or kinetic studies suggested that canonical nitrospira rather than comammox had a higher affinity for nitrite during nitrite oxidation and could utilize nitrite as sole nitrogen source kits et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 liu et al 2021 this would dissipate the advantage of comammox in the higher no2 n habitat the ambient nh3 n was not a significant factor based on the correlation and random forest analyses it is likely because nitrifiers can obtain it through intracellular pathways such as urea or amino acid degradation palomo et al 2018 liu et al 2021 nitrogen related factors led to more pronounced niche separations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in the wet season than in the dry season possibly due to that the higher water temperature was more suitable for metabolic activities of canonical aops and nob le et al 2019 besides the nitrogen compounds antibiotics were another type of critical anthropogenic pollutants kuang et al 2020 that inhibited the comammox niches lms and qns were the most important antibiotic predictors for the comammox importance in nitrifiers in water while mls for that in sediments notably lms qns and mls accounted for small proportions of total antibiotics in this study sequentially 2 7 1 9 2 6 1 4 and 6 8 5 7 fig s10 and s11 kuang et al 2020 a previous study indicated that antibiotics indeed altered nitrogen functional gene compositions in a drinking water reservoir though they were in low concentrations dang et al 2021 both antibiotic types and concentrations can differentiate the dynamic patterns of aops for example li et al 2022 found a higher inhibitory effect of sulfadiazine on comammox abundance than on canonical aop abundances in soils which was generally consistent with our finding that the percentage of comammox in planktonic aops was negatively correlated with sas including sulfadiazine despite all the sa components were not the most important variables fig 6 gao et al 2021 found that comammox were inhibited evidently by azithromycin of mls in lab scale mesocosms which was also observed in this study fig 6 y wang et al 2021 realized a selective enrichment of comammox in activated sludge using lincomycin of lms or trimethoprim of sas and demonstrated suppressive effects on comammox and aob by erythromycin of mls or sulfamethazine of sas wastewater treatment systems could harbor comammox nitrospira with a high functional diversity and eutrophic adaptive capability y wang et al 2021 by contrast riverine or soil comammox under less environmental pressures might be more susceptible to the antibiotic pollutions other two researches suggested that an aoa strain exhibited better removal efficiencies of lincomycin and several sas or qns than comammox and aob isolates zhou et al 2019 l zhou et al 2021 it can be speculated that lms qns sas and mls rather than other antibiotic classes are biotransformed through different routines and efficiencies by nitrifiers and thus became the main drivers for the variations significant negative correlations were found between either clindamycin clarithromycin or roxithromycin and the abundance importance of comammox in both planktonic and benthic nitrifiers fig 6 this should raise more attentions about the impact mechanisms of these antibiotics to mimic natural and engineered systems more realistically future experiments should focus on the community behaviors of comammox especially the yet uncultivated clade b subject to a combined pollution instead of an individual pollutant gao et al 2021 lastly by incubation experiments we measured the potential comammox rate in each sediment sample within our knowledge the wide existence of comammox activities with large contributions to aops was demonstrated in riverine ecosystems for the first time which moved forward a lot compared to previous studies s liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the mean benthic comammox activity of this plateau river was lower than that of the qtp wetland sediments with a higher elevation of 3000 5000 m but their contributions were generally comparable yuan et al 2021 moreover much higher than that of soils from a low altitude plain wang et al 2020 comammox activity predominates the ammonia oxidation process in plateau sediments more than expected which seems to be benefited from the relatively low nh3 n concentrations across almost all the samples 1 10 mg kg 1 fig s11 yuan et al 2021 in this study urbanization and the related antibiotic type mls were the deciding factors to restrain the comammox activity contribution helping consolidate the hypothesis based on the abundance profile despite the lack of physiological evidences the results of correlation and random forest analyses could support mutually and the predictive effects of lms qns and mls on the niche differentiations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers were observed in both seasons suggesting it was not a random occurrence to stabilize the nitrification process appropriate regulation and in situ remediation of overloading antibiotics are particularly necessary in natural environments 5 conclusions this study gained the first insights into a wide existence and diversity of yet uncultured comammox clade b along a high elevation river flowing through the largest city on the qtp and a significant effect of anthropogenic disturbance on comammox biogeography which has been condensed as a conceptual paradigm fig 8 we demonstrated that clade b was the major comammox type within this plateau river with average 3 0 and 2 0 times as abundant as clade a amoa genes in water and sediments respectively the freshwater and dwtp identified species dominated the comammox guilds comammox contributed more abundances to aops and nitrospira sublineages i ii in the suburban area of the upriver with less human population intensity while the wastewater sourced canonical nitrospira were more abundant in the urban area higher contents of no3 n no2 n and antibiotics could limit the comammox niches in nitrifiers in urban water or sediments lms and qns were the most important antibiotic predictors for the niche separations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water while mls for those in sediments finally we confirmed higher activity contributions of benthic comammox in the suburban area than in the urban one and that the contribution variation was significantly and negatively correlated with mls and their major components further metatranscriptomic sequencing or culture based experiments are needed to explore comammox community behaviors under

15335,the recent discovery of comammox nitrospira performing complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate has overturned the long held dogma of two step nitrification on earth yet little is known about the effect of urbanization interference on their distribution using gene centric metagenomics we provided the first blueprints about comammox community biogeography and environmental drivers along a high elevation 2000 m river flowing through the largest city on the vulnerable qinghai tibetan plateau our study confirmed a wide presence and diversity of yet uncultured comammox clade b across wet and dry seasons with average 3 0 and 2 0 times as abundant as clade a amoa genes in water and sediments respectively species identified from freshwater and drinking water treatment plants dominated the comammox guilds 58 100 suggesting this plateau river shared a similar comammox assemblage with the above habitat types compared with the urban area harboring more abundant canonical nitrospira identified in wastewater average 24 the upstream suburban reach had a smaller human population but larger proportions of comammox in ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes 24 72 of abundances and nitrospira sublineages i ii higher contents of nitrate and nitrite in water and antibiotics in water and sediments may restrain comammox niches in nitrifiers over the urban area further random forest analysis revealed that lincosamides and quinolones were the most important antibiotic predictors for the niche differentiations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water while macrolides for those in sediments finally by incubation experiments we demonstrated higher activity contributions of benthic comammox in the suburban area 36 2 92 8 of potential ammonia oxidation rates than in the urban reach and that the contribution variation had significant negative relations with macrolides and their major components overall this study highlighted that anthropogenic activities hampered the advantage of riverine complete nitrifiers over the canonical two step ones keywords gene centric metagenomics complete nitrifier comammox biogeographic pattern urbanization antibiotics qinghai tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification the microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrate is a central process in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycling gruber and galloway 2008 since the end of 1800s nitrification was perceived as a two step reaction mediated by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing microorganisms separately santoro 2016 however the recent discovery of comammox bacteria who can completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate within their cells has overturned this 110 year old classical tenet of two step nitrification and been regarded as a milestone daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2016 based on phylogenies of concatenated conserved genes all the known comammox bacteria belong to nitrospira sublineage ii palomo et al 2019 s liu et al 2020 sakoula et al 2021 which was formerly thought as the most widely distributed clade of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2015 compared with strict nob comammox nitrospira possess a full series of ammonia monooxygenases amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenases hao that are phylogenetically divergent from those of canonical ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 comammox organisms can be divided into clades a and b based on the phylogenies of amo operons daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and these genes have become the ideal biomarkers for comammox identification and quantification metagenomics or amplicon sequencing based surveys have confirmed that comammox nitrospira as the third category of aerobic ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes aops are widely existed on earth they contribute great abundances to nitrifier guilds in a variety of natural systems including surface freshwater palomo et al

systems daims et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 cotto et al 2020 x zhou et al 2021 also possess abundant comammox nitrospira outnumbering aoa or canonical nitrospira it should be noted that higher activity of comammox bacteria than those of either aoa or aob has been demonstrated in some soils and wetlands wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 besides the importance of comammox different environmental characters can lead to significant niche differentiations between comammox clades a and b or even among several subclades within a s liu et al 2020 this suggests a high diversity and complexity of comammox which requires a deeper level e g strain level profile with an increasing number of comammox genomes the preference analysis on basis of their habitat types is also possible but rarely performed such analysis may serve to quantify environmental attributes of ecological patches palomo et al 2022 and unveil the compositional pattern of comammox community the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp is well known as the world s third pole with high elevation low atmospheric pressure cold temperature strong solar radiation etc it is one of the most ecologically vulnerable areas and sensitive to climate changes and human activities xu et al 2022 the qtp typically functions as the asian water tower rivers originating from the qtp are the pipelines of this tower and of primary significance to circumjacent water cycling material transport as well as civilization formation it is noted that excessive urbanization together with rapid developments of agriculture and industry during the past years has brought more inorganic or organic pollutants into rivers on the qtp wu et al 2016a wu et al 2016b kuang et al 2020 dong et al 2021 xu et al 2022 such anthropogenic disturbance can alter riverine microbial communities wang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 and further pose threats to the fragile plateau ecology as the critical participants in global carbon and nitrogen cycling comammox bacteria have been confirmed with a broad existence in the qtp rivers like the yangtze and yellow source lancang nu and yarlung zangbo rivers s liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 but few measured their potential activities additionally due to that the sampling areas of the above studies are far from densely inhabited districts the sensitivity of comammox bacteria versus canonical nitrifiers to anthropogenic activity e g urbanization remains unknown along the qtp rivers this should be an indispensable part for biogeography studies focusing on spatiotemporal variations and the underlying factors planktonic and benthic microbes in plateau aquatic systems can be shaped by different environmental variables zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 under an integrated viewpoint it is necessary to contrast the major drivers of comammox variations in water and sediments along a qtp river subject to intense human activities to address the above issue we implemented a synchronous sampling campaign along the largest tributary of the upper yellow river the huangshui river it flows through xining the biggest city on the qtp and the capital of qinghai province with a population 2 000 000 we collected a total of 58 water and surface sediment samples during wet and dry seasons based on metagenomic shotgun sequencing physicochemical measurements and incubating experiments we aimed to a explore clade and strain level abundance profiles of comammox bacteria and their abundance activity importance in nitrifier guilds over this plateau river b investigate the influence of urbanization level on comammox niches in riverine nitrifiers and the main environmental pollutants driving such variations in water and sediments overall this study is of great help to comprehensively understand comammox ecological pattern under anthropogenic disturbance and develop an optimum nitrogen management strategy along a high altitude river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and

based on the coordinates using arcgis software all the sites are distributed in the plateau region with the elevations varying from 2158 to 2629 m these sites can be divided into urban and suburban

queried against the ncbi non redundant nr database using blastp for double check the amoa and amob instead of amo subunit c were used because they can exhibit stable and consistent phylogenetic clustering for easy identification daims et al 2015 cotto et al 2020 to ensure accuracy orfs with a sequence length 150 amino acids aa were excluded from the following phylogenetic analysis the

phylosift darling et al 2014 based on the parameter described previously s liu et al 2020 to lower the complexity and bias minor adjustments were conducted through removing a genome at a time until comammox clades a and b and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii and iv formed divergent clusters lastly 53 representative genomes recovering from freshwater drinking water treatment plant dwtp soils groundwater wastewater and ocean see the classification standard in palomo et al 2019 in nine countries of asia europe and america were retained to form the reference pool and the key nitrification related genes were identified table s3 the average nucleotide identity ani among pairwise whole genomes and emgs were calculated using orthoani lee et al 2016 bbmap https sourceforge net projects bbmap was applied to map the clean reads of each sample to the emgs with an identity cutoff of 90 the hit number was normalized by total length of emgs and sequencing depth s liu et al 2020 the community and strain level abundances were expressed as the hit number per 20 000 bp emgs per 2 5 108 clean reads to gain the relative abundance of the whole comammox community in each shotgun metagenome bbmap was used to map the clean reads of each sample to the 53 genomes with a minimum identity of 95 the abundance was expressed as the percentage of clean reads hitting all the comammox genomes 2 5 determination of potential rates of comammox nitrospira aoa and aob the potential rates of comammox bacteria aoa and aob were determined via a double inhibition method using kclo3 and 1

diversity of comammox nitrospira to illustrate comammox presence and diversity along the huangshui river on the qtp their amo orfs were firstly assembled from the in situ metagenomic datasets a sum of 121 comammox amoa and amob orfs 150 aa were acquired from 14 water and 16 sediment samples through the kegg nr annotation and phylogenetic analysis fig 1 for comammox amoa 17 and 8 assembled orfs were affiliated with clades a and b separately fig 1a 14 amoa orfs in clade a had close relationships with the amoa of comammox nitrospira sp cg24b recovering from a denmark dwtp palomo et al 2018 and 6

owned both comammox amoa and amob orfs overall 23 and 98 comammox amoa b orfs were separately assembled in water and sediments at 11 sites out of 17 from the upper to the lower reach and clade b orfs outnumbered those of clade a at 10 sites fig 1c these observations confirmed a wide existence and diversity of comammox nitrospira especially the yet uncultured clade b to date zhu et al 2022 over this plateau river 3 2 comammox community structure and biogeographic pattern besides the qualitative analysis using the assembled data we employed the unassembled data for quantitative comparisons ju and zhang 2015 two categories of marker genes i e amoa and emgs were used to recruit comammox and canonical nitrifier like reads from each metagenomic dataset for comparisons of their abundances and biogeography fig s3 displayed that numbers of comammox like reads recruited by the amoa and emgs were significantly and positively correlated in water pearson s adjusted r 2 0 937 p 0 0001 and sediments pearson s adjusted r 2 0 988 p 0 0001 which was consistent with those obtained from the yangtze river s liu et al 2020 4838 comammox like amoa reads were detected in 57 out of 58 water and sediment samples during both seasons and clade b amoa reads outnumbered those of clade a at 74 1 of samples water 72 4 sediment 75 9 fig 2 a b fig s3 we also acquired a total of 76 838 comammox like emg reads and clade b reads outnumbered those of clade a in all the samples fig 2c d fig s3 these results demonstrated that clade b was the dominant comammox type across both temporal and spatial dimensions in this high elevation river the long emg sequences recruited more reads than the amoa genes which helped to fully compare the abundance between clades a and b when comammox belong to the rare biosphere for their abundance importance in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing guilds planktonic comammox constituted up to 24 9 13 0 mean standard deviation of aops clade a 6 2 5 4 clade b 18 7 11 7

abundance contributions in overall water 27 3 56 3 of aops 70 2 84 1 of nitrospira sublineages i ii and sediments 24 6 71 6 of aops 68 7 87 6 of nitrospira sublineages i ii p 0 001 and similar results

and urban groups 5 12 samples close by in each group could support each other and suggest good representativity a detailed strain level abundance profile for comammox and canonical nitrospira was subsequently investigated based on the emg hits under a species level cutoff of 95 genome wide ani richter and rosselló móra 2009 the 53 nitrospira reference bins constituted 19 comammox clade a 13 comammox clade b and 10 canonical nitrospira species fig s6 the results showed that the overall shannon wiener index of clade b water 1 86 0 26 sediment 1 87 0 17 was significantly higher than that of

b orfs closely related to the above species were also assembled fig 1 fig s2 this implied generally uniform results obtained by both read and orf based methods and that the emgs are also the ideal biomarkers to identify the majority of comammox species the distance decay effects of comammox were mostly insignificant p 0 05 except that in sediments of the dry season mantel spearman s r 0 31 or 0 33 p 0 05 fig s7 indicating that their community compositions were not quite varied spatially this was possibly due to that 94 8 of the samples were predominated by the above seven species occupying a mean of 80 4 of comammox abundance with less compositional variations we further summarized the abundance profile according to the ecosystem categories that nitrospira bins were firstly identified from fig 3a b and found that the freshwater and dwtp sourced groups prevailed in planktonic and benthic comammox communities during both seasons 58 100 for each sample with average 73 84 followed by those recovering from soils average 8 17 groundwater average 5 9 and wastewater average 1 2 1 8 the dwtp group was more abundant in sediments than in water the urban reach possessed significantly higher abundance percentages of the wastewater sourced canonical nitrospira species than the suburban area in water of the wet season p 0 01 and sediments of both seasons p 0 05 fig 3a c although comammox bacteria made up for 0 8 of the overall microbes in each sample water 0 07 0 04 sediment 0 19 0 17 fig s8 the spatial difference of urbanization level influenced nitrification by determining the niche separations between such minor group and canonical aops or nitrospira over this plateau river 3 3 environmental drivers for comammox abundance importance we investigated how the microscopic environmental factors determined the abundance variations of comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water and sediments over this plateau urban river correlation type analysis is a reliable tool to characterize the importance of environmental factors zhou and ning 2017 we found that whether in the wet season dry season or all the samples the percentage of planktonic comammox bacteria in aops and abundance ratio of planktonic comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii had significantly negative correlations with antibiotic and nitrogen concentrations instead of toc tp temperature do and ph fig 4 a table s6 specifically comparing the correlation coefficients lms spearman s r 0 65 0 81 p 0 01 and qns r 0 62 0 75 p 0 05 had more pronounced negative correlations with the above percentage and abundance ratio than any other antibiotic types like sas mls tcs β ls and pes during two separate seasons and across all the samples both were also the most important factors in the dry season no3 n tn and no2 n were more negatively correlated with the above percentage and abundance ratio in the wet season r 0 83 0 97 p 0 01 than in the dry season r 0 35 0 60 p 0 05 except tn and the most critical factors in the wet season the percentage of planktonic comammox clade b in aops had more evidently negative correlations with no3 n tn and no2 n r 0 64 0 79 p 0 01 than with other factors in the wet season while in the dry season lms qns and sas were the most important factors r 0 72 0 82 p 0 01 fig s9a table s7 for sediments whether in the wet season dry season or all the samples the percentage of comammox in aops and abundance ratio of comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii were only significantly and negatively related to antibiotics instead of nutrients and ph fig 4b table s6 mls or lms were the most crucial variables with more pronounced effects in the dry season r 0 73 0 84 p 0 01 mls or 0 05 lms than in the wet season r 0 36 0 69 p 0 05 except lms similar negative correlations were also obtained between the proportion of benthic comammox clade b in aops and mls or lms fig s9a table s7 the percentages of comammox clade a in aops were significantly and negatively correlated with very different factors between water e g no2 n and tn and sediments e g mls and sas fig s9b table s7 compared to the suburban area the urban area harbored average 1 5 23 5 fold higher contents of lms 1 1 36 3 ng l qns 1 1 37 4 ng l sas 12 2 1024 6 ng l no3 n 1 8 5 5 mg l tn 1 9 6 5 mg l and no2 n 0 3 2 9 mg l in water and mls 0 7 7 1 ng g in sediments across all the samples and during two separate seasons p 0 05 fig s10 and s11 suggesting that the effect of macroscopic urbanization level on riverine comammox biogeography was ascribed to the spatial differences of antibiotic and nitrogen compounds partially the concentrations of total antibiotics and the major antibiotic types in water and sediments were significantly higher in the urban sites than in the suburban ones which highlighted that the two areas differed a lot in anthropogenic activities random forest a machine learning algorithm was used to reveal the major predictors for the percentage of comammox bacteria in aops and abundance ratio of comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii antibiotic or nitrogen contents instead of other factors were the significant p 0 05 predictors in water and sediments of both seasons fig 5 which was generally in line with the correlation analysis for planktonic guilds lms and qns were the best antibiotics to predict the variations of the above percentage except in the wet season and abundance ratio both were better predictors in the dry season amoa 11 8 emgs 15 1 than in the wet season amoa 2 9 emgs 7 8 no3 n tn and no2 n were the best predictors in the wet season amoa 17 5 emgs 13 4 for benthic communities mls were the best predictor for the above percentage and abundance ratio across all the samples and during two respective seasons mls and lms were better predictors in the dry season amoa 20 1 emgs 19 9 than in the wet season amoa 7 9 emgs 5 3 we subsequently explored the relations between antibiotic available components and the percentage of comammox in aops or abundance ratio of comammox and canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii fig 6 the results showed that all the significant correlations were negative spearman s r 0 33 0 76 p 0 05 in water the major components of lms and qns like lincomycin clindamycin nalidixic acid flumequine and ofloxacin r 0 54 0 63 p 0 05 were more negatively correlated with the above percentage than those r 0 36 0 48 p 0 05 of sas mls and tcs lincomycin clindamycin and flumequine were the most negatively correlated with the above abundance ratio r 0 41 0 42 p 0 05 for sediments the major components in mls like roxithromycin anhydroerythromycin and clarithromycin were the most negatively related to the above percentage and abundance ratio r 0 70 0 76 p 0 0001 3 4 potential comammox activity and the related contribution we finally determined the potential rates of comammox aoa and aob in 29 sediment samples fig 7 a and s12 the potential comammox rates varied from 0 054 1 66 mg n kg 1 d 1 significantly higher comammox rates and the related contributions to aops were found in the dry season rates 0 61 0 45 mg n kg 1 d 1 contributions 62 6 22 9 than in the wet season 0 21 0 16 mg n kg 1 d 1 29 8 15 1 p 0 01 and aoa were the most active aops in the wet season 0 35 0 09 mg n kg 1 d 1 54 2 16 3 with their rates and contributions obviously higher than those of comammox and aob p 0 05 intriguingly in line with the abundance analysis fig 2f the suburban area 36 2 92 8 possessed significantly higher comammox contributions of potential rates than the urban area during both seasons p 0 01 fig 7a which demonstrated profound influences of urbanization on riverine nitrifier communities and activities furthermore we found that the contribution variation of comammox potential rates was significantly and negatively correlated with mls soc and the major components of mls like anhydroerythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin and roxithromycin in two seasons spearman s r 0 39 0 77 p 0 05 fig 7b this suggested analogous antibiotic drivers for the abundance and activity importance of benthic comammox in riverine nitrification 4 discussion based on gene centric metagenomics we developed a high resolution workflow to obtain the first integrated abundance profiles of planktonic and benthic comammox along a qtp river as well as their biogeographic patterns subject to anthropogenic factors significant and positive correlations were observed between the number of clean reads recruited by the comammox amoa and emgs we suggested that the amoa may share the similar characteristics with the emgs i e nearly ubiquitous conservative and present in single copy darling et al 2014 on comammox genomes of this river although we failed to reconstruct the comammox genomes due to the low clean read coverages fig s8 the identified dominant clade a and b reference bins fig 1 and 3a actually possess only one copy amoa meanwhile the amoa genes are not phylogenetically divergent from their close relatives palomo et al 2019 s liu et al 2020 palomo et al 2022 our study demonstrated a broad existence and diversity of clade b comammox across both temporal and spatial dimensions with larger abundances than clade a in water and sediments by analyzing amoa sequences from various systems zhu et al 2022 suggested that clade b is less widely distributed diverse and abundant than clade a and can be restricted to specific niches we summarized nearly all the articles reporting the advantage of clade b over clade a table 1 only rivers soils and rapid sand filters from dwtps possessed more abundant or active clade b which generally corresponded to the sourced ecosystems of clade b genomes table s3 four studies indicated that clade b in many qtp rivers could better adapt to the high elevations 2158 4535 m with relatively low temperature average 9 2 15 3 c and intense light irradiation e g uv http www geodata cn the non plateau river reaches had more abundant clade a than b s liu et al 2020 in this study higher abundance contributions of clade a were found in the wet season water temperature 19 2 1 8 c fig s10 than in the dry season 10 8 2 1 c these findings suggested that the two clades might differ in adaptabilities to natural fluctuations nitrospira genomes actually encode genes related to cold or heat shock liu et al 2021 and uv light induced stress response podowski et al 2022 however little is known about the functional differences between clades a and b another eight studies showed that clade b in soils or rapid sand filters preferred low nh3 n and cold habitats singleton 2018 also found more abundant clade b comammox in permafrost with scarce nitrogen the ammonia transporters encoded by clade b instead of a were previously found in aoa belonging to a large group of proteins referred to as methyl ammonia permeases mep offre et al 2014 the mep type transporter with a higher affinity for ammonia palomo et al 2018 can confer an advantage to survive in the nitrogen limited environment in general we proposed that clade b might outcompete clade a in cold oligotrophic and sun intense environments possibly with a slow growth rate giovannoni and stingl 2007 bakermans et al 2014 more experiments are needed to validate the physiological features despite such microbes are hard to cultivate the freshwater and dwtp identified species e g lm bin98 thk bin2 cg24a cg24c cg24b and ga0074138 dominated the comammox communities in water and sediments across two seasons tens of amo orfs closely related to them were also assembled this implied an analogous comammox assemblage between this high altitude river and other freshwater or dwtp systems the insignificant distance decay patterns of comammox bacteria might indicate similar niches shared by the dominant species here although these species were originally found in usa denmark or china heilongjiang table s3 we suggested that they have colonized here and evolved for a long time considering their high abundances broadly comammox from dwtps flourished in biofilter communities displaying preferences for surface attached growth koch et al 2019 which might be one reason for more abundant dwtp species found in sediments with easier formation of immobilized biofilms than in water palomo et al 2022 indicated that comammox genome evolutions are more affected by habitat types than by species identity highlighting the environmental dependency of evolutionary processes this could provide a theoretical basis that the major comammox taxa were shared by rivers freshwater and dwtps that harbor the similar growth media dynamic condition or nutrient level several canonical nitrospira taxa like aau mbr2 olb3 uw 2 cg24d and spc bin27 were also abundant and firstly discovered in wastewater in usa denmark netherlands or soil in china zhejiang fig 3a table s3 all the results hinted a metabolic versatility of nitrifying bacteria to acclimatize rapidly and strong dispersal capability to colonize widely as indicated by wilson et al 1997 planktonic and benthic comammox contributed higher abundances to nitrifier guilds in the upriver suburban area which is far from xining city center having a lower population intensity and urbanization rate kuang et al 2020 dong et al 2021 similarly larger proportions of comammox in aops or nob were observed in the upstream regions of the yangtze and tama urban rivers with less anthropogenic activities s liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 we thus hypothesized that the human related factors influenced the advantage of riverine comammox over canonical nitrifiers for this plateau river on one hand the urban reach received more nutrients and refractory organics from domestic or industrial wwtps than the rural one kuang et al 2020 dong et al 2021 which was not beneficial for comammox with an oligotrophic lifestyle hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 sakoula et al 2021 particularly the freshwater and dwtp groups on the other it is not surprising to observe more abundant canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii especially the wastewater sourced taxa in the urban reach as they are usually the key members in wwtps daims et al 2016 the thriving aob taxa like nitrosomonas ureae and oligotropha in the urban reach could also feed nob with nitrite from ammonia oxidation daims et al 2016 both of them have been found abundant in wwtps even in the case of low temperature zhang et al 2011 rodriguez caballero et al 2012 they were likely to become more abundant in the urban water and sediments of the plateau river severely subject to the effluents of wwtps besides the wastewater identified comammox were not detected vastly fig 3a on account of all the above the riverine comammox niches along the urban reach would be restrained by their potential competitors with a less n2o emission than that of aob comammox bacteria are thought as an environmentally friendly group kits et al 2019 considering the higher relative and absolute abundances of benthic comammox in the suburban reach fig 2b and s5 the nitrification dependent n2o emission amount from sediments might be lower therein requiring further monitoring and experimental validation nitrogen and antibiotics were the key environmental variables driving the above niche separations and planktonic and benthic communities had different drivers contrasts of the relative adaptations to environmental pressure among taxa are the foundation of niche based theory chesson 2000 75 9 of the water samples of this plateau river reached the worst quality due to nitrogen pollution level v tn 2 mg l environmental quality standards for surface water of china fig s10 higher contents of tn 3 6 1 1 mg l no3 n 3 1 0 9 mg l or no2 n 1 1 0 7 mg l restrained the niches of comammox two clades in nitrifiers in urban water pointing to their oligotrophic preferences compared with the canonical communities hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 sakoula et al 2021 similar results were obtained by s liu et al 2020 clades a and b have significantly lower genomic g c contents than canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii p 0 0001 table s3 also illustrating comammox adaptation to nitrogen deficiency grzymski and dussaq 2012 genomic transcriptomic or kinetic studies suggested that canonical nitrospira rather than comammox had a higher affinity for nitrite during nitrite oxidation and could utilize nitrite as sole nitrogen source kits et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 liu et al 2021 this would dissipate the advantage of comammox in the higher no2 n habitat the ambient nh3 n was not a significant factor based on the correlation and random forest analyses it is likely because nitrifiers can obtain it through intracellular pathways such as urea or amino acid degradation palomo et al 2018 liu et al 2021 nitrogen related factors led to more pronounced niche separations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in the wet season than in the dry season possibly due to that the higher water temperature was more suitable for metabolic activities of canonical aops and nob le et al 2019 besides the nitrogen compounds antibiotics were another type of critical anthropogenic pollutants kuang et al 2020 that inhibited the comammox niches lms and qns were the most important antibiotic predictors for the comammox importance in nitrifiers in water while mls for that in sediments notably lms qns and mls accounted for small proportions of total antibiotics in this study sequentially 2 7 1 9 2 6 1 4 and 6 8 5 7 fig s10 and s11 kuang et al 2020 a previous study indicated that antibiotics indeed altered nitrogen functional gene compositions in a drinking water reservoir though they were in low concentrations dang et al 2021 both antibiotic types and concentrations can differentiate the dynamic patterns of aops for example li et al 2022 found a higher inhibitory effect of sulfadiazine on comammox abundance than on canonical aop abundances in soils which was generally consistent with our finding that the percentage of comammox in planktonic aops was negatively correlated with sas including sulfadiazine despite all the sa components were not the most important variables fig 6 gao et al 2021 found that comammox were inhibited evidently by azithromycin of mls in lab scale mesocosms which was also observed in this study fig 6 y wang et al 2021 realized a selective enrichment of comammox in activated sludge using lincomycin of lms or trimethoprim of sas and demonstrated suppressive effects on comammox and aob by erythromycin of mls or sulfamethazine of sas wastewater treatment systems could harbor comammox nitrospira with a high functional diversity and eutrophic adaptive capability y wang et al 2021 by contrast riverine or soil comammox under less environmental pressures might be more susceptible to the antibiotic pollutions other two researches suggested that an aoa strain exhibited better removal efficiencies of lincomycin and several sas or qns than comammox and aob isolates zhou et al 2019 l zhou et al 2021 it can be speculated that lms qns sas and mls rather than other antibiotic classes are biotransformed through different routines and efficiencies by nitrifiers and thus became the main drivers for the variations significant negative correlations were found between either clindamycin clarithromycin or roxithromycin and the abundance importance of comammox in both planktonic and benthic nitrifiers fig 6 this should raise more attentions about the impact mechanisms of these antibiotics to mimic natural and engineered systems more realistically future experiments should focus on the community behaviors of comammox especially the yet uncultivated clade b subject to a combined pollution instead of an individual pollutant gao et al 2021 lastly by incubation experiments we measured the potential comammox rate in each sediment sample within our knowledge the wide existence of comammox activities with large contributions to aops was demonstrated in riverine ecosystems for the first time which moved forward a lot compared to previous studies s liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the mean benthic comammox activity of this plateau river was lower than that of the qtp wetland sediments with a higher elevation of 3000 5000 m but their contributions were generally comparable yuan et al 2021 moreover much higher than that of soils from a low altitude plain wang et al 2020 comammox activity predominates the ammonia oxidation process in plateau sediments more than expected which seems to be benefited from the relatively low nh3 n concentrations across almost all the samples 1 10 mg kg 1 fig s11 yuan et al 2021 in this study urbanization and the related antibiotic type mls were the deciding factors to restrain the comammox activity contribution helping consolidate the hypothesis based on the abundance profile despite the lack of physiological evidences the results of correlation and random forest analyses could support mutually and the predictive effects of lms qns and mls on the niche differentiations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers were observed in both seasons suggesting it was not a random occurrence to stabilize the nitrification process appropriate regulation and in situ remediation of overloading antibiotics are particularly necessary in natural environments 5 conclusions this study gained the first insights into a wide existence and diversity of yet uncultured comammox clade b along a high elevation river flowing through the largest city on the qtp and a significant effect of anthropogenic disturbance on comammox biogeography which has been condensed as a conceptual paradigm fig 8 we demonstrated that clade b was the major comammox type within this plateau river with average 3 0 and 2 0 times as abundant as clade a amoa genes in water and sediments respectively the freshwater and dwtp identified species dominated the comammox guilds comammox contributed more abundances to aops and nitrospira sublineages i ii in the suburban area of the upriver with less human population intensity while the wastewater sourced canonical nitrospira were more abundant in the urban area higher contents of no3 n no2 n and antibiotics could limit the comammox niches in nitrifiers in urban water or sediments lms and qns were the most important antibiotic predictors for the niche separations between comammox and canonical nitrifiers in water while mls for those in sediments finally we confirmed higher activity contributions of benthic comammox in the suburban area than in the urban one and that the contribution variation was

mustafa et al 2016 sutherland et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 for such applications more robust ceramic membranes with longer life span are generally preferred over their organic counterparts due to their

industrial effluents with high fouling propensity and harsh chemical solutions acidic or alkaline environment li et al 2020 to overcome the challenging issue of nano catalyst recovery some researchers immobilize their catalysts onto ceramic membranes to achieve simultaneous separation and catalytical removal of refractory organic contaminants berger et al 2020 gao et al 2020 hodges et al 2018 iglesias et al 2016 shi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however besides insufficient removal current membranes still suffer from low water permeability due to their inherent unfavorable particle packing membrane structure with low porosity and high transport resistance fraga et al 2017 hotza et al 2020 it is highly desired to rationally design novel separation membrane featuring anti fouling even self cleaning high water permeability and sufficient contaminant removal rate nunes et al 2020 moreover it still remains unclear about the role of true active radicals responsible for catalytic

average size 0 5 μm were first prepared by urea pyrolysis method then they were heated to 600 c for 2 h in a reactor containing β sic nano wire membranes at an elevated temperature rate of 10 c min 1 to allow a sublimation deposition process fig s1 after 2 h dwelling time the reactor was cooled down to room temperature naturally finally nano sized two dimension g c3n4 particles were uniformly decorated onto the out surface of β sic nano wires 2 3 catalytic activity and separation performance evaluation the catalytic activity and separation performance of the nano wire membranes were evaluated in a dead end flow filtration system fig s1 a 500 w xe lamp beijing perfectlight technology co ltd china was applied to simulate solar light source the membranes were installed in the highly transparent quartz photo catalytic reactor where a stainless steel mesh was fixed beneath the membranes as a support the photo catalytic activity was first investigated by submerging the membranes

ln c 0 c k t where c 0 and c mg l 1 are the concentrations of mo at the illumination time t of t 0 s and t s the effect of ph on the catalytic degradation of mo was characterized by adjusting the solution ph 1 0 and ph 13 0 by adding hcl or naoh and the mo concentration was recorded every 5 mins for 65 mins prior to each test the system was operated in the dark environment i e light off for 15 mins until an adsorption desorption equilibrium between membrane and mo was achieved each cycle was comprised of a 15 min dark stage and a 50 min photo catalytic degradation stage for decades the gold standard of uv photocatalysts is p25 commercial tio2 powder with anatase and rutile mixed phase hodges et al 2018 for comparison the degradation performance was also carried out for p25 deposited

the capture reagents such as 2 propanol ipa benzoquinone bq and triethanolamine teoa were added into the reaction mixture to capture active species such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 or produced holes h respectively chang et al 2018 the procedure was similar to the photo catalytic activity test except that the capture reagent was added with a concentration of 0 5 mmol 2 5

tension coefficient of the liquid θ is the contact angle of the liquid on the pore wall and δ p is the applied pressure difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and properties of sic nano wire ceramic membranes conventional ceramic membranes have a multilayered structure with particle packing morphology unlike them in this work a heterogeneous two layer membrane structure was specially designed with macroporous α sic flat sheet ceramic as substrate and with c3n4 β sic nano wire network as catalytically functionalized separation layer fig 2 a highly porous network layer of β sic nano wires was in situ grown onto the black sic ceramic substrate fig 2a in hydrogen atmosphere via ch3sicl3 decomposition during pecvd process eq 5 the growth of β sic nano wires preferentially occurred along their 111 crystal plane javid et al 2021 where increasing reaction temperature from 900 c to 950 c significantly facilitated the growth of more β sic nano wires by efficiently overcoming the activation energy barrier figs 2b and 2c at 950 c such a highly porous β sic nano wire network layer was formed in a random oriented way with promising surface hydrophilicity water contact angle 6 5 c h 3 sic l 3 g h 2 g β sic nano wire s 3 hcl g h 2 g to further enhance photocatalytical ability nano sized two dimension g c3n4 particles 2 5 nm were uniformly decorated onto the out surface of β sic nano wires fig 2f with a mass ratio of g c3n4 to sic is 5 6 via a sublimation deposition process at 600 c in air which could be observed by a membrane color change into yellow like fig 2d even after decoration of nano g c3n4 g c3n4 β sic nano wire layer 8 μm thickness fig 2e not only still maintained a highly porous network structure and sufficient surface hydrophilicity water contact angle 10 but exhibited enhanced photocatalytic ability anchoring of highly dispersive nano g c3n4 onto β sic nano wires was clearly observed by hrtem in fig 2f forming a heterogeneous structure with more active sites for photocatalytical application a spacing of 0 25 nm between adjacent lattice fringes can be ascribed to the d spacing of 111 planes in the β sic crystal suggesting that the growth direction is 111 kao et al 2019 while a spacing of 0 325 nm corresponds to the 002 plane of g c3n4 du et al 2019 the sharp bright spots in the saed patterns fig 2f indicate that the β sic nano wire and the nano g c3n4 have single crystalline structures in addition c n and si elements were detected for g c3n4 β sic nano wire layer fig 2g unlike conventional multi cycle fabrication methods i e coating sintering fraga et al 2017 the in situ growth protocol via pecvd proposed in this work features one step production of small pore ceramic microfiltration membrane 0 12 μm onto macroporous α sic substrate 8 μm without introducing any inter layers fig 3 a in addition anchoring of nano g c3n4 via a sublimation deposition process slightly decreased pore size from 0 12 μm to 0 08 μm fig 3a the surface porosities of β sic and g c3n4 β sic nano wire layers were quantified to be 60 3 and 56 1 by processing sem images using image j software which is higher than not only that 32 8 of α sic substrate fig 3b and fig s2 but these 30 dong et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 of other reported ceramic membrane this results once again indicate that such a nano wire membrane structure has higher porosity i e lower transport resistance than conventional particle packing membrane structure besides α sic phase jcpds 73 1663 both β sic jcpds 73 1665 and g c3n4 phases jcpds 87 1526 were clearly identified for g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane by xrd fig 3c moreover the structure of both g c3n4 and β sic was characterized by their typical peaks in the raman fig 3d especially the presence of raman peaks at 796 cm 1 and 972 cm 1 could ascribed to the modes of transverse optical and longitudinal optical phonons of β sic respectively while three peaks at 1235 cm 1 1558 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 correspond to g c3n4 in order to validate the enhanced light response properties for photo catalytic applications the membranes were further characterized by uv vis drs fig 3e and photoluminescence pl spectroscopy fig 3f compared with β sic nano wire membrane and g c3n4 particle g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibited an absorption edge of more shifting to visible light region with a wider absorption range and higher intensity indicating an enhancement of visible light absorption and better photo catalytic activity fig 3e the heterojunction formed between g c3n4 nanoparticle and β sic nanowires make the band gap becomes narrower and absorption edge red shift moreover the lowered pl intensity of g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane indicates the better separation performance i e more inhibited recombination of electron hole pairs which is beneficial to enhance photo catalytic performance fig 3f chang et al 2018 3 2 enhanced catalytic performance at harsh conditions compared with organic membranes more robust ceramic membranes such as sic membrane have better stability in chemically harsh environments moreover at acidic or alkaline conditions the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibits enhanced photo catalysis removal performance for organic dyes mo fig 4 outperforming the moderate performance under neutral condition fig s3 especially at alkaline condition ph 13 it has better photo catalysis performance i e higher removal rapidly complete degradation within 35 mins fig 4a and fig s3 and higher apparent degradation rate constant fig 4b than β sic nano wire membrane g c3n4 membrane and p25 tio2 ceramic membrane the latter shows incomplete removal efficiency i e 95 even under prolonged time 90 mins interestingly at acidic condition ph 1 faster complete degradation could be observed within 20 mins with higher apparent rate constant which follows pseudo first order kinetics k 0 21 min 1 for the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane fig 4c fig 4d and fig s4 the better performance at acidic condition than that at alkaline condition can be ascribed to the enhanced adsorption via stronger electrostatic attraction si between the positively charged catalytic membrane surface phpzc 2 8 and negatively charged mo anions as well as the easier degradation of mo with quinonoid derivative structure zangeneh et al 2015 in summary the results demonstrate that the specially designed g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane is effective in degrading organic dye under simulated sunlight at strongly acidic or basic conditions where 100 removal can be achieved at 35 mins at ph 13 and 20 mins at ph 1 3 3 enhanced anti fouling and operation stability besides having enhanced degradation performance fig 4 g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane was demonstrated to have promising anti fouling i e self cleaning properties and structural stability over ten cycle operation at acidic condition fig 5 the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibits not only better anti fouling performance i e higher flux and flux recovery ratio but higher removal efficiency than β sic nano wire membrane 100 vs 93 figs 5a c for both membranes without artificial solar light irradiation water flux decreases with operation time due to membrane fouling in contrast under artificial solar light irradiation water flux increases with operation time due to the mitigated membrane fouling via photo catalytic degradation fig 5a even after ten cycle operation the flux recovery ratio was as high as 98 for g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane which is higher than that 89 for β sic nano wire membrane fig 5c interestingly the g c3n4 β sic membrane exhibits not only high permeance 110 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 but complete removal 100 outperforming existing both organic membranes and catalytic ceramic membranes for dye removal permeance 3 3 89 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 removal 90 1 100 fig 5d and table s1 ahmadi et al 2022 alventosa delara et al 2012 cheng et al 2022 han et al 2017 2019 liang et al 2019 ma et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 in particular the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibits higher removal rate and flux under light on condition than those under light off condition the unique structure of g c3n4 β sic nano wire catalytic membrane resulted in enhanced pollutant removal and mitigated membrane fouling fig 5e unlike conventional particle packing membrane structure the specially designed distinctive superporous network structure with flexible nano wires provided ultrafast mass transfer for not only water but mo organic substance accelerating the surface catalytic reaction between mo and g c3n4 sic catalysts at suitable residence time moreover the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane was fully demonstrated to have excellent crystalline phase and structure stability after ten cycle operation which can be clearly reflected by the negligible alterations in crystalline phase xrd patterns fig 5f membrane mass fig 5g1 fig s5 and table s2 pore size fig 5g 2 and table s2 and surface porosity fig 5g3 and table s2 and nano wire structure morphology tem sem images fig 5h specifically g c3n4 nano particles still remained to be uniformly decorated on the surface of β sic nano wires even after ten cycle operation 3 4 mechanistic insights into membrane self cleaning function xps was employed to not only confirm the formation of g c3n4 β sic heterojunction but probe carrier i e electron transfer mechanism fig 6 chang et al 2018 xia et al 2020 all the xps spectra have been calibrated with c1 peak at 284 8 ev as reference before analysis fig 6a chang et al 2018 compared with that 287 9 ev in pristine c3n4 the binding energy n cn2 of g c3n4 β sic heterogeneous membrane shifts to higher value 288 0 ev in darkness but to lower value 287 8 ev under illumination fig 6b which suggests that the c component of g c3n4 in the g c3n4 β sic membrane is an electron donor in the absence of illumination but electron acceptor under illumination a similar phenomenon occurs in the high resolution xps spectra of n element in fig 6c where the binding energies of both n c 3 and cnc bonds in the g c3n4 β sic membrane are higher than those in pristine g c3n4 without illumination but lower under illumination suggesting that not only c but n component i e g c3n4 in g c3n4 β sic membrane actually acts as an electron donor without illumination but electron acceptor with illumination moreover compared with those in pristine β sic nano wire the binding energies of both sio and sic bonds in g c3n4 β sic membrane shift to lower values without illumination but to higher values under illumination fig 6d this results indicate that without illumination electron transfers from g c3n4 to β sic nano wire confirming the formation of g c3n4 β sic heterojunction in the membrane in contrast under illumination the photo generated electrons could transfer in an opposite direction i e from β sic nano wire to g c3n4 forming a s scheme migration path will be discussed in fig 7 both electron paramagnetic resonance epr and active species trapping measurements were performed to probe the reactive species responsible for catalytic degradation reaction fig 7 compared with g c3n4 and β sic nano wire g c3n4 β sic membrane exhibits stronger signal of both dmpo oh and dmpo o2 radicals indicating the formation of more oh and o2 reactive species on its surface under visible light illumination fig 7a and 7b accordingly its possesses a strong oxidation ability i e photo catalytic activity which accelerates the oxidation and degradation behavior of mo superoxide radical o2 was experimentally confirmed to be major reactive species with both hydroxyl radical oh and holes h as minor species for both β sic and g c3n4 β sic membranes fig 7c and fig 7d unlike β sic more superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were trapped for g c3n4 β sic membrane system once again indicating its stronger catalytical degradation ability a schematic diagram clearly shows the catalytic mechanism model with heterojunction structure and radical formation pathway for g c3n4 β sic nano wire ceramic membrane fig 8 and fig s6 unlike separate g c3n4 and β sic nano wire i e without heterojunction formation fig 8a g c3n4 β sic membrane has a heterojunction structure with internal electric field generated even without illumination fig 8b in contrast under illumination photo generated electrons and holes were generated in the g c3n4 β sic heterojunction structure after harvesting energy from visible light then transferred along a s scheme pathway i e electrons from β sic to g c3n4 holes from g c3n4 to β sic with internal static electric field as driving force fig 8c such a transfer mechanism prohibited the recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs in the system enhancing the photo catalytic oxidation activity cao et al 2015 xu et al 2020 moreover photo generated electrons further reacted with surface adsorbed oxygen molecules to produce reactive abundant radicals o2 major and oh minor while holes reacted with oh or h2o species to generate minor radical oh fig 8d chang et al 2018 these generated radicals efficiently degraded mo molecules into co2 the toc in the permeate is zero indicating that there is no c element thus we can make a conclusion that mo converted into co2 and h2o to enhance self cleaning i e anti fouling function of the membrane by synergistic improving water flux and organic dye removal 4 conclusions in this work heterogeneous silicon carbide ceramic membranes were specially designed for enhanced anti fouling self cleaning performance via rational construction of g c3n4 decorated β sic nano wires onto robust ceramic substrates such membranes feature a special catalytic functional layer structure with average pore size of 80 nm and surface porosity of 56 1 the specially designed g c3n4 β sic nano wire membranes were demonstrated to be highly efficient in degrading organic substance under simulated sunlight at alkaline or especially acidic conditions where 100 removal can be achieved at 35 mins at ph 13 and 20 mins at ph 1 interestingly during multi cycle operation the g c3n4 β sic membrane exhibits self cleaning function with rapidly increased flux and removal as well as high flux recovery above 98 moreover they shows not only high water permeance 110 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 but complete removal 100 outperforming existing both polymer membranes and catalytic ceramic membranes permeance 3 3 89 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 removal 90 1 100 in addition the nano wires membranes were demonstrated to have excellent crystalline phase and structure stability after ten cycle operation a g c3n4 β sic heterojunction structure was confirmed to be formed resulting in the generation and transfer along a s scheme pathway i e prohibited recombination of photo generated electrons and holes which enhanced the photo catalytic oxidation activity superoxide radical o2 was experimentally confirmed to be major reactive species with both hydroxyl radical oh and holes h as minor species this work would provide new insights into not only rational design of next generation ceramic membranes with self cleaning function but also more applications of efficient treatment of refractory organic wastewaters in chemically harsh environments providing some scientific reference for other catalytic membrane filtration systems besides organic dye removal the efficient treatment of more organic substances in various real wastewaters is our following work besides the flat sheet configuration designed in our work tubular membranes could also be produced into larger dimensions for scalable application using commercial manufacturing techniques such as commercial extrusion process the catalysis enhanced separation strategy employed in this work not only is applicable to sic ceramic membranes but also can be extended to other more porous ceramic membranes which are still less concerned in the open

better mechanical thermal chemical and especially anti oxidation resistances ayral et al 2019 li et al 2020 riaz et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 they could even enable the efficient treatment of industrial effluents with high fouling propensity and harsh chemical solutions acidic or alkaline environment li et al 2020 to overcome the challenging issue of nano catalyst recovery some researchers immobilize their catalysts onto ceramic membranes to achieve simultaneous separation and catalytical removal of refractory organic contaminants berger et al 2020 gao et al 2020 hodges et al 2018 iglesias et al 2016 shi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however besides insufficient removal current membranes still suffer from low water permeability due to their inherent unfavorable particle packing membrane structure with low porosity and high transport resistance fraga et al 2017 hotza et al 2020 it is highly desired to rationally design novel separation membrane featuring anti fouling even self cleaning high water permeability and sufficient contaminant removal rate nunes et al 2020 moreover it still remains unclear about the role of true active radicals responsible for catalytic function and their formation mechanism and molecule level transfer path for specific catalytic filtration system sic is recognized as one of the most promising third generation semiconductor photo catalysts with a suitable band gap 2 3 3 3 ev fan et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 and excellent properties such as high chemical mechanical thermal stability enabling harsh environment applications chen et al 2022 eray et al 2020 hotza et al 2020 xu et al 2020 specifically besides having common robustness nature sic with a nano wire structure is a more promising catalyst because of its high specific surface area and aspect ratio which could enhance not only light absorption but also charge transfer chen et al 2019 fan et al 2006 wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2006 moreover sic nanowire network structure has a great potential as a key component of high performance functional ceramic membranes for water treatment as a metal free photocatalyst carbon nitride g c3n4 has been attracting considerable attention for pollutant degradation and hydrogen production because of its high abundance excellent chemical stability and intrinsic visible light response asadzadeh khaneghah et al 2020 li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2022c zhao et al 2016 2021 decoration of g c3n4 onto β sic nano wire is expected to further enhance catalytic performance through kinetically facilitating carrier transfer and separation asadzadeh khaneghah et al 2020 ong et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 unlike common suspended photocatalysts rationally designed catalytic membranes can overcome their inherent limitations such as catalyst recovery via incorporating catalysts into membrane structures therefore it is reasonable to design g c3n4 sic catalytic membranes to enable not only high flux water transport but also highly efficient pollutant catalytic degradation in this work unlike conventional particle packing structure we propose a strategy for rationally designing a novel robust nano wire membrane structure enabling self cleaning function ultrahigh water permeance and complete contaminant removal nano c3n4 was decorated onto β sic nano wires with abundant active sites that were first in situ grown onto macro porous α sic ceramic substrates to design a catalytically active separation layer featuring a heterojunction structure high porosity and low transport resistance fig 1 the performance and stability were evaluated under various conditions the membranes were demonstrated to not only exhibit ultra high water flux and complete contaminant removal but also promising operation stability in chemical harsh environments we provide mechanistic insights into the formation and molecule level transfer path of active radicals responsible for catalytic function this work aims to solve the challenges of membrane fouling insufficient flux and removal via designing a simultaneous catalysis separation integrated filtration system enabling the efficient treatment of refractory organic wastewaters using next generation ceramic membranes 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals the α sic substrates pore size 8 μm porosity 46 calcination temperature

the carrier and diluent gas which transferred ch3sicl3 through a bubbler to the reactor while the flow rate of h2 gas was 20 ml min 1 during growth the furnace was operated at 900 950 c for 2 h then g c3n4 nanoparticles were deposited onto β sic nano wires to construct the g c3n4 β sic nano wire heterogeneous membranes via an in situ solvent evaporation method fig s1 specially the g c3n4 powders average size 0 5 μm were first prepared by urea pyrolysis method then they were heated to 600 c for 2 h in a reactor containing β sic nano wire membranes at an elevated temperature rate of 10 c min 1 to allow a sublimation deposition process fig s1 after 2 h dwelling time the reactor was cooled down to room temperature naturally finally nano sized two dimension g c3n4 particles were uniformly decorated onto the out surface of β sic nano wires 2 3 catalytic activity and separation performance evaluation the catalytic activity and separation performance of the nano wire membranes were evaluated in a dead end flow filtration system fig s1 a 500 w xe lamp beijing perfectlight technology co ltd china was applied to simulate solar light source the membranes were installed in the highly transparent quartz photo catalytic reactor where a stainless steel mesh was fixed beneath the membranes as a support the photo catalytic activity was first investigated by submerging the membranes into 5 mg l 1 aqueous mo solution the total volume of mo solution in each test was 200 ml unless specified the corresponding apparent rate constant k can be deduced by using the following equation 1 ln c 0 c k t where c 0 and c mg l 1 are the concentrations of mo at the illumination time t of t 0 s and t s the effect of ph on the catalytic degradation of mo was characterized by adjusting the solution ph 1 0 and ph 13 0 by adding hcl or naoh and the mo concentration was recorded every 5 mins for 65 mins prior to each test the system was operated in the dark environment i e light off for 15 mins until an adsorption desorption equilibrium between membrane and mo was achieved each cycle was comprised of a 15 min dark stage and a 50 min photo catalytic degradation stage for decades the gold standard of uv photocatalysts is p25 commercial tio2 powder with anatase and rutile mixed phase hodges et al 2018 for comparison the degradation performance was also carried out for p25 deposited membranes that were fabricated via dip coating and sintering method the details can be found in the si the effective membrane area was 1 0 10 4 m2 while all the tests were carried out at a constant

respectively analysis using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan gave the carbon content in the permeate 2 4 active species capture experiments for identifying active species the capture reagents such as 2 propanol ipa benzoquinone bq and triethanolamine teoa were added into the reaction mixture to capture active species such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 or produced holes h respectively chang et al 2018 the procedure was similar to the photo catalytic activity test except that the capture reagent was added with a concentration of 0 5 mmol 2 5 characterization the microstructure and morphology of the membranes were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachis 4800 japan equipped with energy dispersive x ray

tension coefficient of the liquid θ is the contact angle of the liquid on the pore wall and δ p is the applied pressure difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and properties of sic nano wire ceramic membranes conventional ceramic membranes have a multilayered structure with particle packing morphology unlike them in this work a heterogeneous two layer membrane structure was specially designed with macroporous α sic flat sheet ceramic as substrate and with c3n4 β sic nano wire network as catalytically functionalized separation layer fig 2 a highly porous network layer of β sic nano wires was in situ grown onto the black sic ceramic substrate fig 2a in hydrogen atmosphere via ch3sicl3 decomposition during pecvd process eq 5 the growth of β sic nano wires preferentially occurred along their 111 crystal plane javid et al 2021 where increasing reaction temperature from 900 c to 950 c significantly facilitated the growth of more β sic nano wires by efficiently overcoming the activation energy barrier figs 2b and 2c at 950 c such a highly porous β sic nano wire network layer was formed in a random oriented way with promising surface hydrophilicity water contact angle 6 5 c h 3 sic l 3 g h 2 g β sic nano wire s 3 hcl g h 2 g to further enhance photocatalytical ability nano sized two dimension g c3n4 particles 2 5 nm were uniformly decorated onto the out surface of β sic nano wires fig 2f with a mass ratio of g c3n4 to sic is 5 6 via a sublimation deposition process at 600 c in air which could be observed by a membrane color change into yellow like fig 2d even after decoration of nano g c3n4 g c3n4 β sic nano wire layer 8 μm thickness fig 2e not only still maintained a highly porous network structure and sufficient surface hydrophilicity water contact angle 10 but exhibited enhanced photocatalytic ability anchoring of highly dispersive nano g c3n4 onto β sic nano wires was clearly observed by hrtem in fig 2f forming a heterogeneous structure with more active sites for photocatalytical application a spacing of 0 25 nm between adjacent lattice fringes can be ascribed to the d spacing of 111 planes in the β sic crystal suggesting that the growth direction is 111 kao et al 2019 while a spacing of 0 325 nm corresponds to the 002 plane of g c3n4 du et al 2019 the sharp bright spots in the saed patterns fig 2f indicate that the β sic nano wire and the nano g c3n4 have single crystalline structures in addition c n and si elements were detected for g c3n4 β sic nano wire layer fig 2g unlike conventional multi cycle fabrication methods i e coating sintering fraga et al 2017 the in situ growth protocol via pecvd proposed in this work features one step production of small pore ceramic microfiltration membrane 0 12 μm onto macroporous α sic substrate 8 μm without introducing any inter layers fig 3 a in addition anchoring of nano g c3n4 via a sublimation deposition process slightly decreased pore size from 0 12 μm to 0 08 μm fig 3a the surface porosities of β sic and g c3n4 β sic nano wire layers were quantified to be 60 3 and 56 1 by processing sem images using image j software which is higher than not only that 32 8 of α sic substrate fig 3b and fig s2 but these 30 dong et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 of other reported ceramic membrane this results once again indicate that such a nano wire membrane structure has higher porosity i e lower transport resistance than conventional particle packing membrane structure besides α sic phase jcpds 73 1663 both β sic jcpds 73 1665 and g c3n4 phases jcpds 87 1526 were clearly identified for g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane by xrd fig 3c moreover the structure of both g c3n4 and β sic was characterized by their typical peaks in the raman fig 3d especially the presence of raman peaks at 796 cm 1 and 972 cm 1 could ascribed to the modes of transverse optical and longitudinal optical phonons of β sic respectively while three peaks at 1235 cm 1 1558 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 correspond to g c3n4 in order to validate the enhanced light response properties for photo catalytic applications the membranes were further characterized by uv vis drs fig 3e and photoluminescence pl spectroscopy fig 3f compared with β sic nano wire membrane and g c3n4 particle g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibited an absorption edge of more shifting to visible light region with a wider absorption range and higher intensity indicating an enhancement of visible light absorption and better photo catalytic activity fig 3e the heterojunction formed between g c3n4 nanoparticle and β sic nanowires make the band gap becomes narrower and absorption edge red shift moreover the lowered pl intensity of g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane indicates the better separation performance i e more inhibited recombination of electron hole pairs which is beneficial to enhance photo catalytic performance fig 3f chang et al 2018 3 2 enhanced catalytic performance at harsh conditions compared with organic membranes more robust ceramic membranes such as sic membrane have better stability in chemically harsh environments moreover at acidic or alkaline conditions the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibits enhanced photo catalysis removal performance for organic dyes mo fig 4 outperforming the moderate performance under neutral condition fig s3 especially at alkaline condition ph 13 it has better photo catalysis performance i e higher removal rapidly complete degradation within 35 mins fig 4a and fig s3 and higher apparent degradation rate constant fig 4b than β sic nano wire membrane g c3n4 membrane and p25 tio2 ceramic membrane the latter shows incomplete removal efficiency i e 95 even under prolonged time 90 mins interestingly at acidic condition ph 1 faster complete degradation could be observed within 20 mins with higher apparent rate constant which follows pseudo first order kinetics k 0 21 min 1 for the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane fig 4c fig 4d and fig s4 the better performance at acidic condition than that at alkaline condition can be ascribed to the enhanced adsorption via stronger electrostatic attraction si between the positively charged catalytic membrane surface phpzc 2 8 and negatively charged mo anions as well as the easier degradation of mo with quinonoid derivative structure zangeneh et al 2015 in summary the results demonstrate that the specially designed g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane is effective in degrading organic dye under simulated sunlight at strongly acidic or basic conditions where 100 removal can be achieved at 35 mins at ph 13 and 20 mins at ph 1 3 3 enhanced anti fouling and operation stability besides having enhanced degradation performance fig 4 g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane was demonstrated to have promising anti fouling i e self cleaning properties and structural stability over ten cycle operation at acidic condition fig 5 the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibits not only better anti fouling performance i e higher flux and flux recovery ratio but higher removal efficiency than β sic nano wire membrane 100 vs 93 figs 5a c for both membranes without artificial solar light irradiation water flux decreases with operation time due to membrane fouling in contrast under artificial solar light irradiation water flux increases with operation time due to the mitigated membrane fouling via photo catalytic degradation fig 5a even after ten cycle operation the flux recovery ratio was as high as 98 for g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane which is higher than that 89 for β sic nano wire membrane fig 5c interestingly the g c3n4 β sic membrane exhibits not only high permeance 110 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 but complete removal 100 outperforming existing both organic membranes and catalytic ceramic membranes for dye removal permeance 3 3 89 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 removal 90 1 100 fig 5d and table s1 ahmadi et al 2022 alventosa delara et al 2012 cheng et al 2022 han et al 2017 2019 liang et al 2019 ma et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 in particular the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane exhibits higher removal rate and flux under light on condition than those under light off condition the unique structure of g c3n4 β sic nano wire catalytic membrane resulted in enhanced pollutant removal and mitigated membrane fouling fig 5e unlike conventional particle packing membrane structure the specially designed distinctive superporous network structure with flexible nano wires provided ultrafast mass transfer for not only water but mo organic substance accelerating the surface catalytic reaction between mo and g c3n4 sic catalysts at suitable residence time moreover the g c3n4 β sic nano wire membrane was fully demonstrated to have excellent crystalline phase and structure stability after ten cycle operation which can be clearly reflected by the negligible alterations in crystalline phase xrd patterns fig 5f membrane mass fig 5g1 fig s5 and table s2 pore size fig 5g 2 and table s2 and surface porosity fig 5g3 and table s2 and nano wire structure morphology tem sem images fig 5h specifically g c3n4 nano particles still remained to be uniformly decorated on the surface of β sic nano wires even after ten cycle operation 3 4 mechanistic insights into membrane self cleaning function xps was employed to not only confirm the formation of g c3n4 β sic heterojunction but probe carrier i e electron transfer mechanism fig 6 chang et al 2018 xia et al 2020 all the xps spectra have been calibrated with c1 peak at 284 8 ev as reference before analysis fig 6a chang et al 2018 compared with that 287 9 ev in pristine c3n4 the binding energy n cn2 of g c3n4 β sic heterogeneous membrane shifts to higher value 288 0 ev in darkness but to lower value 287 8 ev under illumination fig 6b which suggests that the c component of g c3n4 in the g c3n4 β sic membrane is an electron donor in the absence of illumination but electron acceptor under illumination a similar phenomenon occurs in the high resolution xps spectra of n element in fig 6c where the binding energies of both n c 3 and cnc bonds in the g c3n4 β sic membrane are higher than those in pristine g c3n4 without illumination but lower under illumination suggesting that not only c but n component i e g c3n4 in g c3n4 β sic membrane actually acts as an electron donor without illumination but electron acceptor with illumination moreover compared with those in pristine β sic nano wire the binding energies of both sio and sic bonds in g c3n4 β sic membrane shift to lower values without illumination but to higher values under illumination fig 6d this results indicate that without illumination electron transfers from g c3n4 to β sic nano wire confirming the formation of g c3n4 β sic heterojunction in the membrane in contrast under illumination the photo generated electrons could transfer in an opposite direction i e from β sic nano wire to g c3n4 forming a s scheme migration path will be discussed in fig 7 both electron paramagnetic resonance epr and active species trapping measurements were performed to probe the reactive species responsible for catalytic degradation reaction fig 7 compared with g c3n4 and β sic nano wire g c3n4 β sic membrane exhibits stronger signal of both dmpo oh and dmpo o2 radicals indicating the formation of more oh and o2 reactive species on its surface under visible light illumination fig 7a and 7b accordingly its possesses a strong oxidation ability i e photo catalytic activity which accelerates the oxidation and degradation behavior of mo superoxide radical o2 was experimentally confirmed to be major reactive species with both hydroxyl radical oh and holes h as minor species for both β sic and g c3n4 β sic membranes fig 7c and fig 7d unlike β sic more superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were trapped for g c3n4 β sic membrane system once again indicating its stronger catalytical degradation ability a schematic diagram clearly shows the catalytic mechanism model with heterojunction structure and radical formation pathway for g c3n4 β sic nano wire ceramic membrane fig 8 and fig s6 unlike separate g c3n4 and β sic nano wire i e without heterojunction formation fig 8a g c3n4 β sic membrane has a heterojunction structure with internal electric field generated even without illumination fig 8b in contrast under illumination photo generated electrons and holes were generated in the g c3n4 β sic heterojunction structure after harvesting energy from visible light then transferred along a s scheme pathway i e electrons from β sic to g c3n4 holes from g c3n4 to β sic with internal static electric field as driving force fig 8c such a transfer mechanism prohibited the recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs in the system enhancing the photo catalytic oxidation activity cao et al 2015 xu et al 2020 moreover photo generated electrons further reacted with surface adsorbed oxygen molecules to produce reactive abundant radicals o2 major and oh minor while holes reacted with oh or h2o species to generate minor radical oh fig 8d chang et al 2018 these generated radicals efficiently degraded mo molecules into co2 the toc in the permeate is zero indicating that there is no c element thus we can make a conclusion that mo converted into co2 and h2o to enhance self cleaning i e anti fouling function of the membrane by synergistic improving water flux and organic dye removal 4 conclusions in this work heterogeneous silicon carbide ceramic membranes were specially designed for enhanced anti fouling self cleaning performance via rational construction of g c3n4 decorated β sic nano wires onto robust ceramic substrates such membranes feature a special catalytic functional layer structure with average pore size of 80 nm and surface porosity of 56 1 the specially designed g c3n4 β sic nano wire membranes were demonstrated to be highly efficient in degrading organic substance under simulated sunlight at alkaline or especially acidic conditions where 100 removal can be achieved at 35 mins at ph 13 and 20 mins at ph 1 interestingly during multi cycle operation the g c3n4 β sic membrane exhibits self cleaning function with rapidly increased flux and removal as well as high flux recovery above 98 moreover they shows not only high water permeance 110 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 but complete removal 100 outperforming existing both polymer membranes and catalytic ceramic membranes permeance 3 3 89 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 removal 90 1 100 in addition the nano wires membranes were demonstrated to have excellent crystalline phase and structure stability after ten cycle operation a g c3n4 β sic heterojunction structure was confirmed to be formed resulting in the generation and transfer along a s scheme pathway i e prohibited recombination of photo generated electrons and holes which enhanced the photo catalytic oxidation activity superoxide radical o2 was experimentally confirmed to be major reactive species with both hydroxyl radical oh and holes h as minor species this work would provide new insights into not only rational design of next generation ceramic membranes with self cleaning function but also more applications of efficient treatment of refractory organic wastewaters in chemically harsh environments providing some scientific reference for other catalytic membrane filtration systems besides organic dye removal the efficient treatment of more organic substances in various real wastewaters is our following work besides the flat sheet configuration designed in our work tubular membranes could also be produced into larger dimensions for scalable application using commercial manufacturing techniques such as commercial extrusion process the catalysis enhanced separation strategy employed in this work not only is applicable to sic ceramic membranes but also can be extended to other more porous ceramic membranes which are still less concerned in the open

15337,groundwater level gwl recovery in some semiarid regions attributed to mitigation countermeasures for groundwater depletion potentially causes nitrate accumulated in the vadose zone to be introduced into the aquifer however the extent to which gwl recovery affects interactions between the vadose zone and saturated aquifers migration pathways of soil nitrogen and groundwater nitrate dynamics have not been explicitly determined this study established a quasi 3d feedback model for the vadose zone groundwater coupled system in a typical gwl recovery area and quantitatively evaluated the effects of gwl recovery on nitrate n leaching fluxes via the vadose zone and groundwater nitrate n dynamics within the framework of the integrated model both the water contaminant leaching fluxes and the depth to groundwater were exchanged at each flow time step the obtained results reveal that the temporal changes in nitrate n leaching fluxes depended on the behaviors of precipitation farmland irrigation and lithology of the vadose zone while its spatial patterns were determined by both the gwl undulation and the vertical profiles of nitrate n content furthermore the gwl recovery caused the magnitude of the nitrate n leaching fluxes into the aquifer to increase by 44 4 along with the gwl recovery the phreatic aquifer volume increased by 7 47 and the nitrate n mass herein increased by 40 06 which was largely driven by the nitrate n leaching flux consequently the average groundwater nitrate n concentration in the gwl recovery region increased by approximately 2 4 mg l apart from the artificial recharge route this finding suggests that the intensified leaching of soil contaminants given the circumstances of gwl recovery has a negative effect on groundwater quality an appropriate groundwater management scheme is therefore urgently required to achieve an optimal balance between gwl recovery and groundwater environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater level recovery vadose zone groundwater coupled system nitrate leaching flux groundwater nitrate nitrate accumulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater overexploitation due to dramatically increasing water demands along with exponential population growth dietary changes and climate extremes has been largely reported in semiarid regions globally over past decades gleeson et al 2012 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 to mitigate or address these relevant issues of groundwater depletion various approaches have been vigorously adopted such as conveying surficial waters from more humid regions to arid ones zhao et al 2017 roose and starks 2006 developing alternative water resources schiermeier 2008 reducing groundwater abstraction butler et al 2020 and promoting water conservation technology deines et al 2019 as a result groundwater storage in some large depleted aquifers has exhibited a recovery trend in recent years famiglietti and ferguson 2021 zhang et al 2021 for instance the groundwater storage in the north china plain ncp jointly influenced by the south to north water diversion project central route snwdp cr and decreasing or prohibiting pumpage was converted from depletion 2 2 km3 year from 2005 to 2014 to partial recovery 0 3 km3 year from 2015 to 2018 zhang et al 2020 a the snwdp cr was implemented to transfer water from the danjiangkou reservoir in the yangtze river basin to the ncp from december 2014 therein a recovery of 9 0 m of the groundwater level gwl adjacent to the huairou wellfields in the beijing plain bp within the ncp was observed from 2014 to 2017 long et al 2020 moreover the contributions of water diversion climate variability and water saving policies to groundwater storage recovery in the bp from 2006 to 2018 achieved 40 30 and 30 respectively long et al 2020 gwl recovery is expected to alter the spatial patterns of soil water content redox temperature ph etc along the vadose zone these changes in the soil environment ultimately affect the pivotal processes of soil hydrology shen et al 2015 di et al 2019 and soil nitrogen n cycle breuer et al 2002 akbariyeh et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 b n sources derived from anthropogenic and natural factors are generally leached from the surface soil in the form of nitrate leached nitrate attributed to its persistent nature and slow hydrologic transport mcmahon et al 2006 van meter et al 2016 is transported downward and massively accumulated in the deep vadose zone the nitrate n storage in the vadose zone has been reported to exceed 4000 kg ha in some regions of north america china and europe ascott et al 2017 and the amount has reached 6300 kg ha in the ncp where both the thick vadose zone and intensive agricultural cultivation prevail liu et al 2022 under this circumstance gwl recovery could shorten the transport path of nitrate from the surface source to the aquifer and cause more nitrate to leach from the vadose zone into groundwater min et al 2021 basu et al 2022 therefore it is fairly essential to elaborate the effects of gwl recovery on both the nitrate n leaching flux through the vadose zone as well as the groundwater nitrate n dynamics especially for the regions of massive nitrate accumulation in the vadose zone however to the best of our knowledge it is not explicit by far whether the interactions between the vadose zone and saturated aquifers are affected and how the nitrate n leaching fluxes from the vadose zone and the groundwater nitrate dynamics change in response to the gwl recovery to elaborate the complicated processes inherent to the interactions between the vadose zone and saturated aquifers in the gwl recovery region the integrated model combining these two zones is a more attractive solution to date numerous numerical models which describe water movement and the fate and transport of contaminants in the coupled vadose zone and groundwater system have been established with various degrees of complexity and dimensionality ragab and bromley 2010 brunner and simmons 2012 beegum et al 2019 in the context of soil water flow and groundwater flow usually being integrated into a whole system various numerical schemes have been developed to solve the 3d richards equation weill et al 2009 although physically consistent and numerically rigorous these schemes seem to be computationally expensive and numerically unstable the reason is that these solutions are highly nonlinear and greatly sensitive to meteorological factors soil texture and human activities especially for large scale regional problems shen and phanikumar 2010 zha et al 2013 to address this computational challenge the simplification that water movement and solute transport in the vadose zone are treated as 1d vertical processes has been introduced which greatly reduces the computational complexity and improves model stability seo et al 2007 kuznetsov et al 2012 mao et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 that is a quasi 3d integrated scheme containing a 1d vadose zone model and a 3d groundwater model is more applicable to the large regional scale problem for instance the hydrus1d package for modflow which simultaneously evaluates the transient water flow in the saturated unsaturated zone was developed by seo et al 2007 then this integrated scheme was improved in terms of unrealistic sudden inflow and outflow fluxes and was linked with mt3dms beegum et al 2019 furthermore the effectiveness of this coupling scheme in elaborating subsurface hydrology and contaminant transportation processes in saturated unsaturated zones was examined at the regional scale twarakavi et al 2008 beegum et al 2019 therefore in this study the quasi 3d feedback integrated model accomplished by hydrus 1d modflow and mt3dms was established in a typical gwl area the upper and middle parts of the chaobai river alluvial fan craf in the bp within the ncp the gwl herein attributed to the snwdp cr exhibits an apparent recovery trend in recent years furthermore within the integrated frame the interactions between the saturated and unsaturated zones were accomplished through the exchange of information on the water nitrate n flux and the depth to groundwater at each flow time step hereafter the effects of gwl recovery on both the soil nitrate n leaching flux and the groundwater nitrate n dynamics were intuitively evaluated through multiple scenario analysis the results of this study can provide conducive information for future groundwater management in the gwl recovery region while simultaneously considering both the extent of gwl recovery and the evolution of groundwater quality 2 study area the study area 116 40 117 00 e 40 10 40 30 n including the plain area of miyun district huairou district and shunyi district is located in northeastern beijing city and covers a total area of approximately 1362 5 km2 fig 1 a the region experiences a semihumid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration reach approximately 624 8 mm more than 80 occurs from june to september annually 11 7 c and 1800 mm respectively the quaternary sedimentary system in the study area appears highly spatially heterogeneous namely the thickness notably ranges from tens to hundreds of meters from the piedmont to the floodplain the grain size transitions from coarse to fine particles along the north south direction and the aquifer structure ranges from a single sandy gravel layer in the upper craf to 2 3 layers or multiple layers in the middle craf consistent with the terrain slope groundwater generally flows from northeast to southwest and then turns toward the south parallel to the long axis of the basin given long term groundwater overexploitation however the gwl across the entire region continuously declined at an average rate of 0 5 m year before the operation of the snwdp cr zhai et al 2013 consequently there generated a regional piezometric depression cone around the large groundwater wellfields subsequently the delivered water from the snwdp cr in addition to partly compensating for environmental flow and reservoir replenishment was further applied to replace domestic and industrial water consumption originally supplied by groundwater pumping and to recharge the aquifer system along the easily infiltrated river channel including the chaobai yanqi and shahe rivers in the upper part of the craf fig 1 a fig 1 b plots the groundwater pumping level in the three large wellfields and the recharge amount into the aquifer in each year after the snwdp cr operation initiation these yearly data were collected from the beijing water authority http swj beijing gov cn as a result the gwl adjacent to the wellfields and along the recharge route was expected to increase and an increase of 30 0 m was achieved by december 2019 at obs c fig 1 b additionally as shown in fig 1 a and c arable land constitutes the largest land use type of the study area and the ratio ranged from 73 1 to 50 1 from 1980 to 2020 followed by rural settlement and urban land whose ratios ranged from 13 4 to 24 9 and from 1 4 to 6 9 respectively from 1980 to 2020 it can therefore be speculated that the excessive and perennial release of nitrogen fertilizers manure and domestic sewage into the environment play a crucial role in the groundwater nitrate n dynamics in the study area note that the land use type data with a 30 m spatial resolution considered in this study were acquired from the resource and environment data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn 3 materials and methods 3 1 integrated modeling framework in this study a quasi 3d feedback integrated scheme combining the 1d vadose zone and 3d saturated aquifer was adopted to accurately capture the complex interactions between them at the regional scale seo et al 2007 beegum et al 2019 considering the spatial complexity of multiple environmental factors in the domain surface the study area according to the distribution features of relevant primary factors is first partitioned into several subzones along the horizontal direction to describe the spatial complexity of 1d vadose zone processes each subzone is assumed to be homogeneous and locally consistent internally the recharge across the bottom of the vadose zone for each subzone which is calculated by hydrus 1d is treated as the upper boundary of the groundwater model which is executed by modflow and mt3dms procedures it is expected that the discrete grids of the groundwater model beneath the same subzone receive the same recharge amount hereafter the updated gwl calculated by modflow is assigned as the bottom boundary of the corresponding soil profile and the average value is adopted if the soil profile is associated with more than one grid hence the soil profile for each subzone should be designed to extend from the surface to a certain depth below the deepest gwl possible during the entire simulation period to rationalize the bottom boundary of soil profile fig 2 demonstrates the flowchart of the integration of hydrus1d into modflow and coupling to mt3dms as a subroutine the abovementioned feedback processes are repeated at each flow time step during the whole integrated computational procedure note that given the considerably small time step in the hydrus1d model due to the highly nonlinear richards equation the time average recharge flux calculated by hydrus1d is applied to modflow and mt3dms at an arbitrary flow time step during the stress period 3 2 subzone partition as shown in fig 3 six primary factors including surface elevation shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a 30 m spatial resolution land use type lithology distribution above the gwl divided thiessen polygons based on meteorological station location township boundary and depth to groundwater were chosen for subzone partitioning of the quasi 3d integrated model in this study note that data on nitrogen sources along the ground surface were collected in terms of township thus the factor of township boundary was also selected considering the implement time of snwdp cr the investigation period in this study was specified as ranging from january 2011 to december 2019 which covers the periods before and after gwl recovery the temporal variation of the land use type is considerably sluggish and the spatial patterns of gwl is similar for different years apart from the region where mitigation countermeasures were carried out thus the land use type in 2015 and the gwl in january 2011 were adopted in the subzone partition mentioned above in addition the spatial distribution of the lithological structure in the vadose zone was obtained in accordance with historically available well logging information as acquired from the institute of china geological environment monitoring http www cigem cgs gov cn five soil textures including clay silt loam sandy loam sand and gravel were generalized and defined as a result the study area was partitioned into 89 subzones along the horizontal direction fig 3 g the detailed settings of the vadose zone model and groundwater model are provided in texts s1 and s2 respectively of the supporting information 3 3 design of the simulated scenarios to intuitively examine the effects of gwl recovery on the nitrate n leaching flux and the groundwater nitrate dynamics both scenarios with and without mitigation countermeasures were simulated by the quasi 3d integrated model and the deviation between these two scenarios was then analyzed specifically for the scenario with mitigation countermeasures hereinafter referred to as sce div the groundwater abstraction and artificial recharge from 2011 to 2019 were assigned as shown in fig 1b which actually occurred and other conditions retained unchanged for the scenario without mitigation countermeasures hereinafter referred to as sce nodiv the utilization and allocation of water resources retained unchanged as that prior to the snwdp cr operation the groundwater pumping amount of the three large wellfields during each month from 2015 to 2019 was set to match that in 2014 and the artificial recharge was removed and other conditions also retained unchanged 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy verification of the simulated results given the limited data with respect to soil moisture and soil nitrate n content in the study area only measured data of the hydraulic head and nitrate n concentration in the aquifer were employed to examine the accuracy and rationality of the established integrated model changes in both the groundwater flow and nitrate n concentration fields partially depend on soil hydrology and n cycle processes in the vadose zone thus they can be adopted to account for various processes and interactions in and between the vadose zone and the saturated aquifer to a certain extent the field monitoring data of groundwater level and groundwater nitrate n concentration are available from the beijing water authority http swj beijing gov cn the beijing institute of hydrogeology and engineering geology http www bjswd com cn index html and the beijing municipal ecology and environment bureau http sthjj beijing gov cn fig s1 compares the simulated and measured results in the phreatic aquifer note that the nitrate n concentration in the deeper semiconfined aquifers is substantially lower than 0 1 mg l so the variables in the two semiconfined aquifers were not investigated in this study as can be clearly observed the gradient direction and the magnitude of the hydraulic head as well as the spatial pattern of the nitrate n concentration in the phreatic aquifer obtained with the coupled model show substantial agreement with those captured through field monitoring from the perspective of the scatter points of the simulated and measured gwl including 6328 data points and groundwater nitrate n concentration including 404 data points from 2011 2019 in the phreatic aquifer most data scatter points are positioned near the 1 1 line with coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 72 and 0 73 respectively therefore the established quasi 3d integrated model in this study can interpret the pivotal processes that control water movement and the fate and transport of nitrate n in the coupled vadose zone groundwater system and can describe the interactions between these two zones the best fitted parameters applied in the integrated model are listed in table s1 the denitrification process for the different soil textures in the vadose zone of the southern region occurred more intensely due to the distributions of the lithological structure and the corresponding rates are noted in parentheses the exhaustive subareas and corresponding values for some relevant parameters are not presented due to space limitations in this study 4 2 effects on nitrate n dynamics in the vadose zone 4 2 1 nitrate n storage the difference in the phreatic level in dec 2019 between sce div and sce nodiv is plotted in fig 4 a affected by the snwdp cr the gwl adjacent to the region where the mitigation countermeasures were carried out increases to varying degrees compared to sce nodiv this fact demonstrates the effectiveness of the adopted measures in recovering the gwl in this study area which is consistent with other studies zhang et al 2020 a zhao et al 2021 simultaneously along with the gwl recovery as shown in fig 4 b the amount of nitrate n accumulated in the vadose zone in dec 2019 exhibits a decreasing trend compared to sce nodiv the relatively great decrease is largely distributed in subzones 46 48 49 53 57 59 and 62 with the decrease ranging from 800 to 2012 kg ha to inspect the temporal changes in the nitrate n content along the vadose zone during the entire investigation period subzone 57 was selected as an example subzone 57 is located in the upper part of the craf with a representative lithology structure in the vadose zone and a land use type of arable land figs 3 and 5 a and the difference in the average gwl in dec 2019 between sce div and sce nodiv reaches 8 m fig 4 a so it will be more suitable to elaborate the effects of the stored soil nitrate n on the groundwater nitrate n dynamics along the gwl recovery as presented in fig 5 b the intra annual fluctuations of the nitrate n concentration along the vadose zone mostly occur within the silt loam layer which can be attributed to the interactions between the flushing process of infiltrated water and the nitrogen source import conversely in fig 5 c the nitrate n concentration fronts within the underlying gravel layer are observed to continually transport downward over years with an average rate of 2 1 m y furthermore the concentration fronts did not reach the ascending gwl from 2011 to 2019 more importantly the vertical profile of nitrate n content at different times for sce div and sce nodiv seemed to be basically consistent this can be attributed to the fact that the gwl for subzone 57 is considerably deep on the whole and the effect of its variations on the distributions of nitrate n content along the vadose zone is fairly small therefore combined with the results in fig 4b the decrease in the nitrate n content within the vadose zone can be mainly attributed to the fact that nitrate n originally stored in the gwl vertical ascent zone along with the gwl recovery is gradually introduced into the aquifer 4 2 2 nitrate n flux into the aquifer fig 4 c compares the mean annual nitrate n fluxes across the transient bottom of the vadose zone from 2011 to 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv as expected the nitrate n leaching flux for sce div increases to varying degrees compared to sce nodiv the relatively great increases are mostly in subzones 46 48 49 52 53 57 59 62 64 and 66 with the increase ranging from 80 400 kg ha year likewise taking subzone 57 as an example the changes in the water flux and nitrate n flux with time for this subzone for sce div and sce nodiv are shown in fig 5 d e note that a positive flux indicates a downward water nitrate n flux across the bottom of the vadose zone the same below similar to the gwl the water nitrate n flux for the two scenarios deviate from each other after the implementation of mitigation countermeasures however the deviations in the nitrate n flux between sce div and sce nodiv are significantly different from those in the water flux the reason for this phenomenon is that the nitrate n flux into the aquifer driven by the actions of convection and hydrodynamic dispersion is determined by the water flux and the nitrate n concentration at the transient bottom of the vadose zone whereas the nitrate n concentration at the bottom of the vadose zone is relevant to both the distribution characteristics of the vertical concentration profile and the gwl undulation hence as the gwl recover the nitrate n concentration at the transient bottom of the vadose zone varies accordingly consequently causing a fairly great deviation in the nitrate n flux between the two scenarios fig 5 d e that is the temporal changes in the nitrate n flux through the vadose zone are closely associated with gwl recovery as shown in fig s2 for the subzones where the gwl exhibits an obvious upward trend such as subzones 24 30 33 38 43 46 53 and 59 the nitrate n flux into groundwater is also markedly altered by the implementation of mitigation countermeasures and this effect varies for different subzones in addition the temporal changes in the water nitrate n fluxes within a year seem not to be totally identified with the seasonal variations in water input precipitation and irrigation this is a result of the vertical complexity of the lithology structure within the vadose zone the permeability varies widely among various types of soils such as silt clay loam and sand which affects water movement and contaminants relocation underneath the ground surface vks et al 2020 from the perspective of the whole study area as shown in fig 6 the water nitrate n flux across the bottom of the vadose zone remains almost downward during the whole simulation period indicating a continuous import of water nitrate n into groundwater through the vadose zone in the study area however by comparing the two scenarios the average nitrate n flux for sce div appears to be greater than that for sce nodiv by 44 4 this result suggests that for the whole study area the gwl recovery caused by mitigation countermeasures can greatly enhance the nitrate n leaching flux and motivate more soil nitrogen to be introduced into the aquifer 4 3 effects on nitrate n dynamics in the phreatic aquifer 4 3 1 volume of the phreatic aquifer fig 7 a c compares the phreatic aquifer volume at different years for sce div and sce nodiv along with the gwl recovery the phreatic aquifer volume in the northern region for sce div increases compared to sce nodiv the range of difference bounded by the line of 0 5 m3 m2 the red line in fig 7 this region is defined as the gwl recovery area below varies from 141 8 km2 in 2015 to 547 1 km2 in 2019 as shown in fig 8 a the phreatic aquifer volume within the gwl recovery area increases from 13 22 km3 in 2011 to 15 20 km3 in 2019 and from 13 22 km3 in 2011 to 14 21 km3 in 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively the magnitude of deviation in the phreatic aquifer volume between the two scenarios reaches 0 99 km3 in december 2019 accounting for 7 47 of the initial phreatic aquifer volume therefore there exists a slightly more intensive physical dilution effect on the nitrate n concentration in the northern phreatic aquifer for sce div note that the increase in the phreatic aquifer volume from 2011 to 2019 for sce nodiv is mostly caused by the increasing precipitation amount fig 1 b 4 3 2 nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer fig 7 d f compares the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer in different years for sce div and sce nodiv analogously in the northern phreatic aquifer where the aquifer volume increases the mass of stored nitrate n also increases significantly apart from locations immediately adjacent to the artificial recharge route the increase range bounded by the line of absolute value of 0 1 kg m2 increased from 13 7 km2 in 2015 to 354 2 km2 in 2019 as shown in fig 8 b the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer within the gwl recovery area increases from 0 87 108 kg in 2011 to 1 89 108 kg in 2019 and from 0 87 108 kg in 2011 to 1 54 108 kg in 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively the distinction of the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer between the two scenarios achieved 3 48 107 kg in december 2019 accounting for 40 06 of the initial nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer the amount of nitrate n transported into out of the phreatic aquifer through different pathways for sce div and sce nodiv are plotted in fig 9 in general the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer within the gwl recovery area increase by 1 02 108 kg and 0 67 108 kg from 2011 to 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively for sce div the nitrate n amount transported into and out of the phreatic aquifer through the vadose zone groundwater abstraction the domain boundary and leaking flow achieve 1 3 108 kg 0 2 108 kg 0 08 108 kg and 0 05 108 kg respectively with ratios to the total amount of 78 6 13 1 5 1 and 3 2 for sce nodiv the nitrate n amount through the four pathways reach 0 9 108 kg 0 2 108 kg 0 07 108 kg and 0 02 108 kg respectively with ratios of 74 6 17 8 5 8 and 1 8 that is the vadose zone is the primary pathway for external nitrate n to enter the aquifer in the study area and the changes in nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer are mostly determined by the nitrate n leaching flux most studies on n losses from soil have paid more attention to runoff and leaching losses bai et al 2020 chen et al 2022 reported that shallow groundwater fluctuation was an ignored soil n loss pathway from cropland according to this study the nitrate n loss from soil driven by gwl recovery poses a higher environmental risk 4 3 3 nitrate n concentration in the phreatic aquifer synthetically influenced by both the physical dilution and the increase in the nitrate n mass in the northern aquifer there appears to be a difference in groundwater nitrate n concentration herein between sce div and sce nodiv as shown in fig 7 g i the groundwater nitrate n concentration in most of the northern region for sce div is higher than that for sce nodiv this difference reaches approximately 0 5 11 4 mg l in 2019 with an average value of 2 4 mg l conversely the nitrate n concentration immediately adjacent to the artificial recharge route declines significantly with a minimum value of 9 4 mg l compared to sce nodiv as shown in fig 8 c the average groundwater nitrate n concentration within the gwl recovery area increases from 6 57 mg l in 2011 to 12 41 mg l in 2019 and from 6 57 mg l in 2011 to 10 82 mg l in 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively the water quality of the snwdp cr for groundwater recharge is good and is categorized into levels i ii iii according to the national surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 however the gwl recovery caused the deep vadose zone to be submerged thereby inducing the release of soil pollutants furthermore the effects of the nitrate n mass increase in the aquifer mainly driven by the nitrate n leaching through the vadose zone on the groundwater nitrate n concentration are greater than those of the physical dilution by the aquifer volume increase as a result the nitrate n concentration increased in most gwl recovery regions except the artificial recharge route water diversion projects are undoubtedly beneficial for the gwl recovery however it is crucial to define the vertical pollutant amount of the vadose zone and determine a reasonable recovery level preventing persistent contaminants in the vadose zone from entering the aquifer during gwl recovery 5 conclusions the effects of gwl recovery on the groundwater nitrate n dynamics in the upper and middle craf in bp within the ncp were quantitatively assessed by employing a quasi 3d feedback integrated model for the vadose zone groundwater coupled system the gwl in this study area on account of the snwdp cr started from 2014 has rebounded significantly in recent years within the quasi 3d integrated scheme the relevant variables were delivered between the vadose zone model and groundwater model at each flow time step to intuitively analyze the effects of gwl recovery both the scenarios with and without mitigation countermeasures for groundwater depletion were simulated and then compared the spatial temporal changes in the nitrate n leaching flux through the bottom of vadose zone are related to the water leaching flux the vertical profile of nitrate n along the vadose zone and the gwl undulation compared to the scenario without mitigation countermeasures the gwl recovery induced by the snwdp cr caused nitrate accumulated in the deep vadose zone to be introduced into the aquifer and the nitrate n leaching flux to accordingly increase by 44 4 simultaneously the volume of the phreatic aquifer and the groundwater nitrate n mass within the gwl recovery area increased by 0 99 km3 and 3 48 107 kg in dec 2019 respectively accounting for 7 47 of the initial phreatic aquifer volume and 40 06 of the initial nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer furthermore the nitrate n leaching flux through the vadose zone accounting for 74 78 of the total flux into out of the aquifer served as the primary pathway for external nitrate n to enter the aquifer consequently the groundwater nitrate n concentration in most gwl recovery regions increased by 0 5 11 4 mg l in 2019 with an average value of 2 4 mg l this implied that along with the gwl recovery the actions of nitrate n leaching from the vadose zone are greater than the physical dilution effects in this study area thus it is fairly crucial to determine a reasonable recovery level to minimize the adverse impacts of gwl recovery on groundwater quality for long term groundwater management practices the obtained results from this study also provide a valuable reference for groundwater management in regions where abundant contaminant are accumulated within the vadose zone and the gwl is greatly elevated by external factors such as aquifers in north america china and europe both the residual soil contaminant and the appropriate gwl should be adequately considered for developing an optimal groundwater recharge scheme to realize a balance between groundwater resources and groundwater environment additionally the established quasi 3d feedback integrated model for the

15337,groundwater level gwl recovery in some semiarid regions attributed to mitigation countermeasures for groundwater depletion potentially causes nitrate accumulated in the vadose zone to be introduced into the aquifer however the extent to which gwl recovery affects interactions between the vadose zone and saturated aquifers migration pathways of soil nitrogen and groundwater nitrate dynamics have not been explicitly determined this study established a quasi 3d feedback model for the vadose zone groundwater coupled system in a typical gwl recovery area and quantitatively evaluated the effects of gwl recovery on nitrate n leaching fluxes via the vadose zone and groundwater nitrate n dynamics within the framework of the integrated model both the water contaminant leaching fluxes and the depth to groundwater were exchanged at each flow time step the obtained results reveal that the temporal changes in nitrate n leaching fluxes depended on the behaviors of precipitation farmland irrigation and lithology of the vadose zone while its spatial patterns were determined by both the gwl undulation and the vertical profiles of nitrate n content furthermore the gwl recovery caused the magnitude of the nitrate n leaching fluxes into the aquifer to increase by 44 4 along with the gwl recovery the phreatic aquifer volume increased by 7 47 and the nitrate n mass herein increased by 40 06 which was largely driven by the nitrate n leaching flux consequently the average groundwater nitrate n concentration in the gwl recovery region increased by approximately 2 4 mg l apart from the artificial recharge route this finding suggests that the intensified leaching of soil contaminants given the circumstances of gwl recovery has a negative effect on groundwater quality an appropriate groundwater management scheme is therefore urgently required to achieve an optimal balance between gwl recovery and groundwater environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater level recovery vadose zone groundwater coupled system nitrate leaching flux groundwater nitrate nitrate accumulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater overexploitation due to dramatically increasing water demands along with exponential population growth dietary changes and climate extremes has been largely reported in semiarid regions globally over past decades gleeson et al 2012 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 to mitigate or address these relevant issues of groundwater depletion various approaches have been vigorously adopted such as conveying surficial waters from more humid regions to arid ones zhao et al 2017 roose and starks 2006 developing alternative water resources schiermeier 2008 reducing groundwater abstraction butler et al 2020 and promoting water conservation technology deines et al 2019 as a result groundwater storage in some large depleted aquifers has exhibited a recovery trend in recent years famiglietti and ferguson 2021 zhang et al 2021 for instance the groundwater storage in the north china plain ncp jointly influenced by the south to north water diversion project central route snwdp cr and decreasing or prohibiting pumpage was converted from depletion 2 2 km3 year from 2005 to 2014 to partial recovery 0 3 km3 year from 2015 to 2018 zhang et al 2020 a the snwdp cr was implemented to transfer water from the danjiangkou reservoir in the yangtze river basin to the ncp from december 2014 therein a recovery of 9 0 m of the groundwater level gwl adjacent to the huairou wellfields in the beijing plain bp within the ncp was observed from 2014 to 2017 long et al 2020 moreover the contributions of water diversion climate variability and water saving policies to groundwater storage recovery in the bp from 2006 to 2018 achieved 40 30 and 30 respectively long et al 2020 gwl recovery is expected to alter the spatial patterns of soil water content redox temperature ph etc along the vadose zone these changes in the soil environment ultimately affect the pivotal processes of soil hydrology shen et al 2015 di et al 2019 and soil nitrogen n cycle breuer et al 2002 akbariyeh et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 b n sources derived from anthropogenic and natural factors are generally leached from the surface soil in the form of nitrate leached nitrate attributed to its persistent nature and slow hydrologic transport mcmahon et al 2006 van meter et al 2016 is transported downward and massively accumulated in the deep vadose zone the nitrate n storage in the vadose zone has been reported to exceed 4000 kg ha in some regions of north america china and europe ascott et al 2017 and the amount has reached 6300 kg ha in the ncp where both the thick vadose zone and intensive agricultural cultivation prevail liu et al 2022 under this circumstance gwl recovery could shorten the transport path of nitrate from the surface source to the aquifer and cause more nitrate to leach from the vadose zone into groundwater min et al 2021 basu et al 2022 therefore it is fairly essential to elaborate the effects of gwl recovery on both the nitrate n leaching flux through the vadose zone as well as the groundwater nitrate n dynamics especially for the regions of massive nitrate accumulation in the vadose zone however to the best of our knowledge it is not explicit by far whether the interactions between the vadose zone and saturated aquifers are affected and how the nitrate n leaching fluxes from the vadose zone and the groundwater nitrate dynamics change in response to the gwl recovery to elaborate the complicated processes inherent to the interactions between the vadose zone and saturated aquifers in the gwl recovery region the integrated model combining these two zones is a more attractive solution to date numerous numerical models which describe water movement and the fate and transport of contaminants in the coupled vadose zone and groundwater system have been established with various degrees of complexity and dimensionality ragab and bromley 2010 brunner and simmons 2012 beegum et al 2019 in the context of soil water flow and groundwater flow usually being integrated into a whole system various numerical schemes have been developed to solve the 3d richards equation weill et al 2009 although physically consistent and numerically rigorous these schemes seem to be computationally expensive and numerically unstable the reason is that these solutions are highly nonlinear and greatly sensitive to meteorological factors soil texture and human activities especially for large scale regional problems shen and phanikumar 2010 zha et al 2013 to address this computational challenge the simplification that water movement and solute transport in the vadose zone are treated as 1d vertical processes has been introduced which greatly reduces the computational complexity and improves model stability seo et al 2007 kuznetsov et al 2012 mao et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 that is a quasi 3d integrated scheme containing a 1d vadose zone model and a 3d groundwater model is more applicable to the large regional scale problem for instance the hydrus1d package for modflow which simultaneously evaluates the transient water flow in the saturated unsaturated zone was developed by seo et al 2007 then this integrated scheme was improved in terms of unrealistic sudden inflow and outflow fluxes and was linked with mt3dms beegum et al 2019 furthermore the effectiveness of this coupling scheme in elaborating subsurface hydrology and contaminant transportation processes in saturated unsaturated zones was examined at the regional scale twarakavi et al 2008 beegum et al 2019 therefore in this study the quasi 3d feedback integrated model accomplished by hydrus 1d modflow and mt3dms was established in a typical gwl area the upper and middle parts of the chaobai river alluvial fan craf in the bp within the ncp the gwl herein attributed to the snwdp cr exhibits an apparent recovery trend in recent years furthermore within the integrated frame the interactions between the saturated and unsaturated zones were accomplished through the exchange of information on the water nitrate n flux and the depth to groundwater at each flow time step hereafter the effects of gwl recovery on both the soil nitrate n leaching flux and the groundwater nitrate n dynamics were intuitively evaluated through multiple scenario analysis the results of this study can provide conducive information for future groundwater management in the gwl recovery region while simultaneously considering both the extent of gwl recovery and the evolution of groundwater quality 2 study area the study area 116 40 117 00 e 40 10 40 30 n including the plain area of miyun district huairou district and shunyi district is located in northeastern beijing city and covers a total area of approximately 1362 5 km2 fig 1 a the region experiences a semihumid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration reach approximately 624 8 mm more than 80 occurs from june to september annually 11 7 c and 1800 mm respectively the quaternary sedimentary system in the study area appears highly spatially heterogeneous namely the thickness notably ranges from tens to hundreds of meters from the piedmont to the floodplain the grain size transitions from coarse to fine particles along the north south direction and the aquifer structure ranges from a single sandy gravel layer in the upper craf to 2 3 layers or multiple layers in the middle craf consistent with the terrain slope groundwater generally flows from northeast to southwest and then turns toward the south parallel to the long axis of the basin given long term groundwater overexploitation however the gwl across the entire region continuously declined at an average rate of 0 5 m year before the operation of the snwdp cr zhai et al 2013 consequently there generated a regional piezometric depression cone around the large groundwater wellfields subsequently the delivered water from the snwdp cr in addition to partly compensating for environmental flow and reservoir replenishment was further applied to replace domestic and industrial water consumption originally supplied by groundwater pumping and to recharge the aquifer system along the easily infiltrated river channel including the chaobai yanqi and shahe rivers in the upper part of the craf fig 1 a fig 1 b plots the groundwater pumping level in the three large wellfields and the recharge amount into the aquifer in each year after the snwdp cr operation initiation these yearly data were collected from the beijing water authority http swj beijing gov cn as a result the gwl adjacent to the wellfields and along the recharge route was expected to increase and an increase of 30 0 m was achieved by december 2019 at obs c fig 1 b additionally as shown in fig 1 a and c arable land constitutes the largest land use type of the study area and the ratio ranged from 73 1 to 50 1 from 1980 to 2020 followed by rural settlement and urban land whose ratios ranged from 13 4 to 24 9 and from 1 4 to 6 9 respectively from 1980 to 2020 it can therefore be speculated that the excessive and perennial release of nitrogen fertilizers manure and domestic sewage into the environment play a crucial role in the groundwater nitrate n dynamics in the study area note that the land use type data with a 30 m spatial resolution considered in this study were acquired from the resource and environment data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn 3 materials and methods 3 1 integrated modeling framework in this study a quasi 3d feedback integrated scheme combining the 1d vadose zone and 3d saturated aquifer was adopted to accurately capture the complex interactions between them at the regional scale seo et al 2007 beegum et al 2019 considering the spatial complexity of multiple environmental factors in the domain surface the study area according to the distribution features of relevant primary factors is first partitioned into several subzones along the horizontal direction to describe the spatial complexity of 1d vadose zone processes each subzone is assumed to be homogeneous and locally consistent internally the recharge across the bottom of the vadose zone for each subzone which is calculated by hydrus 1d is treated as the upper boundary of the groundwater model which is executed by modflow and mt3dms procedures it is expected that the discrete grids of the groundwater model beneath the same subzone receive the same recharge amount hereafter the updated gwl calculated by modflow is assigned as the bottom boundary of the corresponding soil profile and the average value is adopted if the soil profile is associated with more than one grid hence the soil profile for each subzone should be designed to extend from the surface to a certain depth below the deepest gwl possible during the entire simulation period to rationalize the bottom boundary of soil profile fig 2 demonstrates the flowchart of the integration of hydrus1d into modflow and coupling to mt3dms as a subroutine the abovementioned feedback processes are repeated at each flow time step during the whole integrated computational procedure note that given the considerably small time step in the hydrus1d model due to the highly nonlinear richards equation the time average recharge flux calculated by hydrus1d is applied to modflow and mt3dms at an arbitrary flow time step during the stress period 3 2 subzone partition as shown in fig 3 six primary factors including surface elevation shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a 30 m spatial resolution land use type lithology distribution above the gwl divided thiessen polygons based on meteorological station location township boundary and depth to groundwater were chosen for subzone partitioning of the quasi 3d integrated model in this study note that data on nitrogen sources along the ground surface were collected in terms of township thus the factor of township boundary was also selected considering the implement time of snwdp cr the investigation period in this study was specified as ranging from january 2011 to december 2019 which covers the periods before and after gwl recovery the temporal variation of the land use type is considerably sluggish and the spatial patterns of gwl is similar for different years apart from the region where mitigation countermeasures were carried out thus the land use type in 2015 and the gwl in january 2011 were adopted in the subzone partition mentioned above in addition the spatial distribution of the lithological structure in the vadose zone was obtained in accordance with historically available well logging information as acquired from the institute of china geological environment monitoring http www cigem cgs gov cn five soil textures including clay silt loam sandy loam sand and gravel were generalized and defined as a result the study area was partitioned into 89 subzones along the horizontal direction fig 3 g the detailed settings of the vadose zone model and groundwater model are provided in texts s1 and s2 respectively of the supporting information 3 3 design of the simulated scenarios to intuitively examine the effects of gwl recovery on the nitrate n leaching flux and the groundwater nitrate dynamics both scenarios with and without mitigation countermeasures were simulated by the quasi 3d integrated model and the deviation between these two scenarios was then analyzed specifically for the scenario with mitigation countermeasures hereinafter referred to as sce div the groundwater abstraction and artificial recharge from 2011 to 2019 were assigned as shown in fig 1b which actually occurred and other conditions retained unchanged for the scenario without mitigation countermeasures hereinafter referred to as sce nodiv the utilization and allocation of water resources retained unchanged as that prior to the snwdp cr operation the groundwater pumping amount of the three large wellfields during each month from 2015 to 2019 was set to match that in 2014 and the artificial recharge was removed and other conditions also retained unchanged 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy verification of the simulated results given the limited data with respect to soil moisture and soil nitrate n content in the study area only measured data of the hydraulic head and nitrate n concentration in the aquifer were employed to examine the accuracy and rationality of the established integrated model changes in both the groundwater flow and nitrate n concentration fields partially depend on soil hydrology and n cycle processes in the vadose zone thus they can be adopted to account for various processes and interactions in and between the vadose zone and the saturated aquifer to a certain extent the field monitoring data of groundwater level and groundwater nitrate n concentration are available from the beijing water authority http swj beijing gov cn the beijing institute of hydrogeology and engineering geology http www bjswd com cn index html and the beijing municipal ecology and environment bureau http sthjj beijing gov cn fig s1 compares the simulated and measured results in the phreatic aquifer note that the nitrate n concentration in the deeper semiconfined aquifers is substantially lower than 0 1 mg l so the variables in the two semiconfined aquifers were not investigated in this study as can be clearly observed the gradient direction and the magnitude of the hydraulic head as well as the spatial pattern of the nitrate n concentration in the phreatic aquifer obtained with the coupled model show substantial agreement with those captured through field monitoring from the perspective of the scatter points of the simulated and measured gwl including 6328 data points and groundwater nitrate n concentration including 404 data points from 2011 2019 in the phreatic aquifer most data scatter points are positioned near the 1 1 line with coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 72 and 0 73 respectively therefore the established quasi 3d integrated model in this study can interpret the pivotal processes that control water movement and the fate and transport of nitrate n in the coupled vadose zone groundwater system and can describe the interactions between these two zones the best fitted parameters applied in the integrated model are listed in table s1 the denitrification process for the different soil textures in the vadose zone of the southern region occurred more intensely due to the distributions of the lithological structure and the corresponding rates are noted in parentheses the exhaustive subareas and corresponding values for some relevant parameters are not presented due to space limitations in this study 4 2 effects on nitrate n dynamics in the vadose zone 4 2 1 nitrate n storage the difference in the phreatic level in dec 2019 between sce div and sce nodiv is plotted in fig 4 a affected by the snwdp cr the gwl adjacent to the region where the mitigation countermeasures were carried out increases to varying degrees compared to sce nodiv this fact demonstrates the effectiveness of the adopted measures in recovering the gwl in this study area which is consistent with other studies zhang et al 2020 a zhao et al 2021 simultaneously along with the gwl recovery as shown in fig 4 b the amount of nitrate n accumulated in the vadose zone in dec 2019 exhibits a decreasing trend compared to sce nodiv the relatively great decrease is largely distributed in subzones 46 48 49 53 57 59 and 62 with the decrease ranging from 800 to 2012 kg ha to inspect the temporal changes in the nitrate n content along the vadose zone during the entire investigation period subzone 57 was selected as an example subzone 57 is located in the upper part of the craf with a representative lithology structure in the vadose zone and a land use type of arable land figs 3 and 5 a and the difference in the average gwl in dec 2019 between sce div and sce nodiv reaches 8 m fig 4 a so it will be more suitable to elaborate the effects of the stored soil nitrate n on the groundwater nitrate n dynamics along the gwl recovery as presented in fig 5 b the intra annual fluctuations of the nitrate n concentration along the vadose zone mostly occur within the silt loam layer which can be attributed to the interactions between the flushing process of infiltrated water and the nitrogen source import conversely in fig 5 c the nitrate n concentration fronts within the underlying gravel layer are observed to continually transport downward over years with an average rate of 2 1 m y furthermore the concentration fronts did not reach the ascending gwl from 2011 to 2019 more importantly the vertical profile of nitrate n content at different times for sce div and sce nodiv seemed to be basically consistent this can be attributed to the fact that the gwl for subzone 57 is considerably deep on the whole and the effect of its variations on the distributions of nitrate n content along the vadose zone is fairly small therefore combined with the results in fig 4b the decrease in the nitrate n content within the vadose zone can be mainly attributed to the fact that nitrate n originally stored in the gwl vertical ascent zone along with the gwl recovery is gradually introduced into the aquifer 4 2 2 nitrate n flux into the aquifer fig 4 c compares the mean annual nitrate n fluxes across the transient bottom of the vadose zone from 2011 to 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv as expected the nitrate n leaching flux for sce div increases to varying degrees compared to sce nodiv the relatively great increases are mostly in subzones 46 48 49 52 53 57 59 62 64 and 66 with the increase ranging from 80 400 kg ha year likewise taking subzone 57 as an example the changes in the water flux and nitrate n flux with time for this subzone for sce div and sce nodiv are shown in fig 5 d e note that a positive flux indicates a downward water nitrate n flux across the bottom of the vadose zone the same below similar to the gwl the water nitrate n flux for the two scenarios deviate from each other after the implementation of mitigation countermeasures however the deviations in the nitrate n flux between sce div and sce nodiv are significantly different from those in the water flux the reason for this phenomenon is that the nitrate n flux into the aquifer driven by the actions of convection and hydrodynamic dispersion is determined by the water flux and the nitrate n concentration at the transient bottom of the vadose zone whereas the nitrate n concentration at the bottom of the vadose zone is relevant to both the distribution characteristics of the vertical concentration profile and the gwl undulation hence as the gwl recover the nitrate n concentration at the transient bottom of the vadose zone varies accordingly consequently causing a fairly great deviation in the nitrate n flux between the two scenarios fig 5 d e that is the temporal changes in the nitrate n flux through the vadose zone are closely associated with gwl recovery as shown in fig s2 for the subzones where the gwl exhibits an obvious upward trend such as subzones 24 30 33 38 43 46 53 and 59 the nitrate n flux into groundwater is also markedly altered by the implementation of mitigation countermeasures and this effect varies for different subzones in addition the temporal changes in the water nitrate n fluxes within a year seem not to be totally identified with the seasonal variations in water input precipitation and irrigation this is a result of the vertical complexity of the lithology structure within the vadose zone the permeability varies widely among various types of soils such as silt clay loam and sand which affects water movement and contaminants relocation underneath the ground surface vks et al 2020 from the perspective of the whole study area as shown in fig 6 the water nitrate n flux across the bottom of the vadose zone remains almost downward during the whole simulation period indicating a continuous import of water nitrate n into groundwater through the vadose zone in the study area however by comparing the two scenarios the average nitrate n flux for sce div appears to be greater than that for sce nodiv by 44 4 this result suggests that for the whole study area the gwl recovery caused by mitigation countermeasures can greatly enhance the nitrate n leaching flux and motivate more soil nitrogen to be introduced into the aquifer 4 3 effects on nitrate n dynamics in the phreatic aquifer 4 3 1 volume of the phreatic aquifer fig 7 a c compares the phreatic aquifer volume at different years for sce div and sce nodiv along with the gwl recovery the phreatic aquifer volume in the northern region for sce div increases compared to sce nodiv the range of difference bounded by the line of 0 5 m3 m2 the red line in fig 7 this region is defined as the gwl recovery area below varies from 141 8 km2 in 2015 to 547 1 km2 in 2019 as shown in fig 8 a the phreatic aquifer volume within the gwl recovery area increases from 13 22 km3 in 2011 to 15 20 km3 in 2019 and from 13 22 km3 in 2011 to 14 21 km3 in 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively the magnitude of deviation in the phreatic aquifer volume between the two scenarios reaches 0 99 km3 in december 2019 accounting for 7 47 of the initial phreatic aquifer volume therefore there exists a slightly more intensive physical dilution effect on the nitrate n concentration in the northern phreatic aquifer for sce div note that the increase in the phreatic aquifer volume from 2011 to 2019 for sce nodiv is mostly caused by the increasing precipitation amount fig 1 b 4 3 2 nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer fig 7 d f compares the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer in different years for sce div and sce nodiv analogously in the northern phreatic aquifer where the aquifer volume increases the mass of stored nitrate n also increases significantly apart from locations immediately adjacent to the artificial recharge route the increase range bounded by the line of absolute value of 0 1 kg m2 increased from 13 7 km2 in 2015 to 354 2 km2 in 2019 as shown in fig 8 b the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer within the gwl recovery area increases from 0 87 108 kg in 2011 to 1 89 108 kg in 2019 and from 0 87 108 kg in 2011 to 1 54 108 kg in 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively the distinction of the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer between the two scenarios achieved 3 48 107 kg in december 2019 accounting for 40 06 of the initial nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer the amount of nitrate n transported into out of the phreatic aquifer through different pathways for sce div and sce nodiv are plotted in fig 9 in general the nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer within the gwl recovery area increase by 1 02 108 kg and 0 67 108 kg from 2011 to 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively for sce div the nitrate n amount transported into and out of the phreatic aquifer through the vadose zone groundwater abstraction the domain boundary and leaking flow achieve 1 3 108 kg 0 2 108 kg 0 08 108 kg and 0 05 108 kg respectively with ratios to the total amount of 78 6 13 1 5 1 and 3 2 for sce nodiv the nitrate n amount through the four pathways reach 0 9 108 kg 0 2 108 kg 0 07 108 kg and 0 02 108 kg respectively with ratios of 74 6 17 8 5 8 and 1 8 that is the vadose zone is the primary pathway for external nitrate n to enter the aquifer in the study area and the changes in nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer are mostly determined by the nitrate n leaching flux most studies on n losses from soil have paid more attention to runoff and leaching losses bai et al 2020 chen et al 2022 reported that shallow groundwater fluctuation was an ignored soil n loss pathway from cropland according to this study the nitrate n loss from soil driven by gwl recovery poses a higher environmental risk 4 3 3 nitrate n concentration in the phreatic aquifer synthetically influenced by both the physical dilution and the increase in the nitrate n mass in the northern aquifer there appears to be a difference in groundwater nitrate n concentration herein between sce div and sce nodiv as shown in fig 7 g i the groundwater nitrate n concentration in most of the northern region for sce div is higher than that for sce nodiv this difference reaches approximately 0 5 11 4 mg l in 2019 with an average value of 2 4 mg l conversely the nitrate n concentration immediately adjacent to the artificial recharge route declines significantly with a minimum value of 9 4 mg l compared to sce nodiv as shown in fig 8 c the average groundwater nitrate n concentration within the gwl recovery area increases from 6 57 mg l in 2011 to 12 41 mg l in 2019 and from 6 57 mg l in 2011 to 10 82 mg l in 2019 for sce div and sce nodiv respectively the water quality of the snwdp cr for groundwater recharge is good and is categorized into levels i ii iii according to the national surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 however the gwl recovery caused the deep vadose zone to be submerged thereby inducing the release of soil pollutants furthermore the effects of the nitrate n mass increase in the aquifer mainly driven by the nitrate n leaching through the vadose zone on the groundwater nitrate n concentration are greater than those of the physical dilution by the aquifer volume increase as a result the nitrate n concentration increased in most gwl recovery regions except the artificial recharge route water diversion projects are undoubtedly beneficial for the gwl recovery however it is crucial to define the vertical pollutant amount of the vadose zone and determine a reasonable recovery level preventing persistent contaminants in the vadose zone from entering the aquifer during gwl recovery 5 conclusions the effects of gwl recovery on the groundwater nitrate n dynamics in the upper and middle craf in bp within the ncp were quantitatively assessed by employing a quasi 3d feedback integrated model for the vadose zone groundwater coupled system the gwl in this study area on account of the snwdp cr started from 2014 has rebounded significantly in recent years within the quasi 3d integrated scheme the relevant variables were delivered between the vadose zone model and groundwater model at each flow time step to intuitively analyze the effects of gwl recovery both the scenarios with and without mitigation countermeasures for groundwater depletion were simulated and then compared the spatial temporal changes in the nitrate n leaching flux through the bottom of vadose zone are related to the water leaching flux the vertical profile of nitrate n along the vadose zone and the gwl undulation compared to the scenario without mitigation countermeasures the gwl recovery induced by the snwdp cr caused nitrate accumulated in the deep vadose zone to be introduced into the aquifer and the nitrate n leaching flux to accordingly increase by 44 4 simultaneously the volume of the phreatic aquifer and the groundwater nitrate n mass within the gwl recovery area increased by 0 99 km3 and 3 48 107 kg in dec 2019 respectively accounting for 7 47 of the initial phreatic aquifer volume and 40 06 of the initial nitrate n mass in the phreatic aquifer furthermore the nitrate n leaching flux through the vadose zone accounting for 74 78 of the total flux into out of the aquifer served as the primary pathway for external nitrate n to enter the aquifer consequently the groundwater nitrate n concentration in most gwl recovery regions increased by 0 5 11 4 mg l in 2019 with an average value of 2 4 mg l this implied that along with the gwl recovery the actions of nitrate n leaching from the vadose zone are greater than the physical dilution effects in this study area thus it is fairly crucial to determine a reasonable recovery level to minimize the adverse impacts of gwl recovery on groundwater quality for long term groundwater management practices the obtained results from this study also provide a valuable reference for groundwater management in regions where abundant contaminant are accumulated within the vadose zone and the gwl is greatly elevated by external factors such as aquifers in north america china and europe both the residual soil contaminant and the appropriate gwl should be adequately considered for developing an optimal groundwater recharge scheme to realize a balance between groundwater resources and groundwater environment additionally the established quasi 3d feedback integrated model for the

15338,benzoquinone bq is of great significance for enhancement of contaminants degradation in the homogeneous oxidation system of peroxymonosulfate pms however the role of bq in the heterogeneous activation of pms for contaminants oxidation is still not clear herein this work reported that the addition of bq into the fe3s4 pms system could effectively enhance the degradation and mineralization of bisphenol a bpa mechanistic study uncovered that the bq and pms would form active complexes bq pms on the surface of fe3s4 and the excited bq pms can oxidize the bpa to be specific the electron of bpa was extracted by bq pms and then transfer to the surface of fe3s4 the surface electron can induce the change of valence state of s and fe elements which can trigger the degradation of bpa and inhibit the decomposition of bq itself to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to unveil the positive role of bq in the heterogeneous activation of pms which may shed new light on the establishment of high efficient pms based oxidation technology for remediation of organic pollutant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords benzoquinone iron sulfide peroxymonosulfate heterogeneous system bpa degradation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction quinones are widespread in the natural environment such as water soil and atmosphere aeschbacher et al 2012 cory and mcknight 2005 jakober et al 2007 benzoquinone bq as one kind of quinones is often used as selective quencher for superoxide radical o2 in the field of catalytic oxidation qi et al 2016 wang et al 2020a however researchers have noticed the quinones were able to improve the oxidation ability of some catalytic systems doong and chiang 2005 for example duesteberg et al added the quinones into the fenton system and the conversion of fe iii to fe ii was found to be promoted due to the reduction ability of quinones duesteberg and waite 2007 xu et al 2018 found permanganate can be reduced to mn ii by bq and the mn ii would further react with bq to form mn iii and semiquinone radicals then the semiquinone radicals would be oxidized by mn iii to produce 1o2 thus greatly improved the degradation efficiency of levofloxacin lf in this system mn iii and 1o2 were the dominant reactive species for lf degradation zhou et al 2015 noticed that bq itself could effectively activate pms to degrade sulfamethoxazole smx this was because a dioxirane intermediate was formed between bq and pms under the condition of ph 7 which was then decomposed to produce 1o2 in the heterogeneous system li et al 2020 also noticed that the addition of bq can improve the bpa degradation efficiency by pms activated with cu2o however so far there is still not a reasonable explanation for the positive contribution of bq in the heterogeneous pms activation system iron sulfides as a new type of iron based catalysts have gained increasing attention in recent years xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 many studies have reported the excellent performance of natural iron sulfides in activating peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds to degrade organic contaminants chen et al 2017 diao et al 2017 sühnholz et al 2020 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 which could be attributed to the sulfur mediated cycling of iron species sulfur species as important electron donors could accelerate the regeneration of fe ii on the surface of iron sulfides fan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 and as a result high catalytic activity would be sustained for the iron sulfide catalysts in addition to natural minerals synthetic iron sulfides have been investigated by more and more researchers because they can be prepared in a controlled manner according to the specific requirements lin et al 2020 synthesized a flower like greigite fe3s4 with large specific surface area which can activate pds at low dosage efficiently in our previous study liu et al 2022 it was preliminarily noticed that the bq added in the system which was initially designed to quench o2 can improve the pms activating performance of fe3s4 effectively it is therefore interest to elucidate the unique function of bq and inherent mechanism in the bq assisted system in this work bq was added into the heterogeneous fe3s4 pms system and its effect on bpa degradation was systematically explored the reactive oxygen species ros in the system were explored by quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance epr the reaction process in the presence of bq was also systematically investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in situ raman spectroscopy and electrochemical testing this work was the first to

the experimental process was shown in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 bpa degradation in bq fe3s4 pms system as shown in fig 1 a 56 9 bpa was degraded within 30 min in the fe3s4 pms system when 0 5 mm bq were present in the system the degradation of bpa was significantly improved with the efficiency reaching to 98 1 the inset of fig 1a indicated that the pseudo first order rate constants k of bpa degradation in the presence of bq was 0 136 min 1 which was four times as high as that without bq 0 033 min 1 in addition negligible bpa removal was observed for pms bq and fe3s4 bq systems respectively therefore the following conclusions could be drawn i bq didn t increase the degradation of bpa by activating pms directly ii bpa couldn t be removed by the interaction between bq and fe3s4 in the absence of pms iii it is possible that the presence of bq enhanced the process of pms activation by fe3s4 although the presence of bq promoted the degradation of bpa the iron leaching within the system was also enhanced as shown in the inset of fig 1b the total iron leaching in fe3s4 pms system was 2 1 mg l 1 while it was raised to 3 3 mg l 1 when bq was present in order to explore the effect of leached iron homogeneous experiment was also conducted in which the fe3s4 was replaced with fe2 with the dosage equaling to the leached iron concentration as shown in fig 1b the degradation of bpa was only 20 2 in the fe2 pms system which was significantly lower than that in the bq fe3s4 pms system therefore the activation of pms by fe2 was not the dominant factor for the enhanced oxidation capacity in the system in addition the degradation of bpa was not observed to be promoted significantly when bq was present in the homogeneous fe2 pms system in addition the effect of fe3 on the degradation of bpa in different systems was also investigated and the results were shown to be similar to that of fe2 fig s1 these results indicated that there might be some specific interaction in the heterogeneous bq fe3s4 pms system for bpa degradation in this work the effect of bq addition on bpa mineralization was also investigated since the bq concentration didn t exhibit significant changes in the process of bpa degradation fig s2 the mineralization of bpa could be calculated by measuring the toc concentration in the process of reaction as shown in fig s3 only 27 of bpa was mineralized in fe3s4 pms system while the mineralization of bpa was increased to 51 1 when bq was present this indicated that the presence of bq not only accelerated the degradation of bpa but also promoted the further decomposition of the intermediate products 3 2 mechanism discussion 3 2 1 was the production of ros strengthened by bq to reveal the reaction mechanism we performed radical scavenging tests and epr analyses to investigate the ros generated in the bq fe3s4 pms bpa system meoh and tba have been widely used quenching agents for identifying so4 and oh han et al 2022 sun et al 2022 as shown in fig 2 a the degradation of bpa was decreased to 59 7 when rising meoh concentration to 150 mm 500 times higher than the pms concentration whereas the variation of tba concentration didn t exhibit any influence on bpa degradation this indicated that only so4 was produced in the bq fe3s4 pms bpa system epr spectra showed that there was no radical signal emerged when only pms and bq were present which confirmed that bq couldn t activate pms to produce free radicals so4 or oh on the other hand strong dmpo so4 signals could be observed in the bq fe3s4 pms system demonstrating the presence of so4 in the system in addition some dmpo oh signals were also identified which could be explained by the conversion of so4 to oh eq 1 during the detection process kong et al 2018 the epr spectra in fig s4 displayed that bq added in the system did not increase the intensity of dmpo so4 signals significantly suggesting that the generation of so4 would not be enhanced by bq however the degradation of bpa indeed strengthened by the addition of bq therefore it could be inferred the generation of so4 was not the only or even not the dominant explanation for bpa degradation and it was reasonable to consider the degradation of bpa had been enhanced by the bq via a non radical mechanism 1 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h o h singlet oxygen has been identified as one of the most important ros in the pms activation systems kohantorabi et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 in this work ffa a classic scavenger for 1o2 was also introduced into the bq fe3s4 pms system li et al 2020 as shown in fig 2c the bpa degradation efficiency rapidly dropped to 19 9 following 5 mm of ffa addition the degradation would be further inhibited with higher ffa dosage furthermore the signal of temp 1o2 was detected in the epr spectra of bq fe3s4 pms system fig 2d based on the above results it seemed that 1o2 was produced in the bq fe3s4 pms system and played a dominant role in the bpa degradation however as shown in fig s5 for the fe3s4 pms system although the temp 1o2 signal could also be identified when bq was present it was shown to be much weaker as compared with the system without bq this demonstrated that the presence of bq inhibited the production of 1o2 in the fe3s4 pms system if 1o2 was the dominant ros the decreased 1o2 production couldn t support the enhanced bpa degradation in the bq assisted fe3s4 pms system the strongly depressive effect of ffa on pms activation could be probably attributed to its blockage of surface reactive complex formation on fe3s4 surface yun et al 2018 the mechanism of bq assisting pms activation by fe3s4 for bpa degradation still require further investigation 3 2 2 did bq enhance the activity of fe3s4 as a ligand as shown in fig 3 a the characteristic peak of bq can be observed in the ftir spectra of fe3s4 after bq treatment which demonstrated that bq was adsorbed on the surface of fe3s4 regarding pms activation by inorganic metal based particles the addition of ligands had been repeatedly reported to be effective in enhancing the removal of contaminants gao et al 2021 nie et al 2022 rayaroth et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore it was wondered if the bq worked as a ligand on the fe3s4 surface and thus enhance its pms activation ability fig s6 demonstrated that the degradation of bq itself was significantly different in the systems bq fe3s4 bq fe3s4 pms and bq fe3s4 pms bpa with the removal efficiency of 11 5 47 6 and 2 3 respectively in the bq fe3s4 pms system ros generated from the activation of pms by fe3s4 might target bq for attack so bq was degraded rapidly however when bpa was present the degradation of bq was significantly inhibited the bq exhibited different behaviors under different conditions which was different from the ligand mechanism as reported previously furthermore fig 3b indicated that when without bpa the decomposition of pms was significantly enhanced by bq while in the presence of bpa bq did not exert obvious influence on pms decomposition previous studies had proved that ligand complexed on the catalyst surface can enhance the reactivity of active site and promote the decomposition of pms consequently it could be inferred that the bq didn t improve the degradation of bpa by enhancing the reactivity of active site as a ligand in the bq fe3s4 pms bpa system 3 2 3 was direct electron transfer the main pathway from the result and analysis shown above it was demonstrated that the bq didn t enhance the production of ros its ligand action for enhancing the reactivity of fe3s4 was also excluded therefore other pathways for the enhancing effect of bq had to be considered the direct electron transfer process has been reported as an important non radical mechanism by several researchers ren et al 2022 2020b shao et al 2021 2020 in this process the catalyst worked as a medium for the rapid transfer of electrons from the contaminants to the oxidant of pms and there is no chemical interaction between the catalyst and the pms ding et al 2021 since this mechanism requires catalysts with strong electrical conductivity it is often observed in carbon based catalysts and still rarely in metal based catalysts in order to monitor the electron migration in the reaction process the amperometric i t curves were recorded to probe the current signal as shown in fig 4 when bq was injected into the fe3s4 based system a significant positive current was immediately observed which demonstrated the transfer of electrons from bq to fe3s4 the injection of pms also produced a signal of positive current indicating that pms was serving as an electron donor to transfer electrons to fe3s4 this result also explained the rapid decomposition of pms in the bq fe3s4 pms system as shown in fig 3b in this case pms was decomposed as electron donor but no sulfate radicals were generated however the intensity of the positive current generated after pms injection was much lower than that when bq was injected suggesting there was also a transfer of electrons from the fe3s4 to pms therefore the generated negative current offset part of the positive current moreover a positive current was further observed after bpa injection based on the above results it seemed the electrons were first transferred from bpa to fe3s4 and subsequently to pms i e direct electron transfer was a plausible pathway for the bq assisted pms activation by fe3s4 for bpa degradation however the decomposition of pms in the fe3s4 bq pms system was only enhanced in the absence of bpa which was not influenced by bq in the presence of bpa fig 3b therefore the catalyst could not be considered to serve as an electron mediator to facilitate the electron transfer between bpa and pms although electronic migration indeed took place among bq fe3s4 pms and bpa in the system the behavior of bq assisted fe3s4 activation of pms was significantly different from the traditional direct electron transfer mechanism 3 2 4 new mechanism proposal bq has a strong reducing property dandawate et al 2010 duesteberg and waite 2007 had found addition of quinones into the fenton system could accelerate the conversion of fe iii to fe ii therefore in this work we speculated the bq might also promote the reduction of fe iii species and the variation of surface element valence of fe3s4 was analyzed as shown in fig 5 the fe 2p3 2 spectra can be fitted into two peaks at 711 2 and 713 3 ev corresponding to fe ii and fe iii respectively the fe 2p spectra of the fresh fe3s4 showed that the contents of fe ii and fe iii were 63 9 and 36 1 respectively after the fe3s4 was treated in bq solution for 30 min the surface fe ii content was not shown to be increased but rather decreased to 59 9 suggesting that bq could not directly promote the regeneration of fe ii on fe3s4 however previous study liu et al 2022 had demonstrated that s species in iron sulfide served as electron donor to regenerate fe ii during the process of pms activation therefore it should be considered whether the fe ii regeneration was indirectly promoted by bq via altering the s species on the surface of fe3s4 as shown in fig 5b the peak corresponding to so4 2 168 2 ev 169 4 ev decreased significantly from 40 to 16 4 after bq treatment and a new peak appeared at 166 9 ev which corresponded to so3 2 diao et al 2017 in addition the content of s2 2 163 5 ev 164 7 ev decreased from 51 9 to 44 9 after bq treatment while s2 161 4 ev 162 6 ev increased from 8 1 to 28 8 from the above results it could be concluded that the s species on the surface of fe3s4 were reduced in the presence of bq probably the regeneration of fe ii might be indirectly enhanced by the reduction of s species on the surface of iron sulfide in the presence of bq however as had been demonstrated in the previous sections the addition of bq didn t enhance the decomposition of pms and the production of ros in the presence of bpa therefore the accelerated regeneration of fe ii in this system cannot be directly related to the improved bpa degradation in fig 5b it was shown that the reduction of s species in fe3s4 was stronger when there was no bpa present and the decomposition of pms was significantly enhanced at this time fig 3b which indicating that bq mediated the electron transfer from pms to fe3s4 therefore the electrochemical property of bq was investigated by cyclic voltammetry cv as shown in fig 6 a bq had an anodic peak in the first positive going scan while a significant cathodic peak was also observed in the first negative going scan the cv curves of bq exhibited a symmetric structure which suggested that bq underwent a reversible reaction meanwhile the current density of both the anode and cathode peaks was well maintained indicating that the bq was not consumed with the increased cycles these results demonstrated due to the reversible process bq could not only release electrons but also accept electrons the surface variation of the catalyst in the reaction process was further characterized by ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 6b the peaks appeared at 890 cm 1 and 1115 cm 1 on the catalyst surface corresponded to the characteristic peaks of bq and pms respectively the peaks at 558 cm 1 and 1174 cm 1 corresponded to the characteristic peaks of bpa moreover a strong peak appeared at 1012 cm 1 was likely to be the connection bond formed between bq and pms this provided a medium for the electron transfer between bq and pms considering that bq concentration didn t decrease significantly during the reaction bq and pms were likely to develop metastable structures on the catalyst surface however when there was no bpa present in the system the production of bq pms complexes 1012 cm 1 was inhibited fig s7 this might be due to the rapid decomposition of bq and pms in the absence of bpa in the system which had been illustrated in section 3 2 2 the reaction processes in fe3s4 bq pms bpa system were further investigated by cyclic voltammetry as shown in fig s8 no cathodic peak was observed in blank system using fe3s4 as the working electrode a distinct cathodic peak was observed in the fe3s4 pms bpa system which represented the decomposition of pms by fe3s4 and when bq was present the active area of cv curve increased suggesting higher efficiency of electron transfer occurred in the system in addition the cathodic peak was shifted to the positive direction and the intensity was significantly declined implying the decomposition of pms became more difficult this provided a reasonable explanation for the decreased decomposition of pms shown in fig 3b the chemical evolution of pms on fe3s4 surface was further investigated by in situ raman technology as can be seen in fig 6c the peaks at 879 cm 1 and 1060 cm 1 stood for hso5 and the peak at 982 cm 1 stood for so4 2 bai et al 2022 ren et al 2020a the peaks of pms didn t change when only bq was added whereas when fe3s4 was added alone the peak of hso5 decreased and the peak of so4 2 increased indicating that pms was rapidly decomposed compared with the fe3s4 pms system the pms decomposition in bq fe3s4 pms became more obvious however when bpa was further added in the system the decomposition of pms was inhibited these results was in coincidence with that shown in fig 3b in addition there was a new peak emerged at 834 cm 1 in the pms bq fe3s4 bpa system which corresponded to the active peroxo species pms ren et al 2020a which should be one of the primary contributors to the bpa degradation in conclusion two pathways for degradation of bpa were identified in the bq assisted fe3s4 activating pms system as shown in fig 7 the first pathway was the radical pathway i e so4 was produced from the activation of pms by fe3s4 in this pathway the decomposition of pms was only controlled by the catalyst and bq didn t participate another pathway was the in situ synergistic reaction between bq and pms on the fe3s4 surface when bq and pms were jointly present in the system the active complexes between bq and pms bq pms would be generated on fe3s4 surface if bpa was present in the system the bpa was attacked by the bq pms and electrons were transferred to bq via pms bq thus supplied electrons to fe3s4 to reduce the s species the low valence s species would further reduce fe iii to fe ii and fe ii could transfer electrons to the pms in the complexes leading to the continuous activation of bq pms however if there was no bpa in the system the internal electronic cycling pms bq s fe pms on the surface of fe3s4 could not be maintained stably due to the lack of external electronic supplement from bpa as a result the formation of bq pms on fe3s4 surface would be inhibited and the free bq in water would be oxidized by the so4 produced in path 1 3 3 effect of reagent dosages in this section the effect of reagents fe3s4 bq pms dosage on bpa degradation were investigated as displayed in fig s9a c when the dosage of fe3s4 was 10 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency of bpa was only 43 2 in 30 min and it was improved to 98 1 with the fe3s4 dosage increasing to 20 mg l 1 when fe3s4 dosage was further increased to 30 and 40 mg l 1 100 bpa degradation can be achieved within 20 and 10 min respectively apparently fe3s4 dosage exhibited a significant effect on the degradation of bpa according to the reaction mechanism proposed in section 3 2 higher dosage of fe3s4 can provide more reaction sites for the formation of active complexes bq pms furthermore fig s9b showed that with the increase of bq concentration from 0 1 to 0 7 mm the degradation of bpa was also substantially improved with the efficiency increased from 69 4 to 100 the higher bq concentration was conductive to the adsorption of bq on the fe3s4 surface thus producing more active complexes for the degradation of bpa these results demonstrated again that the bq pms active complexes on fe3s4 surface were responsible for the enhanced degradation of bpa however it was illustrated fig s9c that the dosage of pms only exhibited a negligible effect on bpa degradation this could be attributed to the specificity of reaction path 2 section 3 2 4 after considering the effectiveness and economy the optimal doses of each agent can be determined as 20 mg l for fe3s4 0 5 mm for bq and 0 3 mm for pms respectively 3 4 bpa degradation pathway analysis in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the degradation pathway of bpa in the bq fe3s4 pms system the degradation intermediates were detected and analyzed by uplc ms the possible degradation pathways of bpa were proposed in fig 8 based on the identified intermediates as can be seen in the fe3s4 pms system the degradation of bpa was accomplished by the stepwise oxidation of phenolic hydroxyl groups when bq was present the degradation of bpa was initiated by dehydroxylation and β scission reaction chen et al 2022 proposed that so4 could attack the co bond to accomplish the dehydroxylation process in contrast it was supposed the bq pms might prefer to attack the cc bond to complete the β scission reaction the intermediate products were subsequently oxidized to short chain alcohols and eventually mineralized to co2 and h2o the presence of bq in the system also improved the mineralization of bpa greatly 51 1 vs 27 fig s3 4 conclusions in this work we introduced bq to enhance the pms activation by fe3s4 the degradation and mineralization of bpa were both shown to be significantly improved the experimental results demonstrated that bq didn t promote the production of ros but enhanced bpa degradation by a special pathway which was proposed for the first time bq and pms can form an active complex bq pms on the surface of fe3s4 the bpa can be effectively oxidized by the bq pms the electrons would be transferred to the s species on fe3s4 and finally lead to the regeneration of fe ii via the reversible redox process of bq in this system the bq would not be oxidized if bpa was present the discovery of the bq assisted fe3s4 activating pms mechanism could provide new strategies for construction of highly efficient pms based advanced

15338,benzoquinone bq is of great significance for enhancement of contaminants degradation in the homogeneous oxidation system of peroxymonosulfate pms however the role of bq in the heterogeneous activation of pms for contaminants oxidation is still not clear herein this work reported that the addition of bq into the fe3s4 pms system could effectively enhance the degradation and mineralization of bisphenol a bpa mechanistic study uncovered that the bq and pms would form active complexes bq pms on the surface of fe3s4 and the excited bq pms can oxidize the bpa to be specific the electron of bpa was extracted by bq pms and then transfer to the surface of fe3s4 the surface electron can induce the change of valence state of s and fe elements which can trigger the degradation of bpa and inhibit the decomposition of bq itself to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to unveil the positive role of bq in the heterogeneous activation of pms which may shed new light on the establishment of high efficient pms based oxidation technology for remediation of organic pollutant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords benzoquinone iron sulfide peroxymonosulfate heterogeneous system bpa degradation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction quinones are widespread in the natural environment such as water soil and atmosphere aeschbacher et al 2012 cory and mcknight 2005 jakober et al 2007 benzoquinone bq as one kind of quinones is often used as selective quencher for superoxide radical o2 in the field of catalytic oxidation qi et al 2016 wang et al 2020a however researchers have noticed the quinones were able to improve the oxidation ability of some catalytic systems doong and chiang 2005 for example duesteberg et al added the quinones into the fenton system and the conversion of fe iii to fe ii was found to be promoted due to the reduction ability of quinones duesteberg and waite 2007 xu et al 2018 found permanganate can be reduced to mn ii by bq and the mn ii would further react with bq to form mn iii and semiquinone radicals then the semiquinone radicals would be oxidized by mn iii to produce 1o2 thus greatly improved the degradation efficiency of levofloxacin lf in this system mn iii and 1o2 were the dominant reactive species for lf degradation zhou et al 2015 noticed that bq itself could effectively activate pms to degrade sulfamethoxazole smx this was because a dioxirane intermediate was formed between bq and pms under the condition of ph 7 which was then decomposed to produce 1o2 in the heterogeneous system li et al 2020 also noticed that the addition of bq can improve the bpa degradation efficiency by pms activated with cu2o however so far there is still not a reasonable explanation for the positive contribution of bq in the heterogeneous pms activation system iron sulfides as a new type of iron based catalysts have gained increasing attention in recent years xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 many studies have reported the excellent performance of natural iron sulfides in activating peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds to degrade organic contaminants chen et al 2017 diao et al 2017 sühnholz et al 2020 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 which could be attributed to the sulfur mediated cycling of iron species sulfur species as important electron donors could accelerate the regeneration of fe ii on the surface of iron sulfides fan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 and as a result high catalytic activity would be sustained for the iron sulfide catalysts in addition to natural minerals synthetic iron sulfides have been investigated by more and more researchers because they can be prepared in a controlled manner according to the specific requirements lin et al 2020 synthesized a flower like greigite fe3s4 with large specific surface area which can activate pds at low dosage efficiently in our previous study liu et al 2022 it was preliminarily noticed that the bq added in the system which was initially designed to quench o2 can improve the pms activating performance of fe3s4 effectively it is therefore interest to elucidate the unique function of bq and inherent mechanism in the bq assisted system in this work bq was added into the heterogeneous fe3s4 pms system and its effect on bpa degradation was systematically explored the reactive oxygen species ros in the system were explored by quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance epr the reaction process in the presence of bq was also systematically investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in situ raman spectroscopy and electrochemical testing this work was the first to

the experimental process was shown in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 bpa degradation in bq fe3s4 pms system as shown in fig 1 a 56 9 bpa was degraded within 30 min in the fe3s4 pms system when 0 5 mm bq were present in the system the degradation of bpa was significantly improved with the efficiency reaching to 98 1 the inset of fig 1a indicated that the pseudo first order rate constants k of bpa degradation in the presence of bq was 0 136 min 1 which was four times as high as that without bq 0 033 min 1 in addition negligible bpa removal was observed for pms bq and fe3s4 bq systems respectively therefore the following conclusions could be drawn i bq didn t increase the degradation of bpa by activating pms directly ii bpa couldn t be removed by the interaction between bq and fe3s4 in the absence of pms iii it is possible that the presence of bq enhanced the process of pms activation by fe3s4 although the presence of bq promoted the degradation of bpa the iron leaching within the system was also enhanced as shown in the inset of fig 1b the total iron leaching in fe3s4 pms system was 2 1 mg l 1 while it was raised to 3 3 mg l 1 when bq was present in order to explore the effect of leached iron homogeneous experiment was also conducted in which the fe3s4 was replaced with fe2 with the dosage equaling to the leached iron concentration as shown in fig 1b the degradation of bpa was only 20 2 in the fe2 pms system which was significantly lower than that in the bq fe3s4 pms system therefore the activation of pms by fe2 was not the dominant factor for the enhanced oxidation capacity in the system in addition the degradation of bpa was not observed to be promoted significantly when bq was present in the homogeneous fe2 pms system in addition the effect of fe3 on the degradation of bpa in different systems was also investigated and the results were shown to be similar to that of fe2 fig s1 these results indicated that there might be some specific interaction in the heterogeneous bq fe3s4 pms system for bpa degradation in this work the effect of bq addition on bpa mineralization was also investigated since the bq concentration didn t exhibit significant changes in the process of bpa degradation fig s2 the mineralization of bpa could be calculated by measuring the toc concentration in the process of reaction as shown in fig s3 only 27 of bpa was mineralized in fe3s4 pms system while the mineralization of bpa was increased to 51 1 when bq was present this indicated that the presence of bq not only accelerated the degradation of bpa but also promoted the further decomposition of the intermediate products 3 2 mechanism discussion 3 2 1 was the production of ros strengthened by bq to reveal the reaction mechanism we performed radical scavenging tests and epr analyses to investigate the ros generated in the bq fe3s4 pms bpa system meoh and tba have been widely used quenching agents for identifying so4 and oh han et al 2022 sun et al 2022 as shown in fig 2 a the degradation of bpa was decreased to 59 7 when rising meoh concentration to 150 mm 500 times higher than the pms concentration whereas the variation of tba concentration didn t exhibit any influence on bpa degradation this indicated that only so4 was produced in the bq fe3s4 pms bpa system epr spectra showed that there was no radical signal emerged when only pms and bq were present which confirmed that bq couldn t activate pms to produce free radicals so4 or oh on the other hand strong dmpo so4 signals could be observed in the bq fe3s4 pms system demonstrating the presence of so4 in the system in addition some dmpo oh signals were also identified which could be explained by the conversion of so4 to oh eq 1 during the detection process kong et al 2018 the epr spectra in fig s4 displayed that bq added in the system did not increase the intensity of dmpo so4 signals significantly suggesting that the generation of so4 would not be enhanced by bq however the degradation of bpa indeed strengthened by the addition of bq therefore it could be inferred the generation of so4 was not the only or even not the dominant explanation for bpa degradation and it was reasonable to consider the degradation of bpa had been enhanced by the bq via a non radical mechanism 1 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h o h singlet oxygen has been identified as one of the most important ros in the pms activation systems kohantorabi et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 in this work ffa a classic scavenger for 1o2 was also introduced into the bq fe3s4 pms system li et al 2020 as shown in fig 2c the bpa degradation efficiency rapidly dropped to 19 9 following 5 mm of ffa addition the degradation would be further inhibited with higher ffa dosage furthermore the signal of temp 1o2 was detected in the epr spectra of bq fe3s4 pms system fig 2d based on the above results it seemed that 1o2 was produced in the bq fe3s4 pms system and played a dominant role in the bpa degradation however as shown in fig s5 for the fe3s4 pms system although the temp 1o2 signal could also be identified when bq was present it was shown to be much weaker as compared with the system without bq this demonstrated that the presence of bq inhibited the production of 1o2 in the fe3s4 pms system if 1o2 was the dominant ros the decreased 1o2 production couldn t support the enhanced bpa degradation in the bq assisted fe3s4 pms system the strongly depressive effect of ffa on pms activation could be probably attributed to its blockage of surface reactive complex formation on fe3s4 surface yun et al 2018 the mechanism of bq assisting pms activation by fe3s4 for bpa degradation still require further investigation 3 2 2 did bq enhance the activity of fe3s4 as a ligand as shown in fig 3 a the characteristic peak of bq can be observed in the ftir spectra of fe3s4 after bq treatment which demonstrated that bq was adsorbed on the surface of fe3s4 regarding pms activation by inorganic metal based particles the addition of ligands had been repeatedly reported to be effective in enhancing the removal of contaminants gao et al 2021 nie et al 2022 rayaroth et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore it was wondered if the bq worked as a ligand on the fe3s4 surface and thus enhance its pms activation ability fig s6 demonstrated that the degradation of bq itself was significantly different in the systems bq fe3s4 bq fe3s4 pms and bq fe3s4 pms bpa with the removal efficiency of 11 5 47 6 and 2 3 respectively in the bq fe3s4 pms system ros generated from the activation of pms by fe3s4 might target bq for attack so bq was degraded rapidly however when bpa was present the degradation of bq was significantly inhibited the bq exhibited different behaviors under different conditions which was different from the ligand mechanism as reported previously furthermore fig 3b indicated that when without bpa the decomposition of pms was significantly enhanced by bq while in the presence of bpa bq did not exert obvious influence on pms decomposition previous studies had proved that ligand complexed on the catalyst surface can enhance the reactivity of active site and promote the decomposition of pms consequently it could be inferred that the bq didn t improve the degradation of bpa by enhancing the reactivity of active site as a ligand in the bq fe3s4 pms bpa system 3 2 3 was direct electron transfer the main pathway from the result and analysis shown above it was demonstrated that the bq didn t enhance the production of ros its ligand action for enhancing the reactivity of fe3s4 was also excluded therefore other pathways for the enhancing effect of bq had to be considered the direct electron transfer process has been reported as an important non radical mechanism by several researchers ren et al 2022 2020b shao et al 2021 2020 in this process the catalyst worked as a medium for the rapid transfer of electrons from the contaminants to the oxidant of pms and there is no chemical interaction between the catalyst and the pms ding et al 2021 since this mechanism requires catalysts with strong electrical conductivity it is often observed in carbon based catalysts and still rarely in metal based catalysts in order to monitor the electron migration in the reaction process the amperometric i t curves were recorded to probe the current signal as shown in fig 4 when bq was injected into the fe3s4 based system a significant positive current was immediately observed which demonstrated the transfer of electrons from bq to fe3s4 the injection of pms also produced a signal of positive current indicating that pms was serving as an electron donor to transfer electrons to fe3s4 this result also explained the rapid decomposition of pms in the bq fe3s4 pms system as shown in fig 3b in this case pms was decomposed as electron donor but no sulfate radicals were generated however the intensity of the positive current generated after pms injection was much lower than that when bq was injected suggesting there was also a transfer of electrons from the fe3s4 to pms therefore the generated negative current offset part of the positive current moreover a positive current was further observed after bpa injection based on the above results it seemed the electrons were first transferred from bpa to fe3s4 and subsequently to pms i e direct electron transfer was a plausible pathway for the bq assisted pms activation by fe3s4 for bpa degradation however the decomposition of pms in the fe3s4 bq pms system was only enhanced in the absence of bpa which was not influenced by bq in the presence of bpa fig 3b therefore the catalyst could not be considered to serve as an electron mediator to facilitate the electron transfer between bpa and pms although electronic migration indeed took place among bq fe3s4 pms and bpa in the system the behavior of bq assisted fe3s4 activation of pms was significantly different from the traditional direct electron transfer mechanism 3 2 4 new mechanism proposal bq has a strong reducing property dandawate et al 2010 duesteberg and waite 2007 had found addition of quinones into the fenton system could accelerate the conversion of fe iii to fe ii therefore in this work we speculated the bq might also promote the reduction of fe iii species and the variation of surface element valence of fe3s4 was analyzed as shown in fig 5 the fe 2p3 2 spectra can be fitted into two peaks at 711 2 and 713 3 ev corresponding to fe ii and fe iii respectively the fe 2p spectra of the fresh fe3s4 showed that the contents of fe ii and fe iii were 63 9 and 36 1 respectively after the fe3s4 was treated in bq solution for 30 min the surface fe ii content was not shown to be increased but rather decreased to 59 9 suggesting that bq could not directly promote the regeneration of fe ii on fe3s4 however previous study liu et al 2022 had demonstrated that s species in iron sulfide served as electron donor to regenerate fe ii during the process of pms activation therefore it should be considered whether the fe ii regeneration was indirectly promoted by bq via altering the s species on the surface of fe3s4 as shown in fig 5b the peak corresponding to so4 2 168 2 ev 169 4 ev decreased significantly from 40 to 16 4 after bq treatment and a new peak appeared at 166 9 ev which corresponded to so3 2 diao et al 2017 in addition the content of s2 2 163 5 ev 164 7 ev decreased from 51 9 to 44 9 after bq treatment while s2 161 4 ev 162 6 ev increased from 8 1 to 28 8 from the above results it could be concluded that the s species on the surface of fe3s4 were reduced in the presence of bq probably the regeneration of fe ii might be indirectly enhanced by the reduction of s species on the surface of iron sulfide in the presence of bq however as had been demonstrated in the previous sections the addition of bq didn t enhance the decomposition of pms and the production of ros in the presence of bpa therefore the accelerated regeneration of fe ii in this system cannot be directly related to the improved bpa degradation in fig 5b it was shown that the reduction of s species in fe3s4 was stronger when there was no bpa present and the decomposition of pms was significantly enhanced at this time fig 3b which indicating that bq mediated the electron transfer from pms to fe3s4 therefore the electrochemical property of bq was investigated by cyclic voltammetry cv as shown in fig 6 a bq had an anodic peak in the first positive going scan while a significant cathodic peak was also observed in the first negative going scan the cv curves of bq exhibited a symmetric structure which suggested that bq underwent a reversible reaction meanwhile the current density of both the anode and cathode peaks was well maintained indicating that the bq was not consumed with the increased cycles these results demonstrated due to the reversible process bq could not only release electrons but also accept electrons the surface variation of the catalyst in the reaction process was further characterized by ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 6b the peaks appeared at 890 cm 1 and 1115 cm 1 on the catalyst surface corresponded to the characteristic peaks of bq and pms respectively the peaks at 558 cm 1 and 1174 cm 1 corresponded to the characteristic peaks of bpa moreover a strong peak appeared at 1012 cm 1 was likely to be the connection bond formed between bq and pms this provided a medium for the electron transfer between bq and pms considering that bq concentration didn t decrease significantly during the reaction bq and pms were likely to develop metastable structures on the catalyst surface however when there was no bpa present in the system the production of bq pms complexes 1012 cm 1 was inhibited fig s7 this might be due to the rapid decomposition of bq and pms in the absence of bpa in the system which had been illustrated in section 3 2 2 the reaction processes in fe3s4 bq pms bpa system were further investigated by cyclic voltammetry as shown in fig s8 no cathodic peak was observed in blank system using fe3s4 as the working electrode a distinct cathodic peak was observed in the fe3s4 pms bpa system which represented the decomposition of pms by fe3s4 and when bq was present the active area of cv curve increased suggesting higher efficiency of electron transfer occurred in the system in addition the cathodic peak was shifted to the positive direction and the intensity was significantly declined implying the decomposition of pms became more difficult this provided a reasonable explanation for the decreased decomposition of pms shown in fig 3b the chemical evolution of pms on fe3s4 surface was further investigated by in situ raman technology as can be seen in fig 6c the peaks at 879 cm 1 and 1060 cm 1 stood for hso5 and the peak at 982 cm 1 stood for so4 2 bai et al 2022 ren et al 2020a the peaks of pms didn t change when only bq was added whereas when fe3s4 was added alone the peak of hso5 decreased and the peak of so4 2 increased indicating that pms was rapidly decomposed compared with the fe3s4 pms system the pms decomposition in bq fe3s4 pms became more obvious however when bpa was further added in the system the decomposition of pms was inhibited these results was in coincidence with that shown in fig 3b in addition there was a new peak emerged at 834 cm 1 in the pms bq fe3s4 bpa system which corresponded to the active peroxo species pms ren et al 2020a which should be one of the primary contributors to the bpa degradation in conclusion two pathways for degradation of bpa were identified in the bq assisted fe3s4 activating pms system as shown in fig 7 the first pathway was the radical pathway i e so4 was produced from the activation of pms by fe3s4 in this pathway the decomposition of pms was only controlled by the catalyst and bq didn t participate another pathway was the in situ synergistic reaction between bq and pms on the fe3s4 surface when bq and pms were jointly present in the system the active complexes between bq and pms bq pms would be generated on fe3s4 surface if bpa was present in the system the bpa was attacked by the bq pms and electrons were transferred to bq via pms bq thus supplied electrons to fe3s4 to reduce the s species the low valence s species would further reduce fe iii to fe ii and fe ii could transfer electrons to the pms in the complexes leading to the continuous activation of bq pms however if there was no bpa in the system the internal electronic cycling pms bq s fe pms on the surface of fe3s4 could not be maintained stably due to the lack of external electronic supplement from bpa as a result the formation of bq pms on fe3s4 surface would be inhibited and the free bq in water would be oxidized by the so4 produced in path 1 3 3 effect of reagent dosages in this section the effect of reagents fe3s4 bq pms dosage on bpa degradation were investigated as displayed in fig s9a c when the dosage of fe3s4 was 10 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency of bpa was only 43 2 in 30 min and it was improved to 98 1 with the fe3s4 dosage increasing to 20 mg l 1 when fe3s4 dosage was further increased to 30 and 40 mg l 1 100 bpa degradation can be achieved within 20 and 10 min respectively apparently fe3s4 dosage exhibited a significant effect on the degradation of bpa according to the reaction mechanism proposed in section 3 2 higher dosage of fe3s4 can provide more reaction sites for the formation of active complexes bq pms furthermore fig s9b showed that with the increase of bq concentration from 0 1 to 0 7 mm the degradation of bpa was also substantially improved with the efficiency increased from 69 4 to 100 the higher bq concentration was conductive to the adsorption of bq on the fe3s4 surface thus producing more active complexes for the degradation of bpa these results demonstrated again that the bq pms active complexes on fe3s4 surface were responsible for the enhanced degradation of bpa however it was illustrated fig s9c that the dosage of pms only exhibited a negligible effect on bpa degradation this could be attributed to the specificity of reaction path 2 section 3 2 4 after considering the effectiveness and economy the optimal doses of each agent can be determined as 20 mg l for fe3s4 0 5 mm for bq and 0 3 mm for pms respectively 3 4 bpa degradation pathway analysis in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the degradation pathway of bpa in the bq fe3s4 pms system the degradation intermediates were detected and analyzed by uplc ms the possible degradation pathways of bpa were proposed in fig 8 based on the identified intermediates as can be seen in the fe3s4 pms system the degradation of bpa was accomplished by the stepwise oxidation of phenolic hydroxyl groups when bq was present the degradation of bpa was initiated by dehydroxylation and β scission reaction chen et al 2022 proposed that so4 could attack the co bond to accomplish the dehydroxylation process in contrast it was supposed the bq pms might prefer to attack the cc bond to complete the β scission reaction the intermediate products were subsequently oxidized to short chain alcohols and eventually mineralized to co2 and h2o the presence of bq in the system also improved the mineralization of bpa greatly 51 1 vs 27 fig s3 4 conclusions in this work we introduced bq to enhance the pms activation by fe3s4 the degradation and mineralization of bpa were both shown to be significantly improved the experimental results demonstrated that bq didn t promote the production of ros but enhanced bpa degradation by a special pathway which was proposed for the first time bq and pms can form an active complex bq pms on the surface of fe3s4 the bpa can be effectively oxidized by the bq pms the electrons would be transferred to the s species on fe3s4 and finally lead to the regeneration of fe ii via the reversible redox process of bq in this system the bq would not be oxidized if bpa was present the discovery of the bq assisted fe3s4 activating pms mechanism could provide new strategies for construction of highly efficient pms based advanced

15339,the dissolved carbon concentration which is responsible for aquatic ecosystem productivity and water quality is tightly coupled with hydrological processes excess dissolved carbon may exacerbate eutrophication and hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems and lead to deterioration of water quality storm events dominate the dynamics of dissolved carbon concentrations and this nonlinear behavior exhibits significant time scale dependence here we identified inter and intra event variability in the dissolved carbon concentration discharge c q relationship in an agriculture intensive catchment the driving factors of c q hysteresis patterns for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and organic carbon doc were quantified by redundancy analysis combined with hierarchical partitioning at the inter event scale dic exhibited mainly clockwise hysteresis indicating an exhaustible proximal source e g groundwater however doc hysteresis was generally counter clockwise indicating distal and plentiful sources e g soil water in the agricultural catchment hierarchical partitioning showed that total rainfall peak discharge and flood intensity explained 28 38 of the total variation in c q hysteresis for dic and 39 87 for doc at the inter event scale at the intra event scale time series analysis of dissolved carbon concentration and discharge indicated the interconversion of supply limitation to transport limitation which depends on the activation of the specific dic or doc source zones these findings provide significant insights into understanding the dynamics of dissolved carbon during storm periods and are important for targeted watershed management practices aimed at reducing carbon loading to surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved inorganic carbon storm events agricultural catchment hysteresis pattern data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global riverine carbon exports from inland waters to the ocean has been estimated to be 0 86 0 97 pg c yr 1 and approximately 80 of this flux is transported in dissolved forms drake et al 2018 in surface waters dissolved carbon plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles and is tightly coupled with hydrological processes ran et al 2015 song et al 2020 werner et al 2019 compared to base flow storm events transport more carbon into receiving waters blaen et al 2017 godsey et al 2009 raymond et al 2016 climate change projections also suggest that extreme rainfall events will grow in frequency and magnitude in the future mistick and johnson 2020 this combined effect will accelerate the export of carbon and further threaten the security of freshwater systems and the global carbon cycle campeau et al 2017 therefore understanding dissolved carbon transport processes from potential sources such as agricultural landscapes to aquatic ecosystems is crucial for assessing terrestrial ocean carbon transport and developing effective watershed management strategies marwick et al 2015 marx et al 2017 schefuß et al 2016 elucidating and quantifying hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to storms helps improve the understanding of the sources transformations and fate of riverine dissolved carbon aguilera and melack 2018 dissolved carbon consists of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc and is sensitive to extreme flow conditions due to its water soluble characteristics wagner et al 2019 typically doc in headwater streams is mainly terrestrially derived and mobilized to streams through surface and shallow subsurface paths xu et al 2021 many studies have shown that storm events typically lead to higher doc concentrations in stream water as water sources shift from deep groundwater to shallow organic rich soil blaurock et al 2021 lee et al 2019 xu et al 2021 for dic the subsurface environment forms the largest inorganic carbon source area and can be activated during storms contributing disproportional carbon exports to riverine ecosystems perrin et al 2008 wen et al 2022 however whether the storm response of different carbon fractions is consistent remains poorly understood generally dissolved carbon responses to storms are reflected in the relationships between concentrations and discharge during a given storm godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2021 previous studies have focused mainly on storm hysteresis patterns which are time variant concentration discharge c q relationships liu et al 2021 lloyd et al 2016 hysteresis occurs when solute concentrations at a particular discharge rate differ during the rising and falling limb of storm hydrographs zhang et al 2021 for example mistick and johnson 2020 revealed the differences in the storm responses of doc in headwater streams with contrasting forest harvest histories based on observed hysteresis patterns in a forested watershed in vancouver british columbia vaughan et al 2017 reported that highly variable storm responses and loadings of doc were related to land cover types and seasonality through in situ sensor monitoring combined with hysteresis analysis these results confirm that dissolved carbon concentrations can exhibit highly variable and nonlinear behavior between storm events inter event however temporal variability in c q hysteresis patterns is rapidly evolving and cannot be captured by low frequency measurements during storm events intra event hotchkiss et al 2015 integration of inter event and intra event hysteresis analyses can enable a further understanding of dissolved carbon source availability storage and hydrologic pathways werner et al 2019 long term field monitoring data are typically analyzed using multivariate statistics to attribute the dissolved carbon response such as hysteresis type or numeric metrics to potential rainfall runoff and antecedent condition controls aich et al 2014 ducharme et al 2021 tiefenbacher et al 2021 rainfall can increase dissolved carbon concentrations in rivers through surface runoff or shallow soil water mccabe et al 2021 blaurock et al 2021 showed that a single 11 h storm event delivered more than half the average daily discharge and approximately four times the average daily doc loading moreover antecedent moisture conditions determine the timing of the establishment of catchment hydrological connectivity mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 haddadchi and hicks 2021 found that wet antecedent conditions were more likely to produce clockwise hysteresis because antecedent events mobilized distal carbon sources to the channel thus causing a rapid delivery of dissolved carbon in the subsequent storm events furthermore discharge metrics such as flood intensity imply the degree of mixing and export of dissolved carbon from different hydrological pathways musolff et al 2021 raymond et al 2016 yang et al 2015 faster storm flow peaks are expected to accelerate dissolved carbon exhaustion von freyberg et al 2014 however it is difficult to isolate a single factor due to the coupled effect of multiple variables clark et al 2010 roulet and moore 2006 redundancy analysis rda can quantify the role of explanatory variables in determining the response variable but there are multiple covariances among explanatory variables recently hierarchical partitioning combined with variance partitioning has been used in rda to assess the contribution of environmental factors to changes in community structure lai et al 2022 despite the widespread use of rda hierarchical partitioning allows us to explore how individual event variables affect the delivery of dissolved carbon the overall objective of this study was to identify major flow paths and source zone activation of dissolved carbon at the inter and intra event scales we hypothesized that the dic hysteresis pattern would be different from that of doc between selected events we further hypothesized that the activation of source zones and pathways of doc and dic would change continuously over time during the events these changes mostly depend on catchment hydrological connectivity we tested these hypotheses by assessing high frequency dissolved carbon concentration data from different storm events in an agriculture intensive catchment we conducted hysteresis analysis to quantify the storm response of dissolved carbon then rda based on hierarchical partitioning was utilized to investigate the controls on hysteresis finally we integrated the dynamics of dissolved carbon at different time scales to provide a comprehensive understanding of carbon source availability connectivity and transport pathways at the catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the wulongchi catchment 32 45 40 n 111 13 30 e in the northwestern region of hubei province china fig 1 it is a headwater catchment with a drainage area of 1 92 km2 the local climate is dominated by subtropical monsoons with an average temperature of 18 c the average annual rainfall is 798 mm 70 of which occurs from july to september zhou et al 2017 the altitude of the catchment ranges from 256 m to 402 m with an average of 329 m to control soil erosion since 2007 most farmlands on steep slopes 25 have been converted into terraces currently the predominant land uses in this catchment are farmland forested upland and residential areas accounting for 60 29 4 and 10 6 of the catchment area respectively the most common crops are corn winter wheat and peanut the bedrock of this catchment mainly consists of tertiary red sandstone and mudstone as well as a small proportion of limestone the topsoil layer is less than 1 m thick according to the usa soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 the soil types in the catchment are alfisols and entisols the soil bulk density ranges from 1 12 1 96 g cm3 and increases with soil depth conversely the hydraulic conductivity ks of the soil varies between 0 01 mm min and 19 5 mm min and decreases significantly along the soil profiles the ks of the surface soil 2 82 mm min is significantly larger than that of the deep soil 1 09 mm min moreover the bedrock is almost impermeable 2 2 sample collection and lab measurement a total of 724 water samples were collected in the catchment outlet from april to october 2021 rainfall data with a temporal resolution of 5 min and a 0 2 mm measurement increment were acquired from the local meteorological station the stream at the catchment outlet passed through a h flume and discharge was measured by a submersible pressure transmitter ptx1830 druck usa at 1 min intervals then these hydroclimatic data were summed to hourly and daily time steps for further analysis samples were manually collected from the outlet of the study catchment using a water sampler collection intervals for runoff including sampling prior to the onset of rainfall during rainfall and post event varied between 0 25 and 2 h depending on the rainfall intensity during non storm periods the frequency was adjusted to biweekly water samples were passed through a 0 45 μm nylon syringe filter collected in 100 ml polyethylene plastic bottles and stored in a refrigerated cabinet at 4 c we measured the dic doc concentration in the laboratory by a toc analyzer toc 4200 shimadzu hong kong china 2 3 delineation of storm events event delineation involves the identification of the start and end of a storm event we divided storm events according to the following principles first the minimum rainfall threshold of 5 mm and minimum event duration of 12 h were set according to standards described in a previous study mistick and johnson 2020 second all the storm events resulting in a 60 increase in flow compared to pre storm levels were taken into account considering the high flow during the monitoring period bowes et al 2015 third only the events in which water samples were collected from both the rising and the falling limbs were selected this storm delineation process allowed us to separate events containing multiple peaks and dissolved carbon to return to pre storm levels a total of 20 storm events were selected in this study sixteen potential hydrological controls were collated for each storm event table 1 we divided these variables into three categories runoff rainfall and antecedent the runoff variables include the runoff coefficient k flood intensity iflood time to peak flow tpeak peak discharge qpeak and event duration tstorm the rainfall variables include the total rainfall amounts ptotal duration of rainfall event train maximum rainfall intensity at 10 and 30 min resolutions i10 i30 and average rainfall intensity imean the antecedent variables include the amount of precipitation in the last 1 3 5 and 7 days ap1 ap3 ap5 and ap7 respectively initial baseflow qbase and the time gap between the previous and current storm peaks tgap 2 4 calculations of the hysteresis index and dissolved carbon load the hysteresis index hi was applied to quantify temporal solute concentration dynamics for each storm zuecco et al 2016 hi index is well structured and objective so that it is less restricted by data input e g negative data and can identify more hysteresis types e g figure eight hysteresis moreover hi index is also considered to be quite robust when measurement errors occur for large and long rainfall events the first step was to normalize the discharge and solute concentration data as follows 1 q t q t q m i n q m a x q m i n 2 c t c t c m i n c m a x c m i n where q t and c t are the normalized values of discharge and solute concentration at time t qmax and qmin are the maximum and minimum discharge in the storm and cmax and cmin are the maximum and minimum solute concentrations in the storm in the second step the differences in definite integrals were calculated for a given interval of i j as shown in eq 3 cr q and cf q represent the normalized solute concentration for the rising limb and the falling limb refer to eq 2 respectively 3 δ a i j a r i j a f i j i j c r q d q i j c f q d q where δa i j is the difference between the definite integrals on the rising and falling curves computed for a certain interval ar i j and af i j are definite integrals calculated by the rising and falling limbs at certain intervals respectively i j are the lower and upper limits of the integration respectively and q is the normalized discharge clockwise loops have all δa i j 0 and counter clockwise loops have all δa i j 0 complex loops have all δa i j 1 1 while figure eight loops are characterized by δamin 0 and δamax 0 where δamin and δamax are the minimum and maximum values of δa i j respectively then the sum of the definite integrals was the proposed hysteresis index hi eq 4 4 h i k 1 n δ a i j where k represents the number of intervals used for the calculation and n represents the number of the overall intervals hi ranges from 1 to 1 positive hi values suggest a clockwise hysteresis pattern negative hi values indicate a counter clockwise hysteresis pattern and the absolute value of hi shows the magnitude of hysteresis loops the flushing index fi describes the differences in constituent concentrations between the initial and peak discharge after normalizing the discharge and concentration data the fi is calculated as follows vaughan et al 2017 5 f i c q p e a k n o r m c q i n i t i a l n o r m where cqpeak norm and cqinitial norm are the normalized solute concentrations at the point of peaking and initial discharge respectively similarly the fi values also range from 1 to 1 positive values indicate a flushing effect on the rising limb while negative values indicate a diluting effect on the rising limb for each storm we integrated the dic and doc loads to calculate the export mass of each solute the equation used in this step is adapted from bender et al 2018 6 φ l o a d 0 0036 0 τ q t c t d t τ where φload is the total load kg h c t is the concentration of solute mg l q t is the transient discharge l s t is the time h and τ is the duration of each storm h 2 5 data analysis we used an independent sample t test to detect the differences in storm response between doc and dic n 20 a critical value of p 0 05 was selected to determine statistical significance rda is a constrained principal components analysis of the fitted value matrix of a multiple linear regression between a matrix of response variables and a matrix of explanatory variables and is an extension of multi response regression analysis capblancq and forester 2021 the regression coefficient is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between the response variable and the explanatory variable this coefficient describes the proportion of the total variation in the response variable due to the linear relationship between the response variables and the explanatory variables here we applied rda to explore the relationships between hydroclimatic variables and the storm response of dissolved carbon due to the multicollinearity of explanatory variables we used pearson correlation analysis to screen appropriate explanatory and response variables before implementing rda the individual effect of each explanatory variable was obtained using the hierarchical partitioning method lai et al 2022 this statistical approach allows the problem of covariance between environmental factors to be solved thus obtaining an accurate interpretation for each variable r software was used to perform all the statistical analyses and create the figures r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 time series of discharge rainfall and dissolved carbon concentration the total rainfall during the study period was 925 6 mm which accounted for 89 6 of the annual rainfall 1033 mm in 2021 the rainfall amount in the study year was 29 45 greater than the average annual rainfall 798 mm the daily average discharge was 50 8 l s and showed a significant seasonal variation with high summer flows june august accounting for 70 of the total discharge fig 2 the highest instantaneous discharge of 724 l s occurred in august 2020 in response to the highest single rainfall event when 87 2 mm of rain fell in 24 h fig 2a streamflow responded rapidly to storms regardless of the event size discharges typically increased by 100 and in some cases by as much 400 within a few hours of the onset of each rainfall event and then returned to baseflow conditions within 3 days table 1 throughout the study period the mean stream dic and doc concentrations were 28 76 mg l and 7 58 mg l respectively no long term trends were observed in doc concentrations but dic concentrations increased at the beginning of the study period decreased from june to august and then continued to decrease in september and october fig 2d and c 3 2 storm response of dissolved carbon at the inter event scale significant differences were found between dic and doc in the baseflow concentration peak concentration absolute difference relative difference flushing index and load fig 3 the average peak concentration of dic for all storm events n 20 36 5 2 4 mg l was significantly higher than that of doc 12 5 2 4 mg l p 0 001 the absolute difference in dic concentration was also significantly higher 9 59 3 25 mg l than that in doc 6 24 2 4 mg l p 0 001 however the relative difference in dic concentration 47 33 was significantly lower than that in the doc 102 78 p 0 001 similarly the load in the doc was only one third of that in the dic in addition the flushing index for doc was significantly higher 0 22 0 08 than that for dic 0 07 0 11 p 0 05 the hysteresis index was significantly different between the two carbon fractions dic 0 05 0 03 doc 0 13 0 08 p 0 05 for the selected storm events dic and doc showed different hysteresis patterns which are exhibited in fig 4 for dic clockwise hysteresis was the most frequent 40 followed by complex hysteresis 25 however for doc the hysteresis type was dominated by counter clockwise 50 with the smallest proportion of clockwise 10 in general both dic and doc had approximately 20 complex or unrecognizable storm events and contributed a proportion of the total carbon 3 3 storm response of dissolved carbon at the intra event scale according to the hysteresis types we selected four typical storm events to analyze the mobilization and export process of dissolved carbon during the events which occurred on august 30 event 19 may 14 event 2 july 7 event 8 and august 13 event 17 fig 5 the storm responses of dic and doc showed different behaviors during these events dissolved carbon concentrations in event 2 were primarily diluted in response to discharge increments and the lowest concentrations were 19 4 mg l for dic and 4 9 mg l for doc under high flow conditions during hydrograph recession however dic and doc concentrations showed a rapid recovery and eventually rose above pre event concentrations event 8 with negative hi values underwent opposite processes to event 2 and dissolved carbon concentrations recovered very slowly during the falling limb dic and doc consistently produced elevated concentrations along the falling limb which caused the discharge to peak before the concentrations the lags of dic and doc in event 2 are 2 h and 5 h respectively which are significantly smaller than those of event 8 as shown in event 19 dissolved carbon concentrations were flushed during the rising limb and reached the peak before discharge during the falling limb both dic and doc concentrations experienced a slow recovery and eventually fell the baseflow level in contrast the discharge peak in event 19 was several times that of the other three rainfall events accompanied by 98 2 mm of rainfall for event 17 discharge had two peaks and the main peak 1 81 mm h preceded the first doc peak dic concentrations fluctuated up and down during the storm but generally showed a decreasing trend as a result both dic and doc exhibited complex hysteresis 3 4 determinants of dissolved carbon storm response the controls of hydroclimatic variables on the storm response hi fi and φload of dissolved carbon were identified by rda fig 6 a a total of 61 4 of the variation in the dic response was explained by the first two axes the first rda axis accounted for 41 4 of the variation mainly contributed by ptotal and qpeak while the second rda axis accounted for 20 0 which was mainly contributed by t peak t storm and i flood fig 6a almost all the hydroclimatic variables in the rda model had significant positive correlations with φload but negative correlations with hi and fi moreover tpeak was positively correlated with fi p 0 05 for doc 83 5 of the total variation was explained by the first two axes based on grouping of the explanatory variables the first axis typically represented storm magnitude qpeak ptotal whereas the second axis represented rainfall characteristics train i30 contrary to dic there was a significant positive correlation between fi and φload and a negative correlation with hi for the storm response of doc the results of the variation partitioning analysis are summarized in fig 6b runoff parameters were the main drivers of storm response for both dic and doc explaining 55 4 and 48 6 of the storm response respectively rainfall characteristics explained 25 6 and 34 8 of the storm response for dic and doc respectively antecedent conditions were of lesser importance for generating a significant carbon response hierarchical partitioning indicated that iflood 10 54 had the greatest influence on the dic storm response followed by ptotal 9 38 and qpeak 10 54 similar to dic the top three explanatory variables of storm response for doc were qpeak 15 97 iflood 13 1 and ptotal 10 8 interestingly tpeak was observed to have a greater impact on the storm response of dic than doc these results suggested that runoff and rainfall were key factors in controlling the storm response of dissolved carbon 4 discussion 4 1 effects of anthropogenic disturbances on dissolved carbon transport and production anthropogenic disturbance can significantly alter the hydrological conditions of a watershed thereby affecting the transport and production of dissolved carbon in our study the dissolved carbon concentration was higher than that reported in many other agricultural catchments in europe and north america evans et al 2017 hotchkiss et al 2015 tunaley et al 2017 this may be attributed to the hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical cycle during high flow periods rapid water flow through and across surface soils can deliver carbonaceous material to the stream and reduce respiration losses of dissolved carbon wallin et al 2010 our study is consistent with the pulse shunt concept where extreme hydrological events dominated most of the output of river carbon drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2016 during baseflow periods most of the dissolved carbon is delivered via subsurface flow paths that originate in terrestrial ecosystems and establish hydrologic connections with the stream jung et al 2020 in our catchment extensive ditches and tile drainage existed in the upper catchment while in the lowland areas numerous roadways were distributed hence lateral export of dissolved carbon via shallow or deeper flow paths can effectively recharge the river channel and maintain the dissolved carbon concentration in the stream outram et al 2016 xu et al 2021 moreover many channels were artificially straightened deepened and widened during the periods of terrace construction further improving the structural connectivity of the catchment zhou et al 2017 biogeochemically dissolved co2 is dic the sum of co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 zhi and li 2020 weathering erosion of land rocks and co2 in soils are the natural sources of dic qin et al 2020 in this paper we speculate that dic is mainly derived from riparian zones and subsurface aquifers within our catchment rainfall inputs cause rock weathering products accumulated in the soil to seep into the groundwater or store in the riparian zone and subsequently recharge the channel during baseflow conditions moreover the widespread use of nitrogen fertilizer e g ammonium bicarbonate in small agricultural watersheds may accelerate the weathering of carbonates and increase the output flux of dic perrin et al 2008 khamis et al 2017 doc mainly refers to hydrocarbons humus and esters in water wetlands are often assumed to be near infinite doc sources zarnetske et al 2018 and they tend to occur in lowlands where connectivity with the stream network is initiated by even small hydrologic events however our study area is dominated by cropland 56 4 and the wetland area 3 6 is almost negligible fig 1 doc source zones from terrestrial ecosystems are widely distributed in small agricultural watersheds whether in leaf litter livestock manure fertilizers crop stubble or shallow organic enriched soils which can increase the concentration of riverine doc knapp et al 2020 blaen et al 2017 agricultural practices e g fertilizer application tend to facilitate the enrichment of topsoil organic matter stewart et al 2022 considering a more homogenous spatial distribution of doc in an agriculture landscape we believe that doc source areas are derived from cropland forested areas and riparian zones at the same time hydrological conditions that support doc mobilization also promote the generation of doc zarnetske et al 2018 storms or other hydrological events strengthen the linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems reconnecting previously isolated watershed components through surface and subsurface paths where doc has accumulated stewart et al 2022 ebeling et al 2020 4 2 dissolved carbon mobilization and export at the inter event scale the hysteresis index has the potential to indicate inter event variability in solute dynamics thus facilitating a conceptual understanding of watershed hydrological connectivity transport pathways and source availability najafi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 some indices such as himid hiaich and hilloyd provided detailed information and proved to be useful for the purpose for which they were developed aich et al 2014 lawler et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016 but the applicability of these indices was limited for identifying more complex events e g figure eight hysteresis subjectivity and negative data e g delta values that describe the isotope composition of streamflow we used the hysteresis index to quantify dissolved carbon dynamics during the monitoring period the hysteresis patterns for dic and doc were significantly different thereby providing strong support for our first hypothesis dic exhibited a clockwise hysteresis pattern and the flushing index was generally negative figs 3 and 4 the negative flushing index indicating a diluting effect suggested that proximal dic sources are insufficient to increase stream water concentrations on the rising limb vaughan et al 2017 moreover the clockwise hysteresis loop indicates that dic concentrations are lower on the falling limb than the rising limb and that distal dic sources are not plentiful enough and or unable to maintain long term hydrological connectivity to the stream during sampling periods aguilera and melack 2018 liu et al 2021 based on these results we concluded that dic was predominantly derived from the riparian zone or groundwater bender et al 2018 riparian zones often accumulate partial storage of inorganic carbon while groundwater contains high concentrations of dic before the event and these zones are easily activated during the storm quickflow from the riparian zone at the beginning of a storm may reduce the dic concentration in the stream water which leads to depletion from proximal sources long term hydrological connectivity between distal groundwater and streams cannot be maintained due to soil moisture changes resulting in reduced availability of dic rich groundwater the combination of riparian quickflow and hydrological connectivity shapes the observed event scale c q pattern to our knowledge few studies have investigated storm dic hysteresis at the event scale qin et al 2020 the storm response of dic concentration we observed fit well with the conceptual model described by zhi and li 2020 which revealed a quantitative relationship between solute export patterns and shallow versus deep concentration contrasts highlighting the often overlooked role of nutrient distribution over depths hierarchical partitioning revealed that dic hysteresis was driven by iflood and ptotal fig 6b suggesting that hydrological thresholds may exist for the activation of dic source zones wang et al 2022 balen et al 2017 for example old water pre event water previously stored in the soil can be replaced by new water rainfall which has a higher concentration of inorganic carbon stockinger et al 2015 some model results also showed that droughts may promote the mineralization of organic carbon into inorganic carbon and export it laterally as dic into the stream wen et al 2022 zhi and li 2020 zarnetske et al 2018 the riparian zone plays an important role in regulating dic concentrations as it responds more quickly than other landscape types to storm events pavlin et al 2021 song et al 2020 song et al 2021 doc exhibited a counter clockwise hysteresis pattern for the selected events figs 3 and 4 a positive flushing index suggests that the transport of proximal sources is enough to increase stream doc concentrations on the rising limb while the counter clockwise loop indicates that doc concentrations are more abundant on the falling limb than the rising limb and that distal sources of doc are activated later in the storm as hydrologic pathways connect and or that transport time for doc is greater than that of water in the stream channel mihiranga et al 2021 musolff et al 2021 wagner et al 2019 this pattern is consistent with a study reported for 1 006 watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions where doc flux was almost always transport limitation zarnetske et al 2018 the explanatory mechanisms behind this mainly include the spatial distribution of doc source zones and hydrological connectivity on the one hand shallow and deep hypotheses suggest that the vertical distribution of nutrients shapes stream chemistry and support our results zhi and li 2020 the abundance of organic matter and roots typically decreases exponentially with depth which results in more enrichment of organic carbon in shallow soils lajtha and jones 2018 moreover our catchment has distinct forested upland sources of organic matter e g leaf litter which are likely distal and hydrologically connected to the stream via numerous ditches roadways or tile drainage networks during storms chen et al 2021 this finding was supported by the observed links between hi and i30 and ap5 and ptotal fig 6a on the other hand storms reduce co2 upward emission to the atmosphere and organic carbon mineralization but promote shallow flow paths carbonate dissolution doc production and lateral fluxes of inorganic carbon into streams wen et al 2022 high flows via shallow permeable soils increase the proportion of young water which is typically more enriched with organic materials pavlin et al 2021 although agricultural practices vary greatly around the world most small agricultural watersheds are rich in doc source zones chen et al 2021 these doc source zones e g domestic sewage may increase riverine doc concentrations when water flows through them therefore we believe that doc is mainly derived from near surface flow e g soil water 4 3 identification of dissolved carbon source zone activation at the intra event scale intra event variation in hysteretic behavior was observed in c q relationships for both dic and doc fig 5 reflecting the switch of storm responses between supply limitation and transport limitation mistick and johnson 2020 supply limitation occurs when solutes mobilized during storms are limited by the mass contributed by specific sources mihiranga et al 2021 transport limitation suggests that discharge variability determines when readily available solutes are mobilized basu et al 2010 in agricultural catchments supply limitation can coexist with transport limitation within storms if sources change and different parts of the catchment contribute to the hydrograph at different points in time richardson et al 2020 we selected event 8 and event 2 to identify the dynamics of dissolved carbon source zones activation and the switches of transport and supply limitation during rainfall and the results supported our second hypothesis well both dic and doc exhibited a counter clockwise hysteresis in event 8 fig 5b indicating transport limitation behavior this behavior can be attributed to catchment hydrological connectivity hydrological connectivity which potentially refers primarily to connectivity between hillslopes and streams leads to short term activation of specific carbon source areas surface runoff doc versus deep groundwater sourced dic contributing to the high dissolved carbon concentration of stream xiao et al 2021 the positive flushing index of dissolved carbon dic 0 44 doc 0 63 implies that the proximal source is plentiful during the rising phase of the hydrograph fig 5b the potential sources at the start of the event may be derived from riparian zones riparian zones are hydrologically well connected to the stream channel with the potential to deliver dissolved carbon rapidly at the start of storm events wallin et al 2010 in this event higher antecedent rainfall ap5 26 4 mm may promote the rapid establishment of riparian zone connectivity with streams meanwhile soil water charged with high co2 and doc can also recharge more into the deeper subsurface under wet conditions thereby enhancing dic and doc lateral fluxes wen et al 2022 the negative hysteresis index of dissolved carbon dic 0 41 doc 0 34 suggests that the solute concentration is higher on the falling limb than the rising limb fig 5b the differences in dissolved carbon concentrations are due to the availability of distal sources e g leaf litter and groundwater during wet periods near surface flow begins to transport high concentration dissolved carbon as the hillslope riparian stream continuum is established blaurock et al 2021 however dissolved carbon hysteresis was figure eight during event 2 exhibiting complex behavior fig 5a the hysteresis index was positive for dic 0 24 and negative for doc 0 04 dissolved carbon tends to be supply limitation during the rising limb fig 5a indicating an exhaustible proximal source this possible source likely results from depletion of available sources from riparian zones due to dry antecedent conditions drought is more likely to reduce lateral export of dissolved carbon via shallow and deeper groundwater flow paths thereby causing a slow delivery of dissolved carbon in the subsequent storm events sherriff et al 2016 moreover we observed lower antecedent rainfall prior to event 2 ap5 3 2 mm which supports our results conversely dissolved carbon tends to be transport limitation on the falling limb fig 5a implying the mobilization of more distant sources knapp et al 2020 considering the discontinuity of rainfall slow subsurface pathways may dominate the transport process and further transport previously trapped dissolved carbon sources along water flow paths zhi and li 2020 in this case the very slow increase and decrease in dissolved carbon concentrations led to figure eight shaped moreover we found that the frequency of occurrence of the figure eight hysteresis was 15 for dic and 25 for doc across all events fig 4 based on these results we believe that event characteristics can alter the storm response of solutes from transport limitation to supply limitation or vice versa 5 conclusion in this study high frequency field measurements allowed the hysteresis index to quantify dissolved carbon c q relationships between and during storm events we observed significant differences in dissolved carbon dynamics at the inter and intra event scales dic hysteresis was mainly clockwise among the events suggesting that riparian zones or subsurface aquifers was the primary dic source zones groundwater is the major transport pathway for dic in contrast doc mainly exhibited counter clockwise hysteresis at the event scale we attributed this to hydrological connectivity that activates more distant and plentiful source zones in agricultural systems near surface flows e g soil water are the major transport pathways for doc hierarchical partitioning illustrated that rainfall and runoff conditions dominated the storm response of dissolved carbon and that antecedent wetness conditions were less important from a process based perspective event characteristic may alter the dissolved carbon storm response from transport limitation to supply limitation or vice versa large amounts of carbon were mobilized into the river during the storms resulting in riverine dissolved carbon concentration levels several times higher than those under baseflow conditions we integrated inter scale and intra event dissolved carbon dynamics to identify major sources and transport pathways which facilitated the accurate estimation of carbon export from rivers our investigations can also be applied to explore other types of pollutants given the connectivity transport pathways and spatial and temporal distribution of pollutant in catchments in the future the widespread use of in situ sensors will enable longer time series of storm event monitoring even if researchers cannot reach the field such work combined with water transit time analyses will further our ability to quantify the cascading effect among the emissions removals and loads of dissolved carbon in watersheds and provide a theoretical basis for more accurate models of carbon cycling declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the

15339,the dissolved carbon concentration which is responsible for aquatic ecosystem productivity and water quality is tightly coupled with hydrological processes excess dissolved carbon may exacerbate eutrophication and hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems and lead to deterioration of water quality storm events dominate the dynamics of dissolved carbon concentrations and this nonlinear behavior exhibits significant time scale dependence here we identified inter and intra event variability in the dissolved carbon concentration discharge c q relationship in an agriculture intensive catchment the driving factors of c q hysteresis patterns for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and organic carbon doc were quantified by redundancy analysis combined with hierarchical partitioning at the inter event scale dic exhibited mainly clockwise hysteresis indicating an exhaustible proximal source e g groundwater however doc hysteresis was generally counter clockwise indicating distal and plentiful sources e g soil water in the agricultural catchment hierarchical partitioning showed that total rainfall peak discharge and flood intensity explained 28 38 of the total variation in c q hysteresis for dic and 39 87 for doc at the inter event scale at the intra event scale time series analysis of dissolved carbon concentration and discharge indicated the interconversion of supply limitation to transport limitation which depends on the activation of the specific dic or doc source zones these findings provide significant insights into understanding the dynamics of dissolved carbon during storm periods and are important for targeted watershed management practices aimed at reducing carbon loading to surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved inorganic carbon storm events agricultural catchment hysteresis pattern data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global riverine carbon exports from inland waters to the ocean has been estimated to be 0 86 0 97 pg c yr 1 and approximately 80 of this flux is transported in dissolved forms drake et al 2018 in surface waters dissolved carbon plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles and is tightly coupled with hydrological processes ran et al 2015 song et al 2020 werner et al 2019 compared to base flow storm events transport more carbon into receiving waters blaen et al 2017 godsey et al 2009 raymond et al 2016 climate change projections also suggest that extreme rainfall events will grow in frequency and magnitude in the future mistick and johnson 2020 this combined effect will accelerate the export of carbon and further threaten the security of freshwater systems and the global carbon cycle campeau et al 2017 therefore understanding dissolved carbon transport processes from potential sources such as agricultural landscapes to aquatic ecosystems is crucial for assessing terrestrial ocean carbon transport and developing effective watershed management strategies marwick et al 2015 marx et al 2017 schefuß et al 2016 elucidating and quantifying hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to storms helps improve the understanding of the sources transformations and fate of riverine dissolved carbon aguilera and melack 2018 dissolved carbon consists of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc and is sensitive to extreme flow conditions due to its water soluble characteristics wagner et al 2019 typically doc in headwater streams is mainly terrestrially derived and mobilized to streams through surface and shallow subsurface paths xu et al 2021 many studies have shown that storm events typically lead to higher doc concentrations in stream water as water sources shift from deep groundwater to shallow organic rich soil blaurock et al 2021 lee et al 2019 xu et al 2021 for dic the subsurface environment forms the largest inorganic carbon source area and can be activated during storms contributing disproportional carbon exports to riverine ecosystems perrin et al 2008 wen et al 2022 however whether the storm response of different carbon fractions is consistent remains poorly understood generally dissolved carbon responses to storms are reflected in the relationships between concentrations and discharge during a given storm godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2021 previous studies have focused mainly on storm hysteresis patterns which are time variant concentration discharge c q relationships liu et al 2021 lloyd et al 2016 hysteresis occurs when solute concentrations at a particular discharge rate differ during the rising and falling limb of storm hydrographs zhang et al 2021 for example mistick and johnson 2020 revealed the differences in the storm responses of doc in headwater streams with contrasting forest harvest histories based on observed hysteresis patterns in a forested watershed in vancouver british columbia vaughan et al 2017 reported that highly variable storm responses and loadings of doc were related to land cover types and seasonality through in situ sensor monitoring combined with hysteresis analysis these results confirm that dissolved carbon concentrations can exhibit highly variable and nonlinear behavior between storm events inter event however temporal variability in c q hysteresis patterns is rapidly evolving and cannot be captured by low frequency measurements during storm events intra event hotchkiss et al 2015 integration of inter event and intra event hysteresis analyses can enable a further understanding of dissolved carbon source availability storage and hydrologic pathways werner et al 2019 long term field monitoring data are typically analyzed using multivariate statistics to attribute the dissolved carbon response such as hysteresis type or numeric metrics to potential rainfall runoff and antecedent condition controls aich et al 2014 ducharme et al 2021 tiefenbacher et al 2021 rainfall can increase dissolved carbon concentrations in rivers through surface runoff or shallow soil water mccabe et al 2021 blaurock et al 2021 showed that a single 11 h storm event delivered more than half the average daily discharge and approximately four times the average daily doc loading moreover antecedent moisture conditions determine the timing of the establishment of catchment hydrological connectivity mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 haddadchi and hicks 2021 found that wet antecedent conditions were more likely to produce clockwise hysteresis because antecedent events mobilized distal carbon sources to the channel thus causing a rapid delivery of dissolved carbon in the subsequent storm events furthermore discharge metrics such as flood intensity imply the degree of mixing and export of dissolved carbon from different hydrological pathways musolff et al 2021 raymond et al 2016 yang et al 2015 faster storm flow peaks are expected to accelerate dissolved carbon exhaustion von freyberg et al 2014 however it is difficult to isolate a single factor due to the coupled effect of multiple variables clark et al 2010 roulet and moore 2006 redundancy analysis rda can quantify the role of explanatory variables in determining the response variable but there are multiple covariances among explanatory variables recently hierarchical partitioning combined with variance partitioning has been used in rda to assess the contribution of environmental factors to changes in community structure lai et al 2022 despite the widespread use of rda hierarchical partitioning allows us to explore how individual event variables affect the delivery of dissolved carbon the overall objective of this study was to identify major flow paths and source zone activation of dissolved carbon at the inter and intra event scales we hypothesized that the dic hysteresis pattern would be different from that of doc between selected events we further hypothesized that the activation of source zones and pathways of doc and dic would change continuously over time during the events these changes mostly depend on catchment hydrological connectivity we tested these hypotheses by assessing high frequency dissolved carbon concentration data from different storm events in an agriculture intensive catchment we conducted hysteresis analysis to quantify the storm response of dissolved carbon then rda based on hierarchical partitioning was utilized to investigate the controls on hysteresis finally we integrated the dynamics of dissolved carbon at different time scales to provide a comprehensive understanding of carbon source availability connectivity and transport pathways at the catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the wulongchi catchment 32 45 40 n 111 13 30 e in the northwestern region of hubei province china fig 1 it is a headwater catchment with a drainage area of 1 92 km2 the local climate is dominated by subtropical monsoons with an average temperature of 18 c the average annual rainfall is 798 mm 70 of which occurs from july to september zhou et al 2017 the altitude of the catchment ranges from 256 m to 402 m with an average of 329 m to control soil erosion since 2007 most farmlands on steep slopes 25 have been converted into terraces currently the predominant land uses in this catchment are farmland forested upland and residential areas accounting for 60 29 4 and 10 6 of the catchment area respectively the most common crops are corn winter wheat and peanut the bedrock of this catchment mainly consists of tertiary red sandstone and mudstone as well as a small proportion of limestone the topsoil layer is less than 1 m thick according to the usa soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 the soil types in the catchment are alfisols and entisols the soil bulk density ranges from 1 12 1 96 g cm3 and increases with soil depth conversely the hydraulic conductivity ks of the soil varies between 0 01 mm min and 19 5 mm min and decreases significantly along the soil profiles the ks of the surface soil 2 82 mm min is significantly larger than that of the deep soil 1 09 mm min moreover the bedrock is almost impermeable 2 2 sample collection and lab measurement a total of 724 water samples were collected in the catchment outlet from april to october 2021 rainfall data with a temporal resolution of 5 min and a 0 2 mm measurement increment were acquired from the local meteorological station the stream at the catchment outlet passed through a h flume and discharge was measured by a submersible pressure transmitter ptx1830 druck usa at 1 min intervals then these hydroclimatic data were summed to hourly and daily time steps for further analysis samples were manually collected from the outlet of the study catchment using a water sampler collection intervals for runoff including sampling prior to the onset of rainfall during rainfall and post event varied between 0 25 and 2 h depending on the rainfall intensity during non storm periods the frequency was adjusted to biweekly water samples were passed through a 0 45 μm nylon syringe filter collected in 100 ml polyethylene plastic bottles and stored in a refrigerated cabinet at 4 c we measured the dic doc concentration in the laboratory by a toc analyzer toc 4200 shimadzu hong kong china 2 3 delineation of storm events event delineation involves the identification of the start and end of a storm event we divided storm events according to the following principles first the minimum rainfall threshold of 5 mm and minimum event duration of 12 h were set according to standards described in a previous study mistick and johnson 2020 second all the storm events resulting in a 60 increase in flow compared to pre storm levels were taken into account considering the high flow during the monitoring period bowes et al 2015 third only the events in which water samples were collected from both the rising and the falling limbs were selected this storm delineation process allowed us to separate events containing multiple peaks and dissolved carbon to return to pre storm levels a total of 20 storm events were selected in this study sixteen potential hydrological controls were collated for each storm event table 1 we divided these variables into three categories runoff rainfall and antecedent the runoff variables include the runoff coefficient k flood intensity iflood time to peak flow tpeak peak discharge qpeak and event duration tstorm the rainfall variables include the total rainfall amounts ptotal duration of rainfall event train maximum rainfall intensity at 10 and 30 min resolutions i10 i30 and average rainfall intensity imean the antecedent variables include the amount of precipitation in the last 1 3 5 and 7 days ap1 ap3 ap5 and ap7 respectively initial baseflow qbase and the time gap between the previous and current storm peaks tgap 2 4 calculations of the hysteresis index and dissolved carbon load the hysteresis index hi was applied to quantify temporal solute concentration dynamics for each storm zuecco et al 2016 hi index is well structured and objective so that it is less restricted by data input e g negative data and can identify more hysteresis types e g figure eight hysteresis moreover hi index is also considered to be quite robust when measurement errors occur for large and long rainfall events the first step was to normalize the discharge and solute concentration data as follows 1 q t q t q m i n q m a x q m i n 2 c t c t c m i n c m a x c m i n where q t and c t are the normalized values of discharge and solute concentration at time t qmax and qmin are the maximum and minimum discharge in the storm and cmax and cmin are the maximum and minimum solute concentrations in the storm in the second step the differences in definite integrals were calculated for a given interval of i j as shown in eq 3 cr q and cf q represent the normalized solute concentration for the rising limb and the falling limb refer to eq 2 respectively 3 δ a i j a r i j a f i j i j c r q d q i j c f q d q where δa i j is the difference between the definite integrals on the rising and falling curves computed for a certain interval ar i j and af i j are definite integrals calculated by the rising and falling limbs at certain intervals respectively i j are the lower and upper limits of the integration respectively and q is the normalized discharge clockwise loops have all δa i j 0 and counter clockwise loops have all δa i j 0 complex loops have all δa i j 1 1 while figure eight loops are characterized by δamin 0 and δamax 0 where δamin and δamax are the minimum and maximum values of δa i j respectively then the sum of the definite integrals was the proposed hysteresis index hi eq 4 4 h i k 1 n δ a i j where k represents the number of intervals used for the calculation and n represents the number of the overall intervals hi ranges from 1 to 1 positive hi values suggest a clockwise hysteresis pattern negative hi values indicate a counter clockwise hysteresis pattern and the absolute value of hi shows the magnitude of hysteresis loops the flushing index fi describes the differences in constituent concentrations between the initial and peak discharge after normalizing the discharge and concentration data the fi is calculated as follows vaughan et al 2017 5 f i c q p e a k n o r m c q i n i t i a l n o r m where cqpeak norm and cqinitial norm are the normalized solute concentrations at the point of peaking and initial discharge respectively similarly the fi values also range from 1 to 1 positive values indicate a flushing effect on the rising limb while negative values indicate a diluting effect on the rising limb for each storm we integrated the dic and doc loads to calculate the export mass of each solute the equation used in this step is adapted from bender et al 2018 6 φ l o a d 0 0036 0 τ q t c t d t τ where φload is the total load kg h c t is the concentration of solute mg l q t is the transient discharge l s t is the time h and τ is the duration of each storm h 2 5 data analysis we used an independent sample t test to detect the differences in storm response between doc and dic n 20 a critical value of p 0 05 was selected to determine statistical significance rda is a constrained principal components analysis of the fitted value matrix of a multiple linear regression between a matrix of response variables and a matrix of explanatory variables and is an extension of multi response regression analysis capblancq and forester 2021 the regression coefficient is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between the response variable and the explanatory variable this coefficient describes the proportion of the total variation in the response variable due to the linear relationship between the response variables and the explanatory variables here we applied rda to explore the relationships between hydroclimatic variables and the storm response of dissolved carbon due to the multicollinearity of explanatory variables we used pearson correlation analysis to screen appropriate explanatory and response variables before implementing rda the individual effect of each explanatory variable was obtained using the hierarchical partitioning method lai et al 2022 this statistical approach allows the problem of covariance between environmental factors to be solved thus obtaining an accurate interpretation for each variable r software was used to perform all the statistical analyses and create the figures r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 time series of discharge rainfall and dissolved carbon concentration the total rainfall during the study period was 925 6 mm which accounted for 89 6 of the annual rainfall 1033 mm in 2021 the rainfall amount in the study year was 29 45 greater than the average annual rainfall 798 mm the daily average discharge was 50 8 l s and showed a significant seasonal variation with high summer flows june august accounting for 70 of the total discharge fig 2 the highest instantaneous discharge of 724 l s occurred in august 2020 in response to the highest single rainfall event when 87 2 mm of rain fell in 24 h fig 2a streamflow responded rapidly to storms regardless of the event size discharges typically increased by 100 and in some cases by as much 400 within a few hours of the onset of each rainfall event and then returned to baseflow conditions within 3 days table 1 throughout the study period the mean stream dic and doc concentrations were 28 76 mg l and 7 58 mg l respectively no long term trends were observed in doc concentrations but dic concentrations increased at the beginning of the study period decreased from june to august and then continued to decrease in september and october fig 2d and c 3 2 storm response of dissolved carbon at the inter event scale significant differences were found between dic and doc in the baseflow concentration peak concentration absolute difference relative difference flushing index and load fig 3 the average peak concentration of dic for all storm events n 20 36 5 2 4 mg l was significantly higher than that of doc 12 5 2 4 mg l p 0 001 the absolute difference in dic concentration was also significantly higher 9 59 3 25 mg l than that in doc 6 24 2 4 mg l p 0 001 however the relative difference in dic concentration 47 33 was significantly lower than that in the doc 102 78 p 0 001 similarly the load in the doc was only one third of that in the dic in addition the flushing index for doc was significantly higher 0 22 0 08 than that for dic 0 07 0 11 p 0 05 the hysteresis index was significantly different between the two carbon fractions dic 0 05 0 03 doc 0 13 0 08 p 0 05 for the selected storm events dic and doc showed different hysteresis patterns which are exhibited in fig 4 for dic clockwise hysteresis was the most frequent 40 followed by complex hysteresis 25 however for doc the hysteresis type was dominated by counter clockwise 50 with the smallest proportion of clockwise 10 in general both dic and doc had approximately 20 complex or unrecognizable storm events and contributed a proportion of the total carbon 3 3 storm response of dissolved carbon at the intra event scale according to the hysteresis types we selected four typical storm events to analyze the mobilization and export process of dissolved carbon during the events which occurred on august 30 event 19 may 14 event 2 july 7 event 8 and august 13 event 17 fig 5 the storm responses of dic and doc showed different behaviors during these events dissolved carbon concentrations in event 2 were primarily diluted in response to discharge increments and the lowest concentrations were 19 4 mg l for dic and 4 9 mg l for doc under high flow conditions during hydrograph recession however dic and doc concentrations showed a rapid recovery and eventually rose above pre event concentrations event 8 with negative hi values underwent opposite processes to event 2 and dissolved carbon concentrations recovered very slowly during the falling limb dic and doc consistently produced elevated concentrations along the falling limb which caused the discharge to peak before the concentrations the lags of dic and doc in event 2 are 2 h and 5 h respectively which are significantly smaller than those of event 8 as shown in event 19 dissolved carbon concentrations were flushed during the rising limb and reached the peak before discharge during the falling limb both dic and doc concentrations experienced a slow recovery and eventually fell the baseflow level in contrast the discharge peak in event 19 was several times that of the other three rainfall events accompanied by 98 2 mm of rainfall for event 17 discharge had two peaks and the main peak 1 81 mm h preceded the first doc peak dic concentrations fluctuated up and down during the storm but generally showed a decreasing trend as a result both dic and doc exhibited complex hysteresis 3 4 determinants of dissolved carbon storm response the controls of hydroclimatic variables on the storm response hi fi and φload of dissolved carbon were identified by rda fig 6 a a total of 61 4 of the variation in the dic response was explained by the first two axes the first rda axis accounted for 41 4 of the variation mainly contributed by ptotal and qpeak while the second rda axis accounted for 20 0 which was mainly contributed by t peak t storm and i flood fig 6a almost all the hydroclimatic variables in the rda model had significant positive correlations with φload but negative correlations with hi and fi moreover tpeak was positively correlated with fi p 0 05 for doc 83 5 of the total variation was explained by the first two axes based on grouping of the explanatory variables the first axis typically represented storm magnitude qpeak ptotal whereas the second axis represented rainfall characteristics train i30 contrary to dic there was a significant positive correlation between fi and φload and a negative correlation with hi for the storm response of doc the results of the variation partitioning analysis are summarized in fig 6b runoff parameters were the main drivers of storm response for both dic and doc explaining 55 4 and 48 6 of the storm response respectively rainfall characteristics explained 25 6 and 34 8 of the storm response for dic and doc respectively antecedent conditions were of lesser importance for generating a significant carbon response hierarchical partitioning indicated that iflood 10 54 had the greatest influence on the dic storm response followed by ptotal 9 38 and qpeak 10 54 similar to dic the top three explanatory variables of storm response for doc were qpeak 15 97 iflood 13 1 and ptotal 10 8 interestingly tpeak was observed to have a greater impact on the storm response of dic than doc these results suggested that runoff and rainfall were key factors in controlling the storm response of dissolved carbon 4 discussion 4 1 effects of anthropogenic disturbances on dissolved carbon transport and production anthropogenic disturbance can significantly alter the hydrological conditions of a watershed thereby affecting the transport and production of dissolved carbon in our study the dissolved carbon concentration was higher than that reported in many other agricultural catchments in europe and north america evans et al 2017 hotchkiss et al 2015 tunaley et al 2017 this may be attributed to the hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical cycle during high flow periods rapid water flow through and across surface soils can deliver carbonaceous material to the stream and reduce respiration losses of dissolved carbon wallin et al 2010 our study is consistent with the pulse shunt concept where extreme hydrological events dominated most of the output of river carbon drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2016 during baseflow periods most of the dissolved carbon is delivered via subsurface flow paths that originate in terrestrial ecosystems and establish hydrologic connections with the stream jung et al 2020 in our catchment extensive ditches and tile drainage existed in the upper catchment while in the lowland areas numerous roadways were distributed hence lateral export of dissolved carbon via shallow or deeper flow paths can effectively recharge the river channel and maintain the dissolved carbon concentration in the stream outram et al 2016 xu et al 2021 moreover many channels were artificially straightened deepened and widened during the periods of terrace construction further improving the structural connectivity of the catchment zhou et al 2017 biogeochemically dissolved co2 is dic the sum of co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 zhi and li 2020 weathering erosion of land rocks and co2 in soils are the natural sources of dic qin et al 2020 in this paper we speculate that dic is mainly derived from riparian zones and subsurface aquifers within our catchment rainfall inputs cause rock weathering products accumulated in the soil to seep into the groundwater or store in the riparian zone and subsequently recharge the channel during baseflow conditions moreover the widespread use of nitrogen fertilizer e g ammonium bicarbonate in small agricultural watersheds may accelerate the weathering of carbonates and increase the output flux of dic perrin et al 2008 khamis et al 2017 doc mainly refers to hydrocarbons humus and esters in water wetlands are often assumed to be near infinite doc sources zarnetske et al 2018 and they tend to occur in lowlands where connectivity with the stream network is initiated by even small hydrologic events however our study area is dominated by cropland 56 4 and the wetland area 3 6 is almost negligible fig 1 doc source zones from terrestrial ecosystems are widely distributed in small agricultural watersheds whether in leaf litter livestock manure fertilizers crop stubble or shallow organic enriched soils which can increase the concentration of riverine doc knapp et al 2020 blaen et al 2017 agricultural practices e g fertilizer application tend to facilitate the enrichment of topsoil organic matter stewart et al 2022 considering a more homogenous spatial distribution of doc in an agriculture landscape we believe that doc source areas are derived from cropland forested areas and riparian zones at the same time hydrological conditions that support doc mobilization also promote the generation of doc zarnetske et al 2018 storms or other hydrological events strengthen the linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems reconnecting previously isolated watershed components through surface and subsurface paths where doc has accumulated stewart et al 2022 ebeling et al 2020 4 2 dissolved carbon mobilization and export at the inter event scale the hysteresis index has the potential to indicate inter event variability in solute dynamics thus facilitating a conceptual understanding of watershed hydrological connectivity transport pathways and source availability najafi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 some indices such as himid hiaich and hilloyd provided detailed information and proved to be useful for the purpose for which they were developed aich et al 2014 lawler et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016 but the applicability of these indices was limited for identifying more complex events e g figure eight hysteresis subjectivity and negative data e g delta values that describe the isotope composition of streamflow we used the hysteresis index to quantify dissolved carbon dynamics during the monitoring period the hysteresis patterns for dic and doc were significantly different thereby providing strong support for our first hypothesis dic exhibited a clockwise hysteresis pattern and the flushing index was generally negative figs 3 and 4 the negative flushing index indicating a diluting effect suggested that proximal dic sources are insufficient to increase stream water concentrations on the rising limb vaughan et al 2017 moreover the clockwise hysteresis loop indicates that dic concentrations are lower on the falling limb than the rising limb and that distal dic sources are not plentiful enough and or unable to maintain long term hydrological connectivity to the stream during sampling periods aguilera and melack 2018 liu et al 2021 based on these results we concluded that dic was predominantly derived from the riparian zone or groundwater bender et al 2018 riparian zones often accumulate partial storage of inorganic carbon while groundwater contains high concentrations of dic before the event and these zones are easily activated during the storm quickflow from the riparian zone at the beginning of a storm may reduce the dic concentration in the stream water which leads to depletion from proximal sources long term hydrological connectivity between distal groundwater and streams cannot be maintained due to soil moisture changes resulting in reduced availability of dic rich groundwater the combination of riparian quickflow and hydrological connectivity shapes the observed event scale c q pattern to our knowledge few studies have investigated storm dic hysteresis at the event scale qin et al 2020 the storm response of dic concentration we observed fit well with the conceptual model described by zhi and li 2020 which revealed a quantitative relationship between solute export patterns and shallow versus deep concentration contrasts highlighting the often overlooked role of nutrient distribution over depths hierarchical partitioning revealed that dic hysteresis was driven by iflood and ptotal fig 6b suggesting that hydrological thresholds may exist for the activation of dic source zones wang et al 2022 balen et al 2017 for example old water pre event water previously stored in the soil can be replaced by new water rainfall which has a higher concentration of inorganic carbon stockinger et al 2015 some model results also showed that droughts may promote the mineralization of organic carbon into inorganic carbon and export it laterally as dic into the stream wen et al 2022 zhi and li 2020 zarnetske et al 2018 the riparian zone plays an important role in regulating dic concentrations as it responds more quickly than other landscape types to storm events pavlin et al 2021 song et al 2020 song et al 2021 doc exhibited a counter clockwise hysteresis pattern for the selected events figs 3 and 4 a positive flushing index suggests that the transport of proximal sources is enough to increase stream doc concentrations on the rising limb while the counter clockwise loop indicates that doc concentrations are more abundant on the falling limb than the rising limb and that distal sources of doc are activated later in the storm as hydrologic pathways connect and or that transport time for doc is greater than that of water in the stream channel mihiranga et al 2021 musolff et al 2021 wagner et al 2019 this pattern is consistent with a study reported for 1 006 watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions where doc flux was almost always transport limitation zarnetske et al 2018 the explanatory mechanisms behind this mainly include the spatial distribution of doc source zones and hydrological connectivity on the one hand shallow and deep hypotheses suggest that the vertical distribution of nutrients shapes stream chemistry and support our results zhi and li 2020 the abundance of organic matter and roots typically decreases exponentially with depth which results in more enrichment of organic carbon in shallow soils lajtha and jones 2018 moreover our catchment has distinct forested upland sources of organic matter e g leaf litter which are likely distal and hydrologically connected to the stream via numerous ditches roadways or tile drainage networks during storms chen et al 2021 this finding was supported by the observed links between hi and i30 and ap5 and ptotal fig 6a on the other hand storms reduce co2 upward emission to the atmosphere and organic carbon mineralization but promote shallow flow paths carbonate dissolution doc production and lateral fluxes of inorganic carbon into streams wen et al 2022 high flows via shallow permeable soils increase the proportion of young water which is typically more enriched with organic materials pavlin et al 2021 although agricultural practices vary greatly around the world most small agricultural watersheds are rich in doc source zones chen et al 2021 these doc source zones e g domestic sewage may increase riverine doc concentrations when water flows through them therefore we believe that doc is mainly derived from near surface flow e g soil water 4 3 identification of dissolved carbon source zone activation at the intra event scale intra event variation in hysteretic behavior was observed in c q relationships for both dic and doc fig 5 reflecting the switch of storm responses between supply limitation and transport limitation mistick and johnson 2020 supply limitation occurs when solutes mobilized during storms are limited by the mass contributed by specific sources mihiranga et al 2021 transport limitation suggests that discharge variability determines when readily available solutes are mobilized basu et al 2010 in agricultural catchments supply limitation can coexist with transport limitation within storms if sources change and different parts of the catchment contribute to the hydrograph at different points in time richardson et al 2020 we selected event 8 and event 2 to identify the dynamics of dissolved carbon source zones activation and the switches of transport and supply limitation during rainfall and the results supported our second hypothesis well both dic and doc exhibited a counter clockwise hysteresis in event 8 fig 5b indicating transport limitation behavior this behavior can be attributed to catchment hydrological connectivity hydrological connectivity which potentially refers primarily to connectivity between hillslopes and streams leads to short term activation of specific carbon source areas surface runoff doc versus deep groundwater sourced dic contributing to the high dissolved carbon concentration of stream xiao et al 2021 the positive flushing index of dissolved carbon dic 0 44 doc 0 63 implies that the proximal source is plentiful during the rising phase of the hydrograph fig 5b the potential sources at the start of the event may be derived from riparian zones riparian zones are hydrologically well connected to the stream channel with the potential to deliver dissolved carbon rapidly at the start of storm events wallin et al 2010 in this event higher antecedent rainfall ap5 26 4 mm may promote the rapid establishment of riparian zone connectivity with streams meanwhile soil water charged with high co2 and doc can also recharge more into the deeper subsurface under wet conditions thereby enhancing dic and doc lateral fluxes wen et al 2022 the negative hysteresis index of dissolved carbon dic 0 41 doc 0 34 suggests that the solute concentration is higher on the falling limb than the rising limb fig 5b the differences in dissolved carbon concentrations are due to the availability of distal sources e g leaf litter and groundwater during wet periods near surface flow begins to transport high concentration dissolved carbon as the hillslope riparian stream continuum is established blaurock et al 2021 however dissolved carbon hysteresis was figure eight during event 2 exhibiting complex behavior fig 5a the hysteresis index was positive for dic 0 24 and negative for doc 0 04 dissolved carbon tends to be supply limitation during the rising limb fig 5a indicating an exhaustible proximal source this possible source likely results from depletion of available sources from riparian zones due to dry antecedent conditions drought is more likely to reduce lateral export of dissolved carbon via shallow and deeper groundwater flow paths thereby causing a slow delivery of dissolved carbon in the subsequent storm events sherriff et al 2016 moreover we observed lower antecedent rainfall prior to event 2 ap5 3 2 mm which supports our results conversely dissolved carbon tends to be transport limitation on the falling limb fig 5a implying the mobilization of more distant sources knapp et al 2020 considering the discontinuity of rainfall slow subsurface pathways may dominate the transport process and further transport previously trapped dissolved carbon sources along water flow paths zhi and li 2020 in this case the very slow increase and decrease in dissolved carbon concentrations led to figure eight shaped moreover we found that the frequency of occurrence of the figure eight hysteresis was 15 for dic and 25 for doc across all events fig 4 based on these results we believe that event characteristics can alter the storm response of solutes from transport limitation to supply limitation or vice versa 5 conclusion in this study high frequency field measurements allowed the hysteresis index to quantify dissolved carbon c q relationships between and during storm events we observed significant differences in dissolved carbon dynamics at the inter and intra event scales dic hysteresis was mainly clockwise among the events suggesting that riparian zones or subsurface aquifers was the primary dic source zones groundwater is the major transport pathway for dic in contrast doc mainly exhibited counter clockwise hysteresis at the event scale we attributed this to hydrological connectivity that activates more distant and plentiful source zones in agricultural systems near surface flows e g soil water are the major transport pathways for doc hierarchical partitioning illustrated that rainfall and runoff conditions dominated the storm response of dissolved carbon and that antecedent wetness conditions were less important from a process based perspective event characteristic may alter the dissolved carbon storm response from transport limitation to supply limitation or vice versa large amounts of carbon were mobilized into the river during the storms resulting in riverine dissolved carbon concentration levels several times higher than those under baseflow conditions we integrated inter scale and intra event dissolved carbon dynamics to identify major sources and transport pathways which facilitated the accurate estimation of carbon export from rivers our investigations can also be applied to explore other types of pollutants given the connectivity transport pathways and spatial and temporal distribution of pollutant in catchments in the future the widespread use of in situ sensors will enable longer time series of storm event monitoring even if researchers cannot reach the field such work combined with water transit time analyses will further our ability to quantify the cascading effect among the emissions removals and loads of dissolved carbon in watersheds and provide a theoretical basis for more accurate models of carbon cycling declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the
