25110,a nursery pollinator system comprises a plant and an insect pollinator which uses the reproductive structures of the plant to guard its eggs and serve it as food for the larvae this kind of systems usually includes a third party one or more species of parasitoids that inject their eggs inside the larvae of the pollinating seed predator to feed on them from the inside out here we build a model based on differential equations that replicates this system first by showing the dual role of the pollinating seed predator which behaves both as a mutualist and as antagonist for the plant we show that the system is more stable with the presence of the parasitoids the stationary solutions with them significantly favor the plant population size with minor effects for the population of the pollinating seed predator by modeling both sexes of the nursery pollinator separately we also highlight the role that male adults can have to compensate the costs and benefits of the interaction with plants and thus to contribute to the stability of such mutualisms keywords population dynamics ecological model silene hadena system nursery pollination parasitoids 1 introduction probably the most paradigmatic mutualistic system is pollination toby kiers et al 2010 holland et al 2002 in which the flower visitors obtain trophic resources nectar pollen oils etc and the plant obtains reproductive benefits through pollen dispersal and seed production a special case of pollination called nursery pollination is reported when one pollinator species uses the fertilized flowers as hatching nests for its eggs and the developing seeds serve as a food resource for its larvae therefore the pollinating seed predator obtains plant food resources for both its adult and larval stages depriving the plant of part of the reproductive benefits obtained in a legitimate pollination interaction bronstein 2001 although this kind of interaction sounds eccentric nursery pollination had been described in several families of angiosperms with classic examples like fig trees fig wasps and yuccas yucca moths dufaÿ and anstett 2003 in these systems there must exist a subtle balance between the benefits pollination and costs seed predation to achieve a positive net outcome to the plant indeed the balance may shift from positive to negative and therefore from mutualism to antagonism depending on the mechanisms evolved by the hosts to avoid over exploitation and on the ecological context where the interaction takes place leung and poulin 2008 one mechanism controlling over exploitation by the plant consists of random abortion of fruits or selective abortion of fruits containing eggs or larvae of the pollinating seed predator this feature has been argued by mathematical modeling approaches as an evolutionary strategy of interspecific population regulation holland and deangelis 2001 2006 westerbergh and westerbergh 2001 with respect to the ecological context apart from regulation of population densities due to environmental fluctuations a central topic is related to the presence of third partners one central consideration is whether the seed predator is also the unique pollinator or not hereafter obligate and facultative nursery pollination systems respectively in facultative systems the occurrence of co pollinators can shift the sign of this interaction because they contribute to seed production without the cost of seed predation thompson and pellmyr 1992 the nursery pollination system may be also affected by the existence of predators pathogens and parasitoids that may regulate the population size of the pollinating seed predator avoiding excess seed loss and system instability several field studies suggest this kind of regulatory process in nursery pollination systems force and thompson 1984 elzinga et al 2003 crabb and pellmyr 2006 nunes et al 2018 but it has not been tested by population dynamic models complex biological systems such as the nursery pollination are paradigmatic frameworks because different actors can play a vital role in the equilibrium of the ecological system and the importance of an apparently secondary species can be addressed using population dynamic modeling neuhauser and fargione 2004 holland et al 2002 in this study we use a generalized version of the model of garcía algarra et al 2014 which can describe multiple ecological interactions within the same equations this approach has the advantage of treating species interactions based on fundamental ecological laws turchin 2003 and independently of the model i e without having to consider them as different phenomena which is a conceptual burden such a generalization may allow researchers a better representation of ecological systems by including most observed interactions weighting their importance where necessary and avoiding frameworks of specific systems and ad hoc modeling we hypothesize that when the population density of two species can alternate the net effect of their interaction between mutualism and parasitism the presence of a third species can regulate their population dynamics and stabilize the interaction towards mutualism to test this prediction we applied a generalized model of ecological relations to the system made up of caryophyllaceous plants the nursery pollinator hadena moths and their parasitoid wasps we expect that a subtle regulation of the moths population by its parasitoids may stabilize the dynamics of the system allowing the high metabolic costs of other regulatory processes like fruit abortion to control over exploitation 2 materials and methods we first describe the ecological system studied to build a conceptual diagram that we used to model the system with a set of differential equations 2 1 the ecological system some members of the plant family caryophyllaceae especially the genus silene are involved in a facultative nursery pollination interaction with moths of the genus hadena noctuidae these plants have many diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors but hadena moths are among their most effective pollinators kephart et al 2005 prieto benítez et al 2017 male moths only pollinate the flowers but female moths pollinate and also lay their eggs on fertilized flowers labouche and bernasconi 2010 eggs successfully hatched give rise to the larvae which penetrate into the primary fruits and feed on the seeds once the primary fruit is consumed the larvae feed on a variable number of secondary fruits to complete their development a recent review prieto benítez et al 2017 confirmed nursery pollination between 22 hadena species and 70 caryophyllaceae species but most of the information on this system comes from the best studied pair of interacting species s latifolia and h bicruris extensive surveys found that h bicruris occurred in more than 90 of european s latifolia populations and consumed 25 70 of annual fruit production wolfe 2002 other species are involved in this system prieto benítez et al 2017 some of the multiple diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors are legitimate pollinators that have only a positive effect on the plant but other species some bees and bumblebees may behave as nectar robbers which may affect the fertility of the plant by reducing this flower resource for the legitimate pollinators second a few other insects predate flowers and fruits and therefore constitute a menace to the plants and competitors to the moths third hadena moths have some parasitoids mainly from the braconidae and ichneumonidae wasp families elzinga et al 2003 after feeding on the primary fruit hadena caterpillars are too large to be protected within the fruits they consume so they are prone to attack by these parasitoids which inject their eggs inside them when these eggs hatch the larvae feed on the host fluids without causing immediate death hadena larvae continue feeding on the plant s fruits until growth is complete and then the larvae of parasitoids emerge from the host s body killing it at least 13 parasitoid species are associated with larvae of h bicruris but the best studied species is the braconid microplitis tristis elzinga et al 2007 these parasitoids may act as a control mechanism for the silene hadena system as demonstrated later finally another organism may be involved in the system the obligate fungus pathogen microbotryum it is a complex of cryptic species infecting many caryophylaceous species which replaces the pollen with fungal spores that are spread by pollinating insects antonovics et al 2002 microbotryum infestation causes the sterilization of anthers and also reduce the size of flowers shykoff and kaltz 1998 hadena moths show an adaptive response avoiding diseased plants to oviposit biere and honders 1996 fig 1 shows the interactions among all these species although we simplified the system for modeling purpose fig 2 we do not consider microbotryum since its presence regulates the interaction between plants and moths and that would require a third order term in the interactions moreover fungal population strictly depends on plant population so it cannot be included neither as a net effect on plant independent parameters as we do with other pollinating and predatory insects therefore the effect of microbotryum on the population dynamics of the system require a more complex approach that could be explored in subsequent studies 2 2 the reduced system and translation into equations our ecological system consist of many interactions that were simplified to make a coherent model that we later translated into a set of differential equations we followed this approach 1 we consider only the interactions between one caryophyllaceae x 1 males and females of one hadena species x 2 and x 3 respectively and a third species moth parasitoid x 4 which predate hadena 2 the interaction between hadena and caryophyllaceae are divided between male and female moths male moths act as obligate mutualists for both the caryophyllaceae and the female moths female moths act as facultative mutualists for the male moths but as predators for the caryophyllaceae since moth adults and larvae stages are pooled in a single stage the population of larvae was estimated by the difference larvae x 3 x 2 adult moths can be calculated therefore as adults 2x 2 if x 2 x 3 or adults x 2 x 3 if x 2 x 3 3 all moth larvae are assumed to be female therefore male moths are generated by a mutualistic term that represents the interaction between males and females modulated by coefficient b 23 4 caryophyllaceae is assumed to be sex neutral although this can be justified by the existence of many monoecious subgenera dioecious species can also be modeled assuming only one sex we demonstrate this in a but the main reason is that male and female plants in this system differ only in the intraspecific interactions which do not affect the relations with moths and moth parasitoids 5 parasitoids are modeled as predators and interact only with female moths since females also include the larval stage the latter interaction is modulated by two coefficients b 34 and b 43 although we modeled only one parasitoid species the impact of parasitoids may not be reduced to only one species so we considered that b 34 the influence of parasitoids on female moths and their larvae can be weighted by a factor that considers additional species we discuss this in detail in b to represent the reduced system fig 2 we used a generalized version of the logistic mutualistic system of garcía algarra et al 2014 which can be summarized for n species as 1 x i x i r i k 1 n b ik x k a i c i k 1 n b ik x k x i the set of equations that reflect our assumptions in this system is 2 x 1 x 1 r 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 a 1 c 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 x 1 3 x 2 x 2 r 2 b 23 x 3 a 2 c 2 b 23 x 3 x 2 4 x 3 x 3 r 3 b 31 x 1 b 32 x 2 b 34 x 4 a 3 c 3 b 31 x 1 b 32 x 2 b 34 x 4 x 3 5 x 4 x 4 r 4 b 43 x 3 a 4 c 4 b 43 x 3 x 4 in this system parameters r i represent the intrinsic growth rate of each species i parameters b ij represent the interaction between species i and j and parameters a i and c i represent two kinds of negative effects for species i a i is the saturation rate caused by intraspecific competition and c i represents the limitations caused by the occupation rate by members of the same species the latter has a similar effect as intraspecific competition not with respect to the environment but to interactions with the other species to clarify the meaning of all the parameters we present them one by one to estimate the value of each parameter we performed a comprehensive review of the ecological literature of the system as presented in b r i represents the intrinsic growth rate of each species i we assume that all r i 0 since species depends exclusively on their interactions to reproduce male moths need female moths which in turn need male moths as well as the plants since the female moths also include the larvae parasitoids can survive only in the presence of female moths since they inject eggs inside moths larvae of all the r i only r 1 can be considered positive as well as negative but the only difference when r 1 0 besides an increase in the population size shown later is that the plants can survive without any of the other species which does not reflect the system we care to study r i is measured in units of time 1 and its inverse is the mean lifetime of species i b 12 represents the interaction between the plants and the male moths since it summarizes the entire interaction it thus reflects how many viable seeds are born for each fruit that matures for each flower that a male moth pollinates averaged by the mean number of flowers that a plant produces per unit of time at the end it equals the number of new plants a male moth generates on average per unit of time since it measures plant births b 12 0 and is measured in units of time moths 1 b 13 represents the interaction between the plants and both the female adult moths and larvae we set b 13 b 13 in which b 13 corresponds to the pollination effect of the female moths a mutualistic interaction and b 13 represents the predatory behavior of the moth s larvae an antagonistic interaction in this case we consider that b 13 b 13 so the overall interaction is antagonistic for the plant thus it reflects how many viable seeds die instead of being born for each fruit that matures for each flower that a female moth pollinates averaged by the mean number of flowers that a plant produces per unit of time since it represents deaths b 13 0 and is measured in units of time moths 1 b 23 since male moths reproduce only through female moths this parameter represents how many of the viable larvae produced by a pairing between male and female moths are males per unit of time to calculate this number it is necessary to know the average sex ratio therefore b 23 has units of time moths 1 and necessarily b 23 0 b 31 has a deeper meaning since we assumed that moths need plants to lay their eggs and only female moths can do that this parameter reflects how many viable larvae may arise on average from each plant considering that the larvae eat mainly seeds but also remains of the fruits and even flowers a plant whose flowers and fruits are eaten cannot survive or reproduce and therefore dies to measure this value we calculated how many fruits and flowers an individual larva needs to complete its development and become an adult moth this number reflects how many plants need to die to produce moths per unit of time b 31 has units of time plants 1 and is 0 b 32 means the same as b 23 but with respect to the female moth population therefore it follows that b 32 0 b 34 is the number of female moths that die for each individual parasitoid per unit of time we counted the female moths only since we treated the female moths and their larvae as a single stage therefore b 34 has units of time parasitoids 1 and is 0 b 43 is the number of parasitoids born for each female moth that dies per unit of time it equals the inverse of the number of moths that a parasitoid needs to grow from egg to larva and then to an adult b 43 has units of time moths 1 and is 0 a i represents the limitation imposed by intraspecific competition i e how much the survival of an individuals is reduced because of the presence of other individuals of the same species in the absence of interactions the inverse of this number represents the carrying capacity of a species over the area under study times its mean lifetime a i is measured in units of time population 1 and is always 0 c i even though this parameter is similar to a i it has a different meaning c i represents the relative presence of individuals of a species in the area under study so it measures the competition from trophic interactions we calculated its value by dividing the mean area that an individual occupies by the total area that it can grow into thus c i is a dimensionless parameter and always 0 b 14 b 21 b 24 b 41 b 42 are all 0 this happens because there are no significant direct interactions between plants and parasitoids male moths and plants even male moths feed on plants they reproduce only through female moths and male moths and parasitoids the latter only inject eggs inside the larvae here represented as females only 2 3 solving the set of equations we solved the system numerically using a set of ordinary differential equations odes we used mathematica for the odes and figures and python for the global sensitivity analysis odes were solved numerically switching between explicit and implicit runge kutta methods when stiffness was detected since the system could not be solved analytically we calculated stationary solutions which represent stationary populations when the values are zero or any positive real number we used the jacobian determinant of the system evaluated at the stationary solutions to calculate their eigenvalues and to explore if the corresponding populations were either stable unstable or saddle points the initial conditions and numerical values of parameters used for the simulations are shown in b 2 4 global sensitivity analysis we performed a global sensitivity analysis of our system to study how the uncertainty in the model output can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the inputs we have chosen a sobol sensitivity analysis using the salib python library herman and usher 2017 sobol s method is designed to determine how much of the variability in the model output depends upon each of the input parameters either upon a single parameter or upon an interaction between different parameters sobol 2001 saltelli 2002 saltelli et al 2010 3 results 3 1 the three populations system no parasitoids by setting b 34 0 and b 43 0 we evaluated how the system behaves in the absence of parasitoids in this case the plant nursery pollinator system had only two stable solutions which might oscillate at first but stabilized later one stable solution was obvious extinction of all the populations and the other was a stable coexistence of plants male moths and female moths fig 3 in which the plant population declined to almost the extinction before arose again even though there were solutions that corresponded to extinctions of some of the populations all of them were unstable for the system since they have an obligate dependence between them with r 1 0 there is a stable solution with a positive population of plants and either the extinction of male or both populations of moths we do not present either case because they are of no interest for our system as it depicts a scenario without moths 3 2 the four populations system the role of parasitoids although in the previous case the stationary solution of the system was stable when it included only three populations this solution turned unstable when we introduced a fourth population the parasitoid species the solution became a saddle point the set of four eigenvalues had three negative values and one positive value λ i 33 16 4 26 2 15 0 31 the x 4 axis of the four dimensional phase space had an unstable stationary point on the extinction of the parasitoids therefore the system presented only one stable solution besides total extinction corresponding to the coexistence of the four populations with eigenvalues λ i 15 56 4 27 2 54 0 50 the system oscillated at the beginning but stabilized later and favored plant population compared to the system without parasitoids fig 4 even the presence of a very small population of parasitoids was enough to shift the system to a new stable stationary point in which plant population increased notably from x 1 817 to x 1 1004 with a negligible decrease in male and female moth populations there was also an intermediate phase between t 20 and t 30 in which populations moved to a stationary unstable point corresponding to x 1 191 x 2 20 x 3 38 x 4 62 the eigenvalues corresponding to this unstable solution had imaginary parts λ i 0 17 2 92 i 0 17 2 92 i 0 31 0 081 the reason why populations oscillate through them as mentioned if r 1 0 i e by considering other non nursery pollinators the model predicted a notable increase in plant population from x 1 1090 to x 1 1200 when r 1 0 0973 with a negligible effect in moth and parasitoid populations fig 5 the predation of the parasitoids on the moths mediated by b 34 regulates the effect of initial populations of parasitoids on the system fig 6 when b 34 0 03 which is 0 25 times the value we used before b 34 0 122 moths and parasitoid stationary stable populations remained almost the same they changed less than 1 5 while for plants varied significantly around 15 on the other hand when b 34 0 183 which is 1 5 times the value we used first all populations became extinct even though a stationary stable solution with x 1 1166 x 2 195 x 3 380 and x 4 199 remained for the system to go to the latter solution bigger initial populations were needed in this work we have studied two sets of inputs separately to understand their influence on the model initial conditions i e initial populations and the model parameters table 1 lists the results of the analysis of the initial conditions with different bounds 50 70 for plants 10 30 for males moths 20 40 for females moths and larvae and 0 5 for parasitoids the total order indexes are substantially larger than the first order indexes then higher order interactions likely occur in any case is remarkable the influence of the initial population size of the male moths and secondary the initial population size of the parasitoids table 2 shows the influence of all set of parameters in our model focusing on the total order indexes the most important parameter was r 2 the growth rate of the male moths the interactions between plants with male moths b 12 and plants with females moths and larvae b 13 had a moderate influence followed by the second and third order of parameters of the male moths a 2 and c 2 4 discussion we used a system of differential equations based on a generalization of the model of garcía algarra et al 2014 to simulate a complex biological system with facultative mutualism obligate mutualism and predation these ecological interactions can be introduced in the model simply by modifying the sign of the parameters since biological parameters are easily identifiable in this model we have effectively simulated an ecological system of two species that shift along a mutualism antagonism interaction continuum and then predicted the role of a third species parasitoid on the stability of the system previous works have suggested that parasitoids may act as a regulatory mechanism that prevents populations of pollinating seed predators from growing arbitrarily and thus harming plant populations to the extinction threshold force and thompson 1984 crabb and pellmyr 2006 nunes et al 2018 elzinga and bernasconi 2009 however this is based on observational studies and it had never been explored with experimental populations or by modeling approach the effectiveness of the parasitoid as regulatory mechanism depends not only on its population size but on the intensity of harming it causes to the nursery pollinators in our model these interaction was mediated by parameter b 34 the number of moths killed by each parasitoid per unit of time this parameter was carefully estimated from existing data considering the developmental time of moth larvae the probability of coincidence of larvae and parasitoids through year the number of larvae visited by each parasitoid and a factor to consider the coexistence of more than one species of parasitoids in the system the changes in b 34 modulated the duration of the oscillatory regimes and the stationary populations of the three species as seen in fig 6 when this parameter increases oscillations may provoke extinction of the female moths causing the collapse of the entire system in our example we have modeled only one parasitoid species and assumed that its effect on the moths is strong but it is common to observe more than one parasitoid species coexisting elzinga et al 2007 it is interesting to note that parasitoids may control over exploitation of plants by moths simply by increasing larvae mortality but the regulating processes can be subtler in the caryophyllaceae hadena microplitis system experimental studies have reported that moth larvae rarely die after the injection of the wasps eggs but the mean size reached by parasitized larvae is lower compared to healthy larvae elzinga et al 2003 if the growth rate of parasitized caterpillars is constricted the potential damage to the plants reproductive success is also limited this effect could be assumed with parameter b 13 thus the flexibility of this population dynamics model permits parametrization of these and any other regulatory mechanisms to test their limits the analysis of global sensitivity of our model showed two remarkable points 1 the initial population size of male moths but also of parasitoids had a higher effect on the stability of the system than the initial population size of plants and female moths and 2 the stability also depends on the parameters related mainly with male moths growth rate interaction strength with plants intraspecific competition and relative presence this fact has already been highlighted by labouche and bernasconi 2010 who noted that in the silene latifolia hadena bicruris system the female moths mostly carry with the antagonist side of the interaction oviposition of predatory larvae by contrast male adult insects only contribute to the mutualist side because they provide pollination benefits without predatory costs so they can support the net benefits of the interaction with the plant and therefore the population stability of the whole system however the pollination behavior of adult males in many other nursery pollination systems needs to be confirmed and quantified if they occur to explore properly the benefits and costs of the interaction labouche and bernasconi 2010 in our model the separation of sexes of the pollinating seed predator allowed us to analyze the male derived benefits for the first time compared with previous studies that modeled the stability of mutualisms by interspecific population regulation holland and deangelis 2001 2006 westerbergh and westerbergh 2001 as stated before some nursery pollinated plants perform random or selective abortion of fruits which has been modelized as an effective evolutionary strategy to regulate populations of their mutualist antagonist partners holland and deangelis 2001 2006 westerbergh and westerbergh 2001 however the fruit abortion in response to hadena moths has been described only in one species of caryophyllaceae silene latifolia jolivet and bernasconi 2006 our results demonstrate that the evolution of this mechanism may not be necessary if there exist other ecological processes of regulation mediated by third organisms pairs of species involved in nursery pollination systems do not interact in isolation but are entangled into ecosystems the presence of one or more species of parasitoids and other legitimate pollinators in combination with the role of each sex on the net outcome of the interaction and the spatio temporal variation in species abundance will determine the direction of these mutualistic antagonistic gradients and confer more robustness to the system conflict of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by ministry of economy and competitiveness of spain research projects cgl2009 08755 and mtm2015 63914 p appendix a the role of male plants in the silene hadena system we can demonstrate that there is no influence of dividing the silene population into males and females by taking equations 2 to 5 set the original plant population as female and add a male plant population namely x 5 focusing only on x 1 and x 5 since others populations and their dynamics remain the same we have a 1 x 1 x 1 r 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 b 15 x 5 a 1 c 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 b 15 x 5 x 1 a 2 x 5 x 5 r 5 b 51 x 1 a 5 c 5 b 51 x 1 x 5 the only change is thus the new male plant population x 5 which obviously behaves as an obligate mutualist of the female population x 1 there are only two stationary points for the male plant population x 5 0 and x 5 r 5 b 51 x 1 a 1 c 5 b 51 x 1 for the first one we return to the original system of equations 2 to 5 for the second one we obtain a function of x 1 that shifts from a negative value if r 5 b 51 x 1 we established that r 5 0 to a positive one thus the unique dynamics that x 5 offers is going from extinction to its carrying capacity depending on x 1 on the other hand the dynamics of x 1 depends on itself and b 15 since the last parameter modulates the influence of x 5 the value of b 15 cannot be too high compared to the other b 1j because that would ensure the survival of x 1 and x 5 without pollinators as a matter of fact one may even argue that b 15 0 because the reproduction of the plants depends on the pollination a process that depends mainly on the moths and other flower visitors thus if b 15 0 but small enough the influence of x 5 would be also very small and the system would behave as if x 5 does not exist appendix b numerical values used on the simulations we present the numerical values that we used in the simulations presented in the figures table b 3 we calculated the value of each parameter by considering the following data and assumptions first all data were calculated using 1 day as the time unit and 1 year as the reproductive cycle since some individuals had more than one reproductive cycle per year we considered this in our calculations for some parameters that could not be obtained from actual data reasonable estimates were used banks et al 2017 moxnes and hausken 2007 
25110,a nursery pollinator system comprises a plant and an insect pollinator which uses the reproductive structures of the plant to guard its eggs and serve it as food for the larvae this kind of

model based on differential equations that replicates this system first by showing the dual role of the pollinating seed predator which behaves both as a mutualist and as antagonist for the plant we show that the system is more stable with the presence of the parasitoids the stationary solutions with them significantly favor the plant population size with minor effects for the population of the pollinating seed predator by modeling both sexes of the nursery pollinator separately we also highlight the role that male adults can have to compensate the costs and benefits of the interaction with plants and thus to contribute to the stability of such mutualisms keywords population dynamics ecological model silene hadena system nursery pollination parasitoids 1 introduction probably the most

that a subtle regulation of the moths population by its parasitoids may stabilize the dynamics of the system allowing the high metabolic costs of other regulatory processes like fruit abortion to control over exploitation 2 materials and methods we first describe the ecological system studied to build a conceptual diagram that we used to model the system with a set of differential equations 2 1 the ecological system some members of the plant family caryophyllaceae especially the genus silene are involved in a facultative nursery pollination interaction with moths of the genus hadena noctuidae these plants have many diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors but hadena moths are among their most effective pollinators kephart et al 2005 prieto benítez et al 2017 male moths only pollinate the flowers but female moths pollinate and also lay their eggs on fertilized flowers labouche and bernasconi 2010 eggs successfully hatched give rise to the larvae which penetrate into the primary fruits and feed on the seeds once the primary fruit is consumed the larvae feed on a variable number of secondary fruits to complete their development a recent review prieto benítez et al 2017 confirmed nursery pollination between 22 hadena species and 70 caryophyllaceae species but most of the information on this system comes from the best studied pair of interacting species s latifolia and h bicruris extensive surveys found that h bicruris occurred in more than 90 of european s latifolia populations and consumed 25 70 of annual fruit production wolfe 2002 other species are involved in this system prieto benítez et al 2017 some of the multiple diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors are legitimate pollinators that have only a positive effect on the plant but other species some bees and bumblebees may behave as nectar robbers which may affect the fertility of the plant by reducing this flower resource for the legitimate pollinators second a few other insects predate flowers and fruits and therefore constitute a menace to the plants and competitors to the moths third hadena moths have some parasitoids mainly from the braconidae and ichneumonidae wasp families elzinga et al 2003 after feeding on the primary fruit hadena caterpillars are too large to be protected within the fruits they consume so they are prone to attack by these parasitoids which inject their eggs inside them when these eggs hatch the larvae feed on the host fluids without causing immediate death hadena larvae continue feeding on the plant s fruits until growth is complete and then the larvae of parasitoids emerge from the host s body killing it at least 13 parasitoid species are associated with larvae of h bicruris but the best studied species is the braconid microplitis tristis elzinga et al 2007 these parasitoids may act as a control mechanism for the silene hadena system as demonstrated later finally another organism may be involved in the system the obligate fungus pathogen microbotryum it is a complex of cryptic species infecting many caryophylaceous species which replaces the pollen with fungal spores that are spread by pollinating insects antonovics et al 2002 microbotryum infestation causes the sterilization of anthers and also reduce the size of flowers shykoff and kaltz 1998 hadena moths show an adaptive response avoiding diseased plants to oviposit biere and honders 1996 fig 1 shows the interactions among all these species although we simplified the system for modeling purpose fig 2 we do not consider microbotryum since its presence regulates the interaction between plants and moths and that would require a third order term in the interactions moreover fungal population strictly depends on plant population so it cannot be included neither as a net effect on plant independent parameters as we do with other pollinating and predatory insects therefore the effect of microbotryum on the population dynamics of the system require a more complex approach that could be explored in subsequent studies 2 2 the reduced system and translation into equations our ecological system consist of many interactions that were simplified to make a coherent model that we later translated into a set of differential equations we followed this approach 1 we consider only the interactions between one caryophyllaceae x 1 males and females of one hadena species x 2 and x 3 respectively and a third species moth parasitoid x 4 which predate hadena 2 the interaction between hadena and caryophyllaceae are divided between male and female moths male moths act as obligate mutualists for both the caryophyllaceae and the female moths female moths act as facultative mutualists for the male moths but as predators for the caryophyllaceae since moth adults and larvae stages are pooled in a single stage the population of larvae was estimated by the difference larvae x 3 x 2 adult moths can be calculated therefore as adults 2x 2 if x 2 x 3 or adults x 2 x 3 if x 2 x 3 3 all moth larvae are assumed to be female therefore male moths are generated by a mutualistic term that represents the interaction between males and females modulated by coefficient b 23 4 caryophyllaceae is assumed to be sex neutral although this can be justified by the existence of many monoecious subgenera dioecious species can also be modeled assuming only one sex we demonstrate this in a but the main reason is that male and female plants in this system differ only in the intraspecific interactions which do not affect the relations with moths and moth parasitoids 5 parasitoids are modeled as predators and interact only with female moths since females also include the larval stage the latter interaction is modulated by two coefficients b 34 and b 43 although we modeled only one parasitoid species the impact of parasitoids may not be reduced to only one species so we considered that b 34 the influence of parasitoids on female moths and their larvae can be weighted by a factor that considers additional species we discuss this in detail in b to represent the reduced system fig 2 we used a generalized version of the logistic mutualistic system of garcía algarra et al 2014 which can be summarized for n species as 1 x i x i r i k 1 n b ik x k a i c i k 1 n b ik x k x i the set of equations that reflect our assumptions in this system is 2 x 1 x 1 r 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 a 1 c 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 x 1 3 x 2 x 2 r 2 b 23 x 3 a 2 c 2 b 23 x 3 x 2 4 x 3 x 3 r 3 b 31 x 1 b 32 x 2 b 34 x 4 a 3 c 3 b 31 x 1 b 32 x 2 b 34 x 4 x 3 5 x 4 x 4 r 4 b 43 x 3 a 4 c 4 b 43 x 3 x 4 in this system parameters r i represent the intrinsic growth rate of each species i parameters b ij represent the interaction between species i and j and parameters a i and c i represent two kinds of negative effects for species i a i is the saturation rate caused by intraspecific competition and c i represents the limitations caused by the occupation rate by members of the same species the latter has a similar effect as intraspecific competition not with respect to the environment but to interactions with the other species to clarify the meaning of all the parameters we present them one by one to estimate the value of each parameter we performed a comprehensive review of the ecological literature of the system as presented in b r i represents the intrinsic growth rate of each species i we assume that all r i 0 since species depends exclusively on their interactions to reproduce male moths need female moths which in turn need male moths as well as the plants since the female moths also include the larvae parasitoids can survive only in the presence of female moths since they inject eggs inside moths larvae of all the r i only r 1 can be considered positive as well as negative but the only difference when r 1 0 besides an increase in the population size shown later is that the plants can survive without any of the other species which does not reflect the system we care to study r i is measured in units of time 1 and its inverse is the mean lifetime of species i b 12 represents the interaction between the plants and the male moths since it summarizes the entire interaction it thus reflects how many viable seeds are born for each fruit that matures for each flower that a male moth pollinates averaged by the mean number of flowers that a plant produces per unit of time at the end it equals the number of new plants a male moth generates on average per unit of time since it measures plant births b 12 0 and is measured in units of time moths 1 b 13 represents the interaction between the plants and both the female adult moths and larvae we set b 13 b 13 in which b 13 corresponds to the pollination effect of the female moths a mutualistic interaction and b 13 represents the predatory behavior of the moth s larvae an antagonistic interaction in this case we consider that b 13 b 13 so the overall interaction is antagonistic for the plant thus it reflects how many viable seeds die instead of being born for each fruit that matures for each flower that a female moth pollinates averaged by the mean number of flowers that a plant produces per unit of time since it represents deaths b 13 0 and is measured in units of time moths 1 b 23 since male moths reproduce only through female moths this parameter represents how many of the viable larvae produced by a pairing between male and female moths are males per unit of time to calculate this number it is necessary to know the average sex ratio therefore b 23 has units of time moths 1 and necessarily b 23 0 b 31 has a deeper meaning since we assumed that moths need plants to lay their eggs and only female moths can do that this parameter reflects how many viable larvae may arise on average from each plant considering that the larvae eat mainly seeds but also remains of the fruits and even flowers a plant whose flowers and fruits are eaten cannot survive or reproduce and therefore dies to measure this value we calculated how many fruits and flowers an individual larva needs to complete its development and become an adult moth this number reflects how many plants need to die to produce moths per unit of time b 31 has units of time plants 1 and is 0 b 32 means the same as b 23 but with respect to the female moth population therefore it follows that b 32 0 b 34 is the number of female moths that die for each individual parasitoid per unit of time we counted the female moths only since we treated the female moths and their larvae as a single stage therefore b 34 has units of time parasitoids 1 and is 0 b 43 is the number of parasitoids born for each female moth that dies per unit of time it equals the inverse of the number of moths that a parasitoid needs to grow from egg to larva and then to an adult b 43 has units of time moths 1 and is 0 a i represents the limitation imposed by intraspecific competition i e how much the survival of an individuals is reduced because of the presence of other individuals of the same species in the absence of interactions the inverse of this number represents the carrying capacity of a species over the area under study times its mean lifetime a i is measured in units of time population 1 and is always 0 c i even though this parameter is similar to a i it has a different meaning c i represents the relative presence of individuals of a species in the area under study so it measures the competition from trophic interactions we calculated its value by dividing the mean area that an individual occupies by the total area that it can grow into thus c i is a dimensionless parameter and always 0 b 14 b 21 b 24 b 41 b 42 are all 0 this happens because there are no significant direct interactions between plants and parasitoids male moths and plants even male moths feed on plants they reproduce only through female moths and male moths and parasitoids the latter only inject eggs inside the larvae here represented as females only 2 3 solving the set of equations we solved the system numerically using a set of ordinary differential equations odes we used mathematica for the odes and figures and python for the global sensitivity analysis odes were solved numerically switching between explicit and implicit runge kutta methods when stiffness was detected since the system could not be solved analytically we calculated stationary solutions which represent stationary populations when the values are zero or any positive real number we used the jacobian determinant of the system evaluated at the stationary solutions to calculate their eigenvalues and to explore if the corresponding populations were either stable unstable or saddle points the initial conditions and numerical values of parameters used for the simulations are shown in b 2 4 global sensitivity analysis we performed a global sensitivity analysis of our system to study how the uncertainty in the model output can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the inputs we have chosen a sobol sensitivity analysis using the salib python library herman and usher 2017 sobol s method is designed to determine how much of the variability in the model output depends upon each of the input parameters either upon a single parameter or upon an interaction between different parameters sobol 2001 saltelli 2002 saltelli et al 2010 3 results 3 1 the three populations system no parasitoids by setting b 34 0 and b 43 0 we evaluated how the system behaves in the absence of parasitoids in this case the plant nursery pollinator system had only two stable solutions which might oscillate at first but stabilized later one stable solution was obvious extinction of all the populations and the other was a stable coexistence of plants male moths and female moths fig 3 in which the plant population declined to almost the extinction before arose again even though there were solutions that corresponded to extinctions of some of the populations all of them were unstable for the system since they have an obligate dependence between them with r 1 0 there is a stable solution with a positive population of plants and either the extinction of male or both populations of moths we do not present either case because they are of no interest for our system as it depicts a scenario without moths 3 2 the four populations system the role of parasitoids although in the previous case the stationary solution of the system was stable when it included only three populations this solution turned unstable when we introduced a fourth population the parasitoid species the solution became a saddle point the set of four eigenvalues had three negative values and one positive value λ i 33 16 4 26 2 15 0 31 the x 4 axis of the four dimensional phase space had an unstable stationary point on the extinction of the parasitoids therefore the system presented only one stable solution besides total extinction corresponding to the coexistence of the four populations with eigenvalues λ i 15 56 4 27 2 54 0 50 the system oscillated at the beginning but stabilized later and favored plant population compared to the system without parasitoids fig 4 even the presence of a very small population of parasitoids was enough to shift the system to a new stable stationary point in which plant population increased notably from x 1 817 to x 1 1004 with a negligible decrease in male and female moth populations there was also an intermediate phase between t 20 and t 30 in which populations moved to a stationary unstable point corresponding to x 1 191 x 2 20 x 3 38 x 4 62 the eigenvalues corresponding to this unstable solution had imaginary parts λ i 0 17 2 92 i 0 17 2 92 i 0 31 0 081 the reason why populations oscillate through them as mentioned if r 1 0 i e by considering other non nursery pollinators the model predicted a notable increase in plant population from x 1 1090 to x 1 1200 when r 1 0 0973 with a negligible effect in moth and parasitoid populations fig 5 the predation of the parasitoids on the moths mediated by b 34 regulates the effect of initial populations of parasitoids on the system fig 6 when b 34 0 03 which is 0 25 times the value we used before b 34 0 122 moths and parasitoid stationary stable populations remained almost the same they changed less than 1 5 while for plants varied significantly around 15 on the other hand when b 34 0 183 which is 1 5 times the value we used first all populations became extinct even though a stationary stable solution with x 1 1166 x 2 195 x 3 380 and x 4 199 remained for the system to go to the latter solution bigger initial populations were needed in this work we have studied two sets of inputs separately to understand their influence on the model initial conditions i e initial populations and the model parameters table 1 lists the results of the analysis of the initial conditions with different bounds 50 70 for plants 10 30 for males moths 20 40 for females moths and larvae and 0 5 for parasitoids the total order indexes are substantially larger than the first order indexes then higher order interactions likely occur in any case is remarkable the influence of the initial population size of the male moths and secondary the initial population size of the parasitoids table 2 shows the influence of all set of parameters in our model focusing on the total order indexes the most important parameter was r 2 the growth rate of the male moths the interactions between plants with male moths b 12 and plants with females moths and larvae b 13 had a moderate influence followed by the second and third order of parameters of the male moths a 2 and c 2 4 discussion we used a system of differential equations based on a generalization of the model of garcía algarra et al 2014 to simulate a complex biological system with facultative mutualism obligate mutualism and predation these ecological interactions can be introduced in the model simply by modifying the sign of the parameters since biological parameters are easily identifiable in this model we have effectively simulated an ecological system of two species that shift along a mutualism antagonism interaction continuum and then predicted the role of a third species parasitoid on the stability of the system previous works have suggested that parasitoids may act as a regulatory mechanism that prevents populations of pollinating seed predators from growing arbitrarily and thus harming plant populations to the extinction threshold force and thompson 1984 crabb and pellmyr 2006 nunes et al 2018 elzinga and bernasconi 2009 however this is based on observational studies and it had never been explored with experimental populations or by modeling approach the effectiveness of the parasitoid as regulatory mechanism depends not only on its population size but on the intensity of harming it causes to the nursery pollinators in our model these interaction was mediated by parameter b 34 the number of moths killed by each parasitoid per unit of time this parameter was carefully estimated from existing data considering the developmental time of moth larvae the probability of coincidence of larvae and parasitoids through year the number of larvae visited by each parasitoid and a factor to consider the coexistence of more than one species of parasitoids in the system the changes in b 34 modulated the duration of the oscillatory regimes and the stationary populations of the three species as seen in fig 6 when this parameter increases oscillations may provoke extinction of the female moths causing the collapse of the entire system in our example we have modeled only one parasitoid species and assumed that its effect on the moths is strong but it is common to observe more than one parasitoid species coexisting elzinga et al 2007 it is interesting to note that parasitoids may control over exploitation of plants by moths simply by increasing larvae mortality but the regulating processes can be subtler in the caryophyllaceae hadena microplitis system experimental studies have reported that moth larvae rarely die after the injection of the wasps eggs but the mean size reached by parasitized larvae is lower compared to healthy larvae elzinga et al 2003 if the growth rate of parasitized caterpillars is constricted the potential damage to the plants reproductive success is also limited this effect could be assumed with parameter b 13 thus the flexibility of this population dynamics model permits parametrization of these and any other regulatory mechanisms to test their limits the analysis of global sensitivity of our model showed two remarkable points 1 the initial population size of male moths but also of parasitoids had a higher effect on the stability of the system than the initial population size of plants and female moths and 2 the stability also depends on the parameters related mainly with male moths growth rate interaction strength with plants intraspecific competition and relative presence this fact has already been highlighted by labouche and bernasconi 2010 who noted that in the silene latifolia hadena bicruris system the female moths mostly carry with the antagonist side of the interaction oviposition of predatory larvae by contrast male adult insects only contribute to the mutualist side because they provide pollination benefits without predatory costs so they can support the net benefits of the interaction with the plant and therefore the population stability of the whole system however the pollination behavior of adult males in many other nursery pollination systems needs to be confirmed and quantified if they occur to explore properly the benefits and costs of the interaction labouche and bernasconi 2010 in our model the separation of sexes of the pollinating seed predator allowed us to analyze the male derived benefits for the first time compared with previous studies that modeled the stability of mutualisms by interspecific population regulation holland and deangelis 2001 2006 westerbergh and westerbergh 2001 as stated before some nursery pollinated plants perform random or selective abortion of fruits which has been modelized as an effective evolutionary strategy to regulate populations of their mutualist antagonist partners holland and deangelis 2001 2006 westerbergh and westerbergh 2001 however the fruit abortion in response to hadena moths has been described only in one species of caryophyllaceae silene latifolia jolivet and bernasconi 2006 our results demonstrate that the evolution of this mechanism may not be necessary if there exist other ecological processes of regulation mediated by third organisms pairs of species involved in nursery pollination systems do not interact in isolation but are entangled into ecosystems the presence of one or more species of parasitoids and other legitimate pollinators in combination with the role of each sex on the net outcome of the interaction and the spatio temporal variation in species abundance will determine the direction of these mutualistic antagonistic gradients and confer more robustness to the system conflict of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by ministry of economy and competitiveness of spain research projects cgl2009 08755 and mtm2015 63914 p appendix a the role of male plants in the silene hadena system we can demonstrate that there is no influence of dividing the silene population into males and females by taking equations 2 to 5 set the original plant population as female and add a male plant population namely x 5 focusing only on x 1 and x 5 since others populations and their dynamics remain the same we have a 1 x 1 x 1 r 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 b 15 x 5 a 1 c 1 b 12 x 2 b 13 x 3 b 15 x 5 x 1 a 2 x 5 x 5 r 5 b 51 x 1 a 5 c 5 b 51 x 1 x 5 the only change is thus the new male plant population x 5 which obviously behaves as an obligate mutualist of the female population x 1 there are only two stationary points for the male plant population x 5 0 and x 5 r 5 b 51 x 1 a 1 c 5 b 51 x 1 for the first one we return to the original system of equations 2 to 5 for the second one we obtain a function of x 1 that shifts from a negative value if r 5 b 51 x 1 we established that r 5 0 to a positive one thus the unique dynamics that x 5 offers is going from extinction to its carrying capacity depending on x 1 on the other hand the dynamics of x 1 depends on itself and b 15 since the last parameter modulates the influence of x 5 the value of b 15 cannot be too high compared to the other b 1j because that would ensure the survival of x 1 and x 5 without pollinators as a matter of fact one may even argue that b 15 0 because the reproduction of the plants depends on the pollination a process that depends mainly on the moths and other flower visitors thus if b 15 0 but small enough the influence of x 5 would be also very small and the system would behave as if x 5 does not exist appendix b numerical values used on the simulations we present the numerical values that we used in the simulations presented in the figures table b 3 we calculated the value of each parameter by considering the following data and assumptions first all data were calculated using 1 day as the time unit and 1 year as the reproductive cycle since some individuals had more than one reproductive cycle per year we considered this in our calculations for some parameters that could not be obtained from actual data reasonable estimates were used banks et al 2017 moxnes and hausken

25111,isla del coco costa rica forms part of the five oceanic islands of the eastern tropical pacific and is well known for its high biodiversity and great endemism while several marine biological and oceanographical surveys have been conducted around the island over the past 35 years an integrated systematic view of the shallow water system is lacking as is an assessment of the impact of illegal fisheries the aim of the study was thus to identify the main biological compartments of the isla del coco system and to quantify its energy flow structure through the development of a trophic model for the shallow water environments 30 m with the software ecopath with ecosim and based on the model structure previously used for darwin and wolf islets in the galápagos archipelago a trophic model was developed using information from several field surveys and additional data from similar systems the total biomass of the isla del coco system 1 972 25 t km 2 was mainly comprised of high trophic level species such as hammerhead shark pelagic predatory fish and other sharks the reef ecosystem is in a healthy relatively undisturbed state and dominated by large apex predators and mesopredators of the keystone groups identified toothed cetaceans tiger sharks other sharks benthic omnivorous fish and pelagic predatory fish toothed cetaceans and tiger sharks were identified as having the strongest influence on the structure and diversity of the community through direct and indirect interactions the isla del coco ecosystem presents a higher biomass than a similar system in the galápagos archipelago likely due to lower fishing pressure and higher system maturity keywords oceanic island reef ecosystem ecopath with ecosim top predator mature system marine protected area 1

suggested that sharks and large fish create a selective pressure that enhance system productivity and keep the trophic structure balanced espinoza et al 2014 alvarado et al 2016a due to the high abundance of pelagic predators and the low productivity ic presents a complex trophic assemblage that has been described as an inverted biomass pyramid acuña gonzález et al 2008 friedlander et al 2012 similar ecosystem configurations have been described in the galápagos archipelago specifically for the northern islets of darwin and wolf as well as in other remote islands in the central pacific sandin et al 2008 ruiz et al 2016 however it is notable that some of those locations are under the pressure of artisanal and or commercial fishing whereas ic is considered to be in a quasi pristine state edgar et al 2014 due to its remarkable and worldwide recognized biodiversity ic was designated as a national park in 1978 an unesco world heritage site in 1997 and the extraction of biological or geological resources is strictly prohibited within a 12 nautical mile radius 22 km with its 30 years experience in conservation ic is a success story in demonstrating the effectiveness of marine protected areas mpas edgar et al 2014 however in the past decade this national park has been confronted with illegal fisheries operating inside its boundaries affecting the entire ecosystem and in particular the populations of fish and elasmobranchs sibaja cordero 2008 white et al 2015 presumably as a result of overfishing 8 of 12 elasmobranchs species present in the island and under consideration in the studies of sibaja cordero 2008 and white et al 2015 have declined significantly over the last 20 years in particular the whitetip reef sharks have decreased by 77 and the hammerhead sharks by 45 sibaja cordero 2008 white et al 2015 those numbers highlight the need for increasing enforcement and working on new tools to help decision makers of the national park to ensure that ic remains a marine sanctuary for the etp and the world because of the ecological and biological value of the island it seems essential to assess its community functioning and generate better instruments for conservation ecosystem modeling has been used as a tool to better understand and predict changes to community dynamics due to human or natural disturbances allowing the enhancement of knowledge and management okey et al 2004 metcalf et al 2008 wolff et al 2012 in particular energy flow models can be used to provide information about the state of the system as well as the ecological roles of the different functional groups and must be based on trophic information metcalf et al 2008 for example keystone species may be identified that disproportionately affect ecosystem structuring through their trophic interactions and thus have special significance for ecosystem based management libralato et al 2006 ruiz and wolff 2011 due to its high level of protection and the conservation of its organisms and ecosystems ic represents a natural laboratory and reference system for climate change studies cortés 2008 as it has been shown with other such models simulations can be carried

wolff et al 2012 alva basurto and arias gonzález 2014 ainsworth and mumby 2015 therefore the aim of the present study was to generate a preliminary trophic model for ic that will provide valuable information to help decision makers elaborate strategies for conservation and that allows for future simulations of the effects of global change and illegal fishery scenarios on ecosystem structure

the marine environments of ic most of the data available were within this depth range the narrow and uniform platform where the reef and pelagic communities occur lizano 2001 to build the model we used the software ecopath with ecosim 6 0 ewe christensen et al 2008 we first grouped the species into different compartments according to similar diets predators body size and metabolic requirements ruiz and wolff 2011 the definition of the functional compartments was based on the model elaborated for darwin and wolf islands galápagos by ruiz et al 2016 which allowed for model comparison between the etp systems the model contained 31 functional compartments table 1 including 13 fish functional groups eight benthic invertebrates groups four primary producers groups two zooplankton groups marine mammals sea turtles seabirds and detritus for each compartment key input parameters were biomass b production rate p b consumption rate q b and catch c for species captured by illegal fishing activities the model links the different trophic compartments through a predator prey matrix given the relative contribution of each prey group in the diet of its predator groups ecopath parameterizes

appendix a1 and table s1 appendix a2 fieldwork in the island was also carried out in 2015 in order to supplement deficiencies in the data for each of the functional groups we computed the average biomass per unit area t km 2 of each included species due to the fact that the data were coming from different years statistical analyses were carried out to ensure there were no significant differences between the expeditions and years and that all transects could therefore be averaged further details of data sampling collection and data analysis are available in appendix 1 3 1 2 production biomass ratio p b for fishes under the assumptions of mass balanced trophic models p b is equivalent to the instantaneous rate of total mortality z allen 1971 as we assumed there was no

the values for aggregated groups were estimated and adjusted proportionally to the relative biomass of each species the q b values for the non fish groups invertebrates seabirds sea turtles marine mammals were obtained from other published models and literature sources see table s1 appendix a2 3 1 4 catch and diet matrix the catch estimates were based on data reported by lópez garro et al 2016 as well as data provided by the ngo misión tiburón and by the acmic the diet matrix expresses the diet fraction of predator prey relationships within the system the basic structure of the diet matrix was built using information available in the literature table s2 appendix a2 fishbase froese and pauly 2016 but also shared unpublished information provided by the different scientific researchers of the area park rangers dive masters pretoma and misión tiburón because the ic ecosystem is an open system the diet import approach described by christensen et al 2008 was adopted for some groups this approach is based on the fact that some species are continuously moving in and out of the system boundaries to meet their needs thus it applies for the groups that include species that migrate to or from the system either to feed sharks and pelagic fishes bessudo et al 2011 ketchum et al 2014 nalesso 2014 roff et al 2016 or as part of their annual migratory routes marine mammals and seabirds may

which are used to assess the coherency of the input parameters including 1 biomass which should span 5 7 orders of magnitude when arranged against their trophic levels 2 slope of biomass on a log scale by functional group which declines by 5 10 across all the taxa when arranged against trophic levels 3 vital rates p b q b across taxa trophic levels which decline with increasing trophic level link 2010 piroddi et al 2017 the initial input data produced an unbalanced model ee 1 for several groups balancing was achieved by verifying first that the ecotrophic efficiency ee was lower than one and second that the production over consumption p q ratio i e gross efficiency ge was lower than 0 3 for all compartments ideally between 0 1 and 0 3 christensen et al 2005 in order to balance the model we made manual changes in the initial predator prey matrix considering the availability of prey groups within the model to do so the contribution of some prey in the diet of several predators was modified for some groups in particular the top predator groups it was necessary to reduce their consumption in the system through increasing their import values also during the model balancing some of the p b and average biomass values were slightly adjusted for a few groups the final values for the parameters that have emerged through the balancing procedure deviate only a little generally by less than 7 from the original input data and are within reasonable ranges zooplankton biomass was left open to estimation by ecopath assuming ee 0 95 during the balancing the value of unassimilated consumption for the herbivorous zooplankton was also modified and set to 0 4 because this compartment is mainly composed of calanoid copepods esquivel garrote 2015 and d alelio et al 2016 have shown that these species can have a higher fraction of the food intake that is not assimilated finally regarding the clandestine fisheries using the reports mentioned above we estimated the annual catches and compared it to the annual production of the targeted fish the results showed very low catches 1 of production the biomass value taken out of the system by the illegal fisheries was set to 1 of the production as it has been suggested that some illegal fishing goes undetected and that the data of illegal fisheries may be underestimated arias et al 2014 once the mass balance of the model was reached the summary statistics computed by ecopath were used for a general description of ic system and to assess the maturity of the ecosystem sensu odum 1969 the descriptors were 1 total throughput corresponding to the measure of the total sum of flows within the system 2 contributions to the total throughput from different flows production consumption export respiration and flows to detritus 3 breakdown of biomass and flows from different components of the system 4 total primary production total biomass pp b and total primary production total respiration pp r ratio 5 finn s cycling index finn 1976 6 relative ascendency christensen et al 2005 and 7 transfer efficiency the transfer efficiency te of each discrete trophic level is defined as the fraction of input to each of the aggregated trophic levels that is passed on to the next level i e either consumed by predators or harvested 6 ten qn 1 exn qn where n is the trophic level q is consumption and ex is export including catch and net migration we also had a look at two analyses computed by ecopath mixed trophic impact mti and keystone analysis the mti assesses the effect both direct and indirect that a small increase in the biomass of a group will have on the biomass of the other groups in a system libralato et al 2006 the keystoneness index is estimated by the software as follows 7 ks i log ε i 1 p i where ks i is the keystoneness of group i ε i is the overall effect of group i and p i is the proportional biomass of group i functional groups that have a low biomass and a high overall effect are attributed high values of keystoneness close or higher than zero 4 results 4 1 model characteristics the model construction resulted in a balanced model with 31 functional groups including 13 fish groups 17 non fish groups and one detritus group table 1 fig 2 input and output parameters of the model s compartments are listed in table 1 and the predator prey matrix is presented in table s3 appendix a2 the total biomass of ic system excluding detritus was 1 972 t km 2 table 2 the sharks and rays represented 23 4 of this biomass while the large fishes accounted for 16 7 the pelagic domain contained almost the same biomass as the reef fish compartments 634 t km 2 compared to 614 t km 2 the invertebrates groups contributed 21 1 of the biomass mainly due to the high biomass of the bioeroder sea urchins and 11 7 corresponded to primary producers the non fish groups at the highest trophic levels seabirds dolphins and orcas constituted less than 0 2 table 1 4 2 summary statistics energy flows and trophic structure structural properties of the ecosystem are shown in table 2 the model estimated a total system throughput of 41 183 7 t km 2 year 1 and a net primary production of 4 583 6 t km 2 year 1 of the total throughput 5 7 was recycled the total consumption represented 55 8 of the total throughput 22 978 4 t km 2 year 1 total respiration 29 3 12 050 t km 2 year 1 and the flow into detritus 14 9 6 135 8 t km 2 year 1 the pp b and pp r ratios presented low values 2 32 and 0 38 respectively the net system production was 7 466 4 t km 2 year 1 table 2 reflecting the fact that the system has large food imports from outside the system boundaries to top predators in the present model the mean trophic transfer efficiency te was 12 2 which is within the range of values assumed for aquatic systems lindeman 1942 christensen and pauly 1993a fig 3 shows that about 78 of the throughput t is associated with trophic levels i to iii trophic levels tls i iii contain 13 6 50 2 and 13 7 of t respectively fig 3 the te was greater at the lower levels of the food web due to fundamental metabolic differences between organisms at different levels in the food web 4 3 mixed trophic impact analysis the mti results are shown in fig 4 for most groups of the ic model the impact is too small to be visualized in the graph 0 1 the groups with largest impacts are the tiger shark shark and the toothed cetacean an increase in biomass of the shark and tiger shark groups is associated with a negative impact on the rest of the groups while change in the biomass of the toothed cetaceans is associated with a positive impact for the majority of the groups fig 4 the shark groups have a negative impact on their preferred prey such as sea turtles and sea birds but also on the other sharks and predatory big fishes with which they directly compete for resources the positive impact of the toothed cetaceans over the sharks groups and sea turtles results from an indirect negative impact to tiger sharks the increase of biomass of the cetaceans especially orcas results in a decrease of their main prey tiger shark and consequently prey of tiger sharks are positively affected an increase in sharks and toothed cetaceans biomass has a negative impact on the illegal fisheries by direct competition fisheries are positively affected by increases in tuna either by direct increases of tuna or via indirect increases in tiger sharks which feed on other predators of tuna 4 4 keystone analysis the keystoneness index described by libralato et al 2006 has the property of attributing high values to functional groups that have both low biomass and high overall effect according to that index the keystone functional groups are those that have values close to or greater than zero therefore in the present model the keystone groups are the toothed cetacean tiger shark shark benthic omnivorous fish and pelagic predatory fish fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 general description of the system in the present study we describe the structure and functioning of the ecosystem of ic our estimate of the total fish biomass 1 250 t km 2 table 1 is higher than what has been reported before for the island 780 t km 2 in friedlander et al 2012 110 t km 2 in alvarado et al 2016a this could be explained by the use of slightly different methodologies to survey the pelagic community as well as the different depth ranges covered alvarado et al 2016a did not carry out pelagic transects and surveys were at depth down to 17 m as expected the top predators represent an important part of the ecosystem about 40 of the total biomass and 60 of the fish biomass the top predators are comprised of large predatory fishes and sharks that we divided into three groups the migratory apex predator hammerhead shark the resident apex predator tiger shark white et al 2015 and the resident high level mesopredators white tip sharks silvertip and galápagos sharks the shark community represents 23 3 of the total biomass of the ecosystem 458 t km 2 highlighting their relevance in the system with its high diversity of habitats and species assemblages associated with its complex topography lizano 2012 komyakova et al 2013 the island is likely to have a higher density of prey and possibly also a higher fish productivity as a result there is greater availability of food especially for shark species with high dependence on reef fish in their diet rizzari et al 2014 the functional group of the bioeroders sea urchins mainly the species diadema mexicanum also has high biomass 283 46 t km 2 table 1 in the etp predation has been reported to be one of the main controlling factors of sea urchins alvarado et al 2012 2016b the island displays a complex bottom morphology lizano 2012 rojas and alvarado 2012 with patches of both rocky and coral reefs mainly from the genus porites guzman and cortés 1992 cortés and jiménez 2003 alvarado et al 2016a that provide more shelter from predation dominici arosemena and wolff 2006 palacios and zapata 2014 allowing greater densities and larger sized specimens in addition sea urchins receive only little predation pressure since their predators are controlled by almost unfished large predators such as carnivorous fish and sharks guidetti 2007 alvarado et al 2016b high herbivores and piscivores biomass in particular sharks as well as a high density of sea urchin and crustose algae see table 1 have been shown to be correlated with healthy reefs in non fished zones within the etp and elsewhere stevenson et al 2007 edgar et al 2011 edwards et al 2014 espinoza et al 2014 5 2 summary statistics energy flows and trophic structure the biomass estimates discussed above seem quite accurate due to the sound sampling strategy used and most parameters estimated by the program also seem reasonable and within the range of other reef area models values table 2 the pedigree index which gives an indication of the quality of the model input parameters was 0 47 table 2 being above the midrange 0 42 reported for 150 published models morissette et al 2006 this relatively high value is due to the fact that most of the biomass input data used were derived from in situ sampling in the area and suggests that the model is of acceptable quality and has realistic features despite some uncertainties christensen et al 2005 however since no stomach content data were available for the protected area because the extraction of organisms is highly restricted all the diet information had to be taken from the literature in future studies alternative approaches such as stable isotope analyses may allow obtaining more accurate information about the diet shiffman et al 2012 within the indices given by ecopath some can give indications on the maturity of the system christensen and walters 2004 christensen et al 2005 mature systems show higher overall activity and more complex organization odum 1969 pérez españa and arreguín sánchez 2001 pauly and christensen 2002 lobry et al 2008 the total throughput of our model a measure of system size in terms of flow is high and greater than for most other reported reef areas aliño et al 1993 pauly et al 1993 opitz 1996 liu et al 2009 frausto illescas 2012 ruiz et al 2016 the relatively low connectance index 0 17 suggests a rather low complexity nevertheless it has been mentioned that this index very much depends on system description and the level of taxonomic detail used to represent prey groups christensen 1995 christensen et al 2005 the system omnivory index also used for describing food web structure shows a higher value most likely because of the high representation of apex and meso predators exhibiting high level of omnivory 1 strong consecutive pairs of interactions such as apex predator to mesopredator and then mesopredator to primary resource accompanied with high level of omnivory tend to stabilize food webs and reduce the likelihood of a trophic cascade roff et al 2016 some other attributes can be used to assess the degree of maturity and stress of an ecosystem such as the diversity the net primary production the pp r ratio and the total biomass odum 1985 christensen and pauly 1993a christensen 1995 christensen and walters 2004 samhouri et al 2009 the low values of pp r and pp b are characteristic of a strongly heterotrophic system and show that the system is dominated by respiration and accumulation of biomass the high species diversity of the system alvarado et al 2016a the high system biomass and the high r p ratio are indicative of a more mature system state ruiz et al 2016 the role of the detritus has also been mentioned as an important feature within ecosystem development odum 1969 arias gonzález et al 1997 pauly and christensen 2002 in particular its function in the secondary production of a coral reef ecosystem is important arias gonzález et al 1997 our model shows an intense use of detritus by trophic level tl ii species 6 116 t km 2 fig 3 in addition the biotic community and specifically the fish and zooplankton groups releases high quantities of detritus generated during predation activities 4 696 t km 2 highlighting that this organic matter forms an important energy pathway arias gonzález et al 1997 ruiz et al 2016 baird et al 1991 point out that system comparisons using ecopath summary statistics should be made with care as the definition of the system and compartments and the origin of the input data have a great impact in those results however looking at the trophic structure of the present model in a more general way we can observe some similarities with other reef systems high internal predation as reflected by the high ecotrophic efficiency in the fish and benthic groups and a low proportion of benthic primary production passed up to non benthic consumers aliño et al 1993 arias gonzález et al 1997 liu et al 2009 ruiz et al 2016 finally with regards to the trophic structure it has been postulated that the fish communities of remote and near pristine systems tend to be characterized by inverted biomass pyramids with top down control from upper tls stevenson et al 2007 sandin et al 2008 mourier et al 2016 while the ic system does contain high fish predator biomass a closer look at the biomass and trophic flow structure across all functional groups combined reveals a more typical tapering towards higher tls fig 6 ruiz 2015 also came to similar conclusions for the darwin and wolf system galápagos the only exception is in the biomass of tl 1 which is smaller than that of tl 2 as shown by the diet matrix this ecosystem highly depends on imports of food from outside the system boundaries resulting in a substantial part of the energy intake needed to support the high biomass of top tl species imports do not contribute to the biomass estimates of the model which explains the atypical shape in biomass at the base of the biomass pyramid the perspective provided by estimated throughput per tl fig 6 provides a more holistic view on ecosystem functioning based on energy flows the mean te estimated 12 2 table 2 is higher than the average value of about 10 estimated across aquatic ecosystems christensen and pauly 1993b pauly and christensen 1995 although consistent with other coral reef systems despite their low primary productivity coral reef systems can aggregate biomass which has important consequences for trophic interactions and predator prey controls contrary to the image prompted by the inverted pyramid it is important to recognize that these systems when viewed from a holistic biomass or trophic flow perspective are still subject to the same inefficiencies in energy transfer across trophic levels as other systems furthermore the scale by which we study functioning in coral reef systems is important as higher tls often rely on production across an extended geographic region sometimes referred to as subsidies mourier et al 2016 which were treated as imports in this study 5 3 mti and keystone analysis the mti analysis shows for most groups that a slight change in biomass would have a low and negligible impact on others fig 4 furthermore most of the functional groups are not identified as keystone species as indicated by keystoneness indices lower than one fig 5 on the other hand both perspectives identify two apex predatory groups as being particularly important the toothed cetacean and the tiger shark this finding is consistent with the results of others studies and suggest that these species largely contribute to a top down regulation of their prey populations stevens et al 2000 heithaus et al 2008 baum and worm 2009 navia et al 2010 because they only have few natural predators apex predators are more likely to exert a strong influence on the structure and diversity of the community through direct and indirect interactions roff et al 2016 it is notable that in the case of the toothed cetaceans their effect is larger on species not fed upon directly implying that the trophic impacts of top predators are complex and indirect in the case of the shark group which we classify as mesopredators its relatively low impact in the mti analysis could possibly explain the high functional redundancy that exists among mesopredators sharks and large predatory teleosts compensating for any changes and thus buffering potential trophic cascades frisch et al 2016 those groups of predators are generalists and their diet overlap therefore they could potentially feed upon prey in proportion to availability kingsford 1992 kulbicki et al 2005 rizzari et al 2014 frisch et al 2016 roff et al 2016 these results might imply that the predation pressure in the ecosystem is diffuse rather than concentrated roff et al 2016 the presence of species belonging to the pelagic community reinforces their important rol in the ecosystem functioning as it sets up a selective pressure that maintains system productivity espinoza et al 2014 alvarado et al 2016a the hammerhead shark was not identified as a keystone group nor did it have a substantial impact as calculated by the mti analysis this is due to the fact that they spend most of their time outside the boundaries of our model and only use the area to rest get cleaned and as a reference point rather than to feed peñaherrera et al 2010 bessudo et al 2011 ketchum et al 2014 nevertheless their high residence time in the model area is important for their protection since they are more susceptible to mortality from illegal fisheries in their feeding areas further away from the protected boundaries of the island sibaja cordero 2008 arias et al 2014 ketchum et al 2014 lópez garro et al 2016 5 4 comparison with other models of the etp seascape as mentioned earlier comparisons between models must be done cautiously as the number of compartments taken into consideration the total size of the modelled ecosystem and the input data differ between systems and greatly affect the results and the properties of the system modelled in addition the general type of ecosystem should be considered when making comparisons due to differing ecological features among systems heymans et al 2012 here we specifically compare our model with the one for darwin and wolf islands in northern galápagos ruiz et al 2016 since both are oceanic island systems characterized by a reef community over background oceanic conditions their common features include their location within the eastern tropical seascape and the fact that they are open systems containing migratory species in addition a common model structure was used in the modelling of both systems looking more cautiously at the species composition of both models and their relative abundance in each functional group it should be noted that most species appear in both systems and dominant species are shared in the majority of the groups however the total biomass and throughput of ic is more than double that reported for the galápagos islands of darwin and wolf table 2 probably due to differing levels of fishing pressure isla del coco is a no take area with full protection while fishing is present to some degree in darwin and wolf since these islets belong to the low protection category in the galápagos marine reserve gmr with only 26 8 of its benthic habitats completely excluded from artisanal fisheries ruiz et al 2016 the artisanal fisheries in those remote islands target mainly the spiny lobster and the large demersal predators of high trophic levels taking out 3 8 t km 2 year 1 of biomass ruiz et al 2016 which could explain the lower biomasses of those groups compared to our model on the other hand the percentages of consumption respiration and flow to detritus over the total throughput are very similar in the two models both values of the system production are negative and reflect the large food import of these oceanic systems coming from further away and or deeper than their boundaries christensen et al 2005 the low values of pp r and pp b index indicate that both systems are mature and complex the slightly higher values of pp r and pp b in our model suggest higher utilization of biomass and possibly reveal a relatively better system health while the slightly lower value of system omnivory index at darwin and wolf can be explained by the absence of tiger and silvertip sharks in the latter system ruiz et al 2016 since energy seems to be transferred more efficiently between trophic levels in the ic system the loss of those higher predators in the far northern islands of galápagos due to fishery may have caused this difference in the functioning of the system when compared with other subsystems of the galápagos archipelago ic presents a higher system biomass 1 972 25 t km 2 than the bolivar channel 1 276 3 t km 2 and the floreana model 1 294 5 t km 2 ruiz and wolff 2011 ruiz 2015 however the structure and functionality of these three systems differ greatly due to very distinct oceanographic features the bolivar channel and floreana systems have twice the amount of primary production as ic ruiz 2015 while in the two other galápagos subsystems upwelling pulses with cold and nutrient rich water intrusions shape the food web wolff 2010 ruiz 2015 ic has more tropical conditions with warmer waters seasonal and interannual variability of sea surface temperature sst is generally lower in isla de coco as compared to the bolivar channel and floreana systems of galápagos wolff 2010 on the other hand the much higher biomass of high trophic levels in our ic ecosystem when compared to the bolivar channel and floreana systems appears to result from the fact that there is less fishery impact at the island compared to the galápagos archipelago it is known that local artisanal fisheries play a role in structuring the communities as they affect multiple trophic levels and may generate cascading effect throughout the food web ruiz 2015 enoch and glynn 2017 pauly et al 1998 established that under strong fishing pressure the average trophic level of the catch will decrease as a localized effect of extraction of species of higher trophic levels generally benthic and demersal piscivorous hence the index of mean tl of catches can reveal the major difference in protection between ecosystems albouy et al 2010 in this respect we find that the ic has a higher mean trophic level of catch 3 6 than has been observed in trophic models of the galapagos floreana 2 3 bolivar channel 2 4 and darwin and wolf models 3 0 okey et al 2004 ruiz and wolff 2011 ruiz et al 2016 therefore the high level of protection of the ic system seems to be reflected in higher system biomass higher predator biomass and higher mean tl of the catch 5 5 conservation consideration our modeling exercise shows that ic presents features of a quasi pristine system of a mature state dominated by large apex predators and mesopredators its high diversity and complexity as well as the dominance of long living species may make the system rather susceptible to changes induced from outside the system ruiz et al 2016 in particular a reduction through illegal fisheries or other causes of the keystone groups toothed cetaceans mesopredatory sharks and fishes and tiger sharks would likely provoke trophic cascades resulting in huge consequences for the entire ecosystem this is why it is essential to emphasize the conservation efforts upon those groups especially because the cetaceans and sharks are by catch species and therefore most threatened by illegal fisheries activities the state of the ecosystem reported here together with the nomination of the island as one of the most effective and successful mpa s worldwide edgar et al 2014 demonstrate that the conservation efforts have been efficient however it is important to maintain as well as keep improving the management actions since illegal fishing activities are occurring nearby the island friedlander et al 2012 white et al 2015 finally further investigation of the etp reefs food webs are increasingly important since reefs of that region have shown the ability to recover from mass coral mortality enoch and glynn 2017 those models and simulations may help to understand the mechanisms behind the recovery a big step for the preservation of the reefs acknowledgements thanks to cimar and

25111,isla del coco costa rica forms part of the five oceanic islands of the eastern tropical pacific and is well known for its high biodiversity and great endemism while several marine biological and oceanographical surveys have been conducted around the island over the past 35 years an integrated systematic view of the shallow water system is lacking as is an assessment of the impact of illegal fisheries the aim of the study was thus to identify the main biological compartments of the isla del coco system and to quantify its energy flow structure through the development of a trophic model for the shallow water environments 30 m with the software ecopath with ecosim and based on the model structure previously used for darwin and wolf islets in the galápagos archipelago a trophic model was developed using information from several field surveys and additional data from similar systems the total biomass of the isla del coco system 1 972 25 t km 2 was mainly comprised of high trophic level species such as hammerhead shark pelagic predatory fish and other sharks the reef ecosystem is in a healthy relatively undisturbed state and dominated by large apex predators and mesopredators of the keystone groups identified toothed cetaceans tiger sharks other sharks benthic omnivorous fish and pelagic predatory fish toothed cetaceans and tiger sharks were identified as having the strongest influence on the structure and diversity of the community through direct and indirect interactions the isla del coco ecosystem presents a higher biomass than a similar system in the galápagos archipelago likely due to lower fishing pressure and higher system maturity keywords oceanic island reef ecosystem ecopath with ecosim top predator mature system marine protected area 1

mexicanum and the ichthyofauna alvarado and chiriboga 2008 friedlander et al 2012 alvarado et al 2016a the fish biomass of ic is among the highest in tropical regions and the great abundance of sharks and other large pelagic species emphasizes the uniqueness of the island as a hotspot edgar et al 2011 friedlander et al 2012 alvarado et al 2016a a total of 298 reef associated fish species are reported for the island including 18 species of elasmobranchs fourriére et al 2016 the biomass of fish in this area has been estimated at 780 t km 2 40 of it consisting of apex predators such as

suggested that sharks and large fish create a selective pressure that enhance system productivity and keep the trophic structure balanced espinoza et al 2014 alvarado et al 2016a due to the high abundance of pelagic predators and the low productivity ic presents a complex trophic assemblage that has been described as an inverted biomass pyramid acuña gonzález et al 2008 friedlander et al 2012 similar ecosystem configurations have been described in the galápagos archipelago specifically for the northern islets of darwin and wolf as well as in other remote islands in the central pacific sandin et al 2008 ruiz et al 2016 however it is notable that some of those locations are under the pressure of artisanal and or commercial fishing whereas ic is considered to be in a quasi pristine state edgar et al 2014 due to its remarkable and worldwide recognized biodiversity ic was designated as a national park in 1978 an unesco world heritage site in 1997 and the extraction of biological or geological resources is strictly prohibited within a 12 nautical mile radius 22 km with its 30 years experience in conservation ic is a success story in demonstrating the effectiveness of marine protected areas mpas edgar et al 2014 however in the past decade this national park has been confronted with illegal fisheries operating inside its boundaries affecting the entire ecosystem and in particular the populations of fish and elasmobranchs sibaja cordero 2008 white et al 2015 presumably as a result of overfishing 8 of 12 elasmobranchs species present in the island and under consideration in the studies of sibaja cordero 2008 and white et al 2015 have declined significantly over the last 20 years in particular the whitetip reef sharks have decreased by 77 and the hammerhead sharks by 45 sibaja cordero 2008 white et al 2015 those numbers highlight the need for increasing enforcement and working on new tools to help decision makers of the national park to ensure that ic remains a marine sanctuary for the etp and the world because of the ecological and biological value of the island it seems essential to assess its community functioning and generate better instruments for conservation ecosystem modeling has been used as a tool to better understand and predict changes to community dynamics due to human or natural disturbances allowing the enhancement of knowledge and management okey et al 2004 metcalf et al 2008 wolff et al 2012 in particular energy flow models can be used to provide information about the state of the system as well as the ecological roles of the different functional groups and must be based on trophic information metcalf et al 2008 for example keystone species may be identified that disproportionately affect ecosystem structuring through their trophic interactions and thus have special significance for ecosystem based management libralato et al 2006 ruiz and wolff 2011 due to its high level of protection and the conservation of its organisms and ecosystems ic represents a natural laboratory and reference system for climate change studies cortés 2008 as it has been shown with other such models simulations can be carried out to understand and predict the effect of certain changes in coral communities such as coral algal shifts coral bleaching ph reduction and el niño southern oscillation enso impacts taylor et al 2008 wolff et al 2012 alva basurto and arias gonzález 2014 ainsworth and mumby 2015 therefore the aim of the present study was to generate a preliminary trophic model for ic that will provide valuable information to help decision makers elaborate strategies for conservation and that allows for future simulations of the effects of global change and illegal fishery scenarios on ecosystem structure and function 2 study area ic fig 1 is one of the five oceanic islands in the eastern tropical pacific robertson and cramer 2009 and also forms part of the etp conservation seascape bessudo et al 2011 edgar et al 2011 alvarado et al 2017 ic is the only seamount that reaches the surface of the coco volcanic cordillera a submarine mountain range that extends 1200 km from the galápagos to the osa

galápagos archipelago ecuador fig 1 lizano 2001 garrison 2005 cortés 2008 the island is influenced mainly by the north ecuatorial countercurrent carrying warm water from the western pacific eastward lizano 2008 in addition ic is influenced by enso which has a considerable impact on the distribution and abundance of several marine species such as cartilaginous and bony fishes lea and rosenblatt 2000 garrison 2005 white et al 2015 3 materials and methods the model area chosen was the shallow habitat 30 m depth around ic covering a total area of 14 5 km2 fig 1 this is the most studied area of the marine environments of ic most of the data available were within this depth range the narrow and uniform platform where the reef and pelagic communities occur lizano 2001 to build the model we used the software ecopath with ecosim 6 0 ewe christensen et al 2008 we first grouped the species into different compartments according to similar diets predators body size and metabolic requirements ruiz and wolff 2011 the definition of the functional compartments was based on the model elaborated for darwin and wolf islands galápagos by ruiz et al 2016 which allowed for model comparison between the etp systems the model contained 31 functional compartments table 1 including 13 fish functional groups eight benthic invertebrates groups four primary producers groups two zooplankton groups marine mammals sea turtles seabirds and detritus for each compartment key input parameters were biomass b production rate p b consumption rate q b and catch c for species captured by illegal fishing activities the model links the different trophic compartments through a predator prey matrix given the relative contribution of each prey group in the diet of its predator groups ecopath parameterizes the model based on the assumption that the production p of each group is balanced by losses to predation fishery and other predatory sources of mortality christensen and walters 2004 1 pi yi bi m2i ei

is the prey consumption pi is the production ri is the respiration and ufi the unassimilated food including excretion and egestion energy flow in the model requires definition of the diet for all

appendix a1 and table s1 appendix a2 fieldwork in the island was also carried out in 2015 in order to supplement deficiencies in the data for each of the functional groups we computed the average biomass per unit area t km 2 of each included species due to the fact that the data were coming from different years statistical analyses were carried out to ensure there were no significant differences between the expeditions and years and that all transects could therefore be averaged further details of data sampling collection and data analysis are available in appendix 1 3 1 2 production biomass ratio p b for fishes under the assumptions of mass balanced trophic models p b is equivalent to the instantaneous rate of total mortality z allen 1971 as we assumed there was no

the values for aggregated groups were estimated and adjusted proportionally to the relative biomass of each species the q b values for the non fish groups invertebrates seabirds sea turtles marine mammals were obtained from other published models and literature sources see table s1 appendix a2 3 1 4 catch and diet matrix the catch estimates were based on data reported by lópez garro et al 2016 as well as data provided by the ngo misión tiburón and by the acmic the diet matrix expresses the diet fraction of predator prey relationships within the system the basic structure of the diet matrix was built using information available in the literature table s2 appendix a2 fishbase froese and pauly 2016 but also shared unpublished information provided by the different scientific researchers of the area park rangers dive masters pretoma and misión tiburón because the ic ecosystem is an open system the diet import approach described by christensen et al 2008 was adopted for some groups this approach is based on the fact that some species are continuously moving in and out of the system boundaries to meet their needs thus it applies for the groups that include species that migrate to or from the system either to feed sharks and pelagic fishes bessudo et al 2011 ketchum et al 2014 nalesso 2014 roff et al 2016 or as part of their annual migratory routes marine mammals and seabirds may

which are used to assess the coherency of the input parameters including 1 biomass which should span 5 7 orders of magnitude when arranged against their trophic levels 2 slope of biomass on a log

link 2010 piroddi et al 2017 the initial input data produced an unbalanced model ee 1 for several groups balancing was achieved by verifying first that the ecotrophic efficiency ee was lower than one and second that the production over consumption p q ratio i e gross efficiency ge was lower than 0 3 for all compartments ideally between 0 1 and 0 3 christensen et al 2005 in order to balance the model we made manual changes in the initial predator prey matrix considering the availability of prey groups within the model to do so the contribution of some prey in the diet of several predators was modified for some groups in particular the top predator groups it was necessary to reduce their consumption in the system through increasing their import values also during the model balancing some of the p b and average biomass values were slightly adjusted for a few groups the final values for the parameters that have emerged through the balancing procedure deviate only a little generally by less than 7 from the original input data and are within reasonable ranges zooplankton biomass was left open to estimation by ecopath assuming ee 0 95 during the balancing the value of unassimilated consumption for the herbivorous zooplankton was also modified and set to 0 4 because this compartment is mainly composed of calanoid copepods esquivel garrote 2015 and d alelio et al 2016 have shown that these species can have a higher fraction of the food intake that is not assimilated finally regarding the clandestine fisheries using the reports mentioned above we estimated the annual catches and compared it to the annual production of the targeted fish the results showed very low catches 1 of production the biomass value taken out of the system by the illegal fisheries was set to 1 of the production as it has been suggested that some illegal fishing goes undetected and that the data of illegal fisheries may be underestimated arias et al 2014 once the mass balance of the model was reached the summary statistics computed by ecopath were used for a general description of ic system and to assess the maturity of the ecosystem sensu odum 1969 the descriptors were 1 total throughput corresponding to the measure of the total sum of flows within the system 2 contributions to the total throughput from different flows production consumption export respiration and flows to detritus 3 breakdown of biomass and flows from different components of the system 4 total primary production total biomass pp b and total primary production total respiration pp r ratio 5 finn s cycling index

trophic levels that is passed on to the next level i e either consumed by predators or harvested 6 ten qn 1 exn qn where n is the trophic level q is consumption and ex is export including catch and net migration we also had a look at two analyses computed by ecopath mixed trophic impact mti and keystone analysis the mti assesses the effect both direct and indirect that a small increase in the biomass of a group will have on the biomass of the other groups in a system libralato et al 2006 the keystoneness index is estimated by the software as follows 7 ks i log ε i 1 p i where ks i is the keystoneness of group i ε i is the overall effect of group i and p i is the proportional biomass of group i functional groups that have a low biomass and a high overall effect are attributed high values of keystoneness close or higher than zero 4 results 4 1 model characteristics the model construction resulted in a balanced model with 31 functional groups including 13 fish groups 17 non fish groups and one detritus group table 1 fig 2 input and output parameters of the model s compartments are listed in table 1 and the predator prey matrix is presented in table s3 appendix a2 the total biomass of ic system excluding detritus was 1 972 t km 2 table 2 the sharks and rays represented 23 4 of this biomass while the large fishes accounted for 16 7 the pelagic domain contained almost the same biomass as the reef fish compartments 634 t km 2 compared to 614 t km 2 the invertebrates groups contributed 21 1 of the biomass mainly due to the high biomass of the bioeroder sea urchins and 11 7 corresponded to primary producers the non fish groups at the highest trophic levels seabirds dolphins and orcas constituted less than 0 2 table 1 4 2 summary statistics energy flows and trophic structure structural properties of the ecosystem are shown in table 2 the model estimated a total system throughput of 41 183 7 t km 2 year 1 and a net primary production of 4 583 6 t km 2 year 1 of the total throughput 5 7 was recycled the total consumption represented 55 8 of the total throughput 22 978 4 t km 2 year 1 total respiration 29 3 12 050 t km 2 year 1 and the flow into detritus 14 9 6 135 8 t km 2 year 1 the pp b and pp r ratios presented low values 2 32 and 0 38 respectively the net system production was 7 466 4 t km 2 year 1 table 2 reflecting the fact that the system has large food imports from outside the system boundaries to top predators in the present model the mean trophic transfer efficiency te was 12 2 which is within the range of values assumed for aquatic systems lindeman 1942 christensen and pauly 1993a fig 3 shows that about 78 of the throughput t is associated with trophic levels i to iii trophic levels tls i iii contain 13 6 50 2 and 13 7 of t respectively fig 3 the te was greater at the lower levels of the food web due to fundamental metabolic differences between organisms at different levels in the food web 4 3 mixed trophic impact analysis the mti results are shown in fig 4 for most groups of the ic model the impact is too small to be visualized in the graph 0 1 the groups with largest impacts are the tiger shark shark and the toothed cetacean an increase in biomass of the shark and tiger shark groups is associated with a negative impact on the rest of the groups while change in the biomass of the toothed cetaceans is associated with a positive impact for the majority of the groups fig 4 the shark groups have a negative impact on their preferred prey such as sea turtles and sea birds but also on the other sharks and predatory big fishes with which they directly compete for resources the positive impact of the toothed cetaceans over the sharks groups and sea turtles results from an indirect negative impact to tiger sharks the increase of biomass of the cetaceans especially orcas results in a decrease of their main prey tiger shark and consequently prey of tiger sharks are positively affected an increase in sharks and toothed cetaceans biomass has a negative impact on the illegal fisheries by direct competition fisheries are positively affected by increases in tuna either by direct increases of tuna or via indirect increases in tiger sharks which feed on other predators of tuna 4 4 keystone analysis the keystoneness index described by libralato et al 2006 has the property of attributing high values to functional groups that have both low biomass and high overall effect according to that index the keystone functional groups are those that have values close to or greater than zero therefore in the present model the keystone groups are the toothed cetacean tiger shark shark benthic omnivorous fish and pelagic predatory fish fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 general description of the system in the present study we describe the structure and functioning of the ecosystem of ic our estimate of the total fish biomass 1 250 t km 2 table 1 is higher than what has been reported before for the island 780 t km 2 in friedlander et al 2012 110 t km 2 in alvarado et al 2016a this could be explained by the use of slightly different methodologies to survey the pelagic community as well as the different depth ranges covered alvarado et al 2016a did not carry out pelagic transects and surveys were at depth down to 17 m as expected the top predators represent an important part of the ecosystem about 40 of the total biomass and 60 of the fish biomass the top predators are comprised of large predatory fishes and sharks that we divided into three groups the migratory apex predator hammerhead shark the resident apex predator tiger shark white et al 2015 and the resident high level mesopredators white tip sharks silvertip and galápagos sharks the shark community represents 23 3 of the total biomass of the ecosystem 458 t km 2 highlighting their relevance in the system with its high diversity of habitats and species assemblages associated with its complex topography lizano 2012 komyakova et al 2013 the island is likely to have a higher density of prey and possibly also a higher fish productivity as a result there is greater availability of food especially for shark species with high dependence on reef fish in their diet rizzari et al 2014 the functional group of the bioeroders sea urchins mainly the species diadema mexicanum also has high biomass 283 46 t km 2 table 1 in the etp predation has been reported to be one of the main controlling factors of sea urchins alvarado et al 2012 2016b the island displays a complex bottom morphology lizano 2012 rojas and alvarado 2012 with patches of both rocky and coral reefs mainly from the genus porites guzman and cortés 1992 cortés and jiménez 2003 alvarado et al 2016a that provide more shelter from predation dominici arosemena and wolff 2006 palacios and zapata 2014 allowing greater densities and larger sized specimens in addition sea urchins receive only little predation pressure since their predators are controlled by almost unfished large predators such as carnivorous fish and sharks guidetti 2007 alvarado et al 2016b high herbivores and piscivores biomass in particular sharks as well as a high density of sea urchin and crustose algae see table 1 have been shown to be correlated with healthy reefs in non fished zones within the etp and elsewhere stevenson et al 2007 edgar et al 2011 edwards et al 2014 espinoza et al 2014 5 2 summary statistics energy flows and trophic structure the biomass estimates discussed above seem quite accurate due to the sound sampling strategy used and most parameters estimated by the program also seem reasonable and within the range of other reef area models values table 2 the pedigree index which gives an indication of the quality of the model input parameters was 0 47 table 2 being above the midrange 0 42 reported for 150 published models morissette et al 2006 this relatively high value is due to the fact that most of the biomass input data used were derived from in situ sampling in the area and suggests that the model is of acceptable quality and has realistic features despite some uncertainties christensen et al 2005 however since no stomach content data were available for the protected area because the extraction of organisms is highly restricted all the diet information had to be taken from the literature in future studies alternative approaches such as stable isotope analyses may allow obtaining more accurate information about the diet shiffman et al 2012 within the indices given by ecopath some can give indications on the maturity of the system christensen and walters 2004 christensen et al 2005 mature systems show higher overall activity and more complex organization odum 1969 pérez españa and arreguín sánchez 2001 pauly and christensen 2002 lobry et al 2008 the total throughput of our model a measure of system size in terms of flow is high and greater than for most other reported reef areas aliño et al 1993 pauly et al 1993 opitz 1996 liu et al 2009 frausto illescas 2012 ruiz et al 2016 the relatively low connectance index 0 17 suggests a rather low complexity nevertheless it has been mentioned that this index very much depends on system description and the level of taxonomic detail used to represent prey groups christensen 1995 christensen et al 2005 the system omnivory index also used for describing food web structure shows a higher value most likely because of the high representation of apex and meso predators exhibiting high level of omnivory 1 strong consecutive pairs of interactions such as apex predator to mesopredator and then mesopredator to primary resource accompanied with high level of omnivory tend to stabilize food webs and reduce the likelihood of a trophic cascade roff et al 2016 some other attributes can be used to assess the degree of maturity and stress of an ecosystem such as the diversity the net primary production the pp r ratio and the total biomass odum 1985 christensen and pauly 1993a christensen 1995 christensen and walters 2004 samhouri et al 2009 the low values of pp r and pp b are characteristic of a strongly heterotrophic system and show that the system is dominated by respiration and accumulation of biomass the high species diversity of the system alvarado et al 2016a the high system biomass and the high r p ratio are indicative of a more mature system state ruiz et al 2016 the role of the detritus has also been mentioned as an important feature within ecosystem development odum 1969 arias gonzález et al 1997 pauly and christensen 2002 in particular its function in the secondary production of a coral reef ecosystem is important arias gonzález et al 1997 our model shows an intense use of detritus by trophic level tl ii species 6 116 t km 2 fig 3 in addition the biotic community and specifically the fish and zooplankton groups releases high quantities of detritus generated during predation activities 4 696 t km 2 highlighting that this organic matter forms an important energy pathway arias gonzález et al 1997 ruiz et al 2016 baird et al 1991 point out that system comparisons using ecopath summary statistics should be made with care as the definition of the system and compartments and the origin of the input data have a great impact in those results however looking at the trophic structure of the present model in a more general way we can observe some similarities with other reef systems high internal predation as reflected by the high ecotrophic efficiency in the fish and benthic groups and a low proportion of benthic primary production passed up to non benthic consumers aliño et al 1993 arias gonzález et al 1997 liu et al 2009 ruiz et al 2016 finally with regards to the trophic structure it has been postulated that the fish communities of remote and near pristine systems tend to be characterized by inverted biomass pyramids with top down control from upper tls stevenson et al 2007 sandin et al 2008 mourier et al 2016 while the ic system does contain high fish predator biomass a closer look at the biomass and trophic flow structure across all functional groups combined reveals a more typical tapering towards higher tls fig 6 ruiz 2015 also came to similar conclusions for the darwin and wolf system galápagos the only exception is in the biomass of tl 1 which is smaller than that of tl 2 as shown by the diet matrix this ecosystem highly depends on imports of food from outside the system boundaries resulting in a substantial part of the energy intake needed to support the high biomass of top tl species imports do not contribute to the biomass estimates of the model which explains the atypical shape in biomass at the base of the biomass pyramid the perspective provided by estimated throughput per tl fig 6 provides a more holistic view on ecosystem functioning based on energy flows the mean te estimated 12 2 table 2 is higher than the average value of about 10 estimated across aquatic ecosystems christensen and pauly 1993b pauly and christensen 1995 although consistent with other coral reef systems despite their low primary productivity coral reef systems can aggregate biomass which has important consequences for trophic interactions and predator prey controls contrary to the image prompted by the inverted pyramid it is important to recognize that these systems when viewed from a holistic biomass or trophic flow perspective are still subject to the same inefficiencies in energy transfer across trophic levels as other systems furthermore the scale by which we study functioning in coral reef systems is important as higher tls often rely on production across an extended geographic region sometimes referred to as subsidies mourier et al 2016 which were treated as imports in this study 5 3 mti and keystone analysis the mti analysis shows for most groups that a slight change in biomass would have a low and negligible impact on others fig 4 furthermore most of the functional groups are not identified as keystone species as indicated by keystoneness indices lower than one fig 5 on the other hand both perspectives identify two apex predatory groups as being particularly important the toothed cetacean and the tiger shark this finding is consistent with the results of others studies and suggest that these species largely contribute to a top down regulation of their prey populations stevens et al 2000 heithaus et al 2008 baum and worm 2009 navia et al 2010 because they only have few natural predators apex predators are more likely to exert a strong influence on the structure and diversity of the community through direct and indirect interactions roff et al 2016 it is notable that in the case of the toothed cetaceans their effect is larger on species not fed upon directly implying that the trophic impacts of top predators are complex and indirect in the case of the shark group which we classify as mesopredators its relatively low impact in the mti analysis could possibly explain the high functional redundancy that exists among mesopredators sharks and large predatory teleosts compensating for any changes and thus buffering potential trophic cascades frisch et al 2016 those groups of predators are generalists and their diet overlap therefore they could potentially feed upon prey in proportion to availability kingsford 1992 kulbicki et al 2005 rizzari et al 2014 frisch et al 2016 roff et al 2016 these results might imply that the predation pressure in the ecosystem is diffuse rather than concentrated roff et al 2016 the presence of species belonging to the pelagic community reinforces their important rol in the ecosystem functioning as it sets up a selective pressure that maintains system productivity espinoza et al 2014 alvarado et al 2016a the hammerhead shark was not identified as a keystone group nor did it have a substantial impact as calculated by the mti analysis this is due to the fact that they spend most of their time outside the boundaries of our model and only use the area to rest get cleaned and as a reference point rather than to feed peñaherrera et al 2010 bessudo et al 2011 ketchum et al 2014 nevertheless their high residence time in the model area is important for their protection since they are more susceptible to mortality from illegal fisheries in their feeding areas further away from the protected boundaries of the island sibaja cordero 2008 arias et al 2014 ketchum et al 2014 lópez garro et al 2016 5 4 comparison with other models of the etp seascape as mentioned earlier comparisons between models must be done cautiously as the number of compartments taken into consideration the total size of the modelled ecosystem and the input data differ between systems and greatly affect the results and the properties of the system modelled in addition the general type of ecosystem should be considered when making comparisons due to differing ecological features among systems heymans et al 2012 here we specifically compare our model with the one for darwin and wolf islands in northern galápagos ruiz et al 2016 since both are oceanic island systems characterized by a reef community over background oceanic conditions their common features include their location within the eastern tropical seascape and the fact that they are open systems containing migratory species in addition a common model structure was used in the modelling of both systems looking more cautiously at the species composition of both models and their relative abundance in each functional group it should be noted that most species appear in both systems and dominant species are shared in the majority of the groups however the total biomass and throughput of ic is more than double that reported for the galápagos islands of darwin and wolf table 2 probably due to differing levels of fishing pressure isla del coco is a no take area with full protection while fishing is present to some degree in darwin and wolf since these islets belong to the low protection category in the galápagos marine reserve gmr with only 26 8 of its benthic habitats completely excluded from artisanal fisheries ruiz et al 2016 the artisanal fisheries in those remote islands target mainly the spiny lobster and the large demersal predators of high trophic levels taking out 3 8 t km 2 year 1 of biomass ruiz et al 2016 which could explain the lower biomasses of those groups compared to our model on the other hand the percentages of consumption respiration and flow to detritus over the total throughput are very similar in the two models both values of the system production are negative and reflect the large food import of these oceanic systems coming from further away and or deeper than their boundaries christensen et al 2005 the low values of pp r and pp b index indicate that both systems are mature and complex the slightly higher values of pp r and pp b in our model suggest higher utilization of biomass and possibly reveal a relatively better system health while the slightly lower value of system omnivory index at darwin and wolf can be explained by the absence of tiger and silvertip sharks in the latter system ruiz et al 2016 since energy seems to be transferred more efficiently between trophic levels in the ic system the loss of those higher predators in the far northern islands of galápagos due to fishery may have caused this difference in the functioning of the system when compared with other subsystems of the galápagos archipelago ic presents a higher system biomass 1 972 25 t km 2 than the bolivar channel 1 276 3 t km 2 and the floreana model 1 294 5 t km 2 ruiz and wolff 2011 ruiz 2015 however the structure and functionality of these three systems differ greatly due to very distinct oceanographic features the bolivar channel and floreana systems have twice the amount of primary production as ic ruiz 2015 while in the two other galápagos subsystems upwelling pulses with cold and nutrient rich water intrusions shape the food web wolff 2010 ruiz 2015 ic has more tropical conditions with warmer waters seasonal and interannual variability of sea surface temperature sst is generally lower in isla de coco as compared to the bolivar channel and floreana systems of galápagos wolff 2010 on the other hand the much higher biomass of high trophic levels in our ic ecosystem when compared to the bolivar channel and floreana systems appears to result from the fact that there is less fishery impact at the island compared to the galápagos archipelago it is known that local artisanal fisheries play a role in structuring the communities as they affect multiple trophic levels and may generate cascading effect throughout the food web ruiz 2015 enoch and glynn 2017 pauly et al 1998 established that under strong fishing pressure the average trophic level of the catch will decrease as a localized effect of extraction of species of higher trophic levels generally benthic and demersal piscivorous hence the index of mean tl of catches can reveal the major difference in protection between ecosystems albouy et al 2010 in this respect we find that the ic has a higher mean trophic level of catch 3 6 than has been observed in trophic models of the galapagos floreana 2 3 bolivar channel 2 4 and darwin and wolf models 3 0 okey et al 2004 ruiz and wolff 2011 ruiz et al 2016 therefore the high level of protection of the ic system seems to be reflected in higher system biomass higher predator biomass and higher mean tl of the catch 5 5 conservation consideration our modeling exercise shows that ic presents features of a quasi pristine system of a mature state dominated by large apex predators and mesopredators its high diversity and complexity as well as the dominance of long living species may make the system rather susceptible to changes induced from outside the system ruiz et al 2016 in particular a reduction through illegal fisheries or other causes of the keystone groups toothed cetaceans mesopredatory sharks and fishes and tiger sharks would likely provoke trophic cascades resulting in huge consequences for the entire ecosystem this is why it is essential to emphasize the conservation efforts upon those groups especially because the cetaceans and sharks are by catch species and therefore most threatened by illegal fisheries activities the state of the ecosystem reported here together with the nomination of the island as one of the most effective and successful mpa s worldwide edgar et al 2014 demonstrate that the conservation efforts have been efficient however it is important to maintain as well as keep improving the management actions since illegal fishing activities are occurring nearby the island friedlander et al 2012 white et al 2015 finally further investigation of the etp reefs food webs are increasingly important since reefs of that region have shown the ability to recover from mass coral

25112,in highly regulated systems like large dammed rivers conservation legislation requires that systems are managed in part to avoid adverse impacts on endangered species however multiple endangered species can occur in the same system and management actions that benefit one species may be detrimental to another species the current water management strategies in the sacramento river basin are an example of this conflict cold water releases from shasta reservoir during the summer and fall months are aimed at protecting sacramento river winter run chinook srwrc salmon by providing suitable incubation temperatures for their eggs however the effects of these regulated water temperature releases on another threatened species green sturgeon are less well understood in this study we applied a simplified dynamic energy budget deb model aka debkiss to explore the effect of food limitation and water temperature on the growth rates of green sturgeon this model captures these effects and able to predict the growth of green sturgeon at different food levels and temperature conditions we then linked the deb model with a physically based water temperature model we applied the deb water temperature linked model for green sturgeon along with a temperature dependent egg to fry survival model for srwrc salmon to quantify the consequences of managing water temperatures to improve salmon eggs survival on the growth rate of green sturgeon we found that mean temperature dependent egg to fry survival of salmon increased across a modeled environmental gradient from critically dry to wet water year types while the fractional growth rate of juvenile green sturgeon showed the opposite trend and decreased as water years transitioned from dry to wet conditions we also found a non linear negative correlation between temperature dependent mean growth rate of green sturgeon and mean temperature dependent egg to fry survival of salmon which indicated there is a river temperature related trade off between early growth rate of green sturgeon and embryonic stage survival of salmon however the relatively small gains in the growth rate of green sturgeon achieved in years when temperature criteria for srwrc salmon eggs were not met came at the cost of large reduction in temperature dependent egg to fry survival of salmon thus we concluded the current sacramento river water temperature management for the eggs of the endangered srwrc salmon eggs have a relatively small impact on the growth rate of green sturgeon keywords energy budget model deb debkiss green sturgeon environmental stressors organism environment interactions 1 introduction conservation laws such as the endangered species act esa nmfs 2006 are put in place to protect species at risk of extinction however in some cases multiple endangered species occur in the same system and specific management actions that benefit one species may be detrimental to another for example several anadromous fish populations spawn and rear in the sacramento river california and are impacted by environmental factors such as altered water temperatures due to the operation of dams within the river basin water operations and large scale ecosystem restoration programs aim to recover and protect these fish populations u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation mid pacific region 2008 water management operations include controlled water releases from shasta dam on the sacramento river aimed at providing suitable temperatures downstream for the embryonic development of the endangered sacramento river winter run chinook srwrc salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha significant efforts have been applied towards field work laboratory experiments and model development to predict how temperature affects salmon life history martin et al 2017 however much less is known about temperature impacts on other esa protected species such as green sturgeon acipenser medirostris while laboratory experiments have contributed some data on the growth of larval and juvenile green sturgeon mayfield and chech 2004 allen et al 2006 poletto et al 2018 analytical tools are needed to synthesize the results from these studies and to extrapolate these results to field conditions green sturgeon spawn in three major river basins supporting two populations the northern distinct population segment ndps and the southern distinct population segment sdps adams et al 2007 the ndps is listed as a species of concern and spawns in the rogue river in southern oregon and the klamath river in northern california the sdps spawns in the sacramento river basin and is listed as threatened under the federal esa adams et al 2007 after emergence from eggs sdps sturgeon spend up to two years of their early life history stages rearing in the sacramento river heublein et al 2017 before transitioning into brackish and saltwater environments several factors have been suggested as causes for the decline of green sturgeon in the sacramento river including degradation of freshwater and estuarine habitats adams et al 2007 blockage of historical habitats by impassable dams mora et al 2009 and the effects of commercial fishing including by catch in bottom trawl fisheries erickson and hightower 2007 one additional factor that may contribute to the decline of sdps green sturgeon in the sacramento river is that dam operations are aimed at maintaining cool temperatures to benefit endangered srwrc eggs and may negatively affect the growth or survival of green sturgeon juveniles laboratory studies indicate that optimum green sturgeon growth rates occur between 16 and 19 c mayfield and chech 2004 water temperatures below 16 c often occur in the sacramento river and it is possible that flow and temperature regulation in the sacramento river may reduce the growth rates of green sturgeon leaving them more vulnerable to size dependent predation goto et al 2015 analytical tools are needed to predict green sturgeon growth under various water management conditions and to explore how structured water releases influence transitions through their early life history stages since food availability and temperature are known to strongly influence fish growth the primary objective of this research was to develop a mechanistic model that can predict the combined effect of temperature and food density on the growth rate during early life history stages of green sturgeon in this study we implemented the simplified dynamic energy budget deb model aka debkiss jager et al 2013 to explore the effects of food limitation and temperature on the early life history of green sturgeon the model allows for a mechanistic interpretation of the effects of food limitation and temperature on sturgeon growth and reproduction deb theory is applicable to all organisms but for individual species parameter calibration requires precisely quantified rates of key physiological processes under different environmental conditions thus to parameterize a deb model we compiled an extensive database of green sturgeon growth and reproduction studies over a wide range of environmental conditions we then used the model to explore the effect of food limitation and temperature on sturgeon growth and reproduction we then linked our deb model with a physically based water temperature model of the sacramento river river assessment for forecasting temperature raft pike et al 2013 to demonstrate the effects of temperature on the growth of juvenile green sturgeon we used the coupled deb raft model to predict the effect of observed sacramento river water temperatures on growth of larval and juvenile green sturgeon during their downstream migration and to evaluate how spawning location and timing impacts juvenile growth rates finally we used our green sturgeon deb model along with a model of temperature dependent embryonic survival developed for endangered srwrc martin et al 2017 to evaluate the extent to which managing water for srwrc eggs negatively impacts larval and juvenile green sturgeon growth rates and quantitatively estimate the effect 2 methods 2 1 model definition debkiss is a mass balance model founded on simple mechanistic descriptions of how individual organisms take up and use energy and materials which is represented using state variables and energy material flows fig 1 jager et al 2013 present a detailed model description including assumptions of debkiss which is summarized in the supplementary material the most important difference from the standard deb model sousa et al 2010 is that debkiss does not include a reserve compartment and lacks a state variable for maturity investment in reproduction starts at a fixed body size in our debkiss model we quantify one state variable body mass wv mg and the model involves four mass fluxes assimilation ja structural growth jv flux into the reproduction buffer jr and maturity maintenance jm debkiss makes the assumption that assimilation rate ja scales with mass wv to the 2 3 power and maintenance costs are proportional to mass thus the four fluxes in debkiss i e assimilation ja maintenance jm growth jv and reproduction jr are mathematically expressed as 1 j a f j a m a w v 2 3 2 j m j m v w v 3 d w v d t j v y v a κ j a j m 4 j r 1 κ j a j j i f w v w v p 0 i f w v w v p where f is the scaled functional response which is the observed ingestion rate divided by the maximum ingestion rate for a fish of that size the value of f is between 1 ad libitum food supply and 0 complete starvation ja am is maximum area specific assimilation rate y v a is the conversion efficiency at which assimilated energy is synthesized into biomass jv m is mass specific maintenance cost κ is the allocation fraction to growth and maintenance and wvp is body mass at puberty defined as the onset of allocation to reproduction a detailed mathematical description of the model can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 modelling the effect of environmental factors the effect of environmental factors can be included in the model by altering one or more model parameters and we only considered food availability and water temperature the effect of food availability can be included directly by altering the scaled function response f as a function of food density the effect of temperature is included by scaling the rate parameters i e the maximum area specific assimilation rate ja am and the mass specific maintenance costs jv m as a function of temperature many studies have demonstrated an exponential relationship between biological rate constants and temperature hardiman and mesa 2014 thus the mass specific maintenance costs at any temperature t j m t v is given by 5 j m t v j m 0 v e a 1 t where j m 0 v is the intercept of mass specific maintenance rate at 0 c and a1 is a parameter that is the exponential rate of increase of maintenance costs with temperature t c similarly the maximum area specific assimilation rate at a given temperature t ja am t is given by 6 j a m t a j a m 0 a e b 1 t 2 3 parameter estimation we obtained data from different sources table 1 and estimated the parameters using maximum likelihood optimization table 2 because the growth data sets included in our analysis reported body size in dry weight wet weight and length we required conversions between these variables we assumed a dry to wet weight ratio of 0 15 which was estimated from green sturgeon body composition analysis zheng et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 reported that juvenile green sturgeon body mass is 82 1 86 0 water content the relationship between wet weight and length is assumed to be 7 w v δ m l 3 where l is length cm and δm is a correction factor that accounts for the shape of the fish eq 7 implicitly assumes a specific density of tissue of 1 g cm 3 to relate the volume of a fish to its mass the correction factor δm was estimated from previously measured length and weight allometric relationships gisbert and doroshov 2006 zheng et al 2015 reproduction is expressed as mass flux jr eq 4 however in our analysis reproduction is expressed as number of eggs per individual green sturgeon per day assuming ts is the mean time between spawning events female green sturgeon produce a clutch size of f eggs we translated deb predictions for the reproduction flux jr to predictions of fecundity f as follows 8 f y b a j r w b 0 t s where y b a is conversion efficiency of converting assimilated energy into eggs and w b 0 is the mass of a single freshly laid sturgeon egg we assumed an average spawning interval of three years which falls within the estimated range 2 5 years for green sturgeon borin et al 2017 we estimated w b 0 from estimates of green sturgeon egg size egg diameter van eenennaam et al 2005 2006 brown 2007 was used to estimate egg volume by assuming the egg is a perfect sphere this volume was converted to dry weight to yield the egg weight wb0 for ad libitum food conditions we set f 1 while for the food limited experiments and field data we estimated f for the conversion efficiency coefficients yba yva we used the defaults as suggested in jager et al 2013 we estimated other model parameters by simultaneously fitting the model to all 38 data sets described in table 1 for the parameterization we used maximum likelihood optimization and derived the confidence intervals by profiling the likelihood jager and zimmer 2012 we used matlab 9 2 0 538062 r2017a to develop the code the basic scripts of the code can be found on http www debtox info byom php 2 4 deviation of growth at higher temperatures the exponential relationship between feeding rate and temperature in eq 7 substantially overestimated the growth of green sturgeon at temperatures higher than 19 c see fig s2 of the supplementary material while physiological rates of ectotherms are often well described by an exponential relationship at low to intermediate temperatures the relationship can break down towards the higher end of the temperature range where feeding rate plateaus or even declines borin et al 2017 hung et al 1993 mizanur et al 2014 handeland et al 2008 lee et al 2016 we hypothesized this mismatch in observed and predicted growth rates was due to leveling off of feeding rates at high temperatures thus to avoid the overestimate we assumed there is a critical temperature for the maximum area specific assimilation rate such that above a critical temperature tc feeding rate no longer increases with temperature 9 j a m t a j a m 0 a e a 1 t i f t t c j a m 0 a a 1 t c i f t t c we estimated the critical temperature tc based on the modified temperature correction factor presented in eq 9 and using the growth data reported in allen et al 2006 2 5 model simulations we developed a simulation model that tracks the daily mean temperature exposure profiles of juvenile green sturgeon in the sacramento river based on their movement and migration behaviors our assumptions of how juvenile green sturgeon migrated downstream in our simulations were based on ontogenetic patterns of activity levels observed by kynard et al 2005 and the age and size of saltwater tolerance observed by allen et al 2011 downstream migration of green sturgeon juveniles is facilitated by the transitional onset of saltwater tolerance heublein et al 2017 thus there is a period after hatching where juvenile fish migrate to rearing habitats to wait until the size dependent onset of the physiological processes that mediate salt water tolerance allen et al 2011 heublein et al 2017 synthesized sources that suggest individuals smaller than 200 mm fork length fl are absent from downstream estuarine habitats green sturgeon juveniles show a period of limited movement after hatching lasting about 10 days then initiate a rapid nocturnal downstream migration until 21 days post hatch kynard et al 2005 after this early migration period it is thought that juveniles settle into upriver rearing habitats until they reach the minimum salt water tolerant body size of 200 mm kynard et al 2005 accordingly we assumed that for days 0 10 larvae remain where they were spawned then on days 10 21 green sturgeon migrate at 6 5 km day kynard et al 2005 after 21 days they move both upstream and downstream with very little net downstream movement 0 1 km day until they reach 200 mm in length these combined movement patterns determine the distance an individual juvenile migrates downstream and consequently their location in the river we then determined the daily mean temperature exposure profile of the fish using raft which provides predicted mean daily temperatures in the sacramento river at a spatial resolution of 1 km pike et al 2013 then using the debkiss model we were able to calculate the daily growth increment at that temperature to update the length of the individual finally we used the debkiss raft to evaluate tradeoffs of water temperature management between the growth rate of juvenile green sturgeon and the survival of endangered srwrc salmon eggs due to limited information on the food distribution in the river however we assumed juvenile green sturgeon experience a constant food supply for the purpose of this simulation we assumed a constant functional response value of f 0 8 based on the values we estimated for klamath and oregon rivers table 2 2 5 1 effect of spawning location and spawning periods on early growth we first implemented the debkiss raft simulation model to explore the effect of spawning location and timing on the early growth of green sturgeon offspring and to predict the number of days juvenile green sturgeon require before reaching the estuary i e grow to minimum salt water tolerant body size of 200 mm we assumed four spawning and hatching locations poytress et al 2015 426 river km rkm 391 rkm at red bluff diversion dam rbdd 366 rkm upstream of glenn colusa irrigation district gcid and 332 5 rkm at gcid which are located at 60 km 95 km 120 km and 153 5 km downstream of keswick dam respectively fig 2 surveys of spawning events on the sacramento river indicate that the green sturgeon spawning window extends from early april until mid july poytress et al 2015 accordingly we considered two extreme spawning periods early spawning early april and late spawning late june based on the simulation results we explored the effects of the water temperature during these periods on juvenile growth which resulted from the spatial temporal differences in spawning and rearing conditions we further evaluated the degree of influence of spatial and temporal variation of spawning sites using absolute growth and specific growth rates in this simulation analysis we considered the mean daily temperature over a 22 year 1990 2012 operation period of the shasta dam 2 6 evaluating temperature management tradeoffs for green sturgeon growth vs chinook salmon eggs survival we compared our model s predictions for the effects of river temperature on green sturgeon growth with the predicted effects on winter run chinook egg to fry survival using the model from martin et al 2017 for this we explored the temperature effects of five historical water year types critical dry above normal below normal and wet fig 7 a on the early growth rate of juvenile green sturgeon furthermore we compared the mean srwrc salmon egg to fry survival to the mean growth rate of green sturgeon for the time period of 1990 2015 we estimated the growth of green sturgeon in their first five months i e from may 1st to september 31st and assumed they hatched at rbdd 391 rkm i e 95 km downstream from the keswick dam 3 results 3 1 parameter estimates and model fit we estimated values for all parameters used in our model table 2 and fit the model to selected datasets figs 3 and 4 s2 s6 in general the model captured the trend of most of the laboratory and the field growth r squared of 97 2 and reproduction data r squared of 89 9 figs 3 and 4 both temperature and food availability influence the growth of green sturgeon fig 3 which increases monotonically for the temperature range of 11 19 c the exponential correction factor assumption eq 7 captured the growth trend as a function of temperature in this range but over predicted growth above 19 c fig s2 of the supplementary material after inclusion of an asymptotic temperature correction factor eq 8 the model predicted growth at temperatures ranging from 19 to 24 c fig 5 and estimated tc to be 20 5 c with the lower 95 ci of 19 0 c due to limited data at higher temperatures we were unable to get a precise upper 95 ci our estimates for the temperature exponents for maintenance a1 is 0 165 95 ci 0 069 0 231 and feeding b1 is 0 147 95 ci 0 134 0 162 corresponded to q10 values of 5 2 and 4 3 respectively based on this information we estimated the q10 for growth of green sturgeon e g between 12 and 20 c q10 4 1345 for a 10 g green sturgeon 3 2 model simulations 3 2 1 effect of spawning location and spawning period on early growth model simulations indicate that green sturgeon growth is influenced by both spawning location and timing fig 6 and table 3 there was a positive relationship between sturgeon growth and hatch distance downstream of the keswick dam in both body size and time to reach the minimum critical salt tolerance body size of 200 mm there was a six month difference in the time required to grow to the 200 mm threshold 1 year for upstream and six months for downstream fig 6 however the spatial effect was lessened for fish that hatched later in the season where downstream fish required approximately 290 days to reach 200 mm regardless of hatching time those hatched upstream near the dam reached the minimum critical salt tolerance body size after approximately the same amount of time depending on the spawning location and spawning period our model predicted that a one year old green sturgeon can reach a body weight of 108 g hatched in mid of april 60 km downstream of keswick dam to 260 g hatched in end of june 154 km downstream of keswick dam table 3 from these results it is apparent that the mechanism driving the faster growth further downstream and later in the season is warmer temperature 3 2 2 evaluating temperature management tradeoffs for green sturgeon growth vs chinook salmon eggs survival we examined the impact of five water year types critical dry below normal above normal and wet on the specific growth rate of green sturgeon and temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon green sturgeon specific growth rate and egg to srwrc salmon egg to fry survival both varied in space and time fig 8 temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was highest closer to the dam and earlier in the spawn season fig 8 lower panel while specific growth rate of green sturgeon showed the opposite trend with higher growth rates further down the river and later in the season fig 8 upper panel temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon varied greatly across water year types especially in the upper 20 km below the dam where most srwrc salmon spawn in some locations and during some spawn times temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was near 100 in wet years but near 0 in critical years on the other hand variation in specific growth rate of green sturgeon was relatively low across water year types compared to variation within a year due to differences in spawning location and spawning period there was a negative correlation between temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon using observed redd distributions and specific growth rate of green sturgeon during their first five months of growth fig 8 in the years with the coolest water temperatures e g 1999 2002 2006 2010 2011 temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was 100 and specific growth rate of green sturgeon was between 3 6 and 3 8 d 1 on the other hand in the warmest years such as 2014 and 2015 where due to the drought water temperature criteria were not met for srwrc salmon eggs temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was only 20 and specific growth rate of green sturgeon was 4 2 d 1 furthermore the relationship was non linear moving from years that had 100 temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon to those that had 80 improved specific growth rate of green sturgeon by 0 25 d 1 however to improve specific growth rate of green sturgeon by an additional 0 25 d 1 required dropping temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon from 80 to 20 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 general our aim was to assess the impact of variation in water temperature in part due to managing cool temperatures to benefit the eggs of the endangered srwrc salmon on the growth of green sturgeon juveniles during ontogeny through their outmigration to saltwater by simultaneously fitting our model to an extensive database of green sturgeon growth studies under various temperature and food availability conditions we were able to establish a relationship between temperature and growth rate from a much broader range of temperatures than evaluated in any one particular study furthermore by integrating information across a wide range of studies we expect our estimate of temperature dependent growth to be more robust than would be obtained by any single study because the model explained most of the variation in growth trajectories suggests these studies are largely in agreement about the effects of temperature on green sturgeon growth our analysis suggests a strong temperature dependence for growth with an exponential relationship indicating that green sturgeon growth is sensitive to temperature between the range of 11 and 20 oc we also conclude that green sturgeon was sensitive to temperature management in the sacramento river however our simulations suggest that managing temperatures for the eggs of the endangered srwrc salmon has a relatively small impact on the growth rate of green sturgeon the relatively small gains in the growth rate of green sturgeon achieved in years when temperature criteria for srwrc salmon eggs was not met e g years 2014 2015 in fig 8 came at the cost of large reduction in a temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwc salmon another important finding of this study is the effect of spatial temporal distribution of spawning habitats on the growth rate of green sturgeon individuals hatched downstream and later in the spawning season i e june showed faster growth than those spawned near the keswick dam and growth influences the timing of the outmigration of juvenile green sturgeon larval green sturgeon hatched further downstream from the dam experience higher water temperatures which facilitates increased growth rates and the initiation of size dependent processes at younger ages our analysis also suggests that above 20 oc feeding rate no longer increases with temperature and as a result growth rates decline additional studies at these higher temperatures would allow for a more robust model of growth performance above 20 oc 4 2 the debkiss model assumptions parameter estimation and results in spite of the simplified structure the debkiss model was able capture most of the variation in growth and field reproduction data figs 3 and 4 and supplementary material the main simplifications of the debkiss model are the elimination of reserve dynamics and maturity as state variables an energy reserve compartment would lead to a different shape of growth curve at fluctuating food levels kooijman et al 2008 however at constant food density the standard deb growth model collapses into von bertalanffy growth curve fig 3 show the consistency of our model with the standard deb without including reserve dynamics and the results validate the first assumption of the debkiss model another simplification of the debkiss model is constant size at first reproduction due to lack of information on the size at first reproduction we were unable to validate this assumption however different studies indicate that green sturgeon outmigration is triggered by transitional onset of saltwater tolerance heublein et al 2017 and this physiological switch is size dependent rather than age dependent allen et al 2011 this combination of findings provides some support for the conceptual premise that maturity does not need to be followed explicitly as a state variable the other important model assumption is the asymptotic temperature correction factor eq 9 we applied for correcting the maximum area specific assimilation rate ja am we included the effect of temperature in the debkiss model by scaling the maximum area specific assimilation rate ja am and the volume specific maintenance costs jv m exponentially eqs 5 and 6 however our initial fit indicated that the model strongly over predicted the growth of juvenile green sturgeon at temperatures higher than 19 c the model captured the trend of the growth data for most of the studies we considered however there is a clear discrepancy between the model prediction and growth observations at higher temperatures fig s2 assuming feeding rate levels off above a critical temperature improved this fit fig 5 considering growth as net result of assimilation and maintenance i e eq 2 the critical temperature of tc 20 52 oc is near the optimum temperature that maximizes growth this finding suggests the optimal temperature for growth may be slightly higher than estimates from mayfield and chech 2004 who suggested that the optimum was between 15 c to 19 c mayfield and chech 2004 reported that food consumption growth and food conversion efficiency generally increased with temperature between 11oc and 15oc but stayed constant between 15 oc and 19 oc however a recent laboratory experiment poletto et al 2018 found that green sturgeon reared at 19 oc grew at faster rates than those reared at 16oc in a recent simulation study borin et al 2017 reported that the mass specific growth rate of a 20 year old adult green sturgeon increased with temperature until 19oc and declined above this temperature in this study the authors applied the wisconson bioenergetics model hanson et al 1997 to investigate the effects of different environmental factors including temperature on the consumption and growth potential of green sturgeon inhabiting willapa bay washington key bioenergetics variables in this study were derived from the bioenergetics model parameters estimated for white sturgeon bevelhimer 2002 however studies have revealed that green sturgeon and white sturgeon have physiological and behavioral differences that might affect their bioenergetics directly and indirectly poletto et al 2014 mayfield and chech 2004 verhille et al 2014 for instance mayfield and chech 2004 found that green sturgeon exhibited high metabolic rates relative to other sturgeon species thus we speculate that green sturgeon and white sturgeon might have different energy allocation strategies and these two species might have different optimal physiological performance temperatures our parameter estimation results also indicated that the q10 value of green sturgeon 4 13 is higher than q10 value reported to most biological systems i e q10 2 3 which makes green sturgeon sensitive for temperature changes 4 3 limitations and directions for future improvements the ultimate goal of this study was to provide a mechanistic modelling framework that can support the management and conservation of the endangered sdps of green sturgeon to this end we demonstrated the applicability of the model based on two case studies presented despite this promising outcome the practical implementation of the model as management tool requires more work one limitation of the model is that it does not account for indirect effects of temperature on food availability or predation goto et al 2015 incorporated a sized based predation component acting on juvenile shovelnose sturgeon scaphirhynchus platorynchus to a model evaluating recruitment dynamics of a target population as juvenile salmon survival during their outmigration is strongly influenced by predation within this same migration corridor johnson et al 2017 it is likely that size based predation and the influence of temperature on growth rate would produce survival biomass abundance metrics that also vary by spawning location or time it is also possible juvenile green sturgeon can encounter additional natural and anthropogenic stressors like environmental contaminants further research to investigate the combined effects of potential environmental stressors will improve the applicability of the model and help to develop a reliable analytical tool research on the effects of temperature on the survival of green sturgeon eggs larvae and juveniles will help to more clearly show the effects of the current water management practice on the population dynamics the other limitation worth to mention here is lack of feedback between feeding and food availability in the model in laboratory we can easily quantify the relationship between feeding rate and food availability and also the effect of temperature on the maximum feeding rate however it is difficult to quantify this relationship for the field population hence food availability is a function of different factors including the effect of temperature on the searching foraging abilities of green sturgeon presumably in rivers sturgeon have to work much harder to find food than in the experiments the assumed downstream migration behavior of juvenile green sturgeon is an additional element of the model that needs further research currently little is known about factors affecting downstream migration of green sturgeon in the sacramento river we estimated the typical downstream migration behavior of a juvenile green sturgeon based on published laboratory experiments kynard et al 2005 and our movement sub model uses a simplistic assumption about age size dependent movement generally our movement behavior sub model is tied explicitly to body size as individuals do not embark upon a downstream migration until they have reached 200 mm conversely results of juvenile green sturgeon out migrant studies suggest that their downstream migration is concurrent with high flow events poytress personal communication in reality this environmental cue might apply to all individuals regardless of age or size thus incorporating flow based migration cues into our model would likely amplify the seasonal and spatial differences in size and growth rates resulting in even larger

25112,in highly regulated systems like large dammed rivers conservation legislation requires that systems are managed in part to avoid adverse impacts on endangered species however multiple endangered species can occur in the same system and management actions that benefit one species may be detrimental to another species the current water management strategies in the sacramento river basin are an example of this conflict cold water releases from shasta reservoir during the summer and fall months are aimed at protecting sacramento river winter run chinook srwrc salmon by providing suitable incubation temperatures for their eggs however the effects of these regulated water temperature releases on another threatened species green sturgeon are less well understood in this study we applied a simplified dynamic energy budget deb model aka debkiss to explore the effect of food limitation and water temperature on the growth rates of green sturgeon this model captures these effects and able to predict the growth of green sturgeon at different food levels and temperature conditions we then linked the deb model with a physically based water temperature model we applied the deb water temperature linked model for green sturgeon along with a temperature dependent egg to fry survival model for srwrc salmon to quantify the consequences of managing water temperatures to improve salmon eggs survival on the growth rate of green sturgeon we found that mean temperature dependent egg to fry survival of salmon increased across a modeled environmental gradient from critically dry to wet water year types while the fractional growth rate of juvenile green sturgeon showed the opposite trend and decreased as water years transitioned from dry to wet conditions we also found a non linear negative correlation between temperature dependent mean growth rate of green sturgeon and mean temperature dependent egg to fry survival of salmon which indicated there is a river temperature related trade off between early growth rate of green sturgeon and embryonic stage survival of salmon however the relatively small gains in the growth rate of green sturgeon achieved in years when temperature criteria for srwrc salmon eggs were not met came at the cost of large reduction in temperature dependent egg to fry survival of salmon thus we concluded the current sacramento river water temperature management for the eggs of the endangered srwrc salmon eggs have a relatively small impact on the growth rate of green sturgeon keywords energy budget model deb debkiss green sturgeon environmental stressors organism environment interactions 1 introduction conservation laws such as the endangered species act esa nmfs 2006 are put in place to protect species at risk of extinction however in some cases multiple endangered species occur in the same system and specific management actions that benefit one species may be detrimental to another for example several anadromous fish populations spawn and rear in the sacramento river california and are impacted by environmental factors such as altered water temperatures due to the operation of dams within the river basin water operations and large scale ecosystem restoration programs aim to recover and protect these fish populations u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation mid pacific region 2008 water management operations include controlled water releases from shasta dam on the sacramento river aimed at providing suitable temperatures downstream for the embryonic development of the endangered sacramento river winter run chinook srwrc salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha significant efforts have been applied towards field work laboratory experiments and model development to predict how temperature affects salmon life history martin et al 2017 however much less is known about temperature impacts on other esa protected species such as green sturgeon acipenser medirostris while laboratory experiments have contributed some data on the growth of larval and juvenile green sturgeon mayfield and chech 2004 allen et al 2006 poletto et al 2018 analytical tools are needed to synthesize the results from these studies and to extrapolate these results to field conditions green sturgeon spawn in three major river basins supporting two populations the northern distinct population segment ndps and the southern distinct population segment sdps adams et al 2007 the ndps is listed as a species of concern and spawns in the rogue river in southern oregon and the klamath river in northern california the sdps spawns in the sacramento river basin and is listed as threatened under the federal esa adams et al 2007 after emergence from eggs sdps sturgeon spend up to two years of their early life history stages rearing in the sacramento river heublein et al 2017 before transitioning into brackish and saltwater environments several factors have been suggested as causes for the decline of green sturgeon in the sacramento river including degradation of freshwater and estuarine habitats adams et al 2007 blockage of historical habitats by impassable dams mora et al 2009 and the effects of commercial fishing including by catch in bottom trawl fisheries erickson and hightower 2007 one additional factor that may contribute to the decline of sdps green sturgeon in the sacramento river is that dam operations are aimed at maintaining cool temperatures to benefit endangered srwrc eggs and may negatively affect the growth or survival of green sturgeon juveniles laboratory studies indicate that optimum green sturgeon growth rates occur between 16 and 19 c mayfield and chech 2004 water temperatures below 16 c often occur in the sacramento river and it is possible that flow and temperature regulation in the sacramento river may reduce the growth rates of green sturgeon leaving them more vulnerable to size dependent predation goto et al 2015 analytical tools are needed to predict green sturgeon growth under various water management conditions and to explore how structured water releases influence transitions through their early life history stages since food availability and temperature are known to strongly influence fish growth the primary objective of this research was to develop a mechanistic model that can predict the combined effect of temperature and food density on the growth rate during early life history stages of green sturgeon in this study we implemented the simplified dynamic energy budget deb model aka debkiss jager et al 2013 to explore the effects of food limitation and temperature on the early life history of green sturgeon the model allows for a mechanistic interpretation of the effects of food limitation and temperature on sturgeon growth and reproduction deb theory is applicable to all organisms but for individual species parameter calibration requires precisely quantified rates of key physiological processes under different environmental conditions thus to parameterize a deb model we compiled an extensive database of green sturgeon growth and reproduction studies over a wide range of environmental conditions we then used the model to explore the effect of food limitation and temperature on sturgeon growth and reproduction we then linked our deb model with a physically based water temperature model of the sacramento river river assessment for forecasting temperature raft pike et al 2013 to demonstrate the effects of temperature on the growth of juvenile green sturgeon we used the coupled deb raft model to predict the effect of observed sacramento river water temperatures on growth of larval and juvenile green sturgeon during their downstream migration and to evaluate how spawning location and timing impacts juvenile growth rates finally we used our green sturgeon deb model along with a model of temperature dependent embryonic survival developed for endangered srwrc martin et al 2017 to evaluate the extent to which managing water for srwrc eggs negatively impacts larval and juvenile green sturgeon growth rates and quantitatively estimate the effect 2 methods 2 1 model definition debkiss is a mass balance model founded on simple mechanistic descriptions of how individual organisms take up and use energy and materials which is represented using state variables and energy material flows fig 1 jager et al 2013 present a detailed model description including assumptions of debkiss which is summarized in the supplementary material the most important difference from the standard deb model sousa et al 2010 is that debkiss does not include a reserve compartment and lacks a state variable for maturity investment in reproduction starts at a fixed body size in our debkiss model we quantify one state variable body mass wv mg and the model involves four mass fluxes assimilation ja structural growth jv flux into the reproduction buffer jr and maturity maintenance jm debkiss makes the assumption that assimilation rate ja scales with mass wv to the 2 3 power and maintenance costs are proportional to mass thus the four fluxes in debkiss i e assimilation ja maintenance jm growth jv and reproduction jr are mathematically expressed as 1 j a f j a m a w v 2 3 2 j m j m v w v 3 d w v d t j v y v a κ j a j m 4 j r 1 κ j a j j i f w v w v p 0 i f w v w v p where f is the scaled functional response which is the observed ingestion rate divided by the maximum ingestion rate for a fish of that size the value of f is between 1 ad libitum food supply and 0 complete starvation ja am is maximum area specific assimilation rate y v a is the conversion efficiency at which assimilated energy is synthesized into biomass jv m is mass specific maintenance cost κ is the allocation fraction to growth and maintenance and wvp is body mass at puberty defined as the onset of allocation to reproduction a detailed mathematical description of the model can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 modelling the effect of environmental factors the effect of environmental factors can be included in the model by altering one or more model parameters and we only considered food availability and water temperature the effect of food availability can be included directly by altering the scaled function response f as a function of food density the effect of temperature is included by scaling the rate parameters i e the maximum area specific assimilation rate ja am and the mass specific maintenance costs jv m as a function of temperature many studies have demonstrated an exponential relationship between biological rate constants and temperature hardiman and mesa 2014 thus the mass specific maintenance costs at any temperature t j m t v is given by 5 j m t v j m 0 v e a 1 t where j m 0 v is the intercept of mass specific maintenance rate at 0 c and a1 is a parameter that is the exponential rate of increase of maintenance costs with temperature t c similarly the maximum area specific assimilation rate at a given temperature t ja am t is given by 6 j a m t a j a m 0 a e b 1 t 2 3 parameter estimation we obtained data from different sources table 1 and estimated the parameters using maximum likelihood optimization table 2 because the growth data sets included in our analysis reported body size in dry weight wet weight and length we required conversions between these variables we assumed a dry to wet weight ratio of 0 15 which was estimated from green sturgeon body composition analysis zheng et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 reported that juvenile green sturgeon body mass is 82 1 86 0 water content the relationship between wet weight and length is assumed to be 7 w v δ m l 3 where l is length cm and δm is a correction factor that accounts for the shape of the fish eq 7 implicitly assumes a specific density of tissue of 1 g cm 3 to relate the volume of a fish to its mass the correction factor δm was estimated from previously measured length and weight allometric relationships gisbert and doroshov 2006 zheng et al 2015 reproduction is expressed as mass flux jr eq 4 however in our analysis reproduction is expressed as number of eggs per individual green sturgeon per day assuming ts is the mean time between spawning events female green sturgeon produce a clutch size of f eggs we translated deb predictions for the reproduction flux jr to predictions of fecundity f as follows 8 f y b a j r w b 0 t s where y b a is conversion efficiency of converting assimilated energy into eggs and w b 0 is the mass of a single freshly laid sturgeon egg we assumed an average spawning interval of three years which falls within the estimated range 2 5 years for green sturgeon borin et al 2017 we estimated w b 0 from estimates of green sturgeon egg size egg diameter van eenennaam et al 2005 2006 brown 2007 was used to estimate egg volume by assuming the egg is a perfect sphere this volume was converted to dry weight to yield the egg weight wb0 for ad libitum food conditions we set f 1 while for the food limited experiments and field data we estimated f for the conversion efficiency coefficients yba yva we used the defaults as suggested in jager et al 2013 we estimated other model parameters by simultaneously fitting the model to all 38 data sets described in table 1 for the parameterization we used maximum likelihood optimization and derived the confidence intervals by profiling the likelihood jager and zimmer 2012 we used matlab 9 2 0 538062 r2017a to develop the code the basic scripts of the code can be found on http www debtox info byom php 2 4 deviation of growth at higher temperatures the exponential relationship between feeding rate and temperature in eq 7 substantially overestimated the growth of green sturgeon at temperatures higher than 19 c see fig s2 of the supplementary material while physiological rates of ectotherms are often well described by an exponential relationship at low to intermediate temperatures the relationship can break down towards the higher end of the temperature range where feeding rate plateaus or even declines borin et al 2017 hung et al 1993 mizanur et al 2014 handeland et al 2008 lee et al 2016 we hypothesized this mismatch in observed and predicted growth rates was due to leveling off of feeding rates at high temperatures thus to avoid the overestimate we assumed there is a critical temperature for the maximum area specific assimilation rate such that above a critical temperature tc feeding rate no longer increases with temperature 9 j a m t a j a m 0 a e a 1 t i f t t c j a m 0 a a 1 t c i f t t c we estimated the critical temperature tc based on the modified temperature correction factor presented in eq 9 and using the growth data reported in allen et al 2006 2 5 model simulations we developed a simulation model that tracks the daily mean temperature exposure profiles of juvenile green sturgeon in the sacramento river based on their movement and migration behaviors our assumptions of how juvenile green sturgeon migrated downstream in our simulations were based on ontogenetic patterns of activity levels observed by kynard et al 2005 and the age and size of saltwater tolerance observed by allen et al 2011 downstream migration of green sturgeon juveniles is facilitated by the transitional onset of saltwater tolerance heublein et al 2017 thus there is a period after hatching where juvenile fish migrate to rearing habitats to wait until the size dependent onset of the physiological processes that mediate salt water tolerance allen et al 2011 heublein et al 2017 synthesized sources that suggest individuals smaller than 200 mm fork length fl are absent from downstream estuarine habitats green sturgeon juveniles show a period of limited movement after hatching lasting about 10 days then initiate a rapid nocturnal downstream migration until 21 days post hatch kynard et al 2005 after this early migration period it is thought that juveniles settle into upriver rearing habitats until they reach the minimum salt water tolerant body size of 200 mm kynard et al 2005 accordingly we assumed that for days 0 10 larvae remain where they were spawned then on days 10 21 green sturgeon migrate at 6 5 km day kynard et al 2005 after 21 days they move both upstream and downstream with very little net downstream movement 0 1 km day until they reach 200 mm in length these combined movement patterns determine the distance an individual juvenile migrates downstream and consequently their location in the river we then determined the daily mean temperature exposure profile of the fish using raft which provides predicted mean daily temperatures in the sacramento river at a spatial resolution of 1 km pike et al 2013 then using the debkiss model we were able to calculate the daily growth increment at that temperature to update the length of the individual finally we used the debkiss raft to evaluate tradeoffs of water temperature management between the growth rate of juvenile green sturgeon and the survival of endangered srwrc salmon eggs due to limited information on the food distribution in the river however we assumed juvenile green sturgeon experience a constant food supply for the purpose of this simulation we assumed a constant functional response value of f 0 8 based on the values we estimated for klamath and oregon rivers table 2 2 5 1 effect of spawning location and spawning periods on early growth we first implemented the debkiss raft simulation model to explore the effect of spawning location and timing on the early growth of green sturgeon offspring and to predict the number of days juvenile green sturgeon require before reaching the estuary i e grow to minimum salt water tolerant body size of 200 mm we assumed four spawning and hatching locations poytress et al 2015 426 river km rkm 391 rkm at red bluff diversion dam rbdd 366 rkm upstream of glenn colusa irrigation district gcid and 332 5 rkm at gcid which are located at 60 km 95 km 120 km and 153 5 km downstream of keswick dam respectively fig 2 surveys of spawning events on the sacramento river indicate that the green sturgeon spawning window extends from early april until mid july poytress et al 2015 accordingly we considered two extreme spawning periods early spawning early april and late spawning late june based on the simulation results we explored the effects of the water temperature during these periods on juvenile growth which resulted from the spatial temporal differences in spawning and rearing conditions we further evaluated the degree of influence of spatial and temporal variation of spawning sites using absolute growth and specific growth rates in this simulation analysis we considered the mean daily temperature over a 22 year 1990 2012 operation period of the shasta dam 2 6 evaluating temperature management tradeoffs for green sturgeon growth vs chinook salmon eggs survival we compared our model s predictions for the effects of river temperature on green sturgeon growth with the predicted effects on winter run chinook egg to fry survival using the model from martin et al 2017 for this we explored the temperature effects of five historical water year types critical dry above normal below normal and wet fig 7 a on the early growth rate of juvenile green sturgeon furthermore we compared the mean srwrc salmon egg to fry survival to the mean growth rate of green sturgeon for the time period of 1990 2015 we estimated the growth of green sturgeon in their first five months i e from may 1st to september 31st and assumed they hatched at rbdd 391 rkm i e 95 km downstream from the keswick dam 3 results 3 1 parameter estimates and model fit we estimated values for all parameters used in our model table 2 and fit the model to selected datasets figs 3 and 4 s2 s6 in general the model captured the trend of most of the laboratory and the field growth r squared of 97 2 and reproduction data r squared of 89 9 figs 3 and 4 both temperature and food availability influence the growth of green sturgeon fig 3 which increases monotonically for the temperature range of 11 19 c the exponential correction factor assumption eq 7 captured the growth trend as a function of temperature in this range but over predicted growth above 19 c fig s2 of the supplementary material after inclusion of an asymptotic temperature correction factor eq 8 the model predicted growth at temperatures ranging from 19 to 24 c fig 5 and estimated tc to be 20 5 c with the lower 95 ci of 19 0 c due to limited data at higher temperatures we were unable to get a precise upper 95 ci our estimates for the temperature exponents for maintenance a1 is 0 165 95 ci 0 069 0 231 and feeding b1 is 0 147 95 ci 0 134 0 162 corresponded to q10 values of 5 2 and 4 3 respectively based on this information we estimated the q10 for growth of green sturgeon e g between 12 and 20 c q10 4 1345 for a 10 g green sturgeon 3 2 model simulations 3 2 1 effect of spawning location and spawning period on early growth model simulations indicate that green sturgeon growth is influenced by both spawning location and timing fig 6 and table 3 there was a positive relationship between sturgeon growth and hatch distance downstream of the keswick dam in both body size and time to reach the minimum critical salt tolerance body size of 200 mm there was a six month difference in the time required to grow to the 200 mm threshold 1 year for upstream and six months for downstream fig 6 however the spatial effect was lessened for fish that hatched later in the season where downstream fish required approximately 290 days to reach 200 mm regardless of hatching time those hatched upstream near the dam reached the minimum critical salt tolerance body size after approximately the same amount of time depending on the spawning location and spawning period our model predicted that a one year old green sturgeon can reach a body weight of 108 g hatched in mid of april 60 km downstream of keswick dam to 260 g hatched in end of june 154 km downstream of keswick dam table 3 from these results it is apparent that the mechanism driving the faster growth further downstream and later in the season is warmer temperature 3 2 2 evaluating temperature management tradeoffs for green sturgeon growth vs chinook salmon eggs survival we examined the impact of five water year types critical dry below normal above normal and wet on the specific growth rate of green sturgeon and temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon green sturgeon specific growth rate and egg to srwrc salmon egg to fry survival both varied in space and time fig 8 temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was highest closer to the dam and earlier in the spawn season fig 8 lower panel while specific growth rate of green sturgeon showed the opposite trend with higher growth rates further down the river and later in the season fig 8 upper panel temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon varied greatly across water year types especially in the upper 20 km below the dam where most srwrc salmon spawn in some locations and during some spawn times temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was near 100 in wet years but near 0 in critical years on the other hand variation in specific growth rate of green sturgeon was relatively low across water year types compared to variation within a year due to differences in spawning location and spawning period there was a negative correlation between temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon using observed redd distributions and specific growth rate of green sturgeon during their first five months of growth fig 8 in the years with the coolest water temperatures e g 1999 2002 2006 2010 2011 temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was 100 and specific growth rate of green sturgeon was between 3 6 and 3 8 d 1 on the other hand in the warmest years such as 2014 and 2015 where due to the drought water temperature criteria were not met for srwrc salmon eggs temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon was only 20 and specific growth rate of green sturgeon was 4 2 d 1 furthermore the relationship was non linear moving from years that had 100 temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon to those that had 80 improved specific growth rate of green sturgeon by 0 25 d 1 however to improve specific growth rate of green sturgeon by an additional 0 25 d 1 required dropping temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwrc salmon from 80 to 20 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 general our aim was to assess the impact of variation in water temperature in part due to managing cool temperatures to benefit the eggs of the endangered srwrc salmon on the growth of green sturgeon juveniles during ontogeny through their outmigration to saltwater by simultaneously fitting our model to an extensive database of green sturgeon growth studies under various temperature and food availability conditions we were able to establish a relationship between temperature and growth rate from a much broader range of temperatures than evaluated in any one particular study furthermore by integrating information across a wide range of studies we expect our estimate of temperature dependent growth to be more robust than would be obtained by any single study because the model explained most of the variation in growth trajectories suggests these studies are largely in agreement about the effects of temperature on green sturgeon growth our analysis suggests a strong temperature dependence for growth with an exponential relationship indicating that green sturgeon growth is sensitive to temperature between the range of 11 and 20 oc we also conclude that green sturgeon was sensitive to temperature management in the sacramento river however our simulations suggest that managing temperatures for the eggs of the endangered srwrc salmon has a relatively small impact on the growth rate of green sturgeon the relatively small gains in the growth rate of green sturgeon achieved in years when temperature criteria for srwrc salmon eggs was not met e g years 2014 2015 in fig 8 came at the cost of large reduction in a temperature dependent egg to fry survival of srwc salmon another important finding of this study is the effect of spatial temporal distribution of spawning habitats on the growth rate of green sturgeon individuals hatched downstream and later in the spawning season i e june showed faster growth than those spawned near the keswick dam and growth influences the timing of the outmigration of juvenile green sturgeon larval green sturgeon hatched further downstream from the dam experience higher water temperatures which facilitates increased growth rates and the initiation of size dependent processes at younger ages our analysis also suggests that above 20 oc feeding rate no longer increases with temperature and as a result growth rates decline additional studies at these higher temperatures would allow for a more robust model of growth performance above 20 oc 4 2 the debkiss model assumptions parameter estimation and results in spite of the simplified structure the debkiss model was able capture most of the variation in growth and field reproduction data figs 3 and 4 and supplementary material the main simplifications of the debkiss model are the elimination of reserve dynamics and maturity as state variables an energy reserve compartment would lead to a different shape of growth curve at fluctuating food levels kooijman et al 2008 however at constant food density the standard deb growth model collapses into von bertalanffy growth curve fig 3 show the consistency of our model with the standard deb without including reserve dynamics and the results validate the first assumption of the debkiss model another simplification of the debkiss model is constant size at first reproduction due to lack of information on the size at first reproduction we were unable to validate this assumption however different studies indicate that green sturgeon outmigration is triggered by transitional onset of saltwater tolerance heublein et al 2017 and this physiological switch is size dependent rather than age dependent allen et al 2011 this combination of findings provides some support for the conceptual premise that maturity does not need to be followed explicitly as a state variable the other important model assumption is the asymptotic temperature correction factor eq 9 we applied for correcting the maximum area specific assimilation rate ja am we included the effect of temperature in the debkiss model by scaling the maximum area specific assimilation rate ja am and the volume specific maintenance costs jv m exponentially eqs 5 and 6 however our initial fit indicated that the model strongly over predicted the growth of juvenile green sturgeon at temperatures higher than 19 c the model captured the trend of the growth data for most of the studies we considered however there is a clear discrepancy between the model prediction and growth observations at higher temperatures fig s2 assuming feeding rate levels off above a critical temperature improved this fit fig 5 considering growth as net result of assimilation and maintenance i e eq 2 the critical temperature of tc 20 52 oc is near the optimum temperature that maximizes growth this finding suggests the optimal temperature for growth may be slightly higher than estimates from mayfield and chech 2004 who suggested that the optimum was between 15 c to 19 c mayfield and chech 2004 reported that food consumption growth and food conversion efficiency generally increased with temperature between 11oc and 15oc but stayed constant between 15 oc and 19 oc however a recent laboratory experiment poletto et al 2018 found that green sturgeon reared at 19 oc grew at faster rates than those reared at 16oc in a recent simulation study borin et al 2017 reported that the mass specific growth rate of a 20 year old adult green sturgeon increased with temperature until 19oc and declined above this temperature in this study the authors applied the wisconson bioenergetics model hanson et al 1997 to investigate the effects of different environmental factors including temperature on the consumption and growth potential of green sturgeon inhabiting willapa bay washington key bioenergetics variables in this study were derived from the bioenergetics model parameters estimated for white sturgeon bevelhimer 2002 however studies have revealed that green sturgeon and white sturgeon have physiological and behavioral differences that might affect their bioenergetics directly and indirectly poletto et al 2014 mayfield and chech 2004 verhille et al 2014 for instance mayfield and chech 2004 found that green sturgeon exhibited high metabolic rates relative to other sturgeon species thus we speculate that green sturgeon and white sturgeon might have different energy allocation strategies and these two species might have different optimal physiological performance temperatures our parameter estimation results also indicated that the q10 value of green sturgeon 4 13 is higher than q10 value reported to most biological systems i e q10 2 3 which makes green sturgeon sensitive for temperature changes 4 3 limitations and directions for future improvements the ultimate goal of this study was to provide a mechanistic modelling framework that can support the management and conservation of the endangered sdps of green sturgeon to this end we demonstrated the applicability of the model based on two case studies presented despite this promising outcome the practical implementation of the model as management tool requires more work one limitation of the model is that it does not account for indirect effects of temperature on food availability or predation goto et al 2015 incorporated a sized based predation component acting on juvenile shovelnose sturgeon scaphirhynchus platorynchus to a model evaluating recruitment dynamics of a target population as juvenile salmon survival during their outmigration is strongly influenced by predation within this same migration corridor johnson et al 2017 it is likely that size based predation and the influence of temperature on growth rate would produce survival biomass abundance metrics that also vary by spawning location or time it is also possible juvenile green sturgeon can encounter additional natural and anthropogenic stressors like environmental contaminants further research to investigate the combined effects of potential environmental stressors will improve the applicability of the model and help to develop a reliable analytical tool research on the effects of temperature on the survival of green sturgeon eggs larvae and juveniles will help to more clearly show the effects of the current water management practice on the population dynamics the other limitation worth to mention here is lack of feedback between feeding and food availability in the model in laboratory we can easily quantify the relationship between feeding rate and food availability and also the effect of temperature on the maximum feeding rate however it is difficult to quantify this relationship for the field population hence food availability is a function of different factors including the effect of temperature on the searching foraging abilities of green sturgeon presumably in rivers sturgeon have to work much harder to find food than in the experiments the assumed downstream migration behavior of juvenile green sturgeon is an additional element of the model that needs further research currently little is known about factors affecting downstream migration of green sturgeon in the sacramento river we estimated the typical downstream migration behavior of a juvenile green sturgeon based on published laboratory experiments kynard et al 2005 and our movement sub model uses a simplistic assumption about age size dependent movement generally our movement behavior sub model is tied explicitly to body size as individuals do not embark upon a downstream migration until they have reached 200 mm conversely results of juvenile green sturgeon out migrant studies suggest that their downstream migration is concurrent with high flow events poytress personal communication in reality this environmental cue might apply to all individuals regardless of age or size thus incorporating flow based migration cues into our model would likely amplify the seasonal and spatial differences in size and growth rates resulting in even larger differences between seasonal or spatial differences in spawning hatching emergence locations and dates acknowledgments the authors want to thank dr peter dudley for feedback on earlier drafts of the

25113,semi arid tropical rangelands substantially contribute to livelihoods of subsistence farmers but are threatened by undesired vegetation shifts due to climate change and overgrazing grazing induced shifts of the grass community composition are often associated with rangeland degradation to identify sustainable management strategies a process based understanding of grass functional diversity and rangeland dynamics is required we present a new scheme for adgvm2 a dynamic vegetation model for tropical ecosystems that distinguishes annual and perennial grasses based on trait trade offs to improve the representation of rangeland communities additionally the model includes a new scheme that describes selective grazing and grazing effects on grass layer composition we tested the new model version for various grazing intensities along a precipitation gradient in south africa mean annual precipitation below 500 mm constrained rangeland productivity and carrying capacity increasing grazing intensity reduced rangeland productivity and increased annual grass abundance heavy grazing resulted in annual grass dominance livestock preferred perennial over annual grasses at low grazing intensities at all except the two driest sites preference switched to annual grasses at intermediate intensities and became non discriminating at high grazing intensities rangeland recovery after removal of grazers required 2 15 years we conclude that management intervention reducing or eliminating grazing pressure during and after stress years is crucial to allow rangeland

of semi arid grasslands aside from water availability and fire walker 1987 however intensive grazing combined with climate change may negatively affect ecosystem services provided by rangelands and thereby threaten livelihoods of subsistence farmers adeel et al 2005 guuroh et al 2018 intensive grazing can trigger vegetation changes that may promote as well as deter further grazing hempson et al 2014 because grazing selectively removes biomass based on its palatability this modifies the species composition of herbaceous communities changes distribution and frequency of traits and alters the prevalence of functional types díaz et al 2007 linstädter et al 2014 moreno garcia et al 2014 for example shifts in perennial to annual grass ratio can result from over grazing alone but may be aggravated by additional global change agents such as drought o connor and roux 1995 o connor 1995 reynolds et al 2007 ruppert et al 2015 with substantial negative consequences for dry season feed availability rangeland carrying capacity and local livelihoods martin et al 2016 in particular the loss of perennial species affects productivity quality and duration of forage availability and can lead to desertification where transition to bare ground conditions is involved schlesinger et al 1990 ruppert et al 2015 guuroh et al 2018 whether over grazed rangelands can recover from the associated adverse effects is a highly relevant question for rangeland managers coping with rangeland rehabilitation resting may in some cases allow recovery of forage quantities but not necessarily of forage quality and palatability seymour et al 2010 whereas severely degraded rangelands may not even recover after several decades of resting o connor 1991 müller et al 2007 it is challenging to predict the responses of rangelands to changing grazing regimes due to the complex interactions between grazers vegetation and climate a process based system understanding is needed to develop sustainable land use strategies for rangelands in particular under altered future climate conditions müller et al 2015 although field studies from semi arid tropical rangelands reveal differential effects of grazing on plant communities kohyani et al 2008 linstädter et al 2014 the results of local studies depend on site specific environmental conditions and a site s evolutionary and land use history contradictory observations make it difficult to extrapolate grazing impacts on vegetation from site scale to larger scales in this context models are useful tools they are simplified representations of reality that allow to conduct simulation experiments on interactions between grazing climate change and fire and to test a wide range of alternative management options on large spatio temporal scales dynamic global vegetation models dgvms can simulate how vegetation interacts with environmental forcing factors e g climate co2 and disturbances dgvms help to assess effects of environmental change on vegetation patterns and biogeochemical cycles cramer et al 2001 chang et al 2017 to support large scale spatio temporal applicability many dgvms use a restricted number of plant functional types pfts lavorel et al 2007 this approach successfully captures responses of biogeochemical cycles and broad vegetation patterns cramer et al 2001 however while pft based dgvms distinguish approximately 5 8 woody pfts e g hickler et al 2012 they only differentiate between c3 and c4 grass types c3 and c4 grasses in many dgvms are largely spatially exclusive due to bioclimatic constraints that limit their spatial occurrence e g minimum coldest month survival temperature of c4 grasses and maximum coldest month temperature for establishment of c3 grasses at 15 5 c in lpj and lpj guess sitch et al 2003 smith et al 2001 hence pft based dgvms de facto represent grasses by one single pft at the local scale although in reality both grass types do co occur sage et al 1999 lattanzi 2010 while coarse scale shifts in the competitive balance of woody and herbaceous plant types can be captured based on such a simple grass representation higgins and scheiter 2012 within grass community dynamics remains invisible in rangelands where grasses predominate and provide the main forage source for grazers such a representation is highly inadequate in order to study functioning and biodiversity to assess rangeland sensitivity to grazing to test management scenarios and to deduce sustainable management and conservation strategies a more refined representation of grasses in dgvms is necessary linstädter et al 2014 bond 2016 we argue that dgvms should at least distinguish annual and perennial grasses to reflect the principal dichotomy between two very different life history strategies in semi arid rangelands smith and mcallister 2008 while smaller scale rangeland models have included distinctions between annual and perennial grasses in combination with selective grazing for more than a decade e g liedloff et al 2001 lohmann et al 2012 dgvms so far widely ignore within grass layer diversity dgvms that are capable to distinguish functional differences between annual and perennial grasses will allow a more realistic representation of spatio temporal patterns of forage provision in semi arid tropical rangelands leaf and growth traits of annual and perennial grasses affect their respective sensitivity to grazing as well as productivity seasonal availability and forage quality i e palatability and thereby grazing selectivity e g pontes et al 2007 however not only do grass traits influence grazer choices but grazers selectivity in return also exerts selection pressure on grasses augustine and mcnaughton 1998 grazing selectivity therefore is an important driver of perennial annual grass abundance nonetheless only a few dgvms include grazing routines e g chang et al 2013 pachzelt et al 2015 scheiter and savadogo 2016 rolinski et al 2018 and none of them a representation of grazing selectivity or differentiation of trait diversity within the grass layer using adgvm2 a dgvm for tropical ecosystems scheiter et al 2013 langan et al 2017 we developed a new grass scheme to model annual and perennial grasses and a grazing routine that simulates selective grazing the latter is indispensable for modeling grazing impacts on annual perennial community dynamics as grazing can shift the balance of annual and perennial grasses and lead to decrease in perennial grass abundance e g dyksterhuis 1949 olsvik whittaker et al 1993 tessema et al 2011 we use the updated version of adgvm2 to test the sensitivity of semi arid rangelands to varying grazing intensities for five sites located along a precipitation gradient in south africa we ask the following questions 1 is annual precipitation a determinant of rangeland productivity and does the maximum density of livestock supported by semi arid rangeland ecosystems increase with increasing mean annual precipitation 2 does increasing grazing intensity lead to shifts in the community composition of rangelands due to selective grazing 3 can continuous intense grazing without intermittent resting periods prevent recovery and can it keep rangeland communities in a state of low productivity and forage quality 4 is recovery of rangeland communities from intense grazing mediated by mean annual precipitation i e does mean annual precipitation map influence post disturbance regrowth based on our results we discuss implications for sustainable grazing management of semi arid rangeland ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 model description the adgvm2 simulates growth of individual plants on a representative stand of 1 ha and tracks their state variables each plant individual is characterized by a set of traits describing plant type grass or tree perennial or annual leaf characteristics specific leaf area photosynthetic pathway carbon allocation to plant compartments plant architecture roots and crown shape response to fire reproduction and mortality growth reproduction and mortality of plants are the combined result of trait characteristics and environmental conditions plant performance is regulated by trait trade offs mass conservation for allocation stability trade offs for architecture leaf economic spectrum and resource competition between individuals see scheiter et al 2013 langan et al 2017 and references therein trait inheritance and alteration during reproduction affect community assembly and allow dynamic adaptation to environmental conditions for more details see the adgvm2 model description in scheiter et al 2013 and langan et al 2017 in adgvm2 the simulated representative 1ha vegetation stand is subdivided into equal sized sub cells thereafter denoted as patch containing maximum one type of individual at a given time thereby limiting the maximum number of individuals simulated for each stand the prescribed sub grid structure also allows to track neighborhood relationships between individuals e g to determine competition for light and space patches can be occupied bare become bare and be re colonized by a new individual with potentially different traits following mortality of the original individual in sensitivity tests conducted prior to this study with individual numbers ranging between 25 25 and 60 60 individuals 40 40 individuals had proven sufficiently numerous to represent the full range of trait diversity while keeping computational effort reasonable as single grass individuals in the model are constrained to a maximum cover of 1 m2 their respective mass or area based state variables are multiplied by patch area size to obtain a patch s value this implies trait homogeneity within a patch fig 1 illustrates carbon balance and biomass pools of an individual grass patch here we present a novel scheme for adgvm2 that distinguishes between annual and perennial grass types and a grazing scheme that allows to simulate selective grazing based on status and traits of individual grass patches due to the trait and individual based representation of plants in adgvm2 we are in a unique position that allows us to implement a distinction of grass functional types based on trait trade offs to our knowledge this is the first time such a detailed representation of grass traits and selective grazing has been implemented in a dgvm and it addresses the issue that the relevance of grasses is often neglected in classical pft based dgvms that often focus mainly on diversity and dynamics of woody vegetation 2 2 implementation of annual and perennial grasses we conceptualized annual and perennial grasses by assigning different trait ranges for carbon allocation specific leaf area sla m2 kg 1 and seed size vs seed number based on empirically observed trade off costs between allocation to reproductive vs vegetative structures friedman and ruin 2015 for a conceptual overview see table 1 annual grasses feature rapid production of photosynthetic leaf biomass and quick reproduction as they need to complete their life cycle within one growing season higher allocation to reproductive structures at the expense of investment to vegetative structures in annuals has been described by various authors e g hancock and pritts 1987 vico et al 2016 although such trade offs can be masked by variability in resource availability and fitness of individuals van noordwijk and de jong 1986 selection for rapid gain of leaf area at the beginning of the growing season in annuals is accomplished at the cost of leaf thickness entailing higher sla values garnier 1992 poorter et al 2009 lower capacity to extract soil water and lower leaf longevity langan et al 2017 and references therein allocation trait ranges for annual and perennial grasses in this version of adgvm2 are listed in table 2 trait parameters of plant individuals are randomly assigned during initialization from a functional type s respective allowed trait range are inherited by offspring and are subject to mutation and crossover during reproduction scheiter et al 2013 allocation parameters are scaled such that their sum equals 1 perennial plants switch between a dormant respiratory and a metabolic assimilatory state once light or water availability exceed or fall below plant specific phenology thresholds these threshold values determine the onset and end of leaf growth of perennials in the growing season seed germination of all grasses is also tied to leaf phenology i e crossing the leaf phenology thresholds also triggers seed germination and initiates seedling growth at growing season start to operationalize differences in recruitment annuals in the model have a higher germination likelihood than perennials this assumption is required because the number of individuals modeled on a simulated vegetation stand is limited and new individuals can only establish on non occupied patches as only one randomly chosen seed per empty spot is allowed to germinate at a time the germination likelihood serves to reflect differences in seed density and ensures that annuals can persist in the population perennials experience gradual biomass die back during drought or low light conditions while annuals die at the end of the growing season when water or light availability drop below an individual s phenology thresholds annual and perennial grasses in their assimilatory state experience leaf turnover with leaf longevity being inversely related to sla langan et al 2017 mortality of perennial grasses may be related to age background mortality grazing stress see section 2 3 or negative annual carbon balance a negative c balance can be caused by insufficient c gain e g due to water stress competition self shading or too high c loss due to respiration turnover fire or grazing see e g zimmermann et al 2010 2 3 grazing model previous versions of adgvm2 did not include grazing routines scheiter et al 2013 langan et al 2017 in this updated version of adgvm2 we simulate selective grazing by linking grass removal to state variables and trait values of individual grass patches to our knowledge this is the first time such an approach has been implemented in a dgvm a schematic overview of the grazing scheme is provided in fig 2 daily biomass demand b g kg day 1 is defined by requirement per livestock unit lu multiplied by animal number n a animals ha 1 day 1 see table 3 for overview of state variables grazers remove leaves and stalks reproductive biomass and standing senescent and moribund grass material compare fig 1 to account for the lower nutritional value of dead biomass we assign it 2 3 of the nutritional value of living plant material estimate based on fig 4 in bell 2006 in this study we treat grazing as an external forcing controlled by the number of lu per day and hectare n a and the visitation frequency f a fraction of days per year during which grazers are present we refrain from simulating grazer population dynamics and focus on managed land where stocking rates are controlled by land owners as we are interested in how varying grazing pressure affects grass communities and not how biomass supply feeds back on the livestock population negative balance between demand and supply is tracked but its implications for grazers are ignored for the purpose of this study implicitly assuming that grazers move through the landscape to compensate for their deficit elsewhere or that farmers will provide supplementary feed if required müller et al 2015 when b g exceeds stand level biomass aboveground grass biomass b net is removed down to stubble irrespective of grass type retaining 0 01 kg leaf stalk biomass and reproductive biomass per plant respectively i e all grass patches are grazed irrespective of selection probability belowground plant biomass is indirectly affected by grazing via carbon balance effects roots may experience die back after leaf loss because low carbon assimilation leads to reduced carbon allocation to roots causing root maintenance respiration to exceed c allocation if supply b net exceeds b g biomass is selectively removed from grass patches until b g is satisfied in an iterative cycle grass patches are randomly targeted for grazing and if the drawing of a second random number for a targeted grass patch is less than that patch s selection probability p sel grass biomass is removed from that patch the selection probability p sel determines i the likelihood of a specific grass patch to be grazed and ii the fraction of grass biomass removed from a grazed patch p sel is based on leaf biomass fraction of living to dead leaf material and sla as a palatability proxy kelvin et al 2010 as these are state variables and traits readily available in adgvm2 using the range of available biomass and sla of all grass patches on a representative stand we calculate three separate selection probability values for each grass patch and combine the biomass derived w bm sla derived w sla and dead to living ratio derived w dead probability value to the overall selection probability p sel to determine the three probability values for each probability a linear equation is fit between the two individuals with the highest and lowest respective value biomass sla dead to living ratio in the population assigning a weight of 1 to the individual with the highest and a weight of 0 to the individual with the lowest value grass individuals with less than the minimum biomass required for grazing are ignored selection probability of 0 each grass individual s respective probabilities are then determined using the derived linear equations for biomass sla and dead to living ratio p sel is calculated as the mean of w bm w sla and w dead and describes the overall likelihood that an individual grass patch is grazed this likelihood is high if patch biomass and palatability are high large proportions of dead biomass decrease p sel as dead biomass conceals living biomass in tufts avoidance of tufts with greater amounts of moribund material has been observed in field studies e g o connor 1992 the amount of biomass cropped from a patch is based on its aboveground biomass and p sel in average removing larger relative amounts of biomass from patches with larger p sel biomass removal b removed in kg is calculated as a function of an individual s available biomass b avail in kg and its selection probability p sel 1 b removed b avail p sel b avail b avail p sel p c with p c as a random number between 0 and 0 1 adding bite imprecision to the removal based on p sel biomass is removed in equal proportions from living leaf biomass dead leaf biomass and reproductive biomass but limited to the respective maximum available amount we set a minimum removal per biomass pool minimum bite size of 0 01 kg as long as the respective pool has sufficient biomass in order to avoid removal of very small quantities and associated large numbers of iteration cycles to cover daily demand in principle a grass patch can be grazed several times during 1 day however as a grazed patch s p sel is updated based on its new lower biomass the likelihood to be re selected on the same day decreases both annual and perennial grass patches partially replace lost leaf biomass on a daily basis by reallocating carbon from storage compartments growth compensation see e g mcnaughton 1983 ferraro and oesterheld 2002 the amount of carbon reallocated from storage to leaves b realloc in kg is determined by the fractional loss of original leaf biomass f loss and the individual grass patch s trait value defining the maximum allowed transfer fraction from storage b stor in kg to leaves a s2l 2 b realloc f loss b stor a s 2 l with fraction a s2l being a life history trait grazing may increase plant mortality through negative annual c balance as post grazing recovery can be boosted via reallocation from storage to new leaf tissue plant mortality is also influenced by the size of the storage compartment the allocation to storage trait a s and the storage to leaf reallocation trait a s2l table 2 we additionally calculate a grazing stress factor between 0 and 1 that defines the likelihood of plant death from grazing stress this stress factor depends on how many times an individual patch was grazed within one year and the fraction of annual anpp aboveground net primary productivity in kg that got consumed this approach accounts for empirical evidence that recovery duration has a major impact with longer time for recovery from defoliation and more time between defoliation events significantly decreasing negative effects ferraro and oesterheld 2002 short recovery intervals may be more detrimental than a singular high intensity grazing event as infrequent high intensity grazing has been reported to disrupt the carbohydrate metabolism of perennial plants less severely menke 1992 in adgvm2 grazing related mortality probability depends on the number of days a specific grass patch had to endure grazing and on how severely it got impacted measured by the fraction of anpp that got consumed over the course of a year each perennial patch s annual grazing mortality probability m g is calculated as 3 m g i a c f 2 where i a is a factor related to the number of days per year d g a specific individual was grazed and the consumed fraction c f is the fraction of annual anpp eaten by grazers 4 i a 0 9 364 d g 35 5 364 this equation assumes that for a c f of 1 worst case scenario the mortality risk based on the number of grazing days equals 10 after one grazing event and linearly increases to 100 if vegetation is grazed daily c f is the fraction of annual npp allocated to leaves and reproduction that got consumed by grazers 5 c f 1 a l a re c c npp here npp in kg is annual net productivity aboveground and belowground c c in kg year 1 is the amount of biomass consumed from one individual patch over the course of the year a l is the fraction of npp allocated to leaves and a rep is the fraction of npp allocated to reproduction 2 4 simulation experiments we conducted control simulations without grazing for five study sites along a precipitation gradient in south africa s semi arid rangelands table 4 fig 3 a the sites were chosen to connect to past and ongoing field research performed at these locations where available we compare our simulated results with site specific data from rangeland experiments or ground data from semi arid rangelands with comparable environmental conditions for more details on site specific details and references to field research conducted at the sites see table 4 to ensure that model state variables and trait assemblies stabilize we let the model equilibrate to ambient environmental forcing for 500 years spin up then simulated another 200 years without grazing using iterated monthly data from the cru reference climatology for the period 1961 1990 new et al 2002 we generated daily rainfall sequences from the climatology by using the algorithm provided by new et al 2002 test simulations showed that approx 400 500 simulation years are sufficient to reach dynamic equilibrium of model state variables per site we conducted 10 replicate simulation runs with different initializations of the plant community to account for stochastic effects in precipitation and community assembly each replicate run was initialized with its respective unique and reproducible random seed i e variability between replicate runs was ultimately caused by the differing random seed for the grazing experiments we simulated 100 years of continuous grazing after the spin up phase followed by another 100 years without grazing to allow recovery per site we conducted simulations with 10 different grazing intensities biomass demand b g of 5 10 15 50 kg ha 1 day 1 at a default grazing frequency of 0 2 i e animals are present for approx 20 of the days per year note that unique random seeds for replicate runs between different treatment scenarios were the same e g run no 1 was always initialized with the same random seed in all scenarios therefore differences between scenarios with the same unique random seed are solely due to differences in treatment as we were specifically interested in our novel distinction between annual and perennial grasses and how the relative abundances of these herbaceous pfts were modulated by climate and selective grazing we deliberately excluded fire and woody vegetation although they are part of adgvm2 langan et al 2017 this simplification is justified because tree cover at the study sites is low and large areas of these rangelands are grass dominated this experimental design allows us to focus on the grass layer and the interactions between different grass types grazing and environmental drivers and avoids the common focus on woody vegetation types in dgvms 3 results 3 1 ungrazed communities simulated living grass biomass was subject to large intra and interannual variability fig 3b illustrates the simulated range of annual peak leaf biomass for the control scenarios peak leaf biomass on average reached 2 2 5 t ha 1 at the two driest sites s1 and s2 and 3 3 5 t ha 1 at the wetter sites s3 to s5 sites s1 and s2 displayed higher interannual variability than the wetter sites annual stand level anpp fig 3d varied between ca 4 5 t ha 1 at the two driest sites and ca 6 7 t ha 1 at the wetter sites at the two driest sites anpp showed high interannual variability without grazing perennial grasses dominated the sward at the three wetter sites fig 3c the two dry sites had lower median values of perennial grass abundance 30 and 58 respectively and high temporal variability in the ratio between perennial and annual grasses annual precipitation was a weak predictor of annual anpp tests for correlation and cross correlation between anpp and precipitation revealed low correlation factors see also scatterplots in supplementary fig s1 however productivity tended to be correlated to productivity of preceding years for details on autocorrelation of anpp see supplementary fig s2 this dependency was stronger at the more productive sites due to lower interannual fluctuations in productivity our results from the baseline control simulations therefore only partially confirm the first part of our first key question map below 500 mm constrained simulated peak leaf biomass and anpp while above 500 mm precipitation became less relevant as a limiting factor as further precipitation increase did not reflect in peak leaf biomass and only to some degree in anpp fig 3 variability in peak leaf biomass and annual anpp was markedly higher for the two dry sites s1 and s2 than for the three wetter sites although variability in annual precipitation was comparable for all sites this higher variability of anpp is due to the large interannual variability in perennial fraction at s1 and s2 caused by drought induced die back of perennials i e years with low perennial abundance are also marked by low peak leaf biomass and productivity at sites s3 s5 annual precipitation is sufficient to sustain a stable population of perennials in most years resulting in less variability of peak leaf biomass and anpp 3 2 effect of grazing on productivity and community composition increasing grazing intensity reduced anpp fig 4 a with the amount of anpp for a given grazing intensity depending on the initial productivity of the site the wettest site s5 displayed the highest average annual productivity when undisturbed and at low to intermediate grazing intensities reduction in productivity was approximately linear in absolute fig 4a as well as relative fig 4b terms the approximately linear decrease in productivity with increasing grazing intensity became nonlinear i e productivity started to drop more steeply once demand started to exhaust supply increasing biomass demand could be sustained until annual aboveground productivity became insufficient to fully compensate removal fig 5 sites s4 and s5 had the highest carrying capacities site s5 sustained a continuous long term demand of 25 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 while at site s4 a grazing intensity between 15 and 20 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 could be sustained in most years long term carrying capacity tended to increase with map with lowest carrying capacity at the two driest sites with respect to the second part of our first key question we can say that average carrying capacity of rangelands increases with map the proportion of annual grasses in the population increased with grazing pressure fig 6 without grazing the average percentage of annual grasses varied between 20 and 40 with more annuals at drier sites as long as demand could be satisfied increase of annual grasses with intensity was moderate but increased steeply at the expense of perennial grass abundance once the site productivity became insufficient to cover grazing demand compare fig 5 and 6 without grazing annual grasses contributed less than 10 to anpp at all study sites due to low abundance and their short life span with increasing grazing pressure plot level anpp declined fig 4 perennials became less abundant fig 6 and productivity was increasingly provided by annual grasses with as much as 70 80 contribution at the maximum grazing intensity simulated in this study regarding our second key question our results confirm that grazing as a selective process may affect community composition and thereby alter rangeland productivity and quality as described in section 2 an individual grass patch s likelihood to be grazed is influenced by its sla its aboveground living biomass and its ratio of living and dead biomass annual grasses typically reached lower peak leaf biomass than perennials due to their ephemerality and the thinner leaves resulting from their higher sla a selection mechanism that enables them to quickly increase leaf area at low biomass investment hence at low grazing intensities grazers mostly grazed perennial grasses as their higher biomass outweighed their lower sla fig 7 illustrates how the average likelihood of being grazed for both annuals and perennials varied between sites and grazing intensities avoidance vs preference of annuals in fig 7 was determined by relating the fraction of grazings per year on annuals to their fraction within the grass population i e a value of 1 indicates that annuals were grazed as often as can be expected based on their occurrence in the population whereas a value greater less than 1 indicates that annuals were grazed more less frequently than can be expected based on their occurrence a value of 2 indicates that annuals were grazed two times more frequently than can be expected based on their occurrence the amount of biomass withdrawn from perennials vs annuals also changes with grazing intensity see fig s3 with annuals becoming the dominant biomass source at high grazing intensities at the lowest grazing intensity 5 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 preference of perennial over annual grass patches was common except for the two driest sites s1 and s2 this effect was particularly pronounced for sites s4 and s5 the sites that had high peak leaf biomass and anpp as well as low annual abundance in the control scenario however the drier less productive sites s1 and s2 were characterized by animals preferentially grazing annual grasses or no discrimination against annuals or perennials as grazing intensity increased preference at sites s3 s5 switched from perennials to annuals however when grazing intensity approached carrying capacity discrimination gradually decreased at high intensities annuals and perennials were grazed without discrimination discrimination tended to be highest at the more productive wetter sites at low to intermediate grazing intensities at more arid less productive sites discrimination was less pronounced discrimination decreased as resources became increasingly scarce because at high grazing intensity all available individuals on a representative stand had to be grazed to at least partially meet demand 3 3 supply transgression and post grazing recovery the biomass demand that ultimately exceeded supply differed between sites fig 4 and replicate runs for one site fig 8 a combination of temporal variability of productivity variability of annual rainfall and dynamic balance between increasing grazing intensity and concurrent decrease in productivity influenced if and after how many years supply started to exceed demand for example at site s4 a demand of 15 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 could be covered over the entire 100 year period in all ten replicate runs but a demand of 20 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 was only met in nine replicate runs during one run demand exceeded productivity after approx 40 years of continuous grazing for a demand of 25 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 only 30 of replicate runs maintained sufficient productivity to continuously cover demand for 100 years a grazing intensity of 30 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 exhausted carrying capacity after a maximum of 20 years in all replicate runs qualitatively the tipping point with respect to grazing intensity at site s4 is therefore reached approximately at a demand of 25 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 as variability between replicate runs is largest for this level of demand once carrying capacity had been exceeded pre collapse productivity was never recovered while grazing persisted in accordance with our third key question our results indicate that continuous intensive grazing may prevent recovery and keep rangelands in a less productive state however productivity and community composition recovered after grazing stopped recovery duration depended on preceding grazing intensity and potential site productivity with respect to our fourth key question we identified an indirect relation between map and recovery time with the more productive sites taking longer to recover their full productivity potential which is due to the higher biomass and anpp that needs to be regained at the wetter sites in our simulations 5 10 years were usually sufficient to regain 90 of the productivity level of the ungrazed control fig 9 for any grazing intensity at the two dry sites and for grazing intensities of less than 20 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 at the wetter sites the average population ratio between annual and perennial grasses and stand level peak leaf biomass also recovered to the level of the ungrazed control scenario following the temporal pattern of productivity recovery figure not shown 4 discussion while rangeland ecologists often use sophisticated classification schemes to characterize grass species palatability and responses to grazing dyksterhuis 1949 van oudtshoorn 1999 these classification approaches are not easily transferable to rangelands with a different community composition and or climatic setting linstädter et al 2014 and are thus not feasible for dgvms we present a novel scheme for adgvm2 that conceptualizes distinctive traits and resulting differences in life history strategies of perennial and annual grasses we focus on the community assembly of the grass layer and its dynamics because grazing not only affects the competitive balance between woody and herbaceous vegetation but also alters composition productivity and palatability of the grass layer as a selective process grazing feeds back on forage quality and carrying capacity and causes vegetation changes that can promote or deter further grazing hempson et al 2014 we are aware that we are not considering the full range of criteria defining palatability sla is a simplified surrogate for palatability and not all herbivore species base their dietary selection equally on sla moreover sla palatability relationships may vary considerably across african grasslands ferner et al 2015 however additional palatability related factors such as leaf tensile strength leaf nitrogen content overall nutritional value concentration of defensive leaf phenolics and structural compounds or toxicity currently cannot be deduced from plant traits simulated by adgvm2 nonetheless based on the definition of a few generalized selection criteria we are able to model effects of grazing selectivity that are in agreement with empirical observations such as the shift to higher annual grass abundance at expense of perennial grasses our simulated peak leaf biomass of 2 3 5 t ha 1 in ungrazed rangeland communities is within the typical range reported for semi arid african rangelands dwyer 2011 moustakas et al 2013 oomen et al 2016 anpp values reported for semi arid tropical rangelands are less certain and vary over a wide range depending on location site specific conditions and method used to estimate anpp scurlock et al 2002 knapp et al 2006 report an average of 4 24 1 02 t ha 1 for the grassland trials at ukulinga research farm in kwazulu natal south africa while anpp values between 3 31 and 8 85 t ha 1 with a mean of 6 09 6 53 t ha 1 have been reported for rangeland near nairobi scurlock et al 2002 for neotropical rangelands ospina et al 2012 measured anpp values between 8 98 and 15 6 t ha 1 average anpp estimates from the droughtact grazing experiments performed between 2015 and 2017 at syferkuil experimental farm near university of limpopo in south africa s limpopo province range between 0 8 and 1 62 t ha 1 for perennial grasses in grazing exclusion plots minimum 0 21 0 47 t ha 1 maximum 0 123 2 87 t ha 1 e mudongo j c ruppert and a linstädter unpublished data simulated anpp values are therefore within the range reported for semi arid rangelands but higher than the values estimated in the droughtact grazing experiments yet these experiments include exceptionally dry years experienced in southern africa due to the 2015 2016 el niño one of the strongest of the last 145 years winkler et al 2017 simulated peak leaf biomass and anpp varied between sites with lower values and a wide range of interannual variability at the two driest sites where perennial grasses reach the limit of their ecological niche while wetter years still provide sufficient precipitation to sustain perennial grass cover at these sites dry years cause substantial die back of perennial grasses lowering peak leaf biomass and shifting community composition towards more ephemeral annual grasses intensive grazing as well as low map reduced productivity and promoted annuals this finding agrees with grazing induced changes observed in semi arid tropical rangeland systems walker et al 1981 linstädter et al 2014 replacement of perennials by annuals has been interpreted as a shift in the competitive balance in favor of short lived disturbance adapted annuals dyksterhuis 1949 after weak disturbance persisting perennial grasses quickly expand cover at the beginning of the subsequent growing season more intense disturbances increase mortality of perennials in adgvm2 leading to more open space in the simulated vegetation stand that becomes available for new plant seedlings as annuals need to establish each year they benefit from a high overall mortality and open space created by perennial turnover shifts towards annual dominance decreased biomass supply for grazers as annuals provided less biomass and productivity per grass patch than perennials this agrees with studies reporting lower leaf area and biomass produced per unit rain for annuals than perennials nicholson et al 1990 beck et al 1990 there are several possible reasons that could explain this pattern first annuals germinate build up biomass reproduce and die within one growing season in comparison perennials gradually die back during the dry season but storage reserves help to quickly rebuild biomass in the next growing season second after germination simulated perennials often required several growing seasons to reach maximum values of peak leaf biomass time that annuals intrinsically lack third simulated annual grasses had thinner leaves and higher sla enabling them to quickly gain leaf area after establishment but resulting in overall less leaf biomass this deficit is additionally amplified by proportionally higher carbon allocation to reproduction continental scale applications of grazing models e g pachzelt et al 2015 identified net primary productivity and dry season length as good predictors of grazer density however by ignoring grazing induced community shifts these models may overestimate productivity under high grazing intensity heavily grazed communities were more akin to those of drier sites i e intensive grazing and drought had similar effects on simulated grass communities these results agree with the convergence model of aridity and grazing postulated for grass dominated ecosystems and supported empirically e g by quiroga et al 2010 linstädter et al 2014 and gaitán et al 2018 simulated overgrazing effects carried over to subsequent years and sites did not recover without resting fig 8 this supports recommendations e g müller et al 2015 to adjust grazing management during post drought years to avoid permanent productivity loss and undesired community shifts grazers preference for young tender leaves can prevent regrowth and promote less palatable and or less productive plants o connor 1995 after grazing suppression our sites recovered productivity within 5 15 years fig 9 this agrees with observations from field studies e g o connor 1995 reports more rapid recovery for sites with a low intensity grazing history in the worst cases vegetation has been observed to remain in a degraded state for at least 20 years after exclusion of large herbivores walker et al 1981 persistent heavy grazing may also delay recovery by depleting local seed banks o connor 1991 1992 sternberg et al 2003 moreover recovery of perennial grasses in arid and semi arid rangelands may also depend on the occurrence of a window of opportunity of regeneration such as several years with high rainfall see linstädter et al 2014 and references therein recovery may also be impeded if overgrazing causes soil loss due to increased erosion altered balance of soil nutrient cycles or altered soil water availability due to increased run off we may therefore overestimate rangeland recovery potential due to the simplified nature of our experimental design and soil degradation mechanisms currently not represented in the model in addition competitive interactions between grasses woody vegetation grazing and fire may cause permanent shifts in vegetation structure a set of interactions that we acknowledge but that lies beyond the intended scope of this study our results have implications for sustainable management of semi arid rangelands grazing can reduce drought resistance of rangelands and amplify drought effects in particular negatively affecting perennial grasses vetter 2009 ruppert et al 2015 management should aim to avoid the loss of perennials from populations and seed banks due to drought stress and or overgrazing danckwerts and stuart hill 1988 as perennials provide feed more reliably than the ephemeral annuals downsizing of herds and or provisioning of supplementary fodder should include post stress years when recovery of reserve and green biomass is stimulated providing time to regain levels sufficient to buffer precipitation deficits and grazing losses danckwerts and stuart hill 1988 müller et al 2007 as we could demonstrate once productivity has collapsed it often remains depressed without sufficient resting compare e g danckwerts and stuart hill 1988 contrary to the needs of subsistence farmers who usually aim for maximum stocking density rather than maximum sustainable yield resting promotes improvement of rangeland conditions and allows higher total stocking rates within a certain period of time müller et al 2007 5 conclusions we developed a grass scheme for adgvm2 that allows us to functionally differentiate annuals and perennials this enables us to model within grass layer dynamics and grazing effects on grass community composition our results corroborate empirical evidence that climate and grazing interactively alter community composition of semi arid grass communities linstädter et al 2014 we find that drought and intensive grazing have similar effects on perennial annual ratios in semi arid grass dominated ecosystems as both shift community composition towards higher abundance of annuals concomitant declines in productivity reduce grazing carrying capacity and entail lower carbon storage therefore dgmvs omitting within grass layer dynamics may misjudge the carbon balance of semi arid rangelands grazing impacts and rangeland carrying capacity under future conditions our results also corroborate the need for flexible informed management of semi arid african rangelands found by previous studies to prevent overgrazing from locking grass communities in undesired low productivity states modeling grasses as individuals with dynamic traits and defining characteristic trait based functional differences between annuals and perennials is a promising step towards a long needed improvement of grass representation in dgvms further refinement of grass representation in adgvm2 could include additional grass related traits e g distinction between increaser and decreaser types or the capability for non sexual reproduction and spread via stolons moreover we are confident that the new grass layer dynamics and grazing scheme presented in this study are a necessary basis that will allow evaluation of more complex

25113,semi arid tropical rangelands substantially contribute to livelihoods of subsistence farmers but are threatened by undesired vegetation shifts due to climate change and overgrazing grazing induced shifts of the grass community composition are often associated with rangeland degradation to identify sustainable management strategies a process based understanding of grass functional diversity and rangeland dynamics is required we present a new scheme for adgvm2 a dynamic vegetation model for tropical ecosystems that distinguishes annual and perennial grasses based on trait trade offs to improve the representation of rangeland communities additionally the model includes a new scheme that describes selective grazing and grazing effects on grass layer composition we tested the new model version for various grazing intensities along a precipitation gradient in south africa mean annual precipitation below 500 mm constrained rangeland productivity and carrying capacity increasing grazing intensity reduced rangeland productivity and increased annual grass abundance heavy grazing resulted in annual grass dominance livestock preferred perennial over annual grasses at low grazing intensities at all except the two driest sites preference switched to annual grasses at intermediate intensities and became non discriminating at high grazing intensities rangeland recovery after removal of grazers required 2 15 years we conclude that management intervention reducing or eliminating grazing pressure during and after stress years is crucial to allow rangeland recovery and avoid permanent degradation keywords adgvm2 grazing model perennial grasses annual grasses semi arid rangelands overgrazing 1 introduction grazing is an important ecosystem process with respect to the area affected globally and the amount of plant biomass converted into animal biomass huntly 1991 rangeland grazing also provides a substantial contribution to the livelihoods of people who depend on subsistence farming herrero and thornton 2013 in semi arid rangelands grazers and grasses share a co evolutionary history and grazing has been identified as one of the key determinants of semi arid grasslands aside from water availability and fire walker 1987 however intensive grazing combined with climate change may negatively affect ecosystem services provided by rangelands and thereby threaten livelihoods of subsistence farmers adeel et al 2005 guuroh et al 2018 intensive grazing can trigger vegetation changes that may promote as well as deter further grazing hempson et al 2014 because grazing selectively removes biomass based on its palatability this modifies the species composition of herbaceous communities changes distribution and frequency of traits and alters the prevalence of functional types díaz et al 2007 linstädter et al 2014 moreno garcia et al 2014 for example shifts in perennial to annual grass ratio can result from over grazing alone but may be aggravated by additional global change agents such as drought o connor and roux 1995 o connor 1995 reynolds et al 2007 ruppert et al 2015 with substantial negative consequences for dry season feed availability rangeland carrying capacity and local livelihoods martin et al 2016 in particular the loss of perennial species affects productivity quality and duration of forage availability and can lead to desertification where transition to bare ground conditions is involved schlesinger et al 1990 ruppert et al 2015 guuroh et al 2018 whether over grazed rangelands can recover from the associated adverse effects is a highly relevant question for rangeland managers coping with rangeland rehabilitation resting may in some cases allow recovery of forage quantities but not necessarily of forage quality and palatability seymour et al 2010 whereas severely degraded rangelands may not even recover after several decades of resting o connor 1991 müller et al 2007 it is challenging to predict the responses of rangelands to changing grazing regimes due to the complex interactions between grazers vegetation and climate a process based system understanding is needed to develop sustainable land use strategies for rangelands in particular under altered future climate conditions müller et al 2015 although field studies from semi arid tropical rangelands reveal differential effects of grazing on plant communities kohyani et al 2008 linstädter et al 2014 the results of local studies depend on site specific environmental conditions and a site s evolutionary and land use history contradictory observations make it difficult to extrapolate grazing impacts on vegetation from site scale to larger scales in this context models are useful tools they are simplified representations of reality that allow to conduct simulation experiments on interactions between grazing climate change and fire and to test a wide range of alternative management options on large spatio temporal scales dynamic global vegetation models dgvms can simulate how vegetation interacts with environmental forcing factors e g climate co2 and disturbances dgvms help to assess effects of environmental change on vegetation patterns and biogeochemical cycles cramer et al 2001 chang et al 2017 to support large scale spatio temporal applicability many dgvms use a restricted number of plant functional types pfts lavorel et al 2007 this approach successfully captures responses of biogeochemical cycles and broad vegetation patterns cramer et al 2001 however while pft based dgvms distinguish approximately 5 8 woody pfts e g hickler et al 2012 they only differentiate between c3 and c4 grass types c3 and c4 grasses in many dgvms are largely spatially exclusive due to bioclimatic constraints that limit their spatial occurrence e g minimum coldest month survival temperature of c4 grasses and maximum coldest month temperature for establishment of c3 grasses at 15 5 c in lpj and lpj guess sitch et al 2003 smith et al 2001 hence pft based dgvms de facto represent grasses by one single pft at the local scale although in reality both grass types do co occur sage et al 1999 lattanzi 2010 while coarse scale shifts in the competitive balance of woody and herbaceous plant types can be captured based on such a simple grass representation higgins and scheiter 2012 within grass community dynamics remains invisible in rangelands where grasses predominate and provide the main forage source for grazers such a representation is highly inadequate in order to study functioning and biodiversity to assess rangeland sensitivity to grazing to test management scenarios and to deduce sustainable management and conservation strategies a more refined representation of grasses in dgvms is necessary linstädter et al 2014 bond 2016 we argue that dgvms should at least distinguish annual and perennial grasses to reflect the principal dichotomy between two very different life history strategies in semi arid rangelands smith and mcallister 2008 while smaller scale rangeland models have included distinctions between annual and perennial grasses in combination with selective grazing for more than a decade e g liedloff et al 2001 lohmann et al 2012 dgvms so far widely ignore within grass layer diversity dgvms that are capable to distinguish functional differences between annual and perennial grasses will allow a more realistic representation of spatio temporal patterns of forage provision in semi arid tropical rangelands leaf and growth traits of annual and perennial grasses affect their respective sensitivity to grazing as well as productivity seasonal availability and forage quality i e palatability and thereby grazing selectivity e g pontes et al 2007 however not only do grass traits influence grazer choices but grazers selectivity in return also exerts selection pressure on grasses augustine and mcnaughton 1998 grazing selectivity therefore is an important driver of perennial annual grass abundance nonetheless only a few dgvms include grazing routines e g chang et al 2013 pachzelt et al 2015 scheiter and savadogo 2016 rolinski et al 2018 and none of them a representation of grazing selectivity or differentiation of trait diversity within the grass layer using adgvm2 a dgvm for tropical ecosystems scheiter et al 2013 langan et al 2017 we developed a new grass scheme to model annual and perennial grasses and a grazing routine that simulates selective grazing the latter is indispensable for modeling grazing impacts on annual perennial community dynamics as grazing can shift the balance of annual and perennial grasses and lead to decrease in perennial grass abundance e g dyksterhuis 1949 olsvik whittaker et al 1993 tessema et al 2011 we use the updated version of adgvm2 to test the sensitivity of semi arid rangelands to varying grazing intensities for five sites located along a precipitation gradient in south africa we ask the following questions 1 is annual precipitation a determinant of rangeland productivity and does the maximum density of livestock supported by semi arid rangeland ecosystems increase with increasing mean annual precipitation 2 does increasing grazing intensity lead to shifts in the community composition of rangelands due to selective grazing 3 can continuous intense grazing without intermittent resting periods prevent recovery and can it keep rangeland communities in a state of low productivity and forage quality 4 is recovery of rangeland communities from intense grazing mediated by mean annual precipitation i e does mean annual precipitation map influence post disturbance regrowth based on our results we discuss implications for sustainable grazing management of semi arid rangeland ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 model description the adgvm2 simulates growth of individual plants on a representative stand of 1 ha and tracks their state variables each plant individual is characterized by a set of traits describing plant type grass or tree perennial or annual leaf characteristics specific leaf area photosynthetic pathway carbon allocation to plant compartments plant architecture roots and crown shape response to fire reproduction and mortality growth reproduction and mortality of plants are the combined result of trait characteristics and environmental conditions plant performance is regulated by trait trade offs mass conservation for allocation stability trade offs for architecture leaf economic spectrum and resource competition between individuals see scheiter et al 2013 langan et al 2017 and references therein trait inheritance and alteration during reproduction affect community assembly and allow dynamic adaptation to environmental conditions for more details see the adgvm2 model description in scheiter et al 2013 and langan et al 2017 in adgvm2 the simulated representative 1ha vegetation stand is subdivided into equal sized sub cells thereafter denoted as patch containing maximum one type of individual at a given time thereby limiting the maximum number of individuals simulated for each stand the prescribed sub grid structure also allows to track neighborhood relationships between individuals e g to determine competition for light and space patches can be occupied bare become bare and be re colonized by a new individual with potentially different traits following mortality of the original individual in sensitivity tests conducted prior to this study with individual numbers ranging between 25 25 and 60 60 individuals 40 40 individuals had proven sufficiently numerous to represent the full range of trait diversity while keeping computational effort reasonable as single grass individuals in the model are constrained to a maximum cover of 1 m2 their respective mass or area based state variables are multiplied by patch area size to obtain a patch s value this implies trait homogeneity within a patch fig 1 illustrates carbon balance and biomass pools of an individual grass patch here we present a novel scheme for adgvm2 that distinguishes between annual and perennial grass types and a grazing scheme that allows to simulate selective grazing based on status and traits of individual grass patches due to the trait and individual based representation of plants in adgvm2 we are in a unique position that allows us to implement a distinction of grass functional types based on trait trade offs to our knowledge this is the first time such a detailed representation of grass traits and selective grazing has been implemented in a dgvm and it addresses the issue that the relevance of grasses is often neglected in classical pft based dgvms that often focus mainly on diversity and dynamics of woody vegetation 2 2 implementation of annual and perennial grasses we conceptualized annual and perennial grasses by assigning different trait ranges for carbon allocation specific leaf area sla m2 kg 1 and seed size vs seed number based on empirically observed trade off costs between allocation to reproductive vs vegetative structures friedman and ruin 2015 for a conceptual overview see table 1 annual grasses feature rapid production of photosynthetic leaf biomass and quick reproduction as they need to complete their life cycle within one growing season higher allocation to reproductive structures at the expense of investment to vegetative structures in annuals has been described by various authors e g hancock and pritts 1987 vico et al 2016 although such trade offs can be masked by variability in resource availability and fitness of individuals van noordwijk and de jong 1986 selection for rapid gain of leaf area at the beginning of the growing season in annuals is accomplished at the cost of leaf thickness entailing higher sla values garnier 1992 poorter et al 2009 lower capacity to extract soil water and lower leaf longevity langan et al 2017 and references therein allocation trait ranges for annual and perennial grasses in this version of adgvm2 are listed in table 2 trait parameters of plant individuals are randomly assigned during initialization from a functional type s respective allowed trait range are inherited by offspring and are subject to mutation and crossover during reproduction scheiter et al 2013 allocation parameters are scaled such that their sum equals 1 perennial plants switch between a dormant respiratory and a metabolic assimilatory state once light or water availability exceed or fall below plant specific phenology thresholds these threshold values determine the onset and end of leaf growth of perennials in the growing season seed germination of all grasses is also tied to leaf phenology i e crossing the leaf phenology thresholds also triggers seed germination and initiates seedling growth at growing season start to operationalize differences in recruitment annuals in the model have a higher germination likelihood than perennials this assumption is required because the number of individuals modeled on a simulated vegetation stand is limited and new individuals can only establish on non occupied patches as only one randomly chosen seed per empty spot is allowed to germinate at a time the germination likelihood serves to reflect differences in seed density and ensures that annuals can persist in the population perennials experience gradual biomass die back during drought or low light conditions while annuals die at the end of the growing season when water or light availability drop below an individual s phenology thresholds annual and perennial grasses in their assimilatory state experience leaf turnover with leaf longevity being inversely related to sla langan et al 2017 mortality of perennial grasses may be related to age background mortality grazing stress see section 2 3 or negative annual carbon balance a negative c balance can be caused by insufficient c gain e g due to water stress competition self shading or too high c loss due to respiration turnover fire or grazing see e g zimmermann et al 2010 2 3 grazing model previous versions of adgvm2 did not include grazing routines scheiter et al 2013 langan et al 2017 in this updated version of adgvm2 we simulate selective grazing by linking grass removal to state variables and trait values of individual grass patches to our knowledge this is the first time such an approach has been implemented in a dgvm a schematic overview of the grazing scheme is provided in fig 2 daily biomass demand b g kg day 1 is defined by requirement per livestock unit lu multiplied by animal number n a animals ha 1 day 1 see table 3 for overview of state variables grazers remove leaves and stalks reproductive biomass and standing senescent and moribund grass material compare fig 1 to account for the lower nutritional value of dead biomass we assign it 2 3 of the nutritional value of living plant material estimate based on fig 4 in bell 2006 in this study we treat grazing as an external forcing controlled by the number of lu per day and hectare n a and the visitation frequency f a fraction of days per year during which grazers are present we refrain from simulating grazer population dynamics and focus on managed land where stocking rates are controlled by land owners as we are interested in how varying grazing pressure affects grass communities and not how biomass supply feeds back on the livestock population negative balance between demand and supply is tracked but its implications for grazers are ignored for the purpose of this study implicitly assuming that grazers move through the landscape to compensate for their deficit elsewhere or that farmers will provide supplementary feed if required müller et al 2015 when b g exceeds stand level biomass aboveground grass biomass b net is removed down to stubble irrespective of grass type retaining 0 01 kg leaf stalk biomass and reproductive biomass per plant respectively i e all grass patches are grazed irrespective of selection probability belowground plant biomass is indirectly affected by grazing via carbon balance effects roots may experience die back after leaf loss because low carbon assimilation leads to reduced carbon allocation to roots causing root maintenance respiration to exceed c allocation if supply b net exceeds b g biomass is selectively removed from grass patches until b g is satisfied in an iterative cycle grass patches are randomly targeted for grazing and if the drawing of a second random number for a targeted grass patch is less than that patch s selection probability p sel grass biomass is removed from that patch the selection probability p sel determines i the likelihood of a specific grass patch to be grazed and ii the fraction of grass biomass removed from a grazed patch p sel is based on leaf biomass fraction of living to dead leaf material and sla as a palatability proxy kelvin et al 2010 as these are state variables and traits readily available in adgvm2 using the range of available biomass and sla of all grass patches on a representative stand we calculate three separate selection probability values for each grass patch and combine the biomass derived w bm sla derived w sla and dead to living ratio derived w dead probability value to the overall selection probability p sel to determine the three probability values for each probability a linear equation is fit between the two individuals with the highest and lowest respective value biomass sla dead to living ratio in the population assigning a weight of 1 to the individual with the highest and a weight of 0 to the individual with the lowest value grass individuals with less than the minimum biomass required for grazing are ignored selection probability of 0 each grass individual s respective probabilities are then determined using the derived linear equations for biomass sla and dead to living ratio p sel is calculated as the mean of w bm w sla and w dead and describes the overall likelihood that an individual grass patch is grazed this likelihood is high if patch biomass and palatability are high large proportions of dead biomass decrease p sel as dead biomass conceals living biomass in tufts avoidance of tufts with greater amounts of moribund material has been observed in field studies e g o connor 1992 the amount of biomass cropped from a patch is based on its aboveground biomass and p sel in average removing larger relative amounts of biomass from patches with larger p sel biomass removal b removed in kg is calculated as a function of an individual s available biomass b avail in kg and its selection probability p sel 1 b removed b avail p sel b avail b avail p sel p c with p c as a random number between 0 and 0 1 adding bite imprecision to the removal based on p sel biomass is removed in equal proportions from living leaf biomass dead leaf biomass and reproductive biomass but limited to the respective maximum available amount we set a minimum removal per biomass pool minimum bite size of 0 01 kg as long as the respective pool has sufficient biomass in order to avoid removal of very small quantities and associated large numbers of iteration cycles to cover daily demand in principle a grass patch can be grazed several times during 1 day however as a grazed patch s p sel is updated based on its new lower biomass the likelihood to be re selected on the same day decreases both annual and perennial grass patches partially replace lost leaf biomass on a daily basis by reallocating carbon from storage compartments growth compensation see e g mcnaughton 1983 ferraro and oesterheld 2002 the amount of carbon reallocated from storage to leaves b realloc in kg is determined by the fractional loss of original leaf biomass f loss and the individual grass patch s trait value defining the maximum allowed transfer fraction from storage b stor in kg to leaves a s2l 2 b realloc f loss b stor a s 2 l with fraction a s2l being a life history trait grazing may increase plant mortality through negative annual c balance as post grazing recovery can be boosted via reallocation from storage to new leaf tissue plant mortality is also influenced by the size of the storage compartment the allocation to storage trait a s and the storage to leaf reallocation trait a s2l table 2 we additionally calculate a grazing stress factor between 0 and 1 that defines the likelihood of plant death from grazing stress this stress factor depends on how many times an individual patch was grazed within one year and the fraction of annual anpp aboveground net primary productivity in kg that got consumed this approach accounts for empirical evidence that recovery duration has a major impact with longer time for recovery from defoliation and more time between defoliation events significantly decreasing negative effects ferraro and oesterheld 2002 short recovery intervals may be more detrimental than a singular high intensity grazing event as infrequent high intensity grazing has been reported to disrupt the carbohydrate metabolism of perennial plants less severely menke 1992 in adgvm2 grazing related mortality probability depends on the number of days a specific grass patch had to endure grazing and on how severely it got impacted measured by the fraction of anpp that got consumed over the course of a year each perennial patch s annual grazing mortality probability m g is calculated as 3 m g i a c f 2 where i a is a factor related to the number of days per year d g a specific individual was grazed and the consumed fraction c f is the fraction of annual anpp eaten by grazers 4 i a 0 9 364 d g 35 5 364 this equation assumes that for a c f of 1 worst case scenario the mortality risk based on the number of grazing days equals 10 after one grazing event and linearly increases to 100 if vegetation is grazed daily c f is the fraction of annual npp allocated to leaves and reproduction that got consumed by grazers 5 c f 1 a l a re c c npp here npp in kg is annual net productivity aboveground and belowground c c in kg year 1 is the amount of biomass consumed from one individual patch over the course of the year a l is the fraction of npp allocated to leaves and a rep is the fraction of npp allocated to reproduction 2 4 simulation experiments we conducted control simulations without grazing for five study sites along a precipitation gradient in south africa s semi arid rangelands table 4 fig 3 a the sites were chosen to connect to past and ongoing field research performed at these locations where available we compare our simulated results with site specific data from rangeland experiments or ground data from semi arid rangelands with comparable environmental conditions for more details on site specific details and references to field research conducted at the sites see table 4 to ensure that model state variables and trait assemblies stabilize we let the model equilibrate to ambient environmental forcing for 500 years spin up then simulated another 200 years without grazing using iterated monthly data from the cru reference climatology for the period 1961 1990 new et al 2002 we generated daily rainfall sequences from the climatology by using the algorithm provided by new et al 2002 test simulations showed that approx 400 500 simulation years are sufficient to reach dynamic equilibrium of model state variables per site we conducted 10 replicate simulation runs with different initializations of the plant community to account for stochastic effects in precipitation and community assembly each replicate run was initialized with its respective unique and reproducible random seed i e variability between replicate runs was ultimately caused by the differing random seed for the grazing experiments we simulated 100 years of continuous grazing after the spin up phase followed by another 100 years without grazing to allow recovery per site we conducted simulations with 10 different grazing intensities biomass demand b g of 5 10 15 50 kg ha 1 day 1 at a default grazing frequency of 0 2 i e animals are present for approx 20 of the days per year note that unique random seeds for replicate runs between different treatment scenarios were the same e g run no 1 was always initialized with the same random seed in all scenarios therefore differences between scenarios with the same unique random seed are solely due to differences in treatment as we were specifically interested in our novel distinction between annual and perennial grasses and how the relative abundances of these herbaceous pfts were modulated by climate and selective grazing we deliberately excluded fire and woody vegetation although they are part of adgvm2 langan et al 2017 this simplification is justified because tree cover at the study sites is low and large areas of these rangelands are grass dominated this experimental design allows us to focus on the grass layer and the interactions between different grass types grazing and environmental drivers and avoids the common focus on woody vegetation types in dgvms 3 results 3 1 ungrazed communities simulated living grass biomass was subject to large intra and interannual variability fig 3b illustrates the simulated range of annual peak leaf biomass for the control scenarios peak leaf biomass on average reached 2 2 5 t ha 1 at the two driest sites s1 and s2 and 3 3 5 t ha 1 at the wetter sites s3 to s5 sites s1 and s2 displayed higher interannual variability than the wetter sites annual stand level anpp fig 3d varied between ca 4 5 t ha 1 at the two driest sites and ca 6 7 t ha 1 at the wetter sites at the two driest sites anpp showed high interannual variability without grazing perennial grasses dominated the sward at the three wetter sites fig 3c the two dry sites had lower median values of perennial grass abundance 30 and 58 respectively and high temporal variability in the ratio between perennial and annual grasses annual precipitation was a weak predictor of annual anpp tests for correlation and cross correlation between anpp and precipitation revealed low correlation factors see also scatterplots in supplementary fig s1 however productivity tended to be correlated to productivity of preceding years for details on autocorrelation of anpp see supplementary fig s2 this dependency was stronger at the more productive sites due to lower interannual fluctuations in productivity our results from the baseline control simulations therefore only partially confirm the first part of our first key question map below 500 mm constrained simulated peak leaf biomass and anpp while above 500 mm precipitation became less relevant as a limiting factor as further precipitation increase did not reflect in peak leaf biomass and only to some degree in anpp fig 3 variability in peak leaf biomass and annual anpp was markedly higher for the two dry sites s1 and s2 than for the three wetter sites although variability in annual precipitation was comparable for all sites this higher variability of anpp is due to the large interannual variability in perennial fraction at s1 and s2 caused by drought induced die back of perennials i e years with low perennial abundance are also marked by low peak leaf biomass and productivity at sites s3 s5 annual precipitation is sufficient to sustain a stable population of perennials in most years resulting in less variability of peak leaf biomass and anpp 3 2 effect of grazing on productivity and community composition increasing grazing intensity reduced anpp fig 4 a with the amount of anpp for a given grazing intensity depending on the initial productivity of the site the wettest site s5 displayed the highest average annual productivity when undisturbed and at low to intermediate grazing intensities reduction in productivity was approximately linear in absolute fig 4a as well as relative fig 4b terms the approximately linear decrease in productivity with increasing grazing intensity became nonlinear i e productivity started to drop more steeply once demand started to exhaust supply increasing biomass demand could be sustained until annual aboveground productivity became insufficient to fully compensate removal fig 5 sites s4 and s5 had the highest carrying capacities site s5 sustained a continuous long term demand of 25 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 while at site s4 a grazing intensity between 15 and 20 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 could be sustained in most years long term carrying capacity tended to increase with map with lowest carrying capacity at the two driest sites with respect to the second part of our first key question we can say that average carrying capacity of rangelands increases with map the proportion of annual grasses in the population increased with grazing pressure fig 6 without grazing the average percentage of annual grasses varied between 20 and 40 with more annuals at drier sites as long as demand could be satisfied increase of annual grasses with intensity was moderate but increased steeply at the expense of perennial grass abundance once the site productivity became insufficient to cover grazing demand compare fig 5 and 6 without grazing annual grasses contributed less than 10 to anpp at all study sites due to low abundance and their short life span with increasing grazing pressure plot level anpp declined fig 4 perennials became less abundant fig 6 and productivity was increasingly provided by annual grasses with as much as 70 80 contribution at the maximum grazing intensity simulated in this study regarding our second key question our results confirm that grazing as a selective process may affect community composition and thereby alter rangeland productivity and quality as described in section 2 an individual grass patch s likelihood to be grazed is influenced by its sla its aboveground living biomass and its ratio of living and dead biomass annual grasses typically reached lower peak leaf biomass than perennials due to their ephemerality and the thinner leaves resulting from their higher sla a selection mechanism that enables them to quickly increase leaf area at low biomass investment hence at low grazing intensities grazers mostly grazed perennial grasses as their higher biomass outweighed their lower sla fig 7 illustrates how the average likelihood of being grazed for both annuals and perennials varied between sites and grazing intensities avoidance vs preference of annuals in fig 7 was determined by relating the fraction of grazings per year on annuals to their fraction within the grass population i e a value of 1 indicates that annuals were grazed as often as can be expected based on their occurrence in the population whereas a value greater less than 1 indicates that annuals were grazed more less frequently than can be expected based on their occurrence a value of 2 indicates that annuals were grazed two times more frequently than can be expected based on their occurrence the amount of biomass withdrawn from perennials vs annuals also changes with grazing intensity see fig s3 with annuals becoming the dominant biomass source at high grazing intensities at the lowest grazing intensity 5 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 preference of perennial over annual grass patches was common except for the two driest sites s1 and s2 this effect was particularly pronounced for sites s4 and s5 the sites that had high peak leaf biomass and anpp as well as low annual abundance in the control scenario however the drier less productive sites s1 and s2 were characterized by animals preferentially grazing annual grasses or no discrimination against annuals or perennials as grazing intensity increased preference at sites s3 s5 switched from perennials to annuals however when grazing intensity approached carrying capacity discrimination gradually decreased at high intensities annuals and perennials were grazed without discrimination discrimination tended to be highest at the more productive wetter sites at low to intermediate grazing intensities at more arid less productive sites discrimination was less pronounced discrimination decreased as resources became increasingly scarce because at high grazing intensity all available individuals on a representative stand had to be grazed to at least partially meet demand 3 3 supply transgression and post grazing recovery the biomass demand that ultimately exceeded supply differed between sites fig 4 and replicate runs for one site fig 8 a combination of temporal variability of productivity variability of annual rainfall and dynamic balance between increasing grazing intensity and concurrent decrease in productivity influenced if and after how many years supply started to exceed demand for example at site s4 a demand of 15 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 could be covered over the entire 100 year period in all ten replicate runs but a demand of 20 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 was only met in nine replicate runs during one run demand exceeded productivity after approx 40 years of continuous grazing for a demand of 25 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 only 30 of replicate runs maintained sufficient productivity to continuously cover demand for 100 years a grazing intensity of 30 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 exhausted carrying capacity after a maximum of 20 years in all replicate runs qualitatively the tipping point with respect to grazing intensity at site s4 is therefore reached approximately at a demand of 25 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 as variability between replicate runs is largest for this level of demand once carrying capacity had been exceeded pre collapse productivity was never recovered while grazing persisted in accordance with our third key question our results indicate that continuous intensive grazing may prevent recovery and keep rangelands in a less productive state however productivity and community composition recovered after grazing stopped recovery duration depended on preceding grazing intensity and potential site productivity with respect to our fourth key question we identified an indirect relation between map and recovery time with the more productive sites taking longer to recover their full productivity potential which is due to the higher biomass and anpp that needs to be regained at the wetter sites in our simulations 5 10 years were usually sufficient to regain 90 of the productivity level of the ungrazed control fig 9 for any grazing intensity at the two dry sites and for grazing intensities of less than 20 kg ha 1 grazing day 1 at the wetter sites the average population ratio between annual and perennial grasses and stand level peak leaf biomass also recovered to the level of the ungrazed control scenario following the temporal pattern of productivity recovery figure not shown 4 discussion while rangeland ecologists often use sophisticated classification schemes to characterize grass species palatability and responses to grazing dyksterhuis 1949 van oudtshoorn 1999 these classification approaches are not easily transferable to rangelands with a different community composition and or climatic setting linstädter et al 2014 and are thus not feasible for dgvms we present a novel scheme for adgvm2 that conceptualizes distinctive traits and resulting differences in life history strategies of perennial and annual grasses we focus on the community assembly of the grass layer and its dynamics because grazing not only affects the competitive balance between woody and herbaceous vegetation but also alters composition productivity and palatability of the grass layer as a selective process grazing feeds back on forage quality and carrying capacity and causes vegetation changes that can promote or deter further grazing hempson et al 2014 we are aware that we are not considering the full range of criteria defining palatability sla is a simplified surrogate for palatability and not all herbivore species base their dietary selection equally on sla moreover sla palatability relationships may vary considerably across african grasslands ferner et al 2015 however additional palatability related factors such as leaf tensile strength leaf nitrogen content overall nutritional value concentration of defensive leaf phenolics and structural compounds or toxicity currently cannot be deduced from plant traits simulated by adgvm2 nonetheless based on the definition of a few generalized selection criteria we are able to model effects of grazing selectivity that are in agreement with empirical observations such as the shift to higher annual grass abundance at expense of perennial grasses our simulated peak leaf biomass of 2 3 5 t ha 1 in ungrazed rangeland communities is within the typical range reported for semi arid african rangelands dwyer 2011 moustakas et al 2013 oomen et al 2016 anpp values reported for semi arid tropical rangelands are less certain and vary over a wide range depending on location site specific conditions and method used to estimate anpp scurlock et al 2002 knapp et al 2006 report an average of 4 24 1 02 t ha 1 for the grassland trials at ukulinga research farm in kwazulu natal south africa while anpp values between 3 31 and 8 85 t ha 1 with a mean of 6 09 6 53 t ha 1 have been reported for rangeland near nairobi scurlock et al 2002 for neotropical rangelands ospina et al 2012 measured anpp values between 8 98 and 15 6 t ha 1 average anpp estimates from the droughtact grazing experiments performed between 2015 and 2017 at syferkuil experimental farm near university of limpopo in south africa s limpopo province range between 0 8 and 1 62 t ha 1 for perennial grasses in grazing exclusion plots minimum 0 21 0 47 t ha 1 maximum 0 123 2 87 t ha 1 e mudongo j c ruppert and a linstädter unpublished data simulated anpp values are therefore within the range reported for semi arid rangelands but higher than the values estimated in the droughtact grazing experiments yet these experiments include exceptionally dry years experienced in southern africa due to the 2015 2016 el niño one of the strongest of the last 145 years winkler et al 2017 simulated peak leaf biomass and anpp varied between sites with lower values and a wide range of interannual variability at the two driest sites where perennial grasses reach the limit of their ecological niche while wetter years still provide sufficient precipitation to sustain perennial grass cover at these sites dry years cause substantial die back of perennial grasses lowering peak leaf biomass and shifting community composition towards more ephemeral annual grasses intensive grazing as well as low map reduced productivity and promoted annuals this finding agrees with grazing induced changes observed in semi arid tropical rangeland systems walker et al 1981 linstädter et al 2014 replacement of perennials by annuals has been interpreted as a shift in the competitive balance in favor of short lived disturbance adapted annuals dyksterhuis 1949 after weak disturbance persisting perennial grasses quickly expand cover at the beginning of the subsequent growing season more intense disturbances increase mortality of perennials in adgvm2 leading to more open space in the simulated vegetation stand that becomes available for new plant seedlings as annuals need to establish each year they benefit from a high overall mortality and open space created by perennial turnover shifts towards annual dominance decreased biomass supply for grazers as annuals provided less biomass and productivity per grass patch than perennials this agrees with studies reporting lower leaf area and biomass produced per unit rain for annuals than perennials nicholson et al 1990 beck et al 1990 there are several possible reasons that could explain this pattern first annuals germinate build up biomass reproduce and die within one growing season in comparison perennials gradually die back during the dry season but storage reserves help to quickly rebuild biomass in the next growing season second after germination simulated perennials often required several growing seasons to reach maximum values of peak leaf biomass time that annuals intrinsically lack third simulated annual grasses had thinner leaves and higher sla enabling them to quickly gain leaf area after establishment but resulting in overall less leaf biomass this deficit is additionally amplified by proportionally higher carbon allocation to reproduction continental scale applications of grazing models e g pachzelt et al 2015 identified net primary productivity and dry season length as good predictors of grazer density however by ignoring grazing induced community shifts these models may overestimate productivity under high grazing intensity heavily grazed communities were more akin to those of drier sites i e intensive grazing and drought had similar effects on simulated grass communities these results agree with the convergence model of aridity and grazing postulated for grass dominated ecosystems and supported empirically e g by quiroga et al 2010 linstädter et al 2014 and gaitán et al 2018 simulated overgrazing effects carried over to subsequent years and sites did not recover without resting fig 8 this supports recommendations e g müller et al 2015 to adjust grazing management during post drought years to avoid permanent productivity loss and undesired community shifts grazers preference for young tender leaves can prevent regrowth and promote less palatable and or less productive plants o connor 1995 after grazing suppression our sites recovered productivity within 5 15 years fig 9 this agrees with observations from field studies e g o connor 1995 reports more rapid recovery for sites with a low intensity grazing history in the worst cases vegetation has been observed to remain in a degraded state for at least 20 years after exclusion of large herbivores walker et al 1981 persistent heavy grazing may also delay recovery by depleting local seed banks o connor 1991 1992 sternberg et al 2003 moreover recovery of perennial grasses in arid and semi arid rangelands may also depend on the occurrence of a window of opportunity of regeneration such as several years with high rainfall see linstädter et al 2014 and references therein recovery may also be impeded if overgrazing causes soil loss due to increased erosion altered balance of soil nutrient cycles or altered soil water availability due to increased run off we may therefore overestimate rangeland recovery potential due to the simplified nature of our experimental design and soil degradation mechanisms currently not represented in the model in addition competitive interactions between grasses woody vegetation grazing and fire may cause permanent shifts in vegetation structure a set of interactions that we acknowledge but that lies beyond the intended scope of this study our results have implications for sustainable management of semi arid rangelands grazing can reduce drought resistance of rangelands and amplify drought effects in particular negatively affecting perennial grasses vetter 2009 ruppert et al 2015 management should aim to avoid the loss of perennials from populations and seed banks due to drought stress and or overgrazing danckwerts and stuart hill 1988 as perennials provide feed more reliably than the ephemeral annuals downsizing of herds and or provisioning of supplementary fodder should include post stress years when recovery of reserve and green biomass is stimulated providing time to regain levels sufficient to buffer precipitation deficits and grazing losses danckwerts and stuart hill 1988 müller et al 2007 as we could demonstrate once productivity has collapsed it often remains depressed without sufficient resting compare e g danckwerts and stuart hill 1988 contrary to the needs of subsistence farmers who usually aim for maximum stocking density rather than maximum sustainable yield resting promotes improvement of rangeland conditions and allows higher total stocking rates within a certain period of time müller et al 2007 5 conclusions we developed a grass scheme for adgvm2 that allows us to functionally differentiate annuals and perennials this enables us to model within grass layer dynamics and grazing effects on grass community composition our results corroborate empirical evidence that climate and grazing interactively alter community composition of semi arid grass communities linstädter et al 2014 we find that drought and intensive grazing have similar effects on perennial annual ratios in semi arid grass dominated ecosystems as both shift community composition towards higher abundance of annuals concomitant declines in productivity reduce grazing carrying capacity and entail lower carbon storage therefore dgmvs omitting within grass layer dynamics may misjudge the carbon balance of semi arid rangelands grazing impacts and rangeland carrying capacity under future conditions our results also corroborate the need for flexible informed management of semi arid african rangelands found by previous studies to prevent overgrazing from locking grass communities in undesired low productivity states modeling grasses as individuals with dynamic traits and defining characteristic trait based functional differences between annuals and perennials is a promising step towards a long needed improvement of grass representation in dgvms further refinement of grass representation in adgvm2 could include additional grass related traits e g distinction between increaser and decreaser types or the capability for non sexual reproduction and spread via stolons moreover we are confident that the new grass layer dynamics and grazing scheme presented in this study are a necessary basis that will allow evaluation of more complex

25114,human societies are dependent on a large set of ecosystem services es generated by the diversity of life on earth it has been proposed that the negative impact of human societies on ecosystems could be reduced if the economic value of es would be acknowledged however the evaluation of es vital for human well being using traditional economic models following market principles based on the concept of scarcity and regarding es as an intrinsic market structure poses some limitations ecological economics offers an alternative perspective based on the idea that human economy should not exceed the biophysical limits of the planet understanding the economic value of natural resources and es may be effective to optimize the environmental performance at local scale however the sustainable use of natural resources is ultimately a question of understanding the value of the biosphere at different scales from local to global using multiple perspectives and criteria this paper proposes alternative ways of understanding the real significance and value of biodiversity and its links to the generation of es based on thermodynamics and information theory in particular the use of two indicators of ecosystem complexity reflecting the potential for es delivery is suggested information e g genetic diversity and eco exergy e g the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in biomass of living organisms keywords systems ecology thermodynamics biodiversity ecological economy information theory sustainability 1 what is life life on earth is over 3 5 billion years old a long span even on the scale of the universe the traditional biological definition of life is first and foremost based on two fundamental characteristics metabolism and reproduction i e copying and variation living organisms seek to collect and recycle energy and matter from the environment and transfer their genetic information to the next generation the explanation physics gives for the phenomenon we know as life is very simple to consume free energy as rapidly as possible kaila and annila 2008 in systems ecology solar radiation is the basic source of energy for life on earth and biodiversity is the system that evolved to exploit free energy to the maximum level life on earth requires matter and energy flows for its metabolism the bio geo chemical cycles known as regulating and supporting or maintenance services in the es jargon recycle some 30 elements in the earth s internal system of these the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles are fairly well known burgin et al 2011 schlesinger et al 2011 information remains scarce regarding the ecosystem regulating impacts of other substances such as manganese and iron the basic classification of living organisms is based on the sources of energy they utilise several alternative basic metabolism pathways are known in the world of microbes whereas plants and animals are simpler since they gain energy through photosynthesis and the uptake of nutrients and the consumption of biomass along the trophic chain it could be said that the oldest forms of life contain the most divergent information on how to survive in the universe for these organisms the meaning of the concept of species which we mainly attribute to plants and animals is questionable the functional differences between different groups of organisms such as the way they obtain energy are arguably more crucial 2 boltzmann s thermodynamic systems and darwin s theory of information in the second half of the 1800s at around the same time as charles darwin 1809 1882 was publishing his insights on evolution darwin 1859 ludwig boltzmann 1844 1906 was developing an interest in brownian motion and thermodynamics boltzmann was particularly interested in the second law of thermodynamics e g the law of entropy increase under which systems of nature inevitably drift towards collapse and complete disorder towards the heat death of a universe seeking equilibrium on the other hand darwin s view appeared to lead in the opposite direction towards complexity specialisation and the structured order of biological systems boltzmann believed that living organisms were forming organised structures moving away from thermodynamic equilibrium boltzmann 1905 schneider and kay 1995 niels bohr 1885 1962 the creator of the atomic model took an interest in combining physics and biology but his vitalistic views of the forces explaining life have not taken scientists very far in this integrated area of science in the mid 1900s the austrian physicist and nobel prize winner erwin schrödinger 1887 1961 one of the founders of quantum mechanics who was also interested in explaining life was inspired by boltzmann s findings a particular merit of schrödinger s work lies in the fact that he attempted to build a bridge between physics chemistry and biology he summarized his ideas in two fundamental processes that combine heredity and thermodynamics and describe life as order from order and order from disorder schrödinger 1944 schneider and kay 1995 by the theme of order from order he meant the question of how it is possible for organisms to transfer information from one generation to another he used the genes of a fruit fly which were estimated to consist of approximately 1000 atoms as an example schrödinger wondered how it was possible that changes in temperature do not alter such small structures within a cell which remain intact and pass on information to the next generation he thought that such an alteration could only be avoided if the genes were formed of an aperiodic crystal the structure of which contained information written in code schrödinger s prediction proved true when the dna double helix was discovered some ten years later watson and crick 1953 leading to huge advances in molecular biology however either the order from disorder theme has not been fully understood or has not been taken further by this schrödinger meant how it is possible for life to maintain an organised structure despite the fact that according to the second law of thermodynamics i e in light of the expected increase in entropy within a closed system this should be impossible in the long term schrödinger explained this by stating that an organism maintains order by increasing disorder in its external environment hence schrödinger solved the problem by turning to unbalanced thermodynamics in which matter and energy flows between the system and its external environment are important ilya prigogine 1917 2003 who received the nobel prize in chemistry in 1977 for his contributions to research into dissipative structures complex systems and irreversible phenomena mathematically proved how this process is possible on the basis of self organising systems prigogine 1955 a dissipative structure is a thermodynamically open system which usually operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium in an environment with which it exchanges energy and matter in addition to boltzmann and schrödinger definitions of life combining thermodynamics and biology have been presented by the statistician alfred j lotka 1922 who is well known among ecologists claude shannon known as the founder of information theory whose diversity index is well known in ecology shannon and weaver 1949 the odum brothers odum 1959 odum and odum 2000 and jeffrey wicken 1987 lotka 1922 proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation the application of thermodynamics to the study of biotic systems has opened new perspectives for the future study of the sustainability of social ecological systems nielsen and müller 2009 jørgensen et al 2008 jørgensen and svirezhev 2004 schneider and kay 1995 es research conducted on the scale of the biosphere should at least take into account these perspectives furthermore it should be remarked that thermodynamics is considered within the theoretical framework of ecological economics of which nicholas georgescu roegen was one of the founders georgescu roegen 1967 3 exergy free energy and the main features of thermodynamics system is the main concept of thermodynamics a system is an entity separated from its surroundings by actual or notional boundaries according to thermodynamics systems are classified as open closed or isolated depending on whether or not mass and energy pass through their boundaries into the external environment in an isolated system no energy or mass transfer takes place whereas a closed system can exchange energy but not matter with its external environment in an open system as it is the case of living and ecological systems both matter and energy flows can be exchanged with the external environment other essential concepts in thermodynamics are space entropy and exergy i e the maximum useful work that can be generated when a system is brought to thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment the concept of exergy was defined by zoran rant in 1956 but j williard gibbs had already developed the idea in 1873 gibbs 1873 jørgensen and svirezhev 2004 provided a thorough explanation of the use of exergy in the study of thermodynamic ecological systems in accordance with systems theory thermodynamics describes the transformation of state in relation to time as a black box at both the beginning and end of the process unlike statistical physics mechanics thermodynamics does not study the phases of such a transformation i e the micro states of the system but the change in macro state that can be measured using empirical parameters e g pressure temperature boltzmann studied the transformation of ideal gas towards entropy both entropy and the direction of time are simultaneously depicted by the spread of gas particles in space as evenly as possible boltzmann asked whether this approach could be applied to the description of living natural phenomena he saw difficulties in this issue for instance biosphere organisms cannot be compared to particles of ideal gas because the memory and independent choices of each particle influence their behaviour there have been several applications of thermodynamics and exergy concept to study technological systems while fewer studies were focusing on natural and ecological systems another relevant thermodynamic variable for studying energy flows in eco systems is emergy odum 1996 defined the concept of emergy as the available solar energy used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product its unit is the solar emjoule sej odum 1996 emergy can measure both the work of nature and that of humans in generating product and services emergy accounts for natural e g solar radiation wind rain geothermal flow and human driven flows machineries fuels minerals as well as for human labor and economic services the emergy concept is capable of taking into account for not only the amount but also the quality of different forms of energy according to emergy theory solar radiation is the most diluted form of energy while fossil fuels are very concentrated forms of energy resulting from the work of biosphere over millennia the emergy concept has been widely applied to study natural human dominated and man made ecosystems franzese et al 2014 several recent studies applied the emergy concept to assess the value of natural capital and es berrios et al 2017 buonocore et al 2019 franzese et al 2008 2017 picone et al 2017 ulgiati et al 2011 vassallo et al 2017 4 definitions of information what is information can information be exchanged with its surrounding environment the answer to these questions depends on how information is defined from the perspective of the study of natural systems the origin of information lies in physics karnani et al 2009 kullback 1959 according to genetics information can be transferred between two temporally isolated systems furthermore as an evolutionary concept information is intrinsically linked to natural selection better knowledge of the state of the environment and the potential uses of resources than competitors provides an advantage in selection survival of the fittest spencer 1864 in accordance with this darwinian principle ecosystems have evolved towards more complex structures a well matured ecosystem for example an old rainforest where biodiversity is abundant and diverse contains more genetic information than a simple ecosystem for instance a soybean field cleared from the rainforest or a cattle pasture the ability of a mature ecosystem to work effectively in other words to extract energy and materials from the environment and convert them through metabolism into hereditary information is higher than that of a simple ecosystem jørgensen and svirezhev 2004 unfortunately information is a concept that is often used very imprecisely information theory is currently regarded as a branch of applied mathematics which examines the measurement and transfer of information practical applications can be found in areas as varied as molecular biology data compression technology and social phenomena claude shannon is regarded as the inventor of actual information theory although darwin describes the same phenomena in terms of evolution entropy is also considered a measure in information theory this however has led to many misunderstandings since regardless of the identical relations of variables in boltzmann and shannon s mathematical formulas shannon s statistical entropy is not the same as boltzmann s thermodynamic entropy see wicken 1987 pp 18 19 both can be derived from gibbs s original statistical equation the starting point for shannon s definition of entropy is that it is formed from any symbols alphabets which convey information when their order is varied however uncertainty is very different in nature in statistical thermodynamics and information theory in statistical thermodynamics uncertainty is absolute the micro state of a system cannot be precisely known due to stochasticity in information theory uncertainty reduces as and when the alphabet required for the transmission of the message and its meaning become clear boltzmann gibbs entropy formula for irreversible processes is based on the separation of macrostates and microstates but this is not the case in shannon s entropy perhaps the term complexity would better describe shannon s entropy however information theory and thermodynamics inevitably meet in biology there are many ways to classify information considered essential in terms of research on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems taxonomic diversity describes the number and abundance of species and other taxonomic classification levels phylogenetic diversity describes the evolutionary distances between taxa that is the time span required for differentiation from the point of view of valuating information the use of phylogenetic diversity is justified because it even accounts for the temporal dimension faith et al 2010 genetic diversity consists of the double helix codes of dna the related objects of study can include nucleotides alleles chromosomes or genotypes functional diversity refers to variation in the number of functional properties in addition to these methods of measuring diversity include spatio temporal diversity the number of ecological interactions landscape diversity among others naeem et al 2012 5 why does biodiversity increase during the course of the history of life on earth evolution has continuously given rise to new innovations that have led to adaptive radiation that is rapid growth in the number of species confirmed by new selection advantages in the process of natural selection new species most commonly arise as a result of isolation the most famous and first ever documented example of this being darwin s finches on the galápagos islands three main types of speciation are usually classified allopatric which occurs when biological populations of the same species are geographically isolated sympatric when biological populations of the same species inhabit the same geographic region but different ecological niches and parapatric when biological populations of the same species live geographically adjacent to each other speciation can occur relatively rapidly but on the temporal scale of human life the periods of time required are often extremely long one of the main gradients regulating the occurrence of biodiversity on earth is the distance from the equator which naturally is also an indicator of the quantity of solar energy reaching the surface of the earth gaston 2000 however depending on the studied taxa there are countless exceptions and variations to this general rule heino 2011 when diversity is considered from the perspective of physics an increase in diversity is not an end point of a process in itself but occurs when a system is capable in this way of equalising energy differences as rapidly as possible jaakkola et al 2008 however the regional and biogeographical distributions of biodiversity on the globe tend to be regulated by interactions that are much more rapid than speciation dispersion capacity is one of the most important functional characteristics of biodiversity in constantly changing ecosystems since natural disturbances such as occasional drying of shallow water areas or fire and the subsequent succession modify the landscape but this is not the only means certain tree species for example can be extremely inefficient in spreading to new areas in such a case for them the most effective approach in evolutionary terms is to enhance their chances of survival on the site where they happen to appear such survival mechanisms can include focusing on the quality not the quantity of seeds or for instance developing protective chemical compounds that are toxic to herbivores hubbell 2011 presented a summary of the regularities in the biogeographical distribution of biodiversity complemented by thompson 2010 with more recent examples of the presence of biodiversity on a smaller scale at local level at local level the vegetation responsible for basic production largely determines which other species and consumers are present in ecosystems at succeeding levels of the food chain in theory this is simple but in practice biodiversity is highly challenging to be identified mapped and modelled vihervaara et al 2017 in particular the occurrence of vegetation is regulated by the nutrients content and soil ph precipitation and temperature in europe for example the species richness of vegetation is generally greater where the soil ph 7 or more is higher which in turn is associated with lime content while the species variety in acidic soils ph 6 or less is scarcer as it happens in the case of finland the general regularity of a higher ph and richer biodiversity seems clear however in the south african fynbos the australian kwongan and brazilian cerrado ecosystems the opposite is true in fact in these ecosystems biodiversity is highest in the vegetation of acidic sandy soils these examples show that the different evolutionary history of each region including the evolution of biogeochemical cycles is the reason for the richness of diversity thompson 2010 species also benefit if they are able to modify the conditions of the environment to suit them thereby enhancing their competitive advantage for instance spruce in the boreal zone do this by acidifying the soil with their needles and shading the undergrowth in order to favour their own seedlings similar historical processes regulating local biodiversity can in principle be linked around any substance that is circulating in the biosphere heino 2011 summarised the factors affecting the macro ecological occurrence of species in aquatic ecosystems and proved that for some species such as dragonflies fishes and frogs regional species richness follows a classic downward trend by latitude when moving from the equator to the polar circles in the case of fishes which are the best known examples energy and history are the key factors that explain the richness and endemism of a species however in the case of certain species groups stoneflies caddis flies and salamanders recent studies have revealed evidence indicating that their regional distribution does not directly follow the latitude gradient but is based on more complex biogeographical features the definition of regularities in the species richness of aquatic species becomes even more complex when comparing regularities at global regional or local level for instance the effect of the latitudinal gradient is obvious in the case of large water plants at regional level but not on a global scale the significance of latitude in explaining biodiversity also decreases when an attempt is made to explain species richness among different ecosystems local species richness typically has a linear relationship with regional species richness conclusions drawn about the distribution of large scale species richness are generally based on observations of common species whereas rarer species are not included in the research data lennon et al 2011 heino 2011 proposed that in the examination of large scale macro ecological distribution and that of more local scale landscape level meta communities should be combined to gain a better understanding of the factors explaining species richness 6 ecosystem services are benefits to humans generated by life itself es provision and their connection to biodiversity are timely research areas increasingly investigated by the scientific community cardinale et al 2012 häyhä and franzese 2014 mace et al 2012 pauna et al 2018 a widely used approach of categorising es involves their clustering into provisioning services regulating services cultural services and supporting services millennium ecosystem assessment ma 2005 in simple terms es refer to the benefits people obtain from ecosystems or nature s contributions to people díaz et al 2018 this broad multidisciplinary concept has also been criticised and misinterpreted due to the predominant focus on the monetization of es silvertown 2015 despite of that biophysical quantification of es is a key concept in monitoring of the state of social ecological systems at various scales the so called cascade model has gained favour as a way of avoiding such misconceptions haines young and potschin 2010 based on this model the components giving rise to es comprise 1 biodiversity and the structural features of ecosystems 2 the functional properties of ecosystems 3 the benefits gained from them and experienced by people and 4 the valuation of such benefits not only economic but also social health related and moral this grouping defines different domains of the research on es an approach based on es is of great value in reaching a holistic understanding of human nature interactions and social ecological systems life and biodiversity form the basis for es generation the use of information and eco exergy as fundamental variables for their assessment was explored in vihervaara 2013 systems ecological thinking has deep roots in the history of science and the holistic view of ecosystems is recognized as a leading principle cf h t odum s macroscope as detail eliminator when searching for the big picture systems thinking combining biology chemistry and physics has not become the prevailing paradigm in traditional ecological research although important authors have highlighted the opportunities it offers jørgensen 2010 2012 odum 1996 7 including biodiversity in ecosystem services assessment research into es explores human nature interactions and social ecological systems folke et al 2004 odum 1996 odum and odum 2000 due to the impacts of human activities also occurring at planetary scale rockström et al 2009 it would be particularly meaningful to examine the biosphere as a whole system when planning long term sustainability goals the number of species is an indicator whose state should be carefully monitored because negative changes occurring in this indicator loss of biodiversity are irreversible inevitably reducing the delivery of es as the biologist theodosius dobzhansky 1900 1975 said nothing in biology and ecology makes sense except in the light of evolution as a consequence under this perspective es assessment and related policy making should also entail an understanding of evolutionary processes in terms of ecological interactions predation competition and symbiosis occur in various forms through which energy and materials are recycled within the biosphere the processes of evolution adapt species to the currently prevailing conditions and in this respect information on the past is the key guarantee of success eco exergy has been proposed as a method for evaluating es and the complexity of ecosystems jørgensen 2010 sciubba 2004 nielsen and müller 2009 in particular the use of exergy is based on the perspective that the ability matured over time of an ecosystem in its natural state to work is as high as possible cf carnot 1824 however if only exergy is measured the information capital accumulated during evolution may be underestimated limiting its usability as the sole measure of es an example of this can be seen in tree plantations planted in grasslands which can produce more biomass than the original biotic community but the genetic information of the range of species that previously occurred on the site is lost unless the species preceding the change can be protected by other means vihervaara et al 2012 2013 however it is notable to remember that odum and pinkerton 1955 proposed the theory that natural systems tend to operate at an efficiency that produces the maximum power output not the maximum efficiency although thermodynamic indicators such as emergy and eco exergy are not yet fully recognized and applied when assessing the environmental performance and sustainability of socioecological systems they can provide valuable information about the development and complexity of ecosystems also with regards to es assessment in particular while emergy allows for the accounting of the work of biosphere done in generating goods and services eco exergy provides information about the complexity of ecosystems in relation to the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in the biomass of living organisms another indicator reflecting the potential for es delivery is the phylogenetic diversity or more generally genetic diversity a clear example showing the importance of genetic diversity in relation to es delivery is found in the case of salmon reproduction in the lake saimaa in finland the indigenous salmon salmo salar saimensis in this lake showed a high number of individuals and related biomass however since their natural reproduction is hindered by the destruction of spawning grounds their gene pool is extremely narrow primmer 2012 as a result the narrowed genetic material reduces variation and exposes the population of salmons to a number of threats such as disease parasites or climate change reducing the potential provision of food related es in addition to the concept of es the introduction of the so called evosystem service concept which refers to maintaining the highest possible evolutionary potential for future options has been proposed faith et al 2010 however the use of phylogenetic diversity alone as an indicator of es remains incomplete since it does not take into account matter and energy flows many new aspects could be brought to the valuation of es by using eco exergy and phylogenetic diversity but neither of them is sufficient on its own a deeper knowledge and the better practical application of other indicators describing biodiversity such as the concept of the essential biodiversity variables pereira et al 2013 would also be important to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem processes exploited by human activities 8 concluding remarks in general conventional market based valuation methods are highly suitable for valuing production services such as agricultural products e g provisioning es their valuation is strongly based on accounting their biomass value or related energy content and the local market price however basing the valuation of regulating and supporting es on scarcity and other market based principles poses some limitations these valuations together with market based variables should also take into account the information content of biodiversity since ecosystem functions and interactions between organisms are highly dependent on this variable the sustainable exploitation of es requires the application of different environmental accounting methods such as emergy and eco exergy so to account for energy flows and information content driving the evolution of natural ecosystems and their structuring and functioning energy and information are the basic variables of nature

25114,human societies are dependent on a large set of ecosystem services es generated by the diversity of life on earth it has been proposed that the negative impact of human societies on ecosystems could be reduced if the economic value of es would be acknowledged however the evaluation of es vital for human well being using traditional economic models following market principles based on the concept of scarcity and regarding es as an intrinsic market structure poses some limitations ecological economics offers an alternative perspective based on the idea that human economy should not exceed the biophysical limits of the planet understanding the economic value of natural resources and es may be effective to optimize the environmental performance at local scale however the sustainable use of natural resources is ultimately a question of understanding the value of the biosphere at different scales from local to global using multiple perspectives and criteria this paper proposes alternative ways of understanding the real significance and value of biodiversity and its links to the generation of es based on thermodynamics and information theory in particular the use of two indicators of ecosystem complexity reflecting the potential for es delivery is suggested information e g genetic diversity and eco exergy e g the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in biomass of living organisms keywords systems ecology thermodynamics biodiversity ecological economy information theory sustainability 1 what is life life on earth is over 3 5 billion years old a long span even on the scale of the universe the traditional biological definition of life is first and foremost based on two fundamental characteristics metabolism and reproduction i e copying and variation living organisms seek to collect and recycle energy and matter from the environment and transfer their genetic information to the next generation the explanation physics gives for the phenomenon we know as life is very simple to consume free energy as rapidly as possible kaila and annila 2008 in systems ecology solar radiation is the basic source of energy for life on earth and biodiversity is the system that evolved to exploit free energy to the maximum level life on earth requires matter and energy flows for its metabolism the bio geo chemical cycles known as regulating and supporting or maintenance services in the es jargon recycle some 30 elements in the earth s internal system of these the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles are fairly well known burgin et al 2011 schlesinger et al 2011 information remains scarce regarding the ecosystem regulating impacts of other substances such as manganese and iron the basic classification of living organisms is based on the sources of energy they utilise several alternative basic metabolism pathways are known in the world of microbes whereas plants and animals are simpler since they gain energy through photosynthesis and the uptake of nutrients and the consumption of biomass along the trophic chain it could be said that the oldest forms of life contain the most divergent information on how to survive in the universe for these organisms the meaning of the concept of species which we mainly attribute to plants and animals is questionable the functional differences between different groups of organisms such as the way they obtain energy are arguably more crucial 2 boltzmann s thermodynamic systems and darwin s theory of information in the second half of the 1800s at around the same time as charles darwin 1809 1882 was publishing his insights on evolution darwin 1859 ludwig boltzmann 1844 1906 was developing an interest in brownian motion and thermodynamics boltzmann was particularly interested in the second law of thermodynamics e g the law of entropy increase under which systems of nature inevitably drift towards collapse and complete disorder towards the heat death of a universe seeking equilibrium on the other hand darwin s view appeared to lead in the opposite direction towards complexity specialisation and the structured order of biological systems boltzmann believed that living organisms were forming organised structures moving away from thermodynamic equilibrium boltzmann 1905 schneider and kay 1995 niels bohr 1885 1962 the creator of the atomic model took an interest in combining physics and biology but his vitalistic views of the forces explaining life have not taken scientists very far in this integrated area of science in the mid 1900s the austrian physicist and nobel prize winner erwin schrödinger 1887 1961 one of the founders of quantum mechanics who was also interested in explaining life was inspired by boltzmann s findings a particular merit of schrödinger s work lies in the fact that he attempted to build a bridge between physics chemistry and biology he summarized his ideas in two fundamental processes that combine heredity and thermodynamics and describe life as order from order and order from disorder schrödinger 1944 schneider and kay 1995 by the theme of order from order he meant the question of how it is possible for organisms to transfer information from one generation to another he used the genes of a fruit fly which were estimated to consist of approximately 1000 atoms as an example schrödinger wondered how it was possible that changes in temperature do not alter such small structures within a cell which remain intact and pass on information to the next generation he thought that such an alteration could only be avoided if the genes were formed of an aperiodic crystal the structure of which contained information written in code schrödinger s prediction proved true when the dna double helix was discovered some ten years later watson and crick 1953 leading to huge advances in molecular biology however either the order from disorder theme has not been fully understood or has not been taken further by this schrödinger meant how it is possible for life to maintain an organised structure despite the fact that according to the second law of thermodynamics i e in light of the expected increase in entropy within a closed system this should be impossible in the long term schrödinger explained this by stating that an organism maintains order by increasing disorder in its external environment hence schrödinger solved the problem by turning to unbalanced thermodynamics in which matter and energy flows between the system and its external environment are important ilya prigogine 1917 2003 who received the nobel prize in chemistry in 1977 for his contributions to research into dissipative structures complex systems and irreversible phenomena mathematically proved how this process is possible on the basis of self organising systems prigogine 1955 a dissipative structure is a thermodynamically open system which usually operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium in an environment with which it exchanges energy and matter in addition to boltzmann and schrödinger definitions of life combining thermodynamics and biology have been presented by the statistician alfred j lotka 1922 who is well known among ecologists claude shannon known as the founder of information theory whose diversity index is well known in ecology shannon and weaver 1949 the odum brothers odum 1959 odum and odum 2000 and jeffrey wicken 1987 lotka 1922 proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation the application of thermodynamics to the study of biotic systems has opened new perspectives for the future study of the sustainability of social ecological systems nielsen and müller 2009 jørgensen et al 2008 jørgensen and svirezhev 2004 schneider and kay 1995 es research conducted on the scale of the biosphere should at least take into account these perspectives furthermore it should be remarked that thermodynamics is considered within the theoretical framework of ecological economics of which nicholas georgescu roegen was one of the founders georgescu roegen 1967 3 exergy free energy and the main features of thermodynamics system is the main concept of thermodynamics a system is an entity separated from its surroundings by actual or notional boundaries according to thermodynamics systems are classified as open closed or isolated depending on whether or not mass and energy pass through their boundaries into the external environment in an isolated system no energy or mass transfer takes place whereas a closed system can exchange energy but not matter with its external environment in an open system as it is the case of living and ecological systems both matter and energy flows can be exchanged with the external environment other essential concepts in thermodynamics are space entropy and exergy i e the maximum useful work that can be generated when a system is brought to thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment the concept of exergy was defined by zoran rant in 1956 but j williard gibbs had already developed the idea in 1873 gibbs 1873 jørgensen and svirezhev 2004 provided a thorough explanation of the use of exergy in the study of thermodynamic ecological systems in accordance with systems theory thermodynamics describes the transformation of state in relation to time as a black box at both the beginning and end of the process unlike statistical physics mechanics thermodynamics does not study the phases of such a transformation i e the micro states of the system but the change in macro state that can be measured using empirical parameters e g pressure temperature boltzmann studied the transformation of ideal gas towards entropy both entropy and the direction of time are simultaneously depicted by the spread of gas particles in space as evenly as possible boltzmann asked whether this approach could be applied to the description of living natural phenomena he saw difficulties in this issue for instance biosphere organisms cannot be compared to particles of ideal gas because the memory and independent choices of each particle influence their behaviour there have been several applications of thermodynamics and exergy concept to study technological systems while fewer studies were focusing on natural and ecological systems another relevant thermodynamic variable for studying energy flows in eco systems is emergy odum 1996 defined the concept of emergy as the available solar energy used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product its unit is the solar emjoule sej odum 1996 emergy can measure both the work of nature and that of humans in generating product and services emergy accounts for natural e g solar radiation wind rain geothermal flow and human driven flows machineries fuels minerals as well as for human labor and economic services the emergy concept is capable of taking into account for not only the amount but also the quality of different forms of energy according to emergy theory solar radiation is the most diluted form of energy while fossil fuels are very concentrated forms of energy resulting from the work of biosphere over millennia the emergy concept has been widely applied to study natural human dominated and man made ecosystems franzese et al 2014 several recent studies applied the emergy concept to assess the value of natural capital and es berrios et al 2017 buonocore et al 2019 franzese et al 2008 2017 picone et al 2017 ulgiati et al 2011 vassallo et al 2017 4 definitions of information what is information can information be exchanged with its surrounding environment the answer to these questions depends on how information is defined from the perspective of the study of natural systems the origin of information lies in physics karnani et al 2009 kullback 1959 according to genetics information can be transferred between two temporally isolated systems furthermore as an evolutionary concept information is intrinsically linked to natural selection better knowledge of the state of the environment and the potential uses of resources than competitors provides an advantage in selection survival of the fittest spencer 1864 in accordance with this darwinian principle ecosystems have evolved towards more complex structures a well matured ecosystem for example an old rainforest where biodiversity is abundant and diverse contains more genetic information than a simple ecosystem for instance a soybean field cleared from the rainforest or a cattle pasture the ability of a mature ecosystem to work effectively in other words to extract energy and materials from the environment and convert them through metabolism into hereditary information is higher than that of a simple ecosystem jørgensen and svirezhev 2004 unfortunately information is a concept that is often used very imprecisely information theory is currently regarded as a branch of applied mathematics which examines the measurement and transfer of information practical applications can be found in areas as varied as molecular biology data compression technology and social phenomena claude shannon is regarded as the inventor of actual information theory although darwin describes the same phenomena in terms of evolution entropy is also considered a measure in information theory this however has led to many misunderstandings since regardless of the identical relations of variables in boltzmann and shannon s mathematical formulas shannon s statistical entropy is not the same as boltzmann s thermodynamic entropy see wicken 1987 pp 18 19 both can be derived from gibbs s original statistical equation the starting point for shannon s definition of entropy is that it is formed from any symbols alphabets which convey information when their order is varied however uncertainty is very different in nature in statistical thermodynamics and information theory in statistical thermodynamics uncertainty is absolute the micro state of a system cannot be precisely known due to stochasticity in information theory uncertainty reduces as and when the alphabet required for the transmission of the message and its meaning become clear boltzmann gibbs entropy formula for irreversible processes is based on the separation of macrostates and microstates but this is not the case in shannon s entropy perhaps the term complexity would better describe shannon s entropy however information theory and thermodynamics inevitably meet in biology there are many ways to classify information considered essential in terms of research on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems taxonomic diversity describes the number and abundance of species and other taxonomic classification levels phylogenetic diversity describes the evolutionary distances between taxa that is the time span required for differentiation from the point of view of valuating information the use of phylogenetic diversity is justified because it even accounts for the temporal dimension faith et al 2010 genetic diversity consists of the double helix codes of dna the related objects of study can include nucleotides alleles chromosomes or genotypes functional diversity refers to variation in the number of functional properties in addition to these methods of measuring diversity include spatio temporal diversity the number of ecological interactions landscape diversity among others naeem et al 2012 5 why does biodiversity increase during the course of the history of life on earth evolution has continuously given rise to new innovations that have led to adaptive radiation that is rapid growth in the number of species confirmed by new selection advantages in the process of natural selection new species most commonly arise as a result of isolation the most famous and first ever documented example of this being darwin s finches on the galápagos islands three main types of speciation are usually classified allopatric which occurs when biological populations of the same species are geographically isolated sympatric when biological populations of the same species inhabit the same geographic region but different ecological niches and parapatric when biological populations of the same species live geographically adjacent to each other speciation can occur relatively rapidly but on the temporal scale of human life the periods of time required are often extremely long one of the main gradients regulating the occurrence of biodiversity on earth is the distance from the equator which naturally is also an indicator of the quantity of solar energy reaching the surface of the earth gaston 2000 however depending on the studied taxa there are countless exceptions and variations to this general rule heino 2011 when diversity is considered from the perspective of physics an increase in diversity is not an end point of a process in itself but occurs when a system is capable in this way of equalising energy differences as rapidly as possible jaakkola et al 2008 however the regional and biogeographical distributions of biodiversity on the globe tend to be regulated by interactions that are much more rapid than speciation dispersion capacity is one of the most important functional characteristics of biodiversity in constantly changing ecosystems since natural disturbances such as occasional drying of shallow water areas or fire and the subsequent succession modify the landscape but this is not the only means certain tree species for example can be extremely inefficient in spreading to new areas in such a case for them the most effective approach in evolutionary terms is to enhance their chances of survival on the site where they happen to appear such survival mechanisms can include focusing on the quality not the quantity of seeds or for instance developing protective chemical compounds that are toxic to herbivores hubbell 2011 presented a summary of the regularities in the biogeographical distribution of biodiversity complemented by thompson 2010 with more recent examples of the presence of biodiversity on a smaller scale at local level at local level the vegetation responsible for basic production largely determines which other species and consumers are present in ecosystems at succeeding levels of the food chain in theory this is simple but in practice biodiversity is highly challenging to be identified mapped and modelled vihervaara et al 2017 in particular the occurrence of vegetation is regulated by the nutrients content and soil ph precipitation and temperature in europe for example the species richness of vegetation is generally greater where the soil ph 7 or more is higher which in turn is associated with lime content while the species variety in acidic soils ph 6 or less is scarcer as it happens in the case of finland the general regularity of a higher ph and richer biodiversity seems clear however in the south african fynbos the australian kwongan and brazilian cerrado ecosystems the opposite is true in fact in these ecosystems biodiversity is highest in the vegetation of acidic sandy soils these examples show that the different evolutionary history of each region including the evolution of biogeochemical cycles is the reason for the richness of diversity thompson 2010 species also benefit if they are able to modify the conditions of the environment to suit them thereby enhancing their competitive advantage for instance spruce in the boreal zone do this by acidifying the soil with their needles and shading the undergrowth in order to favour their own seedlings similar historical processes regulating local biodiversity can in principle be linked around any substance that is circulating in the biosphere heino 2011 summarised the factors affecting the macro ecological occurrence of species in aquatic ecosystems and proved that for some species such as dragonflies fishes and frogs regional species richness follows a classic downward trend by latitude when moving from the equator to the polar circles in the case of fishes which are the best known examples energy and history are the key factors that explain the richness and endemism of a species however in the case of certain species groups stoneflies caddis flies and salamanders recent studies have revealed evidence indicating that their regional distribution does not directly follow the latitude gradient but is based on more complex biogeographical features the definition of regularities in the species richness of aquatic species becomes even more complex when comparing regularities at global regional or local level for instance the effect of the latitudinal gradient is obvious in the case of large water plants at regional level but not on a global scale the significance of latitude in explaining biodiversity also decreases when an attempt is made to explain species richness among different ecosystems local species richness typically has a linear relationship with regional species richness conclusions drawn about the distribution of large scale species richness are generally based on observations of common species whereas rarer species are not included in the research data lennon et al 2011 heino 2011 proposed that in the examination of large scale macro ecological distribution and that of more local scale landscape level meta communities should be combined to gain a better understanding of the factors explaining species richness 6 ecosystem services are benefits to humans generated by life itself es provision and their connection to biodiversity are timely research areas increasingly investigated by the scientific community cardinale et al 2012 häyhä and franzese 2014 mace et al 2012 pauna et al 2018 a widely used approach of categorising es involves their clustering into provisioning services regulating services cultural services and supporting services millennium ecosystem assessment ma 2005 in simple terms es refer to the benefits people obtain from ecosystems or nature s contributions to people díaz et al 2018 this broad multidisciplinary concept has also been criticised and misinterpreted due to the predominant focus on the monetization of es silvertown 2015 despite of that biophysical quantification of es is a key concept in monitoring of the state of social ecological systems at various scales the so called cascade model has gained favour as a way of avoiding such misconceptions haines young and potschin 2010 based on this model the components giving rise to es comprise 1 biodiversity and the structural features of ecosystems 2 the functional properties of ecosystems 3 the benefits gained from them and experienced by people and 4 the valuation of such benefits not only economic but also social health related and moral this grouping defines different domains of the research on es an approach based on es is of great value in reaching a holistic understanding of human nature interactions and social ecological systems life and biodiversity form the basis for es generation the use of information and eco exergy as fundamental variables for their assessment was explored in vihervaara 2013 systems ecological thinking has deep roots in the history of science and the holistic view of ecosystems is recognized as a leading principle cf h t odum s macroscope as detail eliminator when searching for the big picture systems thinking combining biology chemistry and physics has not become the prevailing paradigm in traditional ecological research although important authors have highlighted the opportunities it offers jørgensen 2010 2012 odum 1996 7 including biodiversity in ecosystem services assessment research into es explores human nature interactions and social ecological systems folke et al 2004 odum 1996 odum and odum 2000 due to the impacts of human activities also occurring at planetary scale rockström et al 2009 it would be particularly meaningful to examine the biosphere as a whole system when planning long term sustainability goals the number of species is an indicator whose state should be carefully monitored because negative changes occurring in this indicator loss of biodiversity are irreversible inevitably reducing the delivery of es as the biologist theodosius dobzhansky 1900 1975 said nothing in biology and ecology makes sense except in the light of evolution as a consequence under this perspective es assessment and related policy making should also entail an
