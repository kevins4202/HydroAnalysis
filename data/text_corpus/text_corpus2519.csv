12595,electrocoagulation flotation ecf is able to effectively harvest microcells from eutrophicated drinking water reservoirs to reduce algogenic organic matter aom during cyanobacteria blooming however ecf needs high current density cd and prolonged reaction time with inevitable high energy consumption this study aimed to investigate a novel electrocoagulation flocculation flotation eff process with 10 min ec reaction and 15 min flocculation followed by 10 min flotation for microcystis aeruginosa ma cell harvesting from water as well as aom reduction with al hydrates at various cd and ph conditions the results have shown that significant ma cell separation and dissolved organic carbon doc reduction by eff occurred at ph 8 with 5 ma cm2 accounting for 95 and 56 respectively at such a condition the formation of dominant colloidal al species alc governed the eff to promote cells and aom destabilization by strong sweep flocculation along with weak charge neutralization by polymeric al species alb moreover the pronounced reduction in soluble microbial product like smpl substances could be further improved by up to 60 with eff it was also found that eff required only 2 07 10 2 kwh kg in energy input and served energy saving 63 less than that by prolonged ecf at similar ma cell separations it concluded that eff was an energy efficient technique to fast separate and harvest microcells from ma laden water and aom reduction with low energy input for practical application in drinking water treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microcystis aeruginosa electrocoagulation aluminum hydrates energy input data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction toxic cyanobacteria blooms proliferate in reservoirs when high levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate are present owing to industrial residential and agricultural pollution 1 polluted drinking reservoirs and lakes with adequate sunlight are suitable habitats for blooming 2 during the dry season pollutant nutrients are concentrated in water bodies which increases the cyanobacteria production rate under such conditions reservoir water quality decreases and the risk of drinking water safety increases in drinking water treatment plants dwtps the presence of cyanobacteria laden raw water can burden the operation of water treatment units through increased chemical demand in the oxidation coagulation process and frequent clogging and backwashing of filters or membrane filtration units 2 3 furthermore the presence of released algogenic organic matter aom in the chlorination process in dwtps governs the formation of disinfection by products 4 therefore establishing a cost effective pre treatment process for cell separation and harvesting from cyanobacteria laden water in algal impact dwtps is essential the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation flotation ecf method has been well established particularly its potential in water and wastewater treatment 5 7 owing to its versatility in reducing the risk of secondary contamination as well as cost and time effectiveness electrocoagulation ec is also compatible with methods such as ultrasonic 8 ozone oxidation 9 degradation eo fenton and photocatalyst processes 6 furthermore ecf is effective in algal cell separation with low sludge production and chemical consumption in a short time operation process particularly for cyanobacterial cell harvesting 10 ecf reportedly generates a sludge volume 28 times less than that of traditional chemical coagulation owing to ecf sludge containing limited bound water and requiring low energy input of approximately 1 05 0 14 kwh kg 11 the robustness of ecf system has been proven by its effective microalgae cell separation of more than 95 12 and doc reduction of up to 47 13 al based ecf has been commonly used in drinking water supplies for algal laden water treatment 14 in this case al hydrates during electrochemical process play a critical role in algal cell destabilization monomeric al such as al3 and polymeric al al13 7 contribute to algal cell destabilization through charge neutralization 15 in contrast colloidal al oh 3 incorporates algal cells into large flocs at an alkaline ph via sweep flocculation 14 al based ec undergoes a change of al species during a 5 15 min reaction process where the in situ formed al hydrates effectively control coagulation mechanisms under different ph conditions 16 ec or ecf operation at alkaline ph is effective for destabilizing or harvesting cells for microalgae laden water 11 in achieving high efficiency in algal cell separation or harvesting ecf is mostly applied at a high current density cd and prolonged reaction time nevertheless operating ecf at a high cd would lead to ineffective operation high energy consumption over high al residuals and the occurrence of al residuals is inevitable despite low energy consumption 17 this condition is ineffective in forming flocs during ec process at uncontrolled rapid agitation and would decrease organic pollutants 17 however with proper agitation ec improves particle aggregation to form large flocs with a low density enabling effective flotation of particles or microalgae 18 however energy consumption remains a bottleneck for achieving a cost effective ecf in response to algal cell harvesting few studies have investigated the addition of flocculation to ecf and its impact on cyanobacteria cell separation and harvesting under an energy efficient operation procedure therefore further investigation of additional flocculation process between ec and flotation processes in conventional ecf treatment is required to improve cell separation and floc formation in addition the development of an energy efficient ec like process is required for the efficient harvesting of algal cells in this study a novel ec flocculation system was established for microcystis aeruginosa ma cell separation and harvesting from water moreover the al hydrate transformation during al based ec was investigated to understand its impact on algal cell separation and aom reduction via electrocoagulation flocculation flotation eff at various cds and ph conditions scanning electron microscopy sem was employed in the liquid and dried phases to observe the morphology of the al hydrates and aggregated cells after the eff treatment fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem spectroscopy was used to determine the reduction in the fluorescent aom fractions finally the energy input for the effective harvesting of microcells from ma laden water was estimated at the optimal ph and cd in the eff system and was compared with that of the ecf system 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation the ma strain was cultivated in several 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing sterilized bg 11 medium solution at room temperature 25 1 c as previously described 2 the ma strain was placed in a room with an automatic flash shaker os d series digisystem laboratory instrument inc taiwan and six fluorescent tube lamps t5 8w 6500k jan cheng lighting china providing intermittent light in a day night cycle at 16 8 h the ma cell growth profile was monitored every 4 d using a flow cytometer beckman coulter usa every four days to determine the growth phase during cultivation ma cells were harvested for ma suspension preparation while reaching the exponential phase at a cell density of 1 107 cells ml dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified using an organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan to prepare the desired doc concentration 3 mg l for the ma suspension before each test 2 2 reactor setup in this study all electrochemical experiments were designed and conducted in a rectangular reactor with a standardized jar test as previously described 13 fig s1 the reactor was made of plexiglass lida sci taiwan a pair of alumina al electrodes with an active area of 50 cm2 and an interelectrode gap of approximately 2 cm were connected to a direct current dc supply cps 3205 gophert taiwan a sampling port was located 10 cm below the water surface to avoid interference from the flocs formed in the upper layer during sampling the depth design of port location allows for repeated sample collection the adjustable mixer speed control os20 s dlab scientific china was equipped with a stainless steel single blade paddle connected to a plastic coated stirring rod employed in the middle of the reactor floc imaging camera devices floccam durasens usa were mounted on the reactor wall to observe the floc growth rate commercial sandpaper no 240 julun taiwan was used to rub the electrode surface and it was soaked with 3 hcl honeywell fluka usa within 10 min to prevent persistent contamination on the electrode surface weighed and assembled in the reactor after 1 h of the oven drying process the cleaning procedure for the electrodes was modified as previously described 19 2 3 experimental protocols the 2 4 l ma suspension containing approximately 9 3 9 8 105 cells ml algae cells 3 0 2 mg doc l and 0 01 m naclo4 sigma aldrich darmstadt germany as the background ions was prepared before each test the initial ph of each ma suspension was measured using a digital ph meter hq430d flexi hach usa and adjusted using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh honeywell fluka usa at the desired ph value of 5 7 and 8 at various cds a study reported that 100 rpm for rapid mixing and 20 rpm for slow mixing could achieve the optimum conditions in the coagulation process 20 thus each eff test was started with a 10 min reaction during ec with rapid mixing at 100 rpm thereafter the dc supply was switched off and flocculation was conducted for 15 min with slow mixing at 20 rpm flotation was performed for 10 min in addition ecf without flocculation was conducted under the same operating conditions to calculate its energy input compared with that of eff the operational sequences of the ecf and eff processes are shown in fig s2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 ma cell counting and floc size measurement ma cell density was measured using a flow cytometer beckman coulter usa one milliliter of the sample was filtered through a 70 μm filter nylon membrane biofil china and loaded into a 1 5 ml microtube bioscience usa each cell counting test was performed for 2 min the surface charge of the ma cells was measured using a zeta analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern inc uk the concentration of alumina released during the reaction was quantified using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icpe 9800 series shimadzu japan floc structure and morphology were automatically monitored during flocculation using a jar floc camera floccam durasens usa further observation of the al hydrate structure after ec was conducted using liquid phase sem su8200 hitachi japan with a liquid cell in addition a dried phase sem sem jsm 7600f jeol japan equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to observe the morphology of the ma flocs the acceleration voltage was set to 10 kv and aztec software from oxford instruments was used for data processing 2 4 2 aom analysis all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane advantec japan the doc concentration was measured using an organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the absorbance at 254 nm was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu japan to calculate the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva by dividing uv254 by the doc value the fluorescent organic matter in each doc sample was characterized using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan each sample was separately tested with the excitation wavelength ex set from 200 to 500 nm in 10 nm increments by adjusting the emission spectra em from 250 to 550 nm in 5 nm increments each test was tailored to four different areas soluble microbial product like smpl region i aromatic protein like apl region ii humic acid like hal region iii and fulvic acid like fal region iv detailed specific ex em values for each region were identified as previously described 21 the following equation eq 1 was used to calculate the reduction rates of doc and eem 1 reduction ratio n 0 n t n 0 100 where n o represents the initial value of the original ma suspension and n t is the value of the treated samples after ec electrocoagulation flocculation ef and eff 2 4 3 al species and energy input quantification the al species was quantified using the reaction kinetics between each al species and the ferron assay reagent 22 the absorbance at 366 nm was employed to identify all al species using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1280 shimadzu japan under such conditions monomeric al species ala were assigned the absorbance in the first minute and polymeric al species alb were assigned the absorbance from 1 min to 2 h the colloidal al species alc were calculated by subtracting ala and alb from the total alumina concentration in this study the release of al during the eff process is described by the electrolytic half cell reaction oxidation at the anode this reaction process involves the dissolution of the electrode eq 2 and oxygen evolution near the anode eq 3 simultaneously hydrogen microbubbles are generated at the cathode according to eqs 4 and 5 in the solution the released al forms various hydrates as the ph increases eq 6 eqs 2 6 were developed as previously described 23 anodic reaction 2 al s al aq 3 3 e 3 2 h 2 o aq 2 e o 2 g 4 h cathodic reaction 4 2 h 2 o aq 2 e h 2 g 2 oh neutral

the mixing process at a unit ma cell separation using the following formula 11 7 w e m kwh kg u i t e 36 10 5 v s e c o where w em kwh kg of algae is the energy input per algal biomass u is the

from 0 to 1 and c o is the dry mass of microcystis aeruginosa dry mass was quantified as approximately 7 78 10 2 kg m3 in accordance with the apha standard method 24 the following equation eq 8 was also used to calculate the power input of rapid and slow mixing in the ec and flocculation phases 8 p d i 5 k l t n 3 ρ where p is the energy input for mixing process di is the diameter of the blade k l and k t are impeller constants at slow mixing l and rapid mixing t respectively n is the rotation speed per second and ρ is the specific gravity 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cd and ph on ma cell separation by eff cd and ph had a profound effect on ecf for algal cell harvesting 12 this study first investigated ma cell separation at different current densities 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 during eff at neutral ph fig s3a the cd effect on ma cell separation was insignificant during 10 min ec however a significant cd effect on ma cell separation was observed after flocculation flotation where a cell separation ratio could be achieved up to 93 3 at 5 ma cm2 according to faraday s law increasing cd is proportional to released alumina as a coagulant aid for ma cell destabilization and separation by ec nevertheless as cd increased from 5 to 10 ma cm2 the ma cell separation was lowered to approximately 88 this phenomenon might be associated with al release and zeta potential variations figs s3b and s3c excessive al release results in electrostatic repulsive forces between cells causing weak floc formation and impairing cell separation during eff for further justifying the effect of ph on the ma cell separation during eff at optimal cd eff was conducted at different ph values 5 7 and 8 at 5 ma cm2 fig 1a this showed that the ef phase had an insignificant ma cell separation less than 20 regardless of ph variations however the most effective ma cell separation occurred at ph 8 accounting for 95 in contrast ma cell separation achieved approximately 48 at ph 5 the difference in cell separation efficiency among the various ph conditions was attributed to the transformation of the al species positively charged monomeric al was dominant at ph 5 in the ec process and then formed overcharged cellular surfaces with a zeta potential of 22 3 mv fig 1b under such conditions ineffective ma cell aggregation can easily occur owing to strong repulsion between cells 25 additionally the decrease in the number of oh ions under acidic conditions may reduce the diameter of hydrogen gas generation impairing cell flotation 18 consequently unfavorable ma cell separation was observed at ph 5 in contrast polymeric al and colloidal al can effectively destabilize ma cells by charge neutralization and sweep flocculation at an alkaline ph i e ph 8 16 26 these coagulation behaviors would result in remarkable differences in cell aggregation and floc formation during the eff process as shown in fig 1c the flocs grew rapidly in the first 2 min and their size gradually decreased after the third minute independent of the ph variations the insignificant flocs growth was formed at ph 5 accounting for 123 3 μm in size and the floc size increased up to 222 4 μm at ph 8 this phenomenon is also observed in the findings shown in fig 1b where a significant charge reversal occurred at ph 5 which led to ineffective cell aggregation and floc formation however the presence of insoluble al oh 3 dominates the formation of large flocs at alkaline ph 26 the large flocs provided a large area for the adsorption of ma cells improving the attachment between the bubble gas and flocs in the flotation process figs s4 and s5 these results suggest that the effect of operational ph was more pronounced than that of cd on ma cell separation because of its remarkable impact on al ma floc formation and separation during the eff process 3 2 effect of cd and ph on aom release and reduction by eff aom release and reduction can vary with cd and ph conditions in the eff process for ma cell separation figs s6a and s6b show the aom reduction in terms of doc and suva in each step of eff at ph 7 with varying cds this phenomenon indicated that the eff process removed the increased doc regardless of cd variations although doc decreased from 3 70 to 5 14 mg l after ec the increased doc could be effectively reduced after flocculation flotation up to 68 at 5 ma cm2 where the lowest residual doc concentration at approximately 2 35 mg l was observed however a high cd at 10 ma cm2 led to significant aom release from ma cells during ec and the lowest doc removal after flocculation flotation aom released from ma cells probably increases al consumption and ineffective coagulation which worsens doc removal by flotation 27 additionally the doc sample with a low suva of less than 2 l mg m confirmed that the organic substances in the ma suspension are highly hydrophilic 28 this finding implies that aom removal can be affected by its composition in ma laden water the changes in aom composition in fluorophore substances during eff at different cds at ph 7 are shown in figs s6c f conspicuous increases in all fractions were proportional to the increase in cd applied during ec which contributed to a negative afi reduction of up to 26 30 this may be associated with cell rupture and intracellular aom release in ma suspensions increasing the fluorophore substances 29 however a pronounced reduction in all fluorophore fractions occurred after the flocculation flotation process particularly for the smpl and apl fractions at 5 ma cm2 maximum afi reduction of approximately 56 and 44 were obtained for smpl and apl substances respectively the more efficient reduction in smpl and apl fractions than in the hal and fal fractions could be attributed to the increased molecular weight and strong hydrophobicity of the smpl and apl 30 these results indicate that eff effectively facilitated ma cell separation and aom reduction at 5 ma cm2 to further verify the effect of ph on aom reduction during eff at optimal cd eff was conducted at varying ph 5 7 and 8 at 5 ma cm2 fig 2 the doc concentration increased to 3 91 mg l after ec however doc decreased to a minimum of 2 24 mg l after flocculation flotation where the doc reduction increased as ph increased fig 2a although the released doc reached approximately 30 maximum total doc reduction of approximately 56 was achieved at ph 8 after the flocculation flotation process fig 2b as shown in fig 1 al oh 3 plays an important role in destabilizing aom by sweep flocculation at alkaline ph and charge neutralization dominates aom destabilization at acidic ph 31 the lowest suva occurred at ph 8 fig 2a which indicates the occurrence of hydrophobic compound reduction 28 fluorophore substances were further determined during eff at different ph levels to understand the reduction in aom fractions fig 2c f after ec the afi reduction for all substances varied by ph inconsistent with the doc reduction this phenomenon can be attributed to the quenching effect of al metal ions on aom 32 furthermore a significant afi reduction occurred after flocculation flotation particularly for smpl and apl fractions accounting for 60 and 50 at ph 8 respectively in contrast the afi reduction ratio was as low as 15 at ph 5 under the same conditions sweep flocculation occurring at alkaline ph has been established to be effective in reducing aom fractions with a high molecular weight such as smpl and apl substances 33 34 in summary the eff system at ph of 8 and cd of 5 ma cm2 remarkably reduced the amount of aom in terms of doc and fluorophore organics al hydrate transformation during ec can also significantly affect the aom reduction in the eff system 3 3 effect of al hydrate transformation on ma cell separation and aom reduction the types of al hydrates governed the particle destabilization mechanisms during the ec process 16 ferron assay was used to determine al species after a 10 min ec reaction with cd of 5 ma cm2 at different ph conditions from 5 to 9 fig 3a the operational ph significantly affected the dynamic transformation of al hydrates monomeric al species ala predominantly accounted for approximately 43 at ph 5 and it substantially decreased as ph increased until neutral conditions but increased again in the alkaline ph range unlike monomeric al polymeric al species alb and colloidal al species alc increased with an initial increase in ph however their ratio decreased to a minimum at a highly alkaline ph ph 9 in the highly acidic ph region the ratio of alb to alc reached a minimum and ala presented a maximum level moreover an increase in alb and alc occurred accompanied by a reduced level of ala at alkaline ph 22 in this study alb content occupied the highest ratio of 36 at ph 8 owing to the compensation of decreased alc content to further understand the effect of in situ formed al hydrates on ec mechanisms al species distribution at optimal ph ph 8 for 10 min ec without ma cells was investigated fig 3b in the first 2 min of the reaction ala content increased to 80 within 10 min it decreased to 35 in contrast alb and alc gradually increased as the electrolysis time increased notably ala transformed to either alb or alc in a short ec reaction time another study revealed that alb was the dominant species over 10 min during a longer ec reaction process than that used in this study 16 their result was similar to those shown in fig 3b where alb became dominant after 10 min of ec reaction these results suggest that al hydrate transformation is mostly dependent on ec reaction time in addition al hydrate morphology with and without ma cells after eff at ph 8 was closely observed via sem in the liquid and dried phases as shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively voluminous amorphous al oh 3 precipitates and aggregates are shown as seen in fig 4a and fig 4b a study reported that al oh 3 rich flocs have a porous loose structure with amorphous crystals 22 hydroxo aluminum was adsorbed on the surface of ma cells after eff fig 5b the results of the eds mapping of the al and c fractions also confirmed that the cells and aom reacted with al oh 3 fig 5c these results prove that the occurrence of amorphous al oh 3 precipitates during eff predominantly leads to pronounced ma cell separation and aom reduction by sweep flocculation 30 in summary polymeric al species alb such as al13o4 oh 24 7 al13 are present predominately at ph 8 which further improves the coagulation of the ma suspension by charge neutralization 35 under such conditions abundant ala e g al3 was transformed to alc during the ec reaction to form a large amount of al oh 3 precipitates that were responsible for effective ma cell aggregation and aom reduction by sweep flocculation therefore ec enabled subsequent flotation for cell separation and harvesting fig 2 3 4 comparison between eff and ecf efficiency 3 4 1 ma cell separation a comparative study of the eff and ecf was conducted for ma cell separation fig 6 fig 6a shows that the ma cell reduction after flotation was remarkably different between the eff and ecf eff and ecf had insignificant cell reduction after 10 min of ec reaction and ecf exhibited a more pronounced performance than eff with more than 75 cell reduction as the ec reaction time was prolonged to 20 or 30 min however the cell reduction in either eff or ecf was effectively improved by 95 and 85 after flotation coupled with 10 min of ec reaction respectively however when the ec reaction time was extended to 30 min during ecf i e ecf30 the cell reduction was almost 100 the highest cell separation during ecf30 was caused by the abundance of al released in the ma suspension in response to the strong sweep flocculation in addition fig 6b shows the variations in doc with eff and ecf reactions at different ec times the substantial release of doc occurred at a prolonged ec reaction time because a long ec reaction time significantly damaged the ma cells however eff improved total doc reduction more effectively than ecf after the flotation process although a prolonged ecf i e ecf30 was conducted during the ecf30 process a low doc reduction occurred owing to the release of doc thus flocculation was indispensable and effective in facilitating aom reduction because slow agitation was beneficial for ma floc formation and separation by subsequent flotation 3 4 2 energy input fig 7 shows an analysis of the energy input wem for the eff and ecf operations using eqs 7 and 8 a little more energy input was required for eff with a 10 min ec reaction eff10 than that required for ecf with a 10 min ec reaction ecf10 the eff10 process exhibited a pronounced performance with 95 ma cell separation where it had the lowest energy input of 2 07 10 2 kwh kg however the ecf10 process required an energy input of 3 19 10 2 kwh kg in other words the energy consumption of the eff10 operation is 35 less than that of the ecf10 process this result demonstrates that additional flocculation contributed to enhanced cell destabilization and aggregation lowering the total energy input for more effective cell separation there was lesser energy input in this study for algal cell separation by the manipulation of eff10 than in another study which involved considerably more energy input from 0 2 to 2 28 kwh kg 36 in some cases the separation of microalgae such as chlorella and scenedesmus sp requires substantial energy input ranging from 1 1 to 9 5 kwh kg 37 40 however ma cell separation was improved to approximately 100 by the manipulation of ecf30 but required more than 3 5 times the energy input of the eff10 or ecf10 processes in addition the eff10 process s energy savings was 63 lower than that of the ecf at 20 min ecf20 for similar ma cell separations overall the findings in this study show that the energy input of the eff was considerably less than that of ecf at comparable ma cell separation the results indicate that the eff system outperformed the ecf system in ma cell separation and aom reduction and lowered energy consumption 3 5 proposed al based eff mechanisms fig 8 illustrates the proposed ef mechanisms during eff manipulation at an optimal ph ph 8 and cd of 5 ma cm2 for ma cell separation and aom removal from algae laden water ec began with the release of al ions al3 and then transformed to monomeric al ala and polymeric or colloidal al i e alb and alc in the al hydrolysis process voluminous alc al oh 3 predominately destabilized ma cells by sweep flocculation in response to the transformation of ala and alb to alc small amounts of ala and alb hydrates also contributed to cell destabilization by charge neutralization after flocculation enhanced cell aggregation occurred forming enormous flocs which improved subsequent flotation for cell separation and harvesting this result suggests that the eff system performed ma cell separation and aom reduction through charge neutralization and sweep flocculation synchronously previous studies have clarified that charge neutralization and sweep flocculation are effective in ma cell separation and aom reduction owing to the formation of flocs with low specific density and surface charge 14 41 additionally a limited aom reduction i e doc removal appeared after eff owing to the insignificant formation of alb al13 7 as shown in fig 3 studies have indicated that aom reduction depends on the amount of alb formed during ec and chemical coagulation at alkaline ph 16 42 4 conclusions eff is a novel system with superior efficacy in ma cell separation and doc reduction accounting for 95 and 56 respectively in addition the operational ph was critical for the eff to perform ma cell separation with al hydrates during the ec process polymeric al alb was predominately formed accounting for 36 at ph 8 and the cd of 5 ma cm2 however monomeric al ala enormously formed at the beginning of ec but eventually transformed to colloidal al alc these hydrates outperformed large flocs after flocculation which enabled effective flotation the sem observations proved that eff produced clusters of al hydroxide which promoted ma cell destabilization by strong sweep flocculation along with weak charge neutralization under such conditions the decrease in smpl fractions dominantly contributes to aom reduction it has been demonstrated that eff used an energy input 63 lower than that of ecf at a similar ma cell separation ratio where the energy input and cell separation ratio for eff and ecf were 2 07 10 2 kwh kg at 95 and 5 63 10 2 kwh kg at 91 respectively thus it concluded that eff is an energy efficient system and a potential alternative approach to facilitate the harvesting of microcells from ma laden water and

12595,electrocoagulation flotation ecf is able to effectively harvest microcells from eutrophicated drinking water reservoirs to reduce algogenic organic matter aom during cyanobacteria blooming however ecf needs high current density cd and prolonged reaction time with inevitable high energy consumption this study aimed to investigate a novel electrocoagulation flocculation flotation eff process with 10 min ec reaction and 15 min flocculation followed by 10 min flotation for microcystis aeruginosa ma cell harvesting from water as well as aom reduction with al hydrates at various cd and ph conditions the results have shown that significant ma cell separation and dissolved organic carbon doc reduction by eff occurred at ph 8 with 5 ma cm2 accounting for 95 and 56 respectively at such a condition the formation of dominant colloidal al species alc governed the eff to promote cells and aom destabilization by strong sweep flocculation along with weak charge neutralization by polymeric al species alb moreover the pronounced reduction in soluble microbial product like smpl substances could be further improved by up to 60 with eff it was also found that eff required only 2 07 10 2 kwh kg in energy input and served energy saving 63 less than that by prolonged ecf at similar ma cell separations it concluded that eff was an energy efficient technique to fast separate and

nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate are present owing to industrial residential and agricultural pollution 1 polluted drinking reservoirs and lakes with adequate sunlight are suitable habitats for blooming 2 during the dry season pollutant nutrients are concentrated in water bodies which increases the cyanobacteria production rate under such conditions reservoir water quality decreases and the risk of drinking water safety increases in drinking water treatment plants dwtps the presence of cyanobacteria laden raw water can burden the operation of water treatment units through increased chemical demand in the oxidation coagulation process and frequent clogging and backwashing of filters or membrane filtration units 2 3 furthermore the presence of released algogenic organic matter aom in the chlorination process in dwtps governs the formation of disinfection by products 4 therefore establishing a cost effective pre treatment process for cell separation and harvesting from cyanobacteria laden water in algal impact dwtps is essential the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation flotation ecf method has been well established particularly its potential in water and wastewater treatment 5 7 owing to its versatility in reducing the risk of secondary contamination as well as cost and time effectiveness electrocoagulation ec is also compatible with methods such as ultrasonic 8 ozone oxidation 9 degradation eo fenton and photocatalyst processes 6 furthermore ecf is effective in algal cell separation with low sludge production and chemical consumption in a short time operation process particularly for cyanobacterial cell harvesting 10 ecf reportedly generates a sludge volume 28 times less than that of traditional chemical coagulation owing to ecf sludge containing limited bound water and requiring low energy input of approximately 1 05 0 14 kwh kg 11 the robustness of ecf system has been proven by its effective microalgae cell separation of more than 95 12 and doc reduction of up to 47 13 al based ecf has been commonly used in drinking water supplies for algal laden water treatment 14 in this case al hydrates during electrochemical process play a critical role in algal cell destabilization monomeric al such as al3 and polymeric al al13 7 contribute to algal cell destabilization through charge neutralization 15 in contrast colloidal al oh 3 incorporates algal cells into large flocs at an alkaline ph via sweep flocculation 14 al based ec undergoes a change of al species during a 5 15 min reaction process where the in situ formed al hydrates effectively control coagulation mechanisms under different ph conditions 16 ec or ecf operation at alkaline ph is effective for destabilizing or harvesting cells for microalgae laden water 11 in achieving high efficiency in algal cell separation or harvesting ecf is mostly applied at a high current density cd and prolonged reaction time nevertheless operating ecf at a high cd would lead to ineffective operation high energy consumption over high al residuals and the occurrence of al residuals is inevitable despite low energy consumption 17 this condition is ineffective in forming flocs during ec process at uncontrolled rapid agitation and would decrease organic pollutants 17 however with proper agitation ec improves particle aggregation to form large flocs with a low density enabling effective flotation of particles or microalgae 18 however energy consumption remains a bottleneck for achieving a cost effective ecf in response to algal cell harvesting few studies have investigated the addition of flocculation to ecf and its impact on cyanobacteria cell separation and harvesting under an energy efficient operation procedure therefore further investigation of additional flocculation process between ec and flotation processes in conventional ecf treatment is required to improve cell separation and floc formation in addition the development of an energy efficient ec like process is required for the efficient harvesting of algal cells in this study a novel ec flocculation system was established for microcystis aeruginosa ma cell separation and harvesting from water moreover the al hydrate transformation during al based ec was investigated to understand its impact on algal cell separation and aom reduction via electrocoagulation flocculation flotation eff at various cds and ph conditions scanning electron microscopy sem was employed in the liquid and dried phases to observe the morphology of the al hydrates and aggregated cells after the eff treatment fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem spectroscopy was used to determine the reduction in the fluorescent aom fractions finally the energy input for the effective harvesting of microcells from ma laden water was estimated at the optimal ph and cd in the eff system and was compared with that of the ecf system 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation the ma strain was cultivated in several 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing sterilized bg 11 medium solution at room temperature 25 1 c as previously described 2 the ma strain was placed in a room with an automatic flash shaker os d series digisystem laboratory instrument inc taiwan and six fluorescent tube lamps t5 8w 6500k jan cheng lighting china providing intermittent light in a day night cycle at 16 8 h the

preparation while reaching the exponential phase at a cell density of 1 107 cells ml dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified using an organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan to prepare the desired doc concentration 3 mg l for the ma suspension before each test 2 2 reactor setup in this study all electrochemical experiments were designed and conducted in a rectangular reactor with a standardized jar test as previously described 13 fig s1 the reactor was made of plexiglass lida sci taiwan a pair of alumina al electrodes with an active area of 50 cm2 and an interelectrode gap of approximately 2 cm were connected to a direct current dc supply cps 3205 gophert taiwan a sampling port was located 10 cm below the water surface to avoid interference from the flocs formed in the upper layer during sampling the depth design of port location allows for repeated sample collection the adjustable mixer speed control os20 s dlab scientific china was equipped with a stainless steel single blade paddle connected to a plastic coated stirring rod employed in the middle of the reactor floc imaging camera devices floccam durasens usa were mounted on the reactor wall to observe the floc growth rate commercial sandpaper no 240 julun taiwan was used to rub the electrode surface and it was soaked with 3 hcl honeywell fluka usa within 10 min to prevent persistent contamination on the electrode surface weighed and assembled in the reactor after 1 h of the oven drying process the cleaning procedure for the electrodes was modified as previously described 19 2 3 experimental protocols the 2 4 l ma suspension containing approximately 9 3 9 8 105 cells ml algae cells 3 0 2 mg doc l and 0 01 m naclo4 sigma aldrich darmstadt germany as the background ions was prepared before each test the initial ph of each ma suspension was measured using a digital ph meter hq430d flexi hach usa and adjusted using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh honeywell fluka usa at the desired ph value of 5 7 and 8 at various cds a study reported that 100 rpm for rapid mixing and 20 rpm for slow mixing could achieve the optimum conditions in the coagulation process 20 thus each eff test was started with a 10 min reaction during ec with rapid mixing at 100 rpm thereafter the dc supply was switched off and flocculation was conducted for 15 min with slow mixing at 20 rpm flotation was performed for 10 min in addition ecf without flocculation was conducted under the same operating conditions to calculate its energy input compared with that of eff the operational sequences of the ecf and eff processes are shown in fig s2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 ma cell counting and floc size measurement ma cell density was measured using a flow cytometer beckman coulter usa one milliliter of the sample was filtered through a 70 μm filter nylon membrane biofil china and loaded into a 1 5 ml microtube bioscience usa each cell counting test was performed for 2 min the surface charge of the ma cells was measured using a zeta analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern inc uk the concentration of alumina released during the reaction was quantified using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icpe 9800 series shimadzu japan floc structure and morphology were automatically monitored during flocculation using a jar floc camera floccam durasens usa further observation of the al hydrate structure after ec was conducted using liquid phase sem su8200 hitachi japan with a liquid cell in addition a dried phase sem sem jsm 7600f jeol japan equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to observe the morphology of the ma flocs the acceleration voltage was set to 10 kv and aztec software from oxford instruments was used for data processing 2 4 2 aom analysis all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane advantec japan the doc concentration was measured using an organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the absorbance at 254 nm was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu japan to calculate the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva by dividing uv254 by the doc value the fluorescent organic matter in each doc sample was characterized using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan each sample was separately tested with the excitation wavelength ex set from 200 to 500 nm in 10 nm increments by adjusting the emission spectra em from 250 to 550 nm in 5 nm increments each test was tailored to four different areas soluble microbial product like smpl region i aromatic protein like apl region ii humic acid like hal region iii and fulvic acid like fal region iv detailed specific ex em values for each region were identified as previously described 21 the following equation eq 1 was used to calculate the reduction rates of doc and eem 1 reduction ratio n 0 n t n 0 100 where n o represents the initial value of the original ma suspension and n t is the value of the treated samples after ec electrocoagulation flocculation ef and eff 2 4 3 al species and energy input quantification the al species was quantified using the reaction kinetics between each al species and the ferron assay reagent 22 the absorbance at 366 nm was employed to identify all al species using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1280 shimadzu japan under such conditions monomeric al species ala were assigned the absorbance in the first minute and polymeric al species alb were assigned the absorbance from 1 min to 2 h the colloidal al species alc were calculated by subtracting ala and alb from the total alumina concentration in this study the release of al during the eff process is described by the electrolytic half cell reaction oxidation at the anode this reaction process involves the dissolution of the electrode eq 2 and oxygen evolution near the anode eq 3 simultaneously hydrogen microbubbles are generated at the cathode according to eqs 4 and 5 in the solution the released al forms various hydrates as the ph increases eq 6 eqs 2 6 were developed as previously described 23 anodic reaction 2 al s al aq 3 3 e 3 2 h 2 o aq 2 e o 2 g 4 h cathodic reaction 4 2 h 2 o aq 2 e h 2 g 2 oh neutral or alkaline conditions 5 2 h 2 e h 2 g acidic condition 6 al aq 3 al oh 2 aq al 13 aq al oh 3 s al oh 4 increase in ph energy input was determined by calculating total energy consumption during ec and the mixing process at a unit ma cell separation using the following formula 11 7 w e m kwh kg u i t e 36 10 5 v s e c o where w em kwh kg of algae is the energy input per algal biomass u is the voltage i is the current t e is the electrolysis time 36 105 is expressed as 1 kwh 3 600 000 j vs is the volume of ma suspension in each test e is the corresponding ma cell separation efficiency scale from 0 to 1 and c o is the dry mass of microcystis aeruginosa dry mass was quantified as approximately 7 78 10 2 kg m3 in accordance with the apha standard method 24 the following equation eq 8 was also used to calculate the power input of rapid and slow mixing in the ec and flocculation phases 8 p d i 5 k l t n 3 ρ where p is the energy input for mixing process di is the diameter of the blade k l and k t are impeller constants at slow mixing l and rapid mixing t respectively n is the rotation speed per second and ρ is the specific gravity 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cd and ph on ma cell separation by eff cd and ph had a profound effect on ecf for algal cell harvesting 12 this study first investigated ma cell separation at different current densities 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 during eff at neutral ph fig s3a the cd effect on ma cell separation was insignificant during 10 min ec however a significant cd effect on ma cell separation was observed after flocculation flotation where a cell separation ratio could be achieved up to 93 3 at 5 ma cm2 according to faraday s law increasing cd is proportional to released alumina as a coagulant aid for ma cell destabilization and separation by ec nevertheless as cd increased from 5 to 10 ma cm2 the ma cell separation was lowered to approximately 88 this phenomenon might be associated with al release and zeta potential variations figs s3b and s3c excessive al release results in electrostatic repulsive forces between cells causing weak floc formation and impairing cell separation during eff for further justifying the effect of ph on the ma cell separation during eff at optimal cd eff was conducted at different ph values 5 7 and 8 at 5 ma cm2 fig 1a this showed that the ef phase had an insignificant ma cell separation less than 20 regardless of ph variations however the most effective ma cell separation occurred at ph 8 accounting for 95 in contrast ma cell separation achieved approximately 48 at ph 5 the difference in cell separation efficiency among the various ph conditions was attributed to the transformation of the al species positively charged monomeric al was dominant at ph 5 in the ec process and then formed overcharged cellular surfaces with a zeta potential of 22 3 mv fig 1b under such conditions ineffective ma cell aggregation can easily occur owing to strong repulsion between cells 25 additionally the decrease in the number of oh ions under acidic conditions may reduce the diameter of hydrogen gas generation impairing cell flotation 18 consequently unfavorable ma cell separation was observed at ph 5 in contrast polymeric al and colloidal al can effectively destabilize ma cells by charge neutralization and sweep flocculation at an alkaline ph i e ph 8 16 26 these coagulation behaviors would result in remarkable differences in cell aggregation and floc formation during the eff process as shown in fig 1c the flocs grew rapidly in the first 2 min and their size gradually decreased after the third minute independent of the ph variations the insignificant flocs growth was formed at ph 5 accounting for 123 3 μm in size and the floc size increased up to 222 4 μm at ph 8 this phenomenon is also observed in the findings shown in fig 1b where a significant charge reversal occurred at ph 5 which led to ineffective cell aggregation and floc formation however the presence of insoluble al oh 3 dominates the formation of large flocs at alkaline ph 26 the large flocs provided a large area for the adsorption of ma cells improving the attachment between the bubble gas and flocs in the flotation process figs s4 and s5 these results suggest that the effect of operational ph was more pronounced than that of cd on ma cell separation because of its remarkable impact on al ma floc formation and separation during the eff process 3 2 effect of cd and ph on aom release and reduction by eff aom release and reduction can vary with cd and ph conditions in the eff process for ma cell separation figs s6a and s6b show the aom reduction in terms of doc and suva in each step of eff at ph 7 with varying cds this phenomenon indicated that the eff process removed the increased doc regardless of cd variations although doc decreased from 3 70 to 5 14 mg l after ec the increased doc could be effectively reduced after flocculation flotation up to 68 at 5 ma cm2 where the lowest residual doc concentration at approximately 2 35 mg l was observed however a high cd at 10 ma cm2 led to significant aom release from ma cells during ec and the lowest doc removal after flocculation flotation aom released from ma cells probably increases al consumption and ineffective coagulation which worsens doc removal by flotation 27 additionally the doc sample with a low suva of less than 2 l mg m confirmed that the organic substances in the ma suspension are highly hydrophilic 28 this finding implies that aom removal can be affected by its composition in ma laden water the changes in aom composition in fluorophore substances during eff at different cds at ph 7 are shown in figs s6c f conspicuous increases in all fractions were proportional to the increase in cd applied during ec which contributed to a negative afi reduction of up to 26 30 this may be associated with cell rupture and intracellular aom release in ma suspensions increasing the fluorophore substances 29 however a pronounced reduction in all fluorophore fractions occurred after the flocculation flotation process particularly for the smpl and apl fractions at 5 ma cm2 maximum afi reduction of approximately 56 and 44 were obtained for smpl and apl substances respectively the more efficient reduction in smpl and apl fractions than in the hal and fal fractions could be attributed to the increased molecular weight and strong hydrophobicity of the smpl and apl 30 these results indicate that eff effectively facilitated ma cell separation and aom reduction at 5 ma cm2 to further verify the effect of ph on aom reduction during eff at optimal cd eff was conducted at varying ph 5 7 and 8 at 5 ma cm2 fig 2 the doc concentration increased to 3 91 mg l after ec however doc decreased to a minimum of 2 24 mg l after flocculation flotation where the doc reduction increased as ph increased fig 2a although the released doc reached approximately 30 maximum total doc reduction of approximately 56 was achieved at ph 8 after the flocculation flotation process fig 2b as shown in fig 1 al oh 3 plays an important role in destabilizing aom by sweep flocculation at alkaline ph and charge neutralization dominates aom destabilization at acidic ph 31 the lowest suva occurred at ph 8 fig 2a which indicates the occurrence of hydrophobic compound reduction 28 fluorophore substances were further determined during eff at different ph levels to understand the reduction in aom fractions fig 2c f after ec the afi reduction for all substances varied by ph inconsistent with the doc reduction this phenomenon can be attributed to the quenching effect of al metal ions on aom 32 furthermore a significant afi reduction occurred after flocculation flotation particularly for smpl and apl fractions accounting for 60 and 50 at ph 8 respectively in contrast the afi reduction ratio was as low as 15 at ph 5 under the same conditions sweep flocculation occurring at alkaline ph has been established to be effective in reducing aom fractions with a high molecular weight such as smpl and apl substances 33 34 in summary the eff system at ph of 8 and cd of 5 ma cm2 remarkably reduced the amount of aom in terms of doc and fluorophore organics al hydrate transformation during ec can also significantly affect the aom reduction in the eff system 3 3 effect of al hydrate transformation on ma cell separation and aom reduction the types of al hydrates governed the particle destabilization mechanisms during the ec process 16 ferron assay was used to determine al species after a 10 min ec reaction with cd of 5 ma cm2 at different ph conditions from 5 to 9 fig 3a the operational ph significantly affected the dynamic transformation of al hydrates monomeric al species ala predominantly accounted for approximately 43 at ph 5 and it substantially decreased as ph increased until neutral conditions but increased again in the alkaline ph range unlike monomeric al polymeric al species alb and colloidal al species alc increased with an initial increase in ph however their ratio decreased to a minimum at a highly alkaline ph ph 9 in the highly acidic ph region the ratio of alb to alc reached a minimum and ala presented a maximum level moreover an increase in alb and alc occurred accompanied by a reduced level of ala at alkaline ph 22 in this study alb content occupied the highest ratio of 36 at ph 8 owing to the compensation of decreased alc content to further understand the effect of in situ formed al hydrates on ec mechanisms al species distribution at optimal ph ph 8 for 10 min ec without ma cells was investigated fig 3b in the first 2 min of the reaction ala content increased to 80 within 10 min it decreased to 35 in contrast alb and alc gradually increased as the electrolysis time increased notably ala transformed to either alb or alc in a short ec reaction time another study revealed that alb was the dominant species over 10 min during a longer ec reaction process than that used in this study 16 their result was similar to those shown in fig 3b where alb became dominant after 10 min of ec reaction these results suggest that al hydrate transformation is mostly dependent on ec reaction time in addition al hydrate morphology with and without ma cells after eff at ph 8 was closely observed via sem in the liquid and dried phases as shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively voluminous amorphous al oh 3 precipitates and aggregates are shown as seen in fig 4a and fig 4b a study reported that al oh 3 rich flocs have a porous loose structure with amorphous crystals 22 hydroxo aluminum was adsorbed on the surface of ma cells after eff fig 5b the results of the eds mapping of the al and c fractions also confirmed that the cells and aom reacted with al oh 3 fig 5c these results prove that the occurrence of amorphous al oh 3 precipitates during eff predominantly leads to pronounced ma cell separation and aom reduction by sweep flocculation 30 in summary polymeric al species alb such as al13o4 oh 24 7 al13 are present predominately at ph 8 which further improves the coagulation of the ma suspension by charge neutralization 35 under such conditions abundant ala e g al3 was transformed to alc during the ec reaction to form a large amount of al oh 3 precipitates that were responsible for effective ma cell aggregation and aom reduction by sweep flocculation therefore ec enabled subsequent flotation for cell separation and harvesting fig 2 3 4 comparison between eff and ecf efficiency 3 4 1 ma cell separation a comparative study of the eff and ecf was conducted for ma cell separation fig 6 fig 6a shows that the ma cell reduction after flotation was remarkably different between the eff and ecf eff and ecf had insignificant cell reduction after 10 min of ec reaction and ecf exhibited a more pronounced performance than eff with more than 75 cell reduction as the ec reaction time was prolonged to 20 or 30 min however the cell reduction in either eff or ecf was effectively improved by 95 and 85 after flotation coupled with 10 min of ec reaction respectively however when the ec reaction time was extended to 30 min during ecf i e ecf30 the cell reduction was almost 100 the highest cell separation during ecf30 was caused by the abundance of al released in the ma suspension in response to the strong sweep flocculation in addition fig 6b shows the variations in doc with eff and ecf reactions at different ec times the substantial release of doc occurred at a prolonged ec reaction time because a long ec reaction time significantly damaged the ma cells however eff improved total doc reduction more effectively than ecf after the flotation process although a prolonged ecf i e ecf30 was conducted during the ecf30 process a low doc reduction occurred owing to the release of doc thus flocculation was indispensable and effective in facilitating aom reduction because slow agitation was beneficial for ma floc formation and separation by subsequent flotation 3 4 2 energy input fig 7 shows an analysis of the energy input wem for the eff and ecf operations using eqs 7 and 8 a little more energy input was required for eff with a 10 min ec reaction eff10 than that required for ecf with a 10 min ec reaction ecf10 the eff10 process exhibited a pronounced performance with 95 ma cell separation where it had the lowest energy input of 2 07 10 2 kwh kg however the ecf10 process required an energy input of 3 19 10 2 kwh kg in other words the energy consumption of the eff10 operation is 35 less than that of the ecf10 process this result demonstrates that additional flocculation contributed to enhanced cell destabilization and aggregation lowering the total energy input for more effective cell separation there was lesser energy input in this study for algal cell separation by the manipulation of eff10 than in another study which involved considerably more energy input from 0 2 to 2 28 kwh kg 36 in some cases the separation of microalgae such as chlorella and scenedesmus sp requires substantial energy input ranging from 1 1 to 9 5 kwh kg 37 40 however ma cell separation was improved to approximately 100 by the manipulation of ecf30 but required more than 3 5 times the energy input of the eff10 or ecf10 processes in addition the eff10 process s energy savings was 63 lower than that of the ecf at 20 min ecf20 for similar ma cell separations overall the findings in this study show that the energy input of the eff was considerably less than that of ecf at comparable ma cell separation the results indicate that the eff system outperformed the ecf system in ma cell separation and aom reduction and lowered energy consumption 3 5 proposed al based eff mechanisms fig 8 illustrates the proposed ef mechanisms during eff manipulation at an optimal ph ph 8 and cd of 5 ma cm2 for ma cell separation and aom removal from algae laden water ec began with the release of al ions al3 and then transformed to monomeric al ala and polymeric or colloidal al i e alb and alc in the al hydrolysis process voluminous alc al oh 3 predominately destabilized ma cells by sweep flocculation in response to the transformation of ala and alb to alc small amounts of ala and alb hydrates also contributed to cell destabilization by charge neutralization after flocculation enhanced cell aggregation occurred forming enormous flocs which improved subsequent flotation for cell separation and harvesting this result suggests that the eff system performed ma cell separation and aom reduction through charge neutralization and sweep flocculation synchronously previous studies have clarified that charge neutralization and sweep flocculation are effective in ma cell separation and aom reduction owing to the formation of flocs with low specific density and surface charge 14 41 additionally a limited aom reduction i e doc removal appeared after eff owing to the insignificant formation of alb al13 7 as shown in fig 3 studies have indicated that aom reduction depends on the amount of alb formed during ec and chemical coagulation at alkaline ph 16 42 4 conclusions eff is a novel system with superior efficacy in ma cell separation and doc reduction accounting for 95 and 56 respectively in addition the operational ph was critical for the eff to perform ma cell separation with al hydrates during the ec process polymeric al alb was predominately formed accounting for 36 at ph 8 and the cd of 5 ma cm2 however monomeric al ala enormously formed at the beginning of ec but eventually transformed to colloidal al alc these hydrates outperformed large flocs after flocculation which enabled effective flotation the sem observations proved that eff produced clusters of al hydroxide which promoted ma cell destabilization by strong sweep flocculation along with weak charge neutralization under such conditions the decrease in smpl fractions dominantly contributes to aom reduction it has been demonstrated that eff used an energy input 63 lower than that of ecf at a similar ma cell separation ratio where the energy input and cell separation ratio for eff and ecf were 2 07 10 2 kwh kg at 95 and 5 63 10 2 kwh kg at 91 respectively thus it concluded that eff is an energy efficient system and a potential alternative approach to facilitate the harvesting of microcells from ma laden water and aom reduction for practical application in drinking water treatment credit authorship contribution statement jr lin lin conceptualization resources visualization writing original draft writing review

12596,in this study a novel silver phosphate zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was fabricated at room temperature using the chemical precipitation method the photocatalytic properties of the developed p n heterojunction were investigated with respect to organic water pollutants the effects of the operation parameters on the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated photocatalyst were also studied the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic properties with respect to organic pollutants crystal violet cv congo red cr and rhodamine b rh b the total organic carbon toc measurements revealed that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction mineralized 99 0 of rh b 90 7 of cv and 94 7 of cr in 120 min the heterojunction also exhibited excellent cyclic stability which is crucial for practical applications the excellent photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction could be ascribed to the suppression of the photogenerated charge recombination enhancement of the surface area p n heterojunction formation and extended light absorption therefore the developed heterojunction is promising for environmental remediation in general and for photocatalysis based treatment of organic pollutant containing wastewater in particular keywords mof photocatalysis organic pollutants ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction mineralization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction energy crisis and environmental pollution are among the most urgent problems facing the world 1 2 water pollution owing to industrial discharge and urbanization requires immediate action for maintaining environmental safety 3 4 various methods such as adsorption chemical reaction based methods biodegradation and photocatalysis have been developed for wastewater treatment 5 6 among these photocatalysis that uses solar light is considered as a potential candidate due to its simplicity eco friendliness abundance of solar energy and effectiveness 7 10 this approach can also be used to remove low concentration pollutants from water bodies which cannot be achieved using other methods 5 previously various photocatalysts such as but not limited to tio2 w18o49 fe3o4 zno g c3n4 and ag3vo4 have been developed and have demonstrated outstanding photocatalytic activity with respect to inorganic and organic pollutants alike 1 5 7 11 16 however their practical applicability suffers from low quantum yield limited range absorption of solar light fast electron hole recombination rate poor cyclic stability and photocorrosion 5 therefore effective efficient stable eco friendly and solar light absorbing photocatalysts are needed recently metal organic frameworks mofs have attracted significant attention as an emerging class of porous materials due to their adjustable pore size and shape diverse structure and large surface area 5 owing to these interesting properties these materials have been used in different applications including adsorption and separation supercapacitors drug delivery and photocatalysis 17 19 among these applications mofs are promising for photocatalysis based h2 production degradation of organic pollutants carbon dioxide co2 reduction and removal of heavy metals 19 21 nevertheless most of the developed materials suffer from low stability in aqueous solutions limited optical absorption and high cost which hinders their practical applications in photocatalysis 19 thus looking for stable low cost and photocatalyst with excellent optical activity is mandatory zeolite like imidazole skeleton materials zifs are mofs with zeolite skeleton structures that are produced by reactions in solvents with co or zn as metal sources and imidazole derivatives or imidazole as organic ligands 22 zif 8 constructed from zn ii and 2 methyl imidazole ligands exhibits excellent water stability high surface area and regular pores it has been used in various fields such as the knoevenagel reaction friedel crafts acylation and photocatalysis 23 25 various zif 8 based nanocomposite photocatalysts including but not limited to zno zif 8 zn2geo4 zif 8 tio2 zif 8 znins zif 8 and mno2 zif 8 26 30 have been developed nevertheless their use in real practical application is hindered by their low quantum yield low optical activity high cost low eco friendliness and fast electron hole recombination 31 34 therefore zif 8 based effective eco friendly and stable photocatalysts are crucial for practical wastewater treatment by photocatalysis previously different strategies such as the z scheme 35 37 s scheme 38 41 and p n heterojunction formation 42 43 have been developed to improve the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts among these p n heterojunction formation has been promising 44 this approach suppresses the photogenerated charge carrier s recombinations rate owing to the development of an internal electric field 45 in this regard zif 8 is an n type semiconductor 46 that can form p n heterojunctions with suitable p type semiconductors for effective photocatalytic performance 47 therefore it is very important select proper p type semiconductor that can for make p n heterojunction with it interestingly silver orthophosphate ag3po4 is p type semiconductor and it has got huge consideration in wastewater treatment due to its excellent visible light absorption 48 50 nevertheless it suffers from photo corrosion that is caused by photogenerated electrons that hinders its practical application for wastewater treatment in its pure form 48 interestingly different researchers have found that the photo corrosion property of ag3po4 can be suppressed thus its photocatalytic performance and cyclic stability can be improved by nanocomposite formation 51 53 p n heterojunction formation 54 56 and doping 57 59 with suitable materials among these techniques p n heterojunction formation is promising especially when the other material is an mof material that can serve as an adsorption site for pollutants in addition to its charge separation enhancement and photo corrosion suppression which improves its photocatalytic performance 60 therefore zif 8 is a potential material to form p n heterojunction with ag3po4 and was chosen in this study herein taking into account the abovementioned advantages of ag3o4 and zif 8 a novel ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was synthesized using chemical precipitation at room temperature 30 1 c for the first time the photocatalytic activity of the developed photocatalyst with respect to organic pollutants such as crystal violet cv congo red cr and rhodamine b rh b was investigated in response to the visible light illumination the effects of the operation parameters namely the ph catalyst dosage and pollutant concentration on the photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction were also studied systematically the degree of pollutant mineralization by the developed photocatalyst was evaluated based on the total organic carbon toc content a possible reaction for the photodegradation of organic pollutants was also proposed based on the findings 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no₃ ₂ 6h2o 99 was obtained from sigma aldrich 2 methylimidazole 2 mim 98 was bought from nova materials co ltd sliver nitrate agno3 99 8 was purchased from honeywell fluka sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous na2hpo4 99 was purchased from showa chemical industry co ltd methyl alcohol meoh 99 9 was purchased from fisher scientific nafion perfluorinated resin solution 5 wt in lower aliphatic alcohols and water contains 15 20 water was purchased from sigma aldrich sodium hydroxide naoh 98 was purchased from fisher scientific chloroacetic acid sodium salt rhodamin b congo red and crystal violet all of them are analytical reagent grade quality and were purchased from acros organics all materials are used as received without further purification 2 2 preparation of zif 8 the zif 8 photocatalyst was synthesized as described previously 61 62 in particular 25 mm and 50 mm aqueous solutions of zinc nitrate and 2 methyl imidazole were prepared separately the 2 methyl imidazole solution was then added dropwise to the zinc nitrate solution and stirred for 4 h the obtained product was washed three times with deionized water di h2o and dried at 80 c for 8 h 2 3 synthesis of ag3o4 zif 8 p n heterojunctions the ag3o4 zif 8 p n heterojunctions were prepared as follows the prepared zif 8 0 05 g and agno3 2 7 g were added to 40 ml of di h2o and stirred for 10 min then 40 ml of the 0 2 m na2hpo4 aqueous solution was added to the above mixture and stirred for 5 h finally the obtained precipitate was washed with di h2o and dried for 8 h at 80 c pure ag3o4 was also fabricated using the same method without the addition of zif 8 63 2 4 photocatalytic property study to study the photocatalytic performance of the developed photocatalyst different organic wastewater pollutants such as rh b cv and cr was selected to investigate its universal applicability toward different pollutants for the studies of photocatalytic properties 20 mg of the photocatalyst and 50 ml of 20 ppm were added to a 250 ml volume pyrex glass container before light irradiation the solution and photocatalyst were stirred for 30 min in the dark to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the adsorption of a pollutant by a photocatalyst is very important for effective photocatalysis 6 64 because photocatalysis occurs on the surface of a photocatalyst the photodegradation efficiency is largely affected by the surface properties 65 66 photocatalysts with good adsorption properties collect more pollutants on their surfaces making it easier to photodegrade the pollutants which improves the photocatalysts photocatalytic efficiency 65 67 68 therefore the adsorption property was investigated first and then visible light was irradiated on it using a 500 w xe lamp prosper optoelectronic co ltd taiwan of wavelength 250 nm to 2500 nm with filter of 400 780 nm the distance from the lamp to the reactor was 35 cm and the optical intensity of the irradiated light was 1 kw m2 three milliliters of the solution were taken at each 15 min and centrifuged to separate the photocatalyst from the solution the concentrations of the pollutants in the solution were determined using ultraviolet visual uv vis spectrometry 69 moreover the kinetics of the photocatalytic properties of the fabricated samples were studied by fitting the obtained data to a kinetic equation ln ct co kt for the pseudo first order reaction rate 1 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem image in fig 1a shows that the developed zif 8 were hexagonal with diameters in the 300 400 nm range the fabricated ag3po4 were nanoparticles with diameters in the 100 150 nm range and length of several nanometers fig 1b the finding in fig 1c shows that only the ag3po4 structures were present on the surface of the 1 composite because the zif 8 content was smaller and became easily covered with ag3po4 in fig 1d the ag3po4 nanoparticles are dispersed on hexagonal zif 8 confirming good contact between the two materials which is important for effective synergistic photocatalysis fig 1e shows some exposed structures of zif 8 crystals and some ag3po4 attached to the zif 8 surfaces in addition the chemical composition of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was also characterized using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fig 1f shows that ag o p zn and c were present in the heterojunction besides the actual elemental mass and atomic weight percentage composition of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were nearly the same as the theoretical percentages of the different elements in the intended heterojunction fig 1f inset confirming its successful synthesis the surface crystal structures of the developed photocatalysts were investigated using x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 2a shows that zif 8 exhibited diffraction peaks at 2θ of 7 38 10 44 12 75 14 72 16 45 and 18 02 that were attributed to the 011 002 112 022 013 and 222 crystal planes of zif 8 71 the diffraction peaks of ag3po4 were attributed to body centered cubic ag3po4 jspds no 00 006 0505 72 the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibited the characteristic peaks of both ag3po4 and zif 8 and no additional peaks were observed confirming the successful synthesis of the intended heterojunction without any impurities transmission electron microscopy tem and high resolution tem hrtem analyses were also performed for characterizing the surface morphology of the fabricated heterojunction the tem image in fig s1 shows that the ag3po4 nanoparticles were dispersed on hexagonal shaped zif 8 an hrtem image of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction shown in fig s2 reveals a lattice fringe spacing of 0 27 nm that can be attributed to the 210 plane of ag3po4 nevertheless no lattice fringes were observed for zif 8 which was attributed to the destruction of the zif 8 structure under high electron beam conditions 73 similar observations were made for previously reported zif 8 based materials 28 32 74 these results confirm that zif 8 and ag3po4 were in intimate contact improving the charge separation efficiency and thus the photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction the surface chemical compositions of the developed photocatalysts were also investigated using xps and the finding in fig 2b shows that ag p o n c and zn elements are present in the survey spectrum of ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction fig 3a and b for the bare ag3o4 o 1s spectrum reveal two peaks at 529 67 and 531 6 ev attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen and surface adsorbed oxygen respectively 75 fig 3c and d show the xps spectra of ag 3d with the peaks at 367 1 and 373 1 ev can be indexed to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 respectively revealing the existence of the ag oxidation state 76 fig 3e and f show the xps spectra of p 2p and the peak at 132 2 ev suggests the presence of p5 in the nanocomposites 76 fig 4a and b the xps spectra of zn 2p with the peak at 1021 1 ev corresponding to zn 2p3 2 77 fig 4c and d present the xps spectra of n 1s with the peaks at 397 9 ev 398 8 ev and 399 9 ev can be respectively indexed to cn znn and cn owing to the existence of 2 mim from zif 8 77 however there was one peak different from zif 8 for the ag3po4 zif 8 nanocomposite at 396 8 ev indicating the presence of agn this peak was attributed to the zn2 substitution by ag in the zif 8 framework during the preparation process the xps spectra peaks of c 1s shown in fig 4e and f at 284 1 ev were attributed to c c c c of zif 8 78 these findings confirm the successful preparation of the intended heterojunction optical properties which are very important for photocatalysts were investigated as well fig 5a shows that the fabricated photocatalysts exhibit excellent optical properties the bandgaps of the fabricated photocatalysts were also calculated using the kubelka munk function 1 fig 5b reveals that the bandgap energies of ag3o4 zif 8 and the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were 2 38 5 25 and 2 15 ev respectively to evaluate the charge separation efficiency electrochemical impedance spectrometry eis was conducted with the result shown in fig 5c that the eis semicircle radius of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was smaller than those of ag3o4 and zif 8 confirming better electrical conductivity and charge separation efficiency of the fabricated heterojunction which is very important for effective photocatalysis 79 fig 5d shows the photoluminescence pl spectra of the developed catalysts indicating that the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibited low spectra and revealing the suppression of electron hole recombination which is very important for efficient photocatalysis 80 the photocurrent response depicted in the fig 5e presents that ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibited the highest photocurrent response compared with zif 8 and ag3po4 confirming the excellent optical light absorption properties and the conversion of absorbed light into photogenerated charge carriers this implies an outstanding charge separation efficiency and suppression of hole electron recombination further improving the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated heterojunctions 81 taken together these findings suggest that the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibits good optical and photo electrochemical properties which is very important for effective photocatalytic performance 82 the specific surface areas of the fabricated photocatalysts were also investigated the results in table 1 reveal that the surface areas of zif 8 ag3po4 and the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were 1752 40 m2 g 0 13 m2 g and 287 10 m2 g respectively the results also suggest that the surface area of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was larger than that of pure ag3po4 which is very important for the adsorption of pollutants on the photocatalysts surface to enable effective photodegradation 6 83 85 zeta potential measurements were also performed to investigate the surfaces of the developed photocatalysts the results in table 2 show that the zeta potential values of zif 8 ag3po4 and the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were 43 4 mv 2 5 mv and 36 6 mv respectively these results show that the surface charge of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was positive that plays significant for the adsorption of the pollutants and thus important for effective photocatalysis 86 87 carrier concentration types and flat band potentials of the different semiconductor materials were examined using the mott schottky method this method utilizes the fact that the tangent slope is negative for p type semiconductors and positive for n type semiconductors the flat band potential is determined from the intercept with the horizontal coordinate and the positions of the fermi energy levels with respect to the reference electrode and the conduction band positions of the semiconductor can be further known fig 6a shows that zif 8 exhibited a positive slope indicating that zif 8 is an n type material with an intercept of 0 79 ev vs ag agcl on the other hand ag3po4 exhibited a negative slope indicating that ag3po4 is a p type material with a flat band potential of 1 82 ev vs ag agcl as can be seen in fig 6b to further study the charge separation ability of the developed by ag3po4 zif p n heterojunction hall effect measurement were performed according to hall effect measurement principle the sign of charge carrier concentration is indicator of n type and p type material that means the positive and negative sign are ascribed p type and n type semiconductor respectively 88 89 subsequently the findings in table 3 show that ag3po4 and zif 8 presented positive and negative charge carriers signs respectively indicating the successful preparation of p type ag3po4 and n type zif 8 interestingly the ag3po4 zif p n heterojunction exhibited the highest carrier concentration the lowest resistivity and the highest mobility this confirmed that the p n heterojunction formation induced effective charge separation which is important for photocatalysis 3 2 photocatalytic property study the photocatalytic property of developed photocatalysts were evaluated using cv rh b and cr as model organic wastewater pollutants the results in fig 7a show that the rh b photodegradation efficiency of the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction presented 99 of rh b photodegradation efficiency while ag3po4 and zif 8 only 92 3 and 31 respectively under the same condition fig 7c displays that 90 7 of the cv could be photocatalytically decomposed by the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction whereas only 60 5 and 62 3 of it could be photodegraded by ag3po4 and zif 8 respectively under similar experimental conditions moreover fig 7e shows that the photodegradation efficiency of the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction with respect to cr was 94 7 while those of pure ag3po4 and zif 8 were respectively only 70 and 25 3 these results demonstrate that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance which could be ascribed to optical absorption narrow band gap high surface area suppressed charge recombination rate and p n heterojunction formation 1 90 91 the photocatalytic activity of the as prepared photocatalyst was quantitatively studied using the pseudo first order kinetic model in eq 1 92 1 ln c t c 0 kt where t is the time k is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 and c0 and ct are the initial concentration of the pollutant and its concentration at time t respectively the kinetic plot in fig 7b shows that the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited a faster rate of the rh b photodegradation than both pure ag3po4 and zif 8 fig 7d also shows that the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction photocatalyst exhibited a faster rate of the cv photodegradation than zif 8 and ag3po4 besides the finding in fig 7f confirms that the rate of the cr photodegradation by the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction was faster than those by zif 8 and ag3po4 the calculated rate constants in table 4 show that the rate of the rh b photodegradation by the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction was approximately 2 and 41 times faster than by ag3po4 and zif 8 respectively moreover the photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction photocatalyst was compared with that of a previously reported photocatalyst the results of this comparison listed in table 5 suggest that under the same experimental conditions the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited better photocatalytic performance than previously reported photocatalysts with respect to the photodegradation of rh b table 6 also reveals that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited superb photocatalytic activity compared with previously reported photocatalysts with respect to the photodegradation of cr under visible light illumination to study the light utilization efficiencies of the fabricated photocatalysts the apparent quantum efficiencies φ of the photocatalysts were determined according to eq 2 101 2 φ reaction rate incident photon flux n a v l d c a dt d n ph dt in the above equation na is avogadro s number 6 022 1023 molecules mol v is the volume of the reaction solution l nph is the number of photons irradiating at time t ca is the concentration of reactant a mol l and t is the reaction time herein rh b was selected as the representative pollutant the result shows that the determined apparent quantum efficiency under the incident light of 3 1015 photons s was 10 71 3 61 and 15 52 for ag3po4 zif 8 and ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction respectively this finding shows that the apparent quantum efficiency of the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was approximately 1 5 and 4 3 times that of the pure ag3po4 and pure zif 8 respectively the developed heterojunction exhibited excellent light absorption and utilization properties which are crucial for effective photocatalytic performance 1 these results confirm that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction is promising for general environmental remediation and wastewater treatment particularly for the removal of organic dyes 3 3 effect of the operation parameters on the photocatalytic properties of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction the effects of the operation parameters namely dye concentration catalyst dosage and ph on the photocatalytic properties of the fabricated photocatalyst were also studied the results in fig 8a show that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction presented excellent photocatalytic performance at 11 ph for photodegradation of cv the excellent performance of the developed photocatalyst at higher ph can be indexed the good adsorption of the cationic dye cv with a more negative surface charge of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction owing to the dominance of oh to investigate the effect of ph on the photocatalytic performance of the developed photocatalyst on photodegradation of anionic dyes cr was selected as the model pollutant fig 8b shows that the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated photocatalyst decreases with increasing the ph for the photodegradations of cr dyes this decrease in the photocatalytic performance with increasing ph value can be ascribed to the strong electrostatic repulsion of the anionic dyes with more negative surface charge of the photocatalyst at higher ph 102 these findings agree with the measured zeta potentials of the photocatalysts that were reported in table 2 above the influence of the dye concentration on the photocatalytic properties of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was also investigated and the results fig 8c reveals that the photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst decreased as the rh b dye concentration increased the observed suppression of the photodegradation efficiency of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction with increasing rh b dye concentration can ascribed to the existence of extra pollutant molecules than accessible active sites on the heterojunction and the decrease in the amount of light that come into contact with the photocatalyst surface at high dye concentrations 103 the effect of the catalyst dosage on the photocatalytic properties of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was also evaluated and the results in fig 8d show that the photodegradation efficiency increased with increasing photocatalyst dosage owing to an increase in the number of active sites for the dye molecules adsorption on the photocatalyst surface which improved the photocatalytic performance 104 photocatalyst reusability which importantly determines its practical applicability was also investigated the finding in fig 9a shows that the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction presented excellent cyclic stability for the studied five cycles confirming its potential candidacy in wastewater treatment in real application the nature of the active species responsible for the photodegradation of cr cv and rh b was investigated using isopropanol ipa benzoquinone bq silver nitrate agno3 and triethanolamine tea as hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals electrons and hole scavengers respectively 1 105 the result in fig 9b displays that the photodegradation property of the rh b largely suppressed by addition of ipa followed by those of agno3 and tea confirming that the photogenerated hydroxyl radical electrons and holes significantly role subsequently in the photodegradation of rh b 106 in the case of cr the degradation decreased after adding bq demonstrating that o2 led to the degradation reaction of cr the degradation also decreased after adding agno3 thus electrons also participated in the reaction with respect to cv the effect decreased the most following the tea addition implying that the degradation reaction of cv was shaped by holes and the effect decreased slightly when ipa was used as a scavenger implying that oh was also involved in the photodegradation processes 3 4 mineralization studies in photocatalysis study of the degree of mineralization is very important since the pollutant can disappear but converted to another small molecule environmental pollutant the extent of the rh b mineralization by the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction photocatalyst was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon toc in an aqueous solution as shown in fig 10 approximately 96 78 of the toc was removed from rh b during its photodegradation by the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction this result confirmed that rh b was efficiently mineralized into h2o and co2 during photocatalysis making the developed photocatalyst suitable for treating wastewater containing rh b 103 besides the degree of mineralization of cv and cr by the developed photocatalyst was also investigated the findings reveal that the photocatalyst mineralized 96 65 and 97 67 of cv and cr respectively within just 120 min these results confirm that the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction not only depolarized organic dyes but also converted them completely to co2 h2o and other smaller molecules 107 108 the possible photodegradation pathway of the rh b during photocatalysis by the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was predicted based on previous reports rh b first decompose through n deethylation of and decarboxylation by reactive oxygen species ros 109 110 then the n deethylated products undergo chromophore disruption by the ros that leads to formation intermediates having only one benzene ring 109 finally ring opening reaction takes place that leads to complete decomposition and its mineralization into smaller and eco friendly inorganic products such as co2 nh4 and h2o 109 111 similarly the photodegradation path way of cr during photocatalysis removal using was also developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction proposed according to open literatures first cr undergoes deamination and oxygen followed by cleavage of benzene ring cn and nn triple bonds 112 subsequently the formed intermediates undergo nitrification oxidation deamination or desulfonation by reacting with the ros that leads to removal of these groups and formation of lower molecular weight intermediates of malonate malonic acid and 3 carboxypropanoate these lower molecular intermediates further mineralize into h2o and co2 108 112 3 5 proposed photocatalytic mechanism of the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction from the mott schottky analysis the flat band potentials of zif 8 and ag3po4 were obtained by converting the standard hydrogen electrode using eq 3 3 e nhe e ag agcl 0 197 0 059 ph for n type semiconductors the flat band potential is 0 2 v more positive than the cb potential in the case of p type semiconductors the flat band potential is 0 2 ev more positive than the valence band vb potential from which the vb and cb potentials of semiconductors can be calculated 113 based on the energy gap measured by the uv vis spectroscopy and eq 4 the potential value of another energy band was calculated as follows 113 4 e g e cb e vb from eq 4 the calculated fermi energy level efn of zif 8 was 0 18 ev nhe ph 7 thus ecb 0 38 ev by inserting eg 5 25 ev into eq 4 evb was obtained as 4 85 ev similarly the calculated fermi energy level efp of ag3po4 was 2 43 ev nhe ph 7 and accordingly the value of evb was obtained as 2 63 ev by inserting e g 2 38 ev into eq 4 the value of ecb was obtained as 0 25 ev the results are shown in fig 11a based on the above findings a possible photocatalytic mechanism for the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was proposed fig 11b according to this mechanism when ag3po4 contacts zif 8 to form p n heterojunctions the fermi energy level of zif 8 decreases whereas the fermi energy level of ag3po4 increases this results in a state of equilibrium and yields an internal electric field at the interface in the equilibrium the internal electric field causes the ag3po4 region to become negatively charged and the zif 8 region to become positively charged with a more positive cb than for ag3po4 when visible light is irradiated on a photocatalyst it does not excite electrons from the vb of zif 8 to its cb owing to the wide bandgap of 5 23 ev 114 however it excites electrons from the vb of ag3po4 to the cb of ag3po4 simultaneously generating holes in the vb 115 116 then the photogenerated electrons in the cb of p type ag3po4 migrate to the cb edge of n type zif 8 while the holes migrate from the vb of zif 8 to that of ag3po4 forming a p n heterojunction 117 this redistribution of electrons and holes due to the p n heterojunction formation improves charge separation by suppressing electron hole recombination 118 the generated charge carriers migrate toward the surface of the photocatalyst causing photodegradation of organic dyes 11 the photogenerated holes and electrons produce reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals 1 these ros react with the organic dye inducing its photodegradation 11 the general proposed reaction mechanism is as follows first the light absorbed by the ag3po4 part of the ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction generates holes and electrons eq 5 5 ag 3 po 4 zif 8 hv h e the produced holes h can cause dye photodegradation directly by reacting with the dyes or indirectly by generating hydroxyl radicals that react with h2o as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 h h 2 o h oh 7 h dyes degraded dye products simultaneously the generated electrons react with the oxygen dissolved in the solutions and generate superoxide free radicals the generated free radicals further react with h2o to produce ros leading to the photodegradation of the dye as shown by eqs 8 10 8 e o 2 o 2 9 o 2 h 2 o ros 10 ros dyes degraded products 4 conclusions in this study a novel ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was fabricated at room temperature using chemical precipitation methods the developed photocatalyst exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity with respect to cv cr and rh b by photodegrading 90 7 94 7 and 99 0 of them respectively within 120 min sunder visible light illumination it also displayed superb cyclic stability the toc results revealed the outstanding mineralization properties of the fabricated heterojunction during the photodegradation of organic dyes the active species scavenging results confirmed that superoxide radicals hydroxyl radicals and holes were responsible for the photodegradation of organic dyes the excellent photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was attributed to its larger surface area p n heterojunction formation extension of optical properties and suppression of the photogenerated hole electron recombination rate overall the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n

12596,in this study a novel silver phosphate zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was fabricated at room temperature using the chemical precipitation method the photocatalytic properties of the developed p n heterojunction were investigated with respect to organic water pollutants the effects of the operation parameters on the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated photocatalyst were also studied the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic properties with respect to organic pollutants crystal violet cv congo red cr and rhodamine b rh b the total organic carbon toc measurements revealed that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction mineralized 99 0 of rh b 90 7 of cv and 94 7 of cr in 120 min the heterojunction also exhibited excellent cyclic stability which is crucial for practical applications the excellent photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction could be ascribed to the suppression of the photogenerated charge recombination enhancement of the surface area p n heterojunction formation and extended light absorption therefore the developed heterojunction is promising for environmental remediation in general and for photocatalysis based treatment of organic pollutant containing wastewater in particular keywords mof photocatalysis organic pollutants ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction mineralization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction energy crisis and environmental pollution are among the most urgent problems facing the world 1 2 water pollution owing to industrial discharge and urbanization requires immediate action for maintaining environmental safety 3 4 various methods such as adsorption chemical reaction based methods biodegradation and photocatalysis have been developed for wastewater treatment 5 6 among these photocatalysis that uses solar light is considered as a potential candidate due to its simplicity eco friendliness abundance of solar energy and effectiveness 7 10 this approach can also be used to remove low concentration pollutants from water bodies which cannot be achieved using other methods 5 previously various photocatalysts such as but not limited to tio2 w18o49 fe3o4 zno g c3n4 and ag3vo4 have been developed and have demonstrated outstanding photocatalytic activity with respect to inorganic and organic pollutants alike 1 5 7 11 16 however their practical applicability suffers from low quantum yield limited range absorption of solar light fast electron hole recombination rate poor cyclic stability and photocorrosion 5 therefore effective efficient stable eco friendly and solar light absorbing photocatalysts are needed recently metal organic frameworks mofs have attracted significant attention as an emerging class of porous materials due to their adjustable pore size and shape diverse structure and large surface area 5 owing to these interesting properties these materials have been used in different applications including adsorption and separation supercapacitors drug delivery and photocatalysis 17 19 among these applications mofs are promising for photocatalysis based h2 production degradation of organic pollutants carbon dioxide co2 reduction and removal of heavy metals 19 21 nevertheless most of the developed materials suffer from low stability in aqueous solutions limited optical absorption and high cost which hinders their practical applications in photocatalysis 19 thus looking for stable low cost and photocatalyst with excellent optical activity is mandatory zeolite like imidazole skeleton materials zifs are mofs with zeolite skeleton structures that are produced by reactions in solvents with co or zn as metal sources and imidazole derivatives or imidazole as organic ligands 22 zif 8 constructed from zn ii and 2 methyl imidazole ligands exhibits excellent water stability high surface area and regular pores it has been used in various fields such as the knoevenagel reaction friedel crafts acylation and photocatalysis 23 25 various zif 8 based nanocomposite photocatalysts including but not limited to zno zif 8 zn2geo4 zif 8 tio2 zif 8 znins zif 8 and mno2 zif 8 26 30 have been developed nevertheless their use in real practical application is hindered by their low quantum yield low optical activity high cost low eco friendliness and fast electron hole recombination 31 34 therefore zif 8 based effective eco friendly and stable photocatalysts are crucial for practical wastewater treatment by photocatalysis previously different strategies such as the z scheme 35 37 s scheme 38 41 and p n heterojunction formation 42 43 have been developed to improve the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts among these p n heterojunction formation has been promising 44 this approach suppresses the photogenerated charge carrier s recombinations rate owing to the development of an internal electric field 45 in this regard zif 8 is an n type semiconductor 46 that can form p n heterojunctions with suitable p type semiconductors for effective photocatalytic performance 47 therefore it is very important select proper p type semiconductor that can for make p n heterojunction with it interestingly silver orthophosphate ag3po4 is p type semiconductor and it has got huge consideration in wastewater treatment due to its excellent visible light absorption 48 50 nevertheless it suffers from photo corrosion that is caused by photogenerated electrons that hinders its practical application for wastewater treatment in its pure form 48 interestingly different researchers have found that the photo corrosion property of ag3po4 can be suppressed thus its photocatalytic performance and cyclic stability can be improved by nanocomposite formation 51 53 p n heterojunction formation 54 56 and doping 57 59 with suitable materials among these techniques p n heterojunction formation is promising especially when the other material is an mof material that can serve as an adsorption site for pollutants in addition to its charge separation enhancement and photo corrosion suppression which improves its photocatalytic performance 60 therefore zif 8 is a potential material to form p n heterojunction with ag3po4 and was chosen in this study herein taking into account the abovementioned advantages of ag3o4 and zif 8 a novel ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was synthesized using chemical precipitation at room temperature 30 1 c for the first time the photocatalytic activity of the developed photocatalyst with respect to organic pollutants such as crystal violet cv congo red cr and rhodamine b rh b was investigated in response to the visible light illumination the effects of the operation parameters namely the ph catalyst dosage and pollutant concentration on the photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction were also studied systematically the degree of pollutant mineralization by the developed photocatalyst was evaluated based on the total organic carbon toc content a possible reaction for the photodegradation of organic pollutants was also proposed based on the findings 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no₃ ₂ 6h2o 99 was obtained from sigma aldrich 2 methylimidazole 2 mim 98 was bought from nova materials co ltd sliver nitrate agno3 99 8 was purchased from honeywell fluka sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous na2hpo4 99 was purchased from showa chemical industry co ltd methyl alcohol meoh 99 9 was purchased from fisher scientific nafion perfluorinated resin solution 5 wt in lower aliphatic alcohols and water contains 15 20 water was purchased from sigma aldrich sodium hydroxide naoh 98 was purchased from fisher scientific chloroacetic acid sodium salt rhodamin b congo red and crystal violet all of them are analytical reagent grade quality and were purchased from acros organics all materials are used as received without further purification 2 2 preparation of zif 8 the zif 8 photocatalyst was synthesized as described previously 61 62 in particular 25 mm and 50 mm aqueous solutions of zinc nitrate and 2 methyl imidazole were prepared separately the 2 methyl imidazole solution was then added dropwise to the zinc nitrate solution and stirred for 4 h the obtained product was washed three times with deionized water di h2o and dried at 80 c for 8 h 2 3 synthesis of ag3o4 zif 8 p n heterojunctions the ag3o4 zif 8 p n heterojunctions were prepared as follows the prepared zif 8 0 05 g and agno3 2 7 g were added to 40 ml of di h2o and stirred for 10 min then 40 ml of the 0 2 m na2hpo4 aqueous solution was added to the above mixture and stirred for 5 h finally the obtained precipitate was washed with di h2o and dried for 8 h at 80 c pure ag3o4 was also fabricated using the same method without the addition of zif 8 63 2 4 photocatalytic property study to study the photocatalytic performance of the developed photocatalyst different organic wastewater pollutants such as rh b cv and cr was selected to investigate its universal applicability toward different pollutants for the studies of photocatalytic properties 20 mg of the photocatalyst and 50 ml of 20 ppm were added to a 250 ml volume pyrex glass container before light irradiation the solution and photocatalyst were stirred for 30 min in the dark to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the adsorption of a pollutant by a photocatalyst is very important for effective photocatalysis 6 64 because photocatalysis occurs on the surface of a photocatalyst the photodegradation efficiency is largely affected by the surface properties 65 66 photocatalysts with good adsorption properties collect more pollutants on their surfaces making it easier to photodegrade the pollutants which improves the photocatalysts photocatalytic efficiency 65 67 68 therefore the adsorption property was investigated first and then visible light was irradiated on it using a 500 w xe lamp prosper optoelectronic co ltd taiwan of wavelength 250 nm to 2500 nm with filter of 400 780 nm the distance from the lamp to the reactor was 35 cm and the optical intensity of the irradiated light was 1 kw m2 three milliliters of the solution were taken at each 15 min and centrifuged to separate the photocatalyst from the solution the concentrations of the pollutants in the solution were determined using ultraviolet visual uv vis spectrometry 69 moreover the kinetics of the photocatalytic properties of the fabricated samples were studied by fitting the obtained data to a kinetic equation ln ct co kt for the pseudo first order reaction rate 1 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem image in fig 1a shows that the developed zif 8 were hexagonal with diameters in the 300 400 nm range the fabricated ag3po4 were nanoparticles with diameters in the 100 150 nm range and length of several nanometers fig 1b the finding in fig 1c shows that only the ag3po4 structures were present on the surface of the 1 composite because the zif 8 content was smaller and became easily covered with ag3po4 in fig 1d the ag3po4 nanoparticles are dispersed on hexagonal zif 8 confirming good contact between the two materials which is important for effective synergistic photocatalysis fig 1e shows some exposed structures of zif 8 crystals and some ag3po4 attached to the zif 8 surfaces in addition the chemical composition of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was also characterized using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fig 1f shows that ag o p zn and c were present in the heterojunction besides the actual elemental mass and atomic weight percentage composition of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were nearly the same as the theoretical percentages of the different elements in the intended heterojunction fig 1f inset confirming its successful synthesis the surface crystal structures of the developed photocatalysts were investigated using x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 2a shows that zif 8 exhibited diffraction peaks at 2θ of 7 38 10 44 12 75 14 72 16 45 and 18 02 that were attributed to the 011 002 112 022 013 and 222 crystal planes of zif 8 71 the diffraction peaks of ag3po4 were attributed to body centered cubic ag3po4 jspds no 00 006 0505 72 the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibited the characteristic peaks of both ag3po4 and zif 8 and no additional peaks were observed confirming the successful synthesis of the intended heterojunction without any impurities transmission electron microscopy tem and high resolution tem hrtem analyses were also performed for characterizing the surface morphology of the fabricated heterojunction the tem image in fig s1 shows that the ag3po4 nanoparticles were dispersed on hexagonal shaped zif 8 an hrtem image of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction shown in fig s2 reveals a lattice fringe spacing of 0 27 nm that can be attributed to the 210 plane of ag3po4 nevertheless no lattice fringes were observed for zif 8 which was attributed to the destruction of the zif 8 structure under high electron beam conditions 73 similar observations were made for previously reported zif 8 based materials 28 32 74 these results confirm that zif 8 and ag3po4 were in intimate contact improving the charge separation efficiency and thus the photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction the surface chemical compositions of the developed photocatalysts were also investigated using xps and the finding in fig 2b shows that ag p o n c and zn elements are present in the survey spectrum of ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction fig 3a and b for the bare ag3o4 o 1s spectrum reveal two peaks at 529 67 and 531 6 ev attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen and surface adsorbed oxygen respectively 75 fig 3c and d show the xps spectra of ag 3d with the peaks at 367 1 and 373 1 ev can be indexed to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 respectively revealing the existence of the ag oxidation state 76 fig 3e and f show the xps spectra of p 2p and the peak at 132 2 ev suggests the presence of p5 in the nanocomposites 76 fig 4a and b the xps spectra of zn 2p with the peak at 1021 1 ev corresponding to zn 2p3 2 77 fig 4c and d present the xps spectra of n 1s with the peaks at 397 9 ev 398 8 ev and 399 9 ev can be respectively indexed to cn znn and cn owing to the existence of 2 mim from zif 8 77 however there was one peak different from zif 8 for the ag3po4 zif 8 nanocomposite at 396 8 ev indicating the presence of agn this peak was attributed to the zn2 substitution by ag in the zif 8 framework during the preparation process the xps spectra peaks of c 1s shown in fig 4e and f at 284 1 ev were attributed to c c c c of zif 8 78 these findings confirm the successful preparation of the intended heterojunction optical properties which are very important for photocatalysts were investigated as well fig 5a shows that the fabricated photocatalysts exhibit excellent optical properties the bandgaps of the fabricated photocatalysts were also calculated using the kubelka munk function 1 fig 5b reveals that the bandgap energies of ag3o4 zif 8 and the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were 2 38 5 25 and 2 15 ev respectively to evaluate the charge separation efficiency electrochemical impedance spectrometry eis was conducted with the result shown in fig 5c that the eis semicircle radius of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was smaller than those of ag3o4 and zif 8 confirming better electrical conductivity and charge separation efficiency of the fabricated heterojunction which is very important for effective photocatalysis 79 fig 5d shows the photoluminescence pl spectra of the developed catalysts indicating that the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibited low spectra and revealing the suppression of electron hole recombination which is very important for efficient photocatalysis 80 the photocurrent response depicted in the fig 5e presents that ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibited the highest photocurrent response compared with zif 8 and ag3po4 confirming the excellent optical light absorption properties and the conversion of absorbed light into photogenerated charge carriers this implies an outstanding charge separation efficiency and suppression of hole electron recombination further improving the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated heterojunctions 81 taken together these findings suggest that the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction exhibits good optical and photo electrochemical properties which is very important for effective photocatalytic performance 82 the specific surface areas of the fabricated photocatalysts were also investigated the results in table 1 reveal that the surface areas of zif 8 ag3po4 and the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were 1752 40 m2 g 0 13 m2 g and 287 10 m2 g respectively the results also suggest that the surface area of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was larger than that of pure ag3po4 which is very important for the adsorption of pollutants on the photocatalysts surface to enable effective photodegradation 6 83 85 zeta potential measurements were also performed to investigate the surfaces of the developed photocatalysts the results in table 2 show that the zeta potential values of zif 8 ag3po4 and the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction were 43 4 mv 2 5 mv and 36 6 mv respectively these results show that the surface charge of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was positive that plays significant for the adsorption of the pollutants and thus important for effective photocatalysis 86 87 carrier concentration types and flat band potentials of the different semiconductor materials were examined using the mott schottky method this method utilizes the fact that the tangent slope is negative for p type semiconductors and positive for n type semiconductors the flat band potential is determined from the intercept with the horizontal coordinate and the positions of the fermi energy levels with respect to the reference electrode and the conduction band positions of the semiconductor can be further known fig 6a shows that zif 8 exhibited a positive slope indicating that zif 8 is an n type material with an intercept of 0 79 ev vs ag agcl on the other hand ag3po4 exhibited a negative slope indicating that ag3po4 is a p type material with a flat band potential of 1 82 ev vs ag agcl as can be seen in fig 6b to further study the charge separation ability of the developed by ag3po4 zif p n heterojunction hall effect measurement were performed according to hall effect measurement principle the sign of charge carrier concentration is indicator of n type and p type material that means the positive and negative sign are ascribed p type and n type semiconductor respectively 88 89 subsequently the findings in table 3 show that ag3po4 and zif 8 presented positive and negative charge carriers signs respectively indicating the successful preparation of p type ag3po4 and n type zif 8 interestingly the ag3po4 zif p n heterojunction exhibited the highest carrier concentration the lowest resistivity and the highest mobility this confirmed that the p n heterojunction formation induced effective charge separation which is important for photocatalysis 3 2 photocatalytic property study the photocatalytic property of developed photocatalysts were evaluated using cv rh b and cr as model organic wastewater pollutants the results in fig 7a show that the rh b photodegradation efficiency of the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction presented 99 of rh b photodegradation efficiency while ag3po4 and zif 8 only 92 3 and 31 respectively under the same condition fig 7c displays that 90 7 of the cv could be photocatalytically decomposed by the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction whereas only 60 5 and 62 3 of it could be photodegraded by ag3po4 and zif 8 respectively under similar experimental conditions moreover fig 7e shows that the photodegradation efficiency of the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction with respect to cr was 94 7 while those of pure ag3po4 and zif 8 were respectively only 70 and 25 3 these results demonstrate that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance which could be ascribed to optical absorption narrow band gap high surface area suppressed charge recombination rate and p n heterojunction formation 1 90 91 the photocatalytic activity of the as prepared photocatalyst was quantitatively studied using the pseudo first order kinetic model in eq 1 92 1 ln c t c 0 kt where t is the time k is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 and c0 and ct are the initial concentration of the pollutant and its concentration at time t respectively the kinetic plot in fig 7b shows that the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited a faster rate of the rh b photodegradation than both pure ag3po4 and zif 8 fig 7d also shows that the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction photocatalyst exhibited a faster rate of the cv photodegradation than zif 8 and ag3po4 besides the finding in fig 7f confirms that the rate of the cr photodegradation by the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction was faster than those by zif 8 and ag3po4 the calculated rate constants in table 4 show that the rate of the rh b photodegradation by the ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction was approximately 2 and 41 times faster than by ag3po4 and zif 8 respectively moreover the photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction photocatalyst was compared with that of a previously reported photocatalyst the results of this comparison listed in table 5 suggest that under the same experimental conditions the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited better photocatalytic performance than previously reported photocatalysts with respect to the photodegradation of rh b table 6 also reveals that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction exhibited superb photocatalytic activity compared with previously reported photocatalysts with respect to the photodegradation of cr under visible light illumination to study the light utilization efficiencies of the fabricated photocatalysts the apparent quantum efficiencies φ of the photocatalysts were determined according to eq 2 101 2 φ reaction rate incident photon flux n a v l d c a dt d n ph dt in the above equation na is avogadro s number 6 022 1023 molecules mol v is the volume of the reaction solution l nph is the number of photons irradiating at time t ca is the concentration of reactant a mol l and t is the reaction time herein rh b was selected as the representative pollutant the result shows that the determined apparent quantum efficiency under the incident light of 3 1015 photons s was 10 71 3 61 and 15 52 for ag3po4 zif 8 and ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction respectively this finding shows that the apparent quantum efficiency of the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was approximately 1 5 and 4 3 times that of the pure ag3po4 and pure zif 8 respectively the developed heterojunction exhibited excellent light absorption and utilization properties which are crucial for effective photocatalytic performance 1 these results confirm that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction is promising for general environmental remediation and wastewater treatment particularly for the removal of organic dyes 3 3 effect of the operation parameters on the photocatalytic properties of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction the effects of the operation parameters namely dye concentration catalyst dosage and ph on the photocatalytic properties of the fabricated photocatalyst were also studied the results in fig 8a show that the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction presented excellent photocatalytic performance at 11 ph for photodegradation of cv the excellent performance of the developed photocatalyst at higher ph can be indexed the good adsorption of the cationic dye cv with a more negative surface charge of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction owing to the dominance of oh to investigate the effect of ph on the photocatalytic performance of the developed photocatalyst on photodegradation of anionic dyes cr was selected as the model pollutant fig 8b shows that the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated photocatalyst decreases with increasing the ph for the photodegradations of cr dyes this decrease in the photocatalytic performance with increasing ph value can be ascribed to the strong electrostatic repulsion of the anionic dyes with more negative surface charge of the photocatalyst at higher ph 102 these findings agree with the measured zeta potentials of the photocatalysts that were reported in table 2 above the influence of the dye concentration on the photocatalytic properties of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was also investigated and the results fig 8c reveals that the photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst decreased as the rh b dye concentration increased the observed suppression of the photodegradation efficiency of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction with increasing rh b dye concentration can ascribed to the existence of extra pollutant molecules than accessible active sites on the heterojunction and the decrease in the amount of light that come into contact with the photocatalyst surface at high dye concentrations 103 the effect of the catalyst dosage on the photocatalytic properties of the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was also evaluated and the results in fig 8d show that the photodegradation efficiency increased with increasing photocatalyst dosage owing to an increase in the number of active sites for the dye molecules adsorption on the photocatalyst surface which improved the photocatalytic performance 104 photocatalyst reusability which importantly determines its practical applicability was also investigated the finding in fig 9a shows that the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 5 heterojunction presented excellent cyclic stability for the studied five cycles confirming its potential candidacy in wastewater treatment in real application the nature of the active species responsible for the photodegradation of cr cv and rh b was investigated using isopropanol ipa benzoquinone bq silver nitrate agno3 and triethanolamine tea as hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals electrons and hole scavengers respectively 1 105 the result in fig 9b displays that the photodegradation property of the rh b largely suppressed by addition of ipa followed by those of agno3 and tea confirming that the photogenerated hydroxyl radical electrons and holes significantly role subsequently in the photodegradation of rh b 106 in the case of cr the degradation decreased after adding bq demonstrating that o2 led to the degradation reaction of cr the degradation also decreased after adding agno3 thus electrons also participated in the reaction with respect to cv the effect decreased the most following the tea addition implying that the degradation reaction of cv was shaped by holes and the effect decreased slightly when ipa was used as a scavenger implying that oh was also involved in the photodegradation processes 3 4 mineralization studies in photocatalysis study of the degree of mineralization is very important since the pollutant can disappear but converted to another small molecule environmental pollutant the extent of the rh b mineralization by the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction photocatalyst was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon toc in an aqueous solution as shown in fig 10 approximately 96 78 of the toc was removed from rh b during its photodegradation by the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction this result confirmed that rh b was efficiently mineralized into h2o and co2 during photocatalysis making the developed photocatalyst suitable for treating wastewater containing rh b 103 besides the degree of mineralization of cv and cr by the developed photocatalyst was also investigated the findings reveal that the photocatalyst mineralized 96 65 and 97 67 of cv and cr respectively within just 120 min these results confirm that the ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction not only depolarized organic dyes but also converted them completely to co2 h2o and other smaller molecules 107 108 the possible photodegradation pathway of the rh b during photocatalysis by the developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction was predicted based on previous reports rh b first decompose through n deethylation of and decarboxylation by reactive oxygen species ros 109 110 then the n deethylated products undergo chromophore disruption by the ros that leads to formation intermediates having only one benzene ring 109 finally ring opening reaction takes place that leads to complete decomposition and its mineralization into smaller and eco friendly inorganic products such as co2 nh4 and h2o 109 111 similarly the photodegradation path way of cr during photocatalysis removal using was also developed ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction proposed according to open literatures first cr undergoes deamination and oxygen followed by cleavage of benzene ring cn and nn triple bonds 112 subsequently the formed intermediates undergo nitrification oxidation deamination or desulfonation by reacting with the ros that leads to removal of these groups and formation of lower molecular weight intermediates of malonate malonic acid and 3 carboxypropanoate these lower molecular intermediates further mineralize into h2o and co2 108 112 3 5 proposed photocatalytic mechanism of the fabricated ag3po4 zif 8 heterojunction from the mott schottky analysis the flat band potentials of zif 8 and ag3po4 were obtained by converting the standard hydrogen electrode using eq 3 3 e nhe e ag agcl 0 197 0 059 ph for n type semiconductors the flat band potential is 0 2 v more positive than the cb potential in the case of p type semiconductors the flat band potential is 0 2 ev more positive than the valence band vb potential from which the vb and cb potentials of semiconductors can be calculated 113 based on the energy gap measured by the uv vis spectroscopy and eq 4 the potential value of another energy band was calculated as follows 113 4 e g e cb e vb from eq 4 the calculated fermi energy level efn of zif 8 was 0 18 ev nhe ph 7 thus ecb 0 38 ev by inserting eg 5 25 ev into eq 4 evb was obtained as 4 85 ev similarly the calculated fermi energy level efp of ag3po4 was 2 43 ev nhe ph 7 and accordingly the value of evb was obtained as 2 63 ev by inserting e g 2 38 ev into eq 4 the value of ecb was obtained as 0 25 ev the results are shown in fig 11a based on the above findings a possible photocatalytic mechanism for the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was proposed fig 11b according to this mechanism when ag3po4 contacts zif 8 to form p n heterojunctions the fermi energy level of zif 8 decreases whereas the fermi energy level of ag3po4 increases this results in a state of equilibrium and yields an internal electric field at the interface in the equilibrium the internal electric field causes the ag3po4 region to become negatively charged and the zif 8 region to become positively charged with a more positive cb than for ag3po4 when visible light is irradiated on a photocatalyst it does not excite electrons from the vb of zif 8 to its cb owing to the wide bandgap of 5 23 ev 114 however it excites electrons from the vb of ag3po4 to the cb of ag3po4 simultaneously generating holes in the vb 115 116 then the photogenerated electrons in the cb of p type ag3po4 migrate to the cb edge of n type zif 8 while the holes migrate from the vb of zif 8 to that of ag3po4 forming a p n heterojunction 117 this redistribution of electrons and holes due to the p n heterojunction formation improves charge separation by suppressing electron hole recombination 118 the generated charge carriers migrate toward the surface of the photocatalyst causing photodegradation of organic dyes 11 the photogenerated holes and electrons produce reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals 1 these ros react with the organic dye inducing its photodegradation 11 the general proposed reaction mechanism is as follows first the light absorbed by the ag3po4 part of the ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction generates holes and electrons eq 5 5 ag 3 po 4 zif 8 hv h e the produced holes h can cause dye photodegradation directly by reacting with the dyes or indirectly by generating hydroxyl radicals that react with h2o as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 h h 2 o h oh 7 h dyes degraded dye products simultaneously the generated electrons react with the oxygen dissolved in the solutions and generate superoxide free radicals the generated free radicals further react with h2o to produce ros leading to the photodegradation of the dye as shown by eqs 8 10 8 e o 2 o 2 9 o 2 h 2 o ros 10 ros dyes degraded products 4 conclusions in this study a novel ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was fabricated at room temperature using chemical precipitation methods the developed photocatalyst exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity with respect to cv cr and rh b by photodegrading 90 7 94 7 and 99 0 of them respectively within 120 min sunder visible light illumination it also displayed superb cyclic stability the toc results revealed the outstanding mineralization properties of the fabricated heterojunction during the photodegradation of organic dyes the active species scavenging results confirmed that superoxide radicals hydroxyl radicals and holes were responsible for the photodegradation of organic dyes the excellent photocatalytic performance of the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n heterojunction was attributed to its larger surface area p n heterojunction formation extension of optical properties and suppression of the photogenerated hole electron recombination rate overall the developed ag3po4 zif 8 p n

12597,mercury pollution is a global environmental problem an alternative to the chemical method of removing mercury from the aquatic environment is the phytoremediation process based on phytofiltration phytoextraction and phytovolatilization techniques the study showed the effectiveness of phytoremediation with plants lemna minor and salvinia natans carried out in monoculture systems and mixed cultures we used hoagland s mercury contaminated liquid medium 0 15 mghg dm3 0 20 mghg dm3 and 0 30 mghg dm3 the relative growth rate of plants in the control samples was 0 04 0 07 g gd in the presence of mercury for monocultures observed a toxic effect in the form of growth stimulation and the relative growth rate reached 0 12 g gd the bioconcentration factor was the highest on the 7th day of mercury exposure and was 216 856 the efficiency of mercury removal from the substrate in the phytoremediation process was 96 the total protein was increased for lemna minor by 34 salvinia natans by 84 and in mixed culture by up to 99 also the total chlorophyll increased for lemna minor by 14 and for the mixed culture by up to 60 for salvinia natans the total chlorophyll decreased by 53 the biochemical changes may have been a toxic effect of mercury in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lemna minor salvinia natans relative growth rate bioconcentration factor removal efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction environmental mercury pollution of both a global and local nature is a serious international problem evidenced by the minamata convention 1 2 elemental mercury and chemical combinations especially organic mercury are highly toxic oxidised mercury hg ii is a local contaminant whereas elemental mercury hg 0 can migrate to remote areas contributing to global contamination the most bioaccumulative is methylmercury formed by methylation and microbial transformations 3 4 the main habitats for mercury methylation are invertebrate digestive tracts thawing permafrost soils coastal dead zones soils sediments and waters 5 6 both plant and animal organisms especially humans are sensitive to their presence in the environment 7 8 it adversely affects the nervous respiratory digestive and immune systems 9 the amount of mercury in the environment is steadily increasing by anthropogenic activities 10 and from natural sources 11 in addition recent studies indicate increased amounts of mercury in arctic sediments its amount is comparable to levels from the huang river in china which is known for its high rate of hg accumulation in sediments 12 that is highly dangerous because mercury in the oceans as in lake and river waters converts to methylmercury and is incorporated into the aquatic food chain 13 mercury in the water environment especially in closed bodies of water like lakes is converted to methylmercury much faster 6 numerous studies have identified coal mining 14 15 and artisanal and small scale gold mining asgm 6 as potential sources of mercury in soils and terrestrial waters in areas with a high concentration of mining activities much of the agricultural land may be inaccessible due to excessive soil and water contamination 16 17 the result is a reduction in agricultural productivity 18 various techniques are used to remediate soils and waters of mercury 19 however due to mercury s strong ability to form complexes with organic matter its effectiveness is not always satisfactory 20 21 a promising technology for removing heavy metals including mercury from the environment is phytoremediation different methods are used depending on the type of contaminant to be removed the site conditions the magnitude of the necessary clean up and the plant species conditionally they can be divided into two techniques based on reducing the mobility of the contaminant phytostabilisation phytoimmobilisation based on the ability of plants to take up the pollutant from water soil sewage sludge and accumulate in their biomass or released it into the atmosphere phytovolatilisation phytoextraction 22 23 when using this method it is important to remember that heavy metals have an adverse influence on plant morphology and physiology 18 as a result of accumulation in tissues plant uptake of nutrient elements is impaired and the synthesis of assimilation pigments is inhibited 24 the low cost and applicability mean that the method is beginning to be modified to increase efficiency phytoremediation is based on biological processes therefor its effectiveness is highly dependent on the bioavailability of the contaminant it has been shown that thiosulphates and synthetic amino polycarboxylic acids increase the bioavailability of mercury in soils and its translocation to the aerial organs of plants unfortunately there is still little work on the phytoextraction of mercury from water bodies especially with the chemical induction of the process however there are reports on the positive effect of rhizosphere bacteria on mercury accumulation 25 a study by fiqri et al showed the effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza am inoculation on mercury phytoextraction from asgm waste the wild plants used in the study were paspalum conjugatum cyperus kyllingia and lindernia crustacea plants were planted in a mixture of waste and compost 50 50 by weight the inoculum contained glomus gigaspora and skutelespora after 63 days plant roots and shoots were analysed for mercury concentration the results showed that the most potent plant species for mercury extraction was paspalum conjugatum supporting its inoculum with fungi increased the amount of accumulated mercury by 25 26 also fikirdeşici ergen et al conducted studies on mixed cultures with lemna minor the study investigated the removal of al ba and fe by lemna minor daphnia magna and mixed culture tests showed that phytoremediation with lemna minor alone is more effective than in combination with aquatic organisms 27 the present research evaluated the effectiveness of mercury removal from the aquatic environment using the aquatic plants lemna minor and salvinia natans lemna minor is a well studied hyperaccumulator of heavy metals salvinia natans is not as well understood and therefore requires further research to evaluate its accumulation capacity in phytoremediation processes studies on the removal of heavy metals i e lead iron cadmium chromium zinc and manganese in phytoremediation processes with great success for years the hyperaccumulator plants are thoroughly known and classified unfortunately phytoremediation of mercury despite its high toxicity and the ever increasing amount of this element in the environment still requires research to increase its effectiveness plant hyperaccumulators are not well understood and new ones are still being sought especially for the treatment of aquatic environments the research presented here is an attempt to evaluate the potential for mercury accumulation by salvinia natans and also by comparison to results obtained for the hyperaccumulator lemna minor since the two plants in the environment often occur together the study was also conducted in mixed cultures 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material used in the study the study used commercial plants they were grown in artificial water tanks with a liquid substrate composition suitable for plant growth the lairs were a volume of about 1 l and were made of transparent plastic the study was conducted on the monocultures plant of lemna minor and salvinia natans lemna minor is a well studied pleustophyte with high heavy metal bioaccumulation capabilities 28 salvinia natans is a well known plant that lives in many areas 29 its bioaccumulation properties are not sufficiently understood yet its selection for study to assess its heavy metal phytoremediation capacity is the similarity to salvini molesta nuisance the case of salvinia molesta has been studied already to confirm its suitability for phytoremediation unfortunately it is a highly invasive species and introducing it into the new biocenosis may entail many adverse consequences 30 31 few publications on heavy metal removal by salvinia natans have been observed especially mercury removal a comparative study of salvinia natans with lemna minor will allow an assessment of its degree of suitability in phytoremediation technologies it is also essential to study the mixed cultures of lemna minor and salvinia natans tests of the interactions between plant species whether these will be antagonistic or synergistic relationships is of great importance for the efficiency of removing the toxin from the water it is interesting because both species live in standing water and watercourses with low flows fig 1 2 2 preparation of the liquid culture medium and samples the study used a modified hoagland s medium composition kno3 1 02 g dm3 ca no3 2 4h2o 0 71 g dm3 nh4h2po4 0 23 g dm3 mgso4

temperature was 20â 1 c the solution was ph 4 4 5 liquid substrate not contained organic matter and only micro and macro elements in mixed cultured used plants with a weight ratio 2 1 2 3 analyses of mercury in solutions and plant dry matter the analysis of mercury concentrations in solution and plant dry matter was using an altem ama 254 atomic absorption spectrometer 35 36 the amount of mercury in the solutions was tested within 24 h from the download sample the solutions tested did not special preparation required the test vegetable material required the pretreatment of the samples by drying them at room temperature to air dry form for each sample solution dry matter plant test was repeated 10th times and the result was averaged 2 4 plant growth analysis the biomass grown was controlled by the radwag waa 160 c 1 analytical balance plants were weighed before and after the experiment fresh weight after the experiments plants were dried and balanced again dry weight determination dry weight of the plant before the experiment is not possible to identify dry weight before experimental was used as a mathematical conversion informing how much fresh weight was needed to get 1 g dry weight for this aim ten weight plant samples of about 5 g each was prepared the plants were in different physiological conditions the samples were dried at room temperature and weighed the averaged results were used in the conversions the formula for calculation of mean relative growth rate rgr was given by fischer 37 as follows 1 rgr lnw 2 lnw 1 t 2 t 1 where w1 initial dry weight of plant at time t1 w2 final dry weight of plant at time t2 t1 initial time t2 final time 2 5 metal content in plant samples and substratum the bioconcentration factor bcf is a parameter that gives information about the ability of plants for toxin accumulation using the rgr can indirectly determine whether a plant has a high enough abiotic tolerance potential when bcf 1 the plant only absorbs the metal if bcf 1 the ability to accumulate and stabilise the contaminant 38 39 the bioconcentration factor was obtained for the plants using equation 25 40 2 bfc metal concentration in plants metal concentration in substrate as the accumulation of mercury in plants increases it is removed from the substrate which was measured using the removal efficiency re 3 re c i c f c i 100 where c i and c f were the initial and final concentrations of the element in the substratum 2 6 analysis of plant tissue in this study was used the lowry method was modified by eggstein and kreutz 41 42 the fresh plants were rubbed by mechanical homogenisation of 0 1 g in 1 m naoh solution by ultra turraxtube driver the resulting homogeniser was incubated in a water bath at 100 c for 10 min physico chemical denaturation was aimed to destroy the second third and fourth order structures in the proteins after cooling the hydrolysate was filtered on a soft filter to remove plant residues in were received hydrolysates determined of total protein plants absorbance was measured on a t80 uv vis instrument at a wavelength of 750 nm then was reading the total protein from the standard curve the total chlorophyll was content before and after phytoremediation experiments the study used spectrophotometer analysis by the acetone extraction method 43 plants were homogenized mechanically with ultra turraxtube driver homogeniser using 0 1 g of fresh plants in 90 acetone the homogenate was extracted for 22 h in the dark and at 5 c the next filtered through soft strainers absorbance measurements were made on a t80 uv vis instrument at 663 nm and 645 nm the concentrations of total chlorophyll were calculated using the following equations 44 4 total chlorophyll 20 2 a 645 8 02 a 663 3 results and discussion phytoremediation is the removal of toxic substances by plants based on their ability to download pollutants from the environment and degrade them the contaminant is most often incorporated into plant cells or actively metabolised depending on the kind of pollutant and the environmental conditions the different plant species can use many mechanisms of phytoremediation processes accordingly we distinguish a few phytoremediation methods such as phytoextraction phytodegradation rhizofiltration phytostabilisation and phytoevaporation in the case of heavy metal removal phytoextraction is the most common involving the accumulation of the pollutant in plant tissues 45 in the case of aquatic plants often observed the process of rhizofiltration many floating aquatic plants can adsorb or precipitate xenobiotics on the surface of roots submerged in water lemna minor also belongs to this group mercury removal has as a third mechanism phytoevaporation volatilisation after uptake of the pollutant by the plant transpiration and evaporation of the pollutant occurs in a modified form 25 the amount of mercury was tested in the plants and liquid media before the study began the initial bcf was calculated on obtained based on the test results the bcf on day 0 of the experiment for lemna minor was 78 for salvinia natans 126 and the mixed culture only 33 fig 2 shows the bioconcentration factor analysis the bcf indicates the highest pollutant accumulation in the first seven days it was observed for both monocultures after this time the amount of mercury in plant tissues decreased for lemna minor the amounts were comparable for days 14 and 21 for concentrations of 0 15mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 they were about 30 for concentrations of 0 30 mghg dm3 there were 12 less on day 14 and 9 less on day 21 relative to day 7 research by amare and co workers showed that lemna minor is a high phytoaccumulator for fe mn zn and co while moderate for cd cu ni and cr 46 similar results were obtained by bedouh and co workers obtaining good removal of zn ni fe and pb and slightly less cr and cu 47 salvinia natans reduced the amount of mercury in tissues by 15 on day 14 for concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 9 each for concentrations of 0 20 mghg dm3 and 0 30 mghg dm3 on subsequent days the amount of toxin in the tissues continued to decrease relative to the seventh day of the experiment for the concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 it was 38 less for the concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 23 less and for the concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 30 less the reduction of the bioconcentration factor in plant tissues may have been due to their death from mercury toxicity as a result the dead cells may have released mercury into the environment visual assessment of the plants seems to confirm this numerous foci of chlorosis and necrosis were visible on the surface of the leaves also the biochemical analysis showed significant changes in the amount of total protein and total chlorophyll in the plants for different times of mercury exposure comparing the bioaccumulation of two plants no found expressive differences in the lemna minor the range was 275 561 while for salvinia natans it was 280 567 the mixed culture of lemna minor and salvinia natans showed the worst results of the bioconcentration factor values for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 after day 7th it was 216 the days 14th and 21st the results were similar and were 335 and 361 respectively the highest bcf was observed at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 after day 7th it was 856 that was twice the value obtained for lemna minor and salvinia natans in monocultures however on day 14th it dropped to a value of 400 followed by a rise again to a value of 563 this situation could have resulted from a reaction to the presence of mercury in the substrate in higher amounts that contributed to a faster activation of the plant s defence mechanisms resulting in a higher accumulation of pollutants for the concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 the bcf was the lowest of all concentrations and plant configurations tested its value was 216 335 and 361 in the next days of the experiment respectively due to the scale and prevalence of the problem of environmental pollution by heavy metals phytoremediation is a promising solution plants that show the ability to remove more than one metal simultaneously are particularly useful that is especially true the contaminated areas are a mixture of elements or compounds rather than a single metal the degree of removal of metallic contaminants depends not only on the species of plant used but also on the chemical form of the contaminant i e its bioavailability many pollutants enter the plant via the same pathways as nutrients and are then stored in the vacuoles protecting the plant from their toxic effects metals such as zinc manganese and iron are micro and macro elements that are essential for the proper functioning of plant organisms they become a pollutant when their amount in the environment increases significantly as plants take them up continuously from the substrate these mechanisms will be faster than other metals that do not occur naturally in living organisms e g mercury therefore the removal of metal from the substrate also depends on the presence of co occurring substances and competitive processes 10 58 as exposure time increases the translocation coefficient may decrease meaning that hg accumulates mainly in the roots in contrast the bioconcentration factor may increase as shown in a study conducted on brassica juncea by raj and co workers 48 based on the results it cannot be clear whether the relationship between the plants used is antagonistic or synergistic it can only suppose that in danger which may be a sudden high concentration of the toxin was started the defence processes the detoxification processes of plants may be different and their intensification may also be various their type and magnitude may largely depend on how the plant perceives the threat for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 the metabolic processes carried out by both plants supported each other to such an extent that a significant increase in mercury accumulation in their tissues was observed at the same time changes in the amount of mercury in the medium were observed analysing figs 2 and 3 it was found that as the amount of mercury in the plants decreased the amount of mercury in the medium did not always increase depending on the concentration of mercury in the medium and the phytoremediation plant a different course of experiments was observed mercury removal in monocultures was in the range of 68 94 for lemna minor and 61 91 for salvinia natans in contrast it was 82 96 in the mixed culture for lemna minor and concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 the least removal of toxic metal was on day 7 on days 14 and 21 the amount of mercury in the medium was much lower and comparable for both concentrations the smallest diurnal variation in the amount of mercury in the medium was observed for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 it should be noted that despite the decreasing bcf the re value increased this shows that the mercury that was no longer accumulated in the plant tissues was also not released into the liquid medium presumably it could have been released into the atmosphere by enzymatic metabolism or by evaporation with water through the stomata bacteria capable of volatilising mercury through the production of the enzyme mercuric reductase are present in the environment 25 49 50 although the plants were subjected to purification processes to remove microflora from their surfaces however due to their delicate structure methods were used that may not have been effective enough the changes in re values for salvinia natans were quite different on day 7th for all concentrations the amount of metal removed was comparable at 85 91 in the next days of the experiment re decreased to 75 14d and 59 21d for a concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 86 14d and 78 21d for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 comparing the rt results obtained for lemna minor and salvinia natans we see that the mercury removal in both cases is comparable in the case of lemna minor an extension of the experimental time seems to be justified especially for lower concentrations for salvinia natans on the other hand the best results of re were obtained on day 7th regardless of the mercury concentration in the contaminated medium fig 3 the highest and least varied re values independently of mercury concentration and time of experiment were observed for mixed cultures despite the highest bcf for day 7th at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 re in this case was not the highest similar to the study with lemna minor mercury may have been released into the atmosphere since the weight ratio in the mixed cultures was 2 1 the number of lemna minor plants in this system may not have been sufficient to achieve the high efficiency of the phytoremediation process the efficiency of phytoremediation largely depends on the physiological condition of the plants and their growth rate it the influenced by the amount of total protein as a building block and the number of assimilatory pigments analysing the rgr it should be noted that both lemna minor and salvinia natans in the control samples reduced the growth rate on the following days of the experiment that could have been the effect of plant stress after transfer to hogland s medium although the plants were commercially grown their previous medium may have contained different proportions of mineral substances than the hogland medium it may also have a small amount of organic matter so the epiphytic microflora was more abundant hogland s substrate contains only the minerals necessary for proper plant growth the biological material was cleaned up from residues of previous media and microflora to ensure that growth conditions were as uniform as possible throughout the experiment these mechanical processes could also temporarily weaken plants the mixed culture initially showed an increase in rgr at 17 but this was small by day 21 it had decreased by 33 compared to the value of the control sample fig 4 further analysis of relative plant growth fig 4 showed a significant increase in biomass for salvinia natans while this was 0 05 0 06 g gd for the control samples it was 0 05 0 12 g gd for the mercury exposed plants the greatest differences in rgr were observed on day 7th of the experiment when the mercury exposed plants grew almost twice as fast as on the mercury free medium for a concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 there was a 100 greater increase compared to the control for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 a 67 increase and for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 an 83 increase according to the literature this may have been an effect of mercury toxicity manifested as stimulations of plant growth on the other days the rgr was slightly higher for the mercury samples compared to the control samples and ranged between 20 and 60 the second highest plant growth was observed in the mixed culture for concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 the rgr was higher on day 7 at days 14 and 21 it was already lower than for the control samples the worst growth was observed for the mixed culture and a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 the rgr was 0 03 g gd since the growth of salvinia natans plants in the presence of lemna minor decreased it can be supposed that these plants do not show interspecies synergistic interactions on the other hand it could be due to a reduction in the toxic effect of mercury on plants few epiphytic microorganisms may have remained on the surface of the leaves and roots of lemna minor despite the plant wash ustiatik et al showed that inoculation with the epiphytic bacteria jeotgalicoccus huakuii bacillus amyloliquefaciens increased the biomass by 52 68 and the bioaccumulation of mercury by 47 76 the study of the amount of mercury remaining in the sand after the bacterial inoculum showed a reduction of 80 the results confirm the improved plant biomass production and mercury accumulation in the presence of epiphytic bacteria 51 the bcf was lower and the re higher than for the monocultures that could be the result of mercury volatilisation then its amount in the solution may have decreased and such a toxic effect on growth stimulation and biomass production was not observed it seems to be confirmed by the results of total protein fig 5 lemna minor produced the least amount of it during mercury exposure compared to salvinia natans and the mixed culture the highest amount of protein was observed at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 at concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 its amount was very similar as the amount of protein decreased for the lower concentrations during the first seven days of the experiment and increased for 0 30 mghg dm3 we can conclude that the toxic effect of mercury may be growth stimulation for higher mercury concentrations a toxic effect was observed more quickly than for lower concentrations a similar situation was observed for salvinia natans an increase in total protein was observed after day 7th compared to the control sample for all concentrations for the concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 the amount of protein increased significantly after seven days and this trend continued until the fourteenth day of exposure on day 7 it was 691 mg gdm and was 51 higher than control for day 14 755 mg gdm a 65 increase on the twenty first day the amount of protein decreased to 630 mg gdm but was still greater than in the control sample however for the concentrations of 0 20 mghg dm3 and 0 30 mghg dm3 a trend of increase was observed throughout all studies the maximum value was 844 mg gdm for the 0 20 mghg dm3 concentration i e an 84 increase in the amount of protein in the plants after their mercury exposure a slightly lower value of 802 mg gdm was observed for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 an increase of 75 the number of protein changes in plants may be due to the formation of a protein complex with hg ii ions which alters protein conformation and solubility sahu et al found that total protein levels in plants decreased at high mercury concentrations in contrast at low concentrations of hg in the medium protein levels in leaves and roots of t aestivum l increased relative to the control 52 elevated levels of mercury in the plant can cause oxidative stress and cellular activities destructive to their organelles the effect of that is increasing the production of reactive oxygen species superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals by the antioxidant system 53 54 their overproduction leads to an increase in glutathione 55 which acts as a dehydroascorbate reductant to neutralise toxic elements 56 also proteins such as homocysteine methyltransferase ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase long and short chains 14 3 3 like protein and 40s biosynthesis related ribosomal protein s15 become activated in plants in the presence of mercury 57 the results obtained for the mixed culture were as follows during the first seven days for all concentrations tested the amount of total protein in the plants increased significantly after mercury exposure for 0 15 mghg dm3 by 64 for 0 20 mghg dm3 by 76 and for 0 30 mghg dm3 was higher than initially in the plants the largest increases in protein were observed for the highest mercury concentration tested that may have been due to the plants activating defence mechanisms against the toxin results which were evident in the changes in protein amount keep in mind that total protein includes biomass forming proteins and enzymatic proteins many detoxification mechanisms involve enzymatic transformations the study showed an adverse effect of mercury on the amounts of total chlorophyll in the plants fig 5 for lemna minor slight variations were observed throughout the study period and for all concentrations the amount of total chlorophyll varied between 14 08 and 18 88 mg gdm while in the control sample it was 16 56 mg gdm the highest chlorophyll was observed on day 14 at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 which was a 14 increase over the control the lowest was on day 7th at a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 a decrease of 15 rai s removal studies of fe cu cd cr and zn showed decreasing even about 58 of chlorophyll in lemna minor in the presence of heavy metals 58 with a metal removal rate of more than 90 from the water the chlorophyll of salvinia natans was lower throughout the mercury exposure period than in control only on day 21st for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 was slightly higher at 27 52 mg gdm while in a control sample was 27 48 mg gdm however this is an insignificant difference which is within the error analysis that may be indicative of the greater sensitivity of this species to mercury manifested by a reduction in the production of assimilatory pigments changes in the form of chlorosis were evident throughout the study the plants may temporarily reduce chlorophyll production to intensify mercury detoxification or phytoextraction processes raj and colleagues also observed a decrease in chlorophyll in brassica juncea plants exposed to mercury the chlorophyll decreased with the amount of hg in the substrate and the time of exposure to the toxin 48 for changes in chlorophyll for the mixed culture different trends were observed depending on the mercury concentration in the contaminated hoagland medium on the seventh day for a concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 the amount of chlorophyll was 21 62 mg gdm and was comparable to that of the control sample next its amount increased until day 21 reaching a maximum value 34 23 mg gdm the highest chlorophyll value obtained in the presence of mercury was 58 higher than in plants not exposed to the test metal a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 was the smallest increase in chlorophyll relative to the control its maximum value with mercury exposure was 29 43 mg gdm 40 higher than the control this study was also the only one in which a decrease in chlorophyll was observed a reduction to 19 04 mg gdm occurred on day 7th and was 11 less than the control for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 there was an increase relative to the control by day 14 of exposure the maximum value was 32 84 mg gdm an increase of 54 over the control sample 21 34 mg gdm next the amount of chlorophyll decreased to 29 70 mg gdm throughout the study period its amount was higher than in the control sample despite the decrease in the final days the last changes in total chlorophyll were observed in studies on lemna minor this plant is an established hyperaccumulator that shows resistance to the effects of heavy metal toxicity current in the environment in the case of salvinia natas the results obtained indicate its greater sensitivity to mercury significant decreases in the number of assimilation pigments were observed manifested as visible changes in leaf colouration chlorosis necrosis the highest increase in assimilation pigments was observed for the mixed culture which may have been due to synergistic interactions between the plants tested this may have resulted in an increased production of chlorophylls to obtain energy to intensify physiological processes that could reduce the effect of mercury toxicity on plants the most common methods used to remove mercury from water are precipitation adsorption ion exchange chemical reduction membrane separation and membrane extraction however not all of these methods are used on an industrial scale some of them are on a laboratory or semi technical scale of the methods presented the most effective for the removal of inorganic mercury compounds is the precipitation method using sulphur compounds the removal rate is as high as 99 9 using the phytoremediation method a comparable degree of mercury removal can be achieved 90 96 at a lower cost and without the additional chemical compounds 59 4 conclusion it has been shown that both lemna minor which is a known hyperaccumulator of heavy metals and salvinia natans which is little known as an accumulator in accumulation of heavy metals can successfully carry out mercury phytoremediation both plant species showed high tolerance to the mercury present in the aquatic environment tolerating concentrations up to 0 30 mathrmmghg dm 3 based on the results the bioaccumulation properties of lemna minor and salvinia natans were comparable however the most effective phytoremediation process occurred in the case of a mixed culture of both plant species studied that was confirmed not only by bcf values but also by re since both plant species occur in the environment under similar climatic conditions it can be presumed that there may be synergistic interactions between them such relationships between species may result in a reduced impact of mercury on living organisms less toxic effect that was also confirmed by biochemical studies in the case of mixed cultures an increase of up to 99 in total protein and an increase of 60 in the number of assimilatory pigments were observed it was also observed that as the concentration in the medium increased the bcf and the total protein increased since plants can incorporate xenobiotics into their organic structures in the above ground parts it can be thought that this defence mechanism was used to stress caused by the presence of the toxin in the environment that is particularly evident in the case of mixed cultures also in the case of the amount of total chlorophyll similar relationships could be observed an increased total protein is often at the same time an increased amount of assimilatory pigments allowing to obtain the energy necessary for the physiological processes of plants mixed cultures the plants studied are invasive species in many parts of the world their use in phytoremediation processes should be carried out under strictly defined and controlled conditions therefore phytoremediation processes are often carried out in special tanks from which excess biomass can be easily caught the biggest problem of the phytoremediation process remains the significant amount of biomass produced contaminated with heavy metals removed from the environment when designing this type of treatment plant it is necessary to consider options for managing the resulting biomass the most common is composting pyrolysis or compression funding the study was conducted under the grant mnisw no n n523 612139 entitled evaluation of the

12597,mercury pollution is a global environmental problem an alternative to the chemical method of removing mercury from the aquatic environment is the phytoremediation process based on phytofiltration phytoextraction and phytovolatilization techniques the study showed the effectiveness of phytoremediation with plants lemna minor and salvinia natans carried out in monoculture systems and mixed cultures we used hoagland s mercury contaminated liquid medium 0 15 mghg dm3 0 20 mghg dm3 and 0 30 mghg dm3 the relative growth rate of plants in the control samples was 0 04 0 07 g gd in the presence of mercury for monocultures observed a toxic effect in the form of growth stimulation and the relative growth rate reached 0 12 g gd the bioconcentration factor was the highest on the 7th day of mercury exposure and was 216 856 the efficiency of mercury removal from the substrate in the phytoremediation process was 96 the total protein was increased for lemna minor by 34 salvinia natans by 84 and in mixed culture by up to 99 also the total chlorophyll increased for lemna minor by 14 and for the mixed culture by up to 60 for salvinia natans the total chlorophyll decreased by 53 the biochemical changes may have been a toxic effect of mercury in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lemna minor salvinia natans relative growth rate bioconcentration factor removal efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction environmental mercury pollution of both a global and local nature is a serious international problem evidenced by the minamata convention 1 2 elemental mercury and chemical combinations especially organic mercury are highly toxic oxidised mercury hg ii is a local contaminant whereas elemental mercury hg 0 can migrate to remote areas contributing to global contamination the most bioaccumulative is methylmercury formed by methylation and microbial transformations 3 4 the main habitats for mercury methylation are invertebrate digestive tracts thawing permafrost soils coastal dead zones soils sediments and waters 5 6 both plant and animal organisms especially humans are sensitive to their presence in the environment 7 8 it adversely affects the nervous respiratory digestive and immune systems 9 the amount of mercury in the environment is steadily increasing by anthropogenic activities 10 and from natural sources 11 in addition recent studies indicate increased amounts of mercury in arctic sediments its amount is comparable to levels from the huang river in china which is known for its high rate of hg accumulation in sediments 12 that is highly dangerous because mercury in the oceans as in lake and river waters converts to methylmercury and is incorporated into the aquatic food chain 13 mercury in the water environment especially in closed bodies of water like lakes is converted to methylmercury much faster 6 numerous studies have identified coal mining 14 15 and artisanal and small scale gold mining asgm 6 as potential sources of mercury in soils and terrestrial waters in areas with a high concentration of mining activities much of the agricultural land may be inaccessible due to excessive soil and water contamination 16 17 the result is a reduction in agricultural productivity 18 various techniques are used to remediate soils and waters of mercury 19 however due to mercury s strong ability to form complexes with organic matter its effectiveness is not always satisfactory 20 21 a promising technology for removing heavy metals including mercury from the environment is phytoremediation different methods are used depending on the type of contaminant to be removed the site conditions the magnitude of the necessary clean up and the plant species conditionally they can be divided into two techniques based on reducing the mobility of the contaminant phytostabilisation phytoimmobilisation based on the ability of plants to take up the pollutant from water soil sewage sludge and accumulate in their biomass or released it into the atmosphere phytovolatilisation phytoextraction 22 23 when using this method it is important to remember that heavy metals have an adverse influence on plant morphology and physiology 18 as a result of accumulation in tissues plant uptake of nutrient elements is impaired and the synthesis of assimilation pigments is inhibited 24 the low cost and applicability mean that the method is beginning to be modified to increase efficiency phytoremediation is based on biological processes therefor its effectiveness is highly dependent on the bioavailability of the contaminant it has been shown that thiosulphates and synthetic amino polycarboxylic acids increase the bioavailability of mercury in soils and its translocation to the aerial organs of plants unfortunately there is still little work on the phytoextraction of mercury from water bodies especially with the chemical induction of the process however there are reports on the positive effect of rhizosphere bacteria on mercury accumulation 25 a study by fiqri et al showed the effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza am inoculation on mercury phytoextraction from asgm waste the wild plants used in the study were paspalum conjugatum cyperus kyllingia and lindernia crustacea plants were planted in a mixture of waste and compost 50 50 by weight the inoculum contained glomus gigaspora and skutelespora after 63 days plant roots and shoots were analysed for mercury concentration the results showed that the most potent plant species for mercury extraction was paspalum conjugatum supporting its inoculum with fungi increased the amount of accumulated mercury by 25 26 also fikirdeşici ergen et al conducted studies on mixed cultures with lemna minor the study investigated the removal of al ba and fe by lemna minor daphnia magna and mixed culture tests showed that phytoremediation with lemna minor alone is more effective than in combination with aquatic organisms 27 the present research evaluated the effectiveness of mercury removal from the aquatic environment using the aquatic plants lemna minor and salvinia natans lemna minor is a well studied hyperaccumulator of heavy metals salvinia natans is not as well understood and therefore requires further research to evaluate its accumulation capacity in phytoremediation processes studies on the removal of heavy metals i e lead iron cadmium chromium zinc and manganese in phytoremediation processes with great success for years the hyperaccumulator plants are thoroughly known and classified unfortunately phytoremediation of mercury despite its high toxicity and the ever increasing amount of this element in the environment still requires research to increase its effectiveness plant hyperaccumulators are not well understood and new ones are still being sought especially for the treatment of aquatic environments the research presented here is an attempt to evaluate the potential for mercury accumulation by salvinia natans and also by comparison to results obtained for the hyperaccumulator lemna minor since the two plants in the environment often occur together the study was also conducted in mixed cultures 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material used in the study the study used commercial plants they were grown in artificial water tanks with a liquid substrate composition suitable for plant growth the lairs were a volume of about 1 l and were made of transparent plastic the study was conducted on the monocultures plant of lemna minor and salvinia natans lemna minor is a well studied pleustophyte with high heavy metal bioaccumulation capabilities 28 salvinia natans is a well known plant that lives in many areas 29 its bioaccumulation properties are not sufficiently understood yet its selection for study to assess its heavy metal phytoremediation capacity is the similarity to salvini molesta nuisance the case of salvinia molesta has been studied already to confirm its suitability for phytoremediation unfortunately it is a highly invasive species and introducing it into the new biocenosis may entail many adverse consequences 30 31 few publications on heavy metal removal by salvinia natans have been observed especially mercury removal a comparative study of salvinia natans with lemna minor will allow an assessment of its degree of suitability in phytoremediation technologies it is also essential to study the mixed cultures of lemna minor and salvinia natans tests of the interactions between plant species whether these will be antagonistic or synergistic relationships is of great importance for the efficiency of removing the toxin from the water it is interesting because both species live in standing water and watercourses with low flows fig 1 2 2 preparation of the liquid culture medium and samples the study used a modified hoagland s medium composition kno3 1 02 g dm3 ca no3 2 4h2o 0 71 g dm3 nh4h2po4 0 23 g dm3 mgso4

the following concentrations were selected 0 15 mghg dm3 0 20 mghg dm3 0 30 mghg dm3 for each concentration 5 g of plants were placed in a lair with 500 cm3 medium contaminated hg the experiment lasted 21 days experiments were conducted under constant conditions using a biosell fd 147 inox phytotron with a day night cycle 12 h 12 h temperature 22 c 15 c at 40 humidity the water solution temperature was 20â 1 c the solution was ph 4 4 5 liquid substrate not contained organic matter and only micro and macro elements in mixed cultured used plants with a weight ratio 2 1 2 3 analyses of mercury in solutions and plant dry matter the analysis of mercury concentrations in solution and plant dry matter was using an altem ama 254 atomic absorption spectrometer 35 36 the amount of mercury in the solutions was tested within 24 h from the download sample the solutions tested did not special preparation required the test vegetable material required the pretreatment of the samples by drying them at room temperature to air dry form for each sample solution dry matter plant test was repeated 10th times and the result was averaged 2 4 plant growth analysis the biomass grown was controlled by the radwag waa 160 c 1 analytical balance plants were weighed before and after the experiment fresh weight after the experiments plants were dried and balanced again dry weight determination dry weight of the plant before the experiment is not possible to identify dry weight before experimental was used as a mathematical conversion informing how much fresh weight was needed to get 1 g dry weight for this aim ten weight plant samples of about 5 g each was prepared the plants were in different physiological conditions the samples were dried at room temperature and weighed the averaged results were used in the conversions the formula for calculation of mean relative growth rate rgr was given by fischer 37 as follows 1 rgr lnw 2 lnw 1 t 2 t 1 where w1 initial dry weight of plant at time t1 w2 final dry weight of plant at time t2 t1 initial time t2 final time 2 5 metal content in plant samples and substratum the bioconcentration factor bcf is a parameter that gives information about the ability of plants for toxin accumulation using the rgr can indirectly determine whether a plant has a high enough abiotic tolerance potential when bcf 1 the plant only absorbs the metal if bcf 1 the ability to accumulate and stabilise the contaminant 38 39 the bioconcentration factor was obtained for the plants using equation 25 40 2 bfc metal concentration in plants metal concentration in substrate as the accumulation of mercury in plants increases it is removed from the substrate which was measured using the removal efficiency re 3 re c i c f c i 100 where c i and c f were the initial and final concentrations of the element in the substratum 2 6 analysis of plant tissue in this study was used the lowry method was modified by eggstein and kreutz 41 42 the fresh plants were rubbed by mechanical homogenisation of 0 1 g in 1 m naoh solution by ultra turraxtube driver the resulting homogeniser was incubated in a water bath at 100 c for 10 min physico chemical denaturation was aimed to destroy the second third and fourth order structures in the proteins after cooling the hydrolysate was filtered on a soft filter to remove plant residues in were received hydrolysates determined of total protein plants absorbance was measured on a t80 uv vis instrument at a wavelength of 750 nm then was reading the total protein from the standard curve the total chlorophyll was content before and after phytoremediation experiments the study used spectrophotometer analysis by the acetone extraction method 43 plants were homogenized mechanically with ultra turraxtube driver homogeniser using 0 1 g of fresh plants in 90 acetone the homogenate was extracted for 22 h in the dark and at 5 c the next filtered through soft strainers absorbance measurements were made on a t80 uv vis instrument at 663 nm and 645 nm the concentrations of total chlorophyll were calculated using the following equations 44 4 total chlorophyll 20 2 a 645 8 02 a 663 3 results and discussion phytoremediation is the removal of toxic substances by plants based on their ability to download pollutants from the environment and degrade them the contaminant is most often incorporated into plant cells or actively metabolised depending on the kind of pollutant and the environmental conditions the different plant species can use many mechanisms of phytoremediation processes accordingly we distinguish a few phytoremediation methods such as phytoextraction phytodegradation rhizofiltration phytostabilisation and phytoevaporation in the case of heavy metal removal phytoextraction is the most common involving the accumulation of the pollutant in plant tissues 45 in the case of aquatic plants often observed the process of rhizofiltration many floating aquatic plants can adsorb or precipitate xenobiotics on the surface of roots submerged in water lemna minor also belongs to this group mercury removal has as a third mechanism phytoevaporation volatilisation after uptake of the pollutant by the plant transpiration and evaporation of the pollutant occurs in a modified form 25 the amount of mercury was tested in the plants and liquid media before the study began the initial bcf was calculated on obtained based on the test results the bcf on day 0 of the experiment for lemna minor was 78 for salvinia natans 126 and the mixed culture only 33 fig 2 shows the bioconcentration factor analysis the bcf indicates the highest pollutant accumulation in the first seven days it was observed for both monocultures after this time the amount of mercury in plant tissues decreased for lemna minor the amounts were comparable for days 14 and 21 for concentrations of 0 15mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 they were about 30 for concentrations of 0 30 mghg dm3 there were 12 less on day 14 and 9 less on day 21 relative to day 7 research by amare and co workers showed that lemna minor is a high phytoaccumulator for fe mn zn and co while moderate for cd cu ni and cr 46 similar results were obtained by bedouh and co workers obtaining good removal of zn ni fe and pb and slightly less cr and cu 47 salvinia natans reduced the amount of mercury in tissues by 15 on day 14 for concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 9 each for concentrations of 0 20 mghg dm3 and 0 30 mghg dm3 on subsequent days the amount of toxin in the tissues continued to decrease relative to the seventh day of the experiment for the concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 it was 38 less for the concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 23 less and for the concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 30 less the reduction of the bioconcentration factor in plant tissues may have been due to their death from mercury toxicity as a result the dead cells may have released mercury into the environment visual assessment of the plants seems to confirm this numerous foci of chlorosis and necrosis were visible on the surface of the leaves also the biochemical analysis showed significant changes in the amount of total protein and total chlorophyll in the plants for different times of mercury exposure comparing the bioaccumulation of two plants no found expressive differences in the lemna minor the range was 275 561 while for salvinia natans it was 280 567 the mixed culture of lemna minor and salvinia natans showed the worst results of the bioconcentration factor values for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 after day 7th it was 216 the days 14th and 21st the results were similar and were 335 and 361 respectively the highest bcf was observed at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 after day 7th it was 856 that was twice the value obtained for lemna minor and salvinia natans in monocultures however on day 14th it dropped to a value of 400 followed by a rise again to a value of 563 this situation could have resulted from a reaction to the presence of mercury in the substrate in higher amounts that contributed to a faster activation of the plant s defence mechanisms resulting in a higher accumulation of pollutants for the concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 the bcf was the lowest of all concentrations and plant configurations tested its value was 216 335 and 361 in the next days of the experiment respectively due to the scale and prevalence of the problem of environmental pollution by heavy metals phytoremediation is a promising solution plants that show the ability to remove more than one metal simultaneously are particularly useful that is especially true the contaminated areas are a mixture of elements or compounds rather than a single metal the degree of removal of metallic contaminants depends not only on the species of plant used but also on the chemical form of the contaminant i e its bioavailability many pollutants enter the plant via the same pathways as nutrients and are then stored in the vacuoles protecting the plant from their toxic effects metals such as zinc manganese and iron are micro and macro elements that are essential for the proper functioning of plant organisms they become a pollutant when their amount in the environment increases significantly as plants take them up continuously from the substrate these mechanisms will be faster than other metals that do not occur naturally in living organisms e g mercury therefore the removal of metal from the substrate also depends on the presence of co occurring substances and competitive processes 10 58 as exposure time increases the translocation coefficient may decrease meaning that hg accumulates mainly in the roots in contrast the bioconcentration factor may increase as shown in a study conducted on brassica juncea by raj and co workers 48 based on the results it cannot be clear whether the relationship between the plants used is antagonistic or synergistic it can only suppose that in danger which may be a sudden high concentration of the toxin was started the defence processes the detoxification processes of plants may be different and their intensification may also be various their type and magnitude may largely depend on how the plant perceives the threat for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 the metabolic processes carried out by both plants supported each other to such an extent that a significant increase in mercury accumulation in their tissues was observed at the same time changes in the amount of mercury in the medium were observed analysing figs 2 and 3 it was found that as the amount of mercury in the plants decreased the amount of mercury in the medium did not always increase depending on the concentration of mercury in the medium and the phytoremediation plant a different course of experiments was observed mercury removal in monocultures was in the range of 68 94 for lemna minor and 61 91 for salvinia natans in contrast it was 82 96 in the mixed culture for lemna minor and concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 the least removal of toxic metal was on day 7 on days 14 and 21 the amount of mercury in the medium was much lower and comparable for both concentrations the smallest diurnal variation in the amount of mercury in the medium was observed for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 it should be noted that despite the decreasing bcf the re value increased this shows that the mercury that was no longer accumulated in the plant tissues was also not released into the liquid medium presumably it could have been released into the atmosphere by enzymatic metabolism or by evaporation with water through the stomata bacteria capable of volatilising mercury through the production of the enzyme mercuric reductase are present in the environment 25 49 50 although the plants were subjected to purification processes to remove microflora from their surfaces however due to their delicate structure methods were used that may not have been effective enough the changes in re values for salvinia natans were quite different on day 7th for all concentrations the amount of metal removed was comparable at 85 91 in the next days of the experiment re decreased to 75 14d and 59 21d for a concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 86 14d and 78 21d for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 comparing the rt results obtained for lemna minor and salvinia natans we see that the mercury removal in both cases is comparable in the case of lemna minor an extension of the experimental time seems to be justified especially for lower concentrations for salvinia natans on the other hand the best results of re were obtained on day 7th regardless of the mercury concentration in the contaminated medium fig 3 the highest and least varied re values independently of mercury concentration and time of experiment were observed for mixed cultures despite the highest bcf for day 7th at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 re in this case was not the highest similar to the study with lemna minor mercury may have been released into the atmosphere since the weight ratio in the mixed cultures was 2 1 the number of lemna minor plants in this system may not have been sufficient to achieve the high efficiency of the phytoremediation process the efficiency of phytoremediation largely depends on the physiological condition of the plants and their growth rate it the influenced by the amount of total protein as a building block and the number of assimilatory pigments analysing the rgr it should be noted that both lemna minor and salvinia natans in the control samples reduced the growth rate on the following days of the experiment that could have been the effect of plant stress after transfer to hogland s medium although the plants were commercially grown their previous medium may have contained different proportions of mineral substances than the hogland medium it may also have a small amount of organic matter so the epiphytic microflora was more abundant hogland s substrate contains only the minerals necessary for proper plant growth the biological material was cleaned up from residues of previous media and microflora to ensure that growth conditions were as uniform as possible throughout the experiment these mechanical processes could also temporarily weaken plants the mixed culture initially showed an increase in rgr at 17 but this was small by day 21 it had decreased by 33 compared to the value of the control sample fig 4 further analysis of relative plant growth fig 4 showed a significant increase in biomass for salvinia natans while this was 0 05 0 06 g gd for the control samples it was 0 05 0 12 g gd for the mercury exposed plants the greatest differences in rgr were observed on day 7th of the experiment when the mercury exposed plants grew almost twice as fast as on the mercury free medium for a concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 there was a 100 greater increase compared to the control for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 a 67 increase and for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 an 83 increase according to the literature this may have been an effect of mercury toxicity manifested as stimulations of plant growth on the other days the rgr was slightly higher for the mercury samples compared to the control samples and ranged between 20 and 60 the second highest plant growth was observed in the mixed culture for concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 the rgr was higher on day 7 at days 14 and 21 it was already lower than for the control samples the worst growth was observed for the mixed culture and a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 the rgr was 0 03 g gd since the growth of salvinia natans plants in the presence of lemna minor decreased it can be supposed that these plants do not show interspecies synergistic interactions on the other hand it could be due to a reduction in the toxic effect of mercury on plants few epiphytic microorganisms may have remained on the surface of the leaves and roots of lemna minor despite the plant wash ustiatik et al showed that inoculation with the epiphytic bacteria jeotgalicoccus huakuii bacillus amyloliquefaciens increased the biomass by 52 68 and the bioaccumulation of mercury by 47 76 the study of the amount of mercury remaining in the sand after the bacterial inoculum showed a reduction of 80 the results confirm the improved plant biomass production and mercury accumulation in the presence of epiphytic bacteria 51 the bcf was lower and the re higher than for the monocultures that could be the result of mercury volatilisation then its amount in the solution may have decreased and such a toxic effect on growth stimulation and biomass production was not observed it seems to be confirmed by the results of total protein fig 5 lemna minor produced the least amount of it during mercury exposure compared to salvinia natans and the mixed culture the highest amount of protein was observed at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 at concentrations of 0 15 mghg dm3 and 0 20 mghg dm3 its amount was very similar as the amount of protein decreased for the lower concentrations during the first seven days of the experiment and increased for 0 30 mghg dm3 we can conclude that the toxic effect of mercury may be growth stimulation for higher mercury concentrations a toxic effect was observed more quickly than for lower concentrations a similar situation was observed for salvinia natans an increase in total protein was observed after day 7th compared to the control sample for all concentrations for the concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 the amount of protein increased significantly after seven days and this trend continued until the fourteenth day of exposure on day 7 it was 691 mg gdm and was 51 higher than control for day 14 755 mg gdm a 65 increase on the twenty first day the amount of protein decreased to 630 mg gdm but was still greater than in the control sample however for the concentrations of 0 20 mghg dm3 and 0 30 mghg dm3 a trend of increase was observed throughout all studies the maximum value was 844 mg gdm for the 0 20 mghg dm3 concentration i e an 84 increase in the amount of protein in the plants after their mercury exposure a slightly lower value of 802 mg gdm was observed for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 an increase of 75 the number of protein changes in plants may be due to the formation of a protein complex with hg ii ions which alters protein conformation and solubility sahu et al found that total protein levels in plants decreased at high mercury concentrations in contrast at low concentrations of hg in the medium protein levels in leaves and roots of t aestivum l increased relative to the control 52 elevated levels of mercury in the plant can cause oxidative stress and cellular activities destructive to their organelles the effect of that is increasing the production of reactive oxygen species superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals by the antioxidant system 53 54 their overproduction leads to an increase in glutathione 55 which acts as a dehydroascorbate reductant to neutralise toxic elements 56 also proteins such as homocysteine methyltransferase ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase long and short chains 14 3 3 like protein and 40s biosynthesis related ribosomal protein s15 become activated in plants in the presence of mercury 57 the results obtained for the mixed culture were as follows during the first seven days for all concentrations tested the amount of total protein in the plants increased significantly after mercury exposure for 0 15 mghg dm3 by 64 for 0 20 mghg dm3 by 76 and for 0 30 mghg dm3 was higher than initially in the plants the largest increases in protein were observed for the highest mercury concentration tested that may have been due to the plants activating defence mechanisms against the toxin results which were evident in the changes in protein amount keep in mind that total protein includes biomass forming proteins and enzymatic proteins many detoxification mechanisms involve enzymatic transformations the study showed an adverse effect of mercury on the amounts of total chlorophyll in the plants fig 5 for lemna minor slight variations were observed throughout the study period and for all concentrations the amount of total chlorophyll varied between 14 08 and 18 88 mg gdm while in the control sample it was 16 56 mg gdm the highest chlorophyll was observed on day 14 at a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 which was a 14 increase over the control the lowest was on day 7th at a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 a decrease of 15 rai s removal studies of fe cu cd cr and zn showed decreasing even about 58 of chlorophyll in lemna minor in the presence of heavy metals 58 with a metal removal rate of more than 90 from the water the chlorophyll of salvinia natans was lower throughout the mercury exposure period than in control only on day 21st for a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 was slightly higher at 27 52 mg gdm while in a control sample was 27 48 mg gdm however this is an insignificant difference which is within the error analysis that may be indicative of the greater sensitivity of this species to mercury manifested by a reduction in the production of assimilatory pigments changes in the form of chlorosis were evident throughout the study the plants may temporarily reduce chlorophyll production to intensify mercury detoxification or phytoextraction processes raj and colleagues also observed a decrease in chlorophyll in brassica juncea plants exposed to mercury the chlorophyll decreased with the amount of hg in the substrate and the time of exposure to the toxin 48 for changes in chlorophyll for the mixed culture different trends were observed depending on the mercury concentration in the contaminated hoagland medium on the seventh day for a concentration of 0 15 mghg dm3 the amount of chlorophyll was 21 62 mg gdm and was comparable to that of the control sample next its amount increased until day 21 reaching a maximum value 34 23 mg gdm the highest chlorophyll value obtained in the presence of mercury was 58 higher than in plants not exposed to the test metal a concentration of 0 20 mghg dm3 was the smallest increase in chlorophyll relative to the control its maximum value with mercury exposure was 29 43 mg gdm 40 higher than the control this study was also the only one in which a decrease in chlorophyll was observed a reduction to 19 04 mg gdm occurred on day 7th and was 11 less than the control for a concentration of 0 30 mghg dm3 there was an increase relative to the control by day 14 of exposure the maximum value was 32 84 mg gdm an increase of 54 over the control sample 21 34 mg gdm next the amount of chlorophyll decreased to 29 70 mg gdm throughout the study period its amount was higher than in the control sample despite the decrease in the final days the last changes in total chlorophyll were observed in studies on lemna minor this plant is an established hyperaccumulator that shows resistance to the effects of heavy metal toxicity current in the environment in the case of salvinia natas the results obtained indicate its greater sensitivity to mercury significant decreases in the number of assimilation pigments were observed manifested as visible changes in leaf colouration chlorosis necrosis the highest increase in assimilation pigments was observed for the mixed culture which may have been due to synergistic interactions between the plants tested this may have resulted in an increased production of chlorophylls to obtain energy to intensify physiological processes that could reduce the effect of mercury toxicity on plants the most common methods used to remove mercury from water are precipitation adsorption ion exchange chemical reduction membrane separation and membrane extraction however not all of these methods are used on an industrial scale some of them are on a laboratory or semi technical scale of the methods presented the most effective for the removal of inorganic mercury compounds is the precipitation method using sulphur compounds the removal rate is as high as 99 9 using the phytoremediation method a comparable degree of mercury removal can be achieved 90 96 at a lower cost and without the additional chemical compounds 59 4 conclusion it has been shown that both lemna minor which is a known hyperaccumulator of heavy metals and salvinia natans which is little known as an accumulator in accumulation of heavy metals can successfully carry out mercury phytoremediation both plant species showed high tolerance to the mercury present in the aquatic environment tolerating concentrations up to 0 30 mathrmmghg dm 3 based on the results the bioaccumulation properties of lemna minor and salvinia natans were comparable however the most effective phytoremediation process occurred in the case of a mixed culture of both plant species studied that was confirmed not only by bcf values but also by re since both plant species occur in the environment under similar climatic conditions it can be presumed that there may be synergistic interactions between them such relationships between species may result in a reduced impact of mercury on living organisms less toxic effect that was also confirmed by biochemical studies in the case of mixed cultures an increase of up to 99 in total protein and an increase of 60 in the number of assimilatory pigments were observed it was also observed that as the concentration in the medium increased the bcf and the total protein increased since plants can incorporate xenobiotics into their organic structures in the above ground parts it can be thought that this defence mechanism was used to stress caused by the presence of the toxin in the environment that is particularly evident in the case of mixed cultures also in the case of the amount of total chlorophyll similar relationships could be observed an increased total protein is often at the same time an increased amount of assimilatory pigments allowing to obtain the energy necessary for the physiological processes of plants mixed cultures the plants studied are invasive species in many parts of the world their use in phytoremediation processes should be carried out under strictly defined and controlled conditions therefore phytoremediation processes are often carried out in special tanks from which excess biomass can be easily caught the biggest problem of the phytoremediation process remains the significant amount of biomass produced contaminated with heavy metals removed from the environment when designing this type of treatment plant it is necessary to consider options for managing the resulting biomass the most common is composting pyrolysis or compression funding the study was conducted under the grant mnisw no n n523 612139 entitled evaluation of the

transmembrane pressure toc total organic carbon who world health organization xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1 introduction nowadays arsenic contamination in groundwater has become a global concern inorganic arsenic is exceedingly toxic and carcinogenic to all living entities drinking arsenic contaminated water has recently been identified as one of the most serious health concerns high levels of arsenic as in water pose a serious concern to public health since they can lead to skin diseases and ultimately cancer 1 world health organization who guidelines state that arsenic levels in drinking water should not exceed 10 μg l as concentrations has been frequently reported to be in the range from 0 5 to 5000 μg l in groundwater samples of over 70 nations in the world 2 arsenic exists in various oxidation states including arsenite as 3 arsenic as0 arsenate as 5 and arsine as 3 each with varying degrees of toxicity 3 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the two primary forms of arsenic that exist in natural water bodies according to studies as iii is more toxic compared to as v 4 arsenite is primarily present in the neutral form in ph ranging from 1 to 9 22 and begins to dissociate at ph 9 22 to create h2aso3 ions before further dissociating to haso3 2 ions at ph 12 3 at ph 1 2 2 arsenate appears as the neutral form of h3aso4 and begins to deprotonate at ph 2 2 7 08 and 11 5 to create h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 ions respectively 5 arsenate removal is often easier compared to arsenite removal due to the existence of uncharged arsenite in water whereas negatively charged arsenate can be easily attracted due to electrostatic interaction thus removing arsenic from water is frequently the only practical alternative for obtaining safe drinking water several conventional methods have been used for the remediation of arsenic from drinking water like adsorption coagulation ion exchange oxidation precipitation etc 6 9 most of the processes are material intensive expensive to operate have poor throughput and generate toxic sludge as well as liquid waste membrane technology can be a feasible solution for arsenic removal because of several advantages such as physical separation no additional chemical use easy scalability room temperature filtering and high efficiency for arsenic removal reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are the most often utilized membrane filtration techniques 10 polyamide pa based thin film composite tfc technology is extensively used to make ro and nf membranes 11 however both techniques have drawbacks such as the need for higher transmembrane pressure tmp and poor throughput nanotechnology offers new ways to improve the performance of ro and nf membranes by embedding nanomaterial into the thin selective layer of polyamide pa these new categories of membranes with incorporated nanomaterials in the pa layer are known as thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes nanomaterials doped into the dense layer of pa tfc membrane may enhance the membranes surface charge as a result selectivity of the membrane improved due to charge charge repulsion with enhanced permeate flux jeong et al 2007 first reported the preparation of the tfn membrane 12 they prepared a naa zeolite incorporated tfn ro membrane by embedding nanomaterials into the dense layer of pa the prepared tfn membrane exhibited improved permeability compared to the pristine tfc membrane while maintaining the rejection of salt several types of porous and nonporous nanomaterials such as silver carbon nanotube cnt graphene oxide multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt silica metal oxide tio2 alumina zeolites metal organic framework mof were utilized for tfn membrane the majority of tfc and tfn membranes are reported in flat sheet configuration 13 16 few studies are reported on tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes the high surface to volume ratio of this membrane arrangement allows for a scalable and compact design with increased throughput at lower tmp parthasarathy et al 1994 17 first reported the tfc hollow fiber membrane they coated the outer surface of porous hf by interfacial polymerization verissimo et al 2005 18 first reported the inner layer coating of tfc hollow fiber membrane they used polyetherimide pei hollow fiber membranes as a substrate formed a pa layer on the inner surface of the fiber and utilized this hollow fiber membrane for desalination at low pressure few studies are reported on the development of nanoparticle incorporated hollow fiber tfn membranes for water treatment for instance liu et al 2015 19 developed sapo 34 nanoparticles incorporated tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for multivalent electrolyte and micro pollutant molecules rejection plisko et al 2018 20 developed fullerenol c60 oh 22 24 incorporated tfn hollow fiber membrane for lysozyme rejection with enhanced antifouling characteristics compared to the tfc membrane gai et al 2019 21 lin et al 2019 22 and guo et al 2020 23 developed tfn hollow fiber membrane for brackish water desalination by incorporating na modified carbon quantum dots modified hkust 1 and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poss nanomaterials in the pa layer respectively tian et al 2020 24 and jiang et al 2021 25 developed tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for divalent salt rejection by incorporating graphene oxide go and covalent organic frameworks cof in the pa layer respectively lan et al 2021 26 reported a novel 3 dimensional 3d hollow cup like macrocyclic compound based tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for boron removal gorriz et al 2021 27 developed mil 101 cr mof based tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for dye removal very few studies reported on mof incorporated tfn hollow fiber membranes for water treatment copper benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylate cubtc is a well studied mof used for membrane application cubtc framework containing cu metal units coordinated by four carboxylic functional groups thus creating a three dimensional network with nanoscale channels 0 9 0 9 nm2 28 29 these unique channels are suitable to transport water molecules and are capable of rejecting solutes of a certain size this mof provides a highly porous structure and hydrophilic functional cooh group suitable for polyamide dense layer modification therefore cubtc incorporated tfn membrane used for nf application is promising due to water molecules moving quickly through the framework flow channel and enhanced solute rejection as a result of the steric exclusion effects 30 cubtc can be mixed with an aqueous phase monomer to form a dense layer of pa that can improve the membrane pure water flux and surface charge without affecting its selectivity only a few research have been reported about cubtc nanoparticles for nf membrane application misdan et al 2019 31 developed a novel cubtc incorporated tfn flat sheet nanofiltration membrane they first prepared a nanocomposite substrate membrane by incorporation of cubtc nanoparticle in psf followed by the ip process of pip and tmc to develop a top selective layer over the membrane surface the permeability salt selectivity and antifouling nature of the membrane were enhanced due to the addition of the cubtc in the polymer matrix sharma et al 2021 32 modify the active layer of commercial flat sheet nf membrane surface by cubtc pva coating to enhance the performance of the membrane mozafari et al 2019 33 developed a loose flat sheet nf membrane by the formation of a thin film cubtc cluster on the chitosan cs coated pes membrane surface the developed cubtc cs coated membrane exhibits higher manganese rejection 86 compared to cs coated membrane manganese rejection 78 sani et al 2015 2016 34 35 developed a mixed matrix solvent resistant nanofiltration srnf flat sheet membrane by incorporation of cubtc in polyphenylsulfone ppsu polymer the developed mixed matrix membranes were used for dye methanol separation permeate flux and dye rejection of the membrane improved due to the addition of cubtc nanoparticles in ppsu as detailed in the perceiving discussion hf configuration is more suited for real life application due to their high scalability and improved performance at lower tmp however there is no study reporting cubtc incorporated tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for real life application like arsenic remediation from groundwater thus cubtc incorporated tfn nf hollow fiber membrane has become an interesting research topic with much scope to study with this notion tfn hf membrane was developed by incorporating cubtc in the pa layer on the inner surface of the psf hollow fiber membrane substrate in this study a small amount of cubtc mof was mixed in organic tmc solution for the ip reaction between mpd and cubtc tmc producing high flux tfn hollow fiber membranes sem xps afm permeability contact angle mwco and surface zeta potential were used to analyze the developed hollow fiber membranes the main objective of this study is to fabricate and characterization of mof incorporated advanced tfn hollow fiber membrane and their application in arsenic removal for the very first time tfn hf nf membrane was used for arsenic rejection application long term performance of the developed tfn hf nf membrane was tested for arsenate rejection from artificially arsenic contaminated groundwater 2 experiment 2 1

rejection of the developed hf membrane are illustrated in fig 9 arsenic rejection tests were carried out on the prepared hollow fiber membranes using 70 μg l synthetic arsenate solution at a fixed 1 bar tmp and neutral ph individual experiments of arsenic rejection using a synthetic solution were carried out for each membrane arsenic was normally oxidized with water to produce arsenate oxide aso4 3 4 60 tfc and tfn membranes have a higher rejection than psf membranes as shown in fig 9 a psf membrane exhibits only 8 6 arsenate rejection with the permeate flux 74 6 l m2h at 1 bar tmp psf membranes show less arsenate rejection due to the membrane surface having less negative zeta potential and the absence of carboxylic and amine compounds on the surface of the membrane 61 tfc and tfn hf membranes exhibit significant rejection of arsenate tfc and tfn hf membranes reject 84 9 and 85 8 of arsenate with permeate fluxes of 3 8 l m2h and 15 6 l m2h respectively the negatively charged arsenate oxides aso4 3 were repelled by the negative surface charge of the modified hf membrane higher arsenic rejection was observed by the tfc and tfn hf membrane surfaces due to electrical repulsion donnan exclusion between the negatively charged arsenate oxide and the negative membrane surface arsenate rejection is similar for tfc and tfn membranes although the tfn membrane has a higher permeate flux compared to the tfc membrane although the tfn membrane has a higher porosity than the tfc membrane as shown in table 1 the donnan exclusion is influential more than the size exclusion for arsenate rejection at neutral ph the zeta potential of the tfn membrane 37 4 mv is higher than that of the tfc membrane 17 2 mv cubtc embedded tfn hf membranes are thus appropriate for arsenate rejection with enhanced permeate flux as a result the tfn membrane was chosen for future investigation 3 3 2 tfn membrane salt rejection the permeate flux and rejection of nacl and na2so4 for tfn membrane at 1 bar tmp 1000 mg l feed concentration and ph 7 are shown in fig 10 tfn membrane tests were carried out with synthetic nacl and na2so4 solutions na2so4 salt rejection is higher compared to nacl rejection due to the electrostatic repulsion of so4 2 in the divalent na2so4 salt being greater than that of cl in monovalent nacl salt na2so4 and nacl salts are rejected because the tfn membrane has a negative surface charge at normal ph tfn hollow fiber membrane exhibits the rejection of nacl and na2so4 is 41 8 and 72 9 with permeate fluxes of 15 2 l m2h and 15 4 l m2h

concentration at different tmp with solution ph 7 arsenic rejection and permeate flux at different tmp by tfn hollow fiber membrane is presented in fig 11 it is observed in fig 9 that permeate flux of the membrane increase and arsenic rejection slightly decreases with tmp for example permeate flux of the membrane increases from 15 4 l m2h to 44 7 l m2h and the rejection of the as v decreases from 85 8 to 80 7 as the tmp increases from 1 bar to 3 bar due to increased driving force at higher tmp more as v ions are convected across the membrane reducing its rejection convective flux through the nf membrane predominates at higher tmp which reduces the rejection of as v 3 3 4 arsenic contaminated natural groundwater treatment tfn hollow fiber membrane was performed for arsenate rejection studies of artificially arsenic contaminated groundwater feed solution of 35 50 70 and 90 μg l arsenate concentration at 1 bar tmp with solution ph 7 rejection and permeate concentration of arsenate with different feed concentrations by tfn hollow fiber membrane is presented in fig 12 a it is observed from fig 12 a that as v rejections were in the range of 83 to 85 for the feed concentrations of as v varying from 35 μg l to 90 μg l tfn hollow fiber membrane shows less than 10 μg l permissible limit of arsenic is 10 μg l arsenic permeate concentration at 35 μg l and 50 μg l feed concentration permeate concentration increases from 5 2 μg l to 15 μg l as the feed concentration increases from 35 μg l to 90 μg l for the tfn membrane the arsenic permeates flux of the tmf membrane at 1 bar tmp remains constant at 15 2 1 2 l m2h for different arsenic feed concentrations at lower feed arsenic concentrations tfn membranes exhibit arsenic permeate concentrations within the permissible limit less than 10 μg l long duration arsenic contaminated groundwater filtration experiment was carried out at 1 bar tmp with 70 μg l arsenic concentration by tfn membrane fig 12 b shows the permeate flux and arsenic concentration profiles by tfn membrane permeates flux decreases from 15 6 l m2h to 12 5 l m2h for groundwater in 36 h as shown in fig 12 b high molecular weight solutes are present in natural groundwater which results in the formation of a gel layer over the membrane surface that grows with time leading to declining of permeate flux with time after 15 h operation the membrane reached almost steady state transport behaviour with permeate flux and arsenate rejection about 13 l m2h and 80 respectively at normal ph the tfn membrane has a negative zeta potential mentioned in section 3 5 due to the negative membrane surface charge arsenate was rejected by the donnan exclusion mechanism due to the existence of other competing ions in groundwater arsenic rejection reduces from 84 4 to 79 4 after 36 h table 3 reported the other feed and permeate parameters after 36 h run tfn membrane was also able to reject 41 6 of tds 42 8 of hardness and 41 1 of iron from groundwater long term stability and durability of tfn membrane exhibited for arsenate remediation from arsenic contaminated groundwater fig 12 c represents the edx spectrum of the inner surface of the tfn membrane after filtration of the as v synthetic solution to confirm the mechanism of arsenate rejection by the donnan exclusion principle by the tfn membrane therefore regeneration of the membrane is not required for long duration run only periodical water backwash is sufficient to minimize the reversible fouling of the membrane the weight percent of different elements are carbon 69 67 oxygen 54 52 nitrogen 1 95 sulfur 3 35 and copper 0 51 it can be observed that the inner surface of the tfn membrane does not contain as indicating that arsenic is not adsorbed on the membrane surface 4

rejection between 70 and 96 the arsenate permeability of commercial nf membrane shows in the range of 0 24 to 8 l m2h bar the arsenate permeability in the present work is 15 6 l m2h bar which is higher than the reported commercial nf membrane in the present work the developed hollow fiber cubtc tfn nf membrane is operated at lower tmp 1 bar compare to the flat sheet nf membrane arsenate rejection by cubtc tfn nf hollow fiber membrane attained is as high as 85 8 and is comparable with other references 5 conclusions for nanofiltration application cubtc integrated tfn hollow fiber membranes were developed using an interfacial polymerization method the lumen surface of the psf hf membrane was coated with a selective thin polyamide layer adding a small amount of cubtc into polyamide film increased the permeability of the tfn hf membrane significantly the tfn hf membrane exhibit 16 6 l m2h bar pure water permeability 1723 da mwco and 10 6 å average pore radius furthermore at neutral ph the developed tfn membrane had a substantially negative zeta potential 37 4 mv and a hydrophilic surface contact angle 40 at 1 bar operating tmp the tfc and tfn membranes rejected 84 9 and 85 8 of arsenate with permeate fluxes of 3 8 l m2h and 15 6 l m2h respectively tfn membrane was used to treat arsenic affected natural groundwater that had been artificially contaminated arsenate rejection in groundwater was 84 4 79 4 at 1 bar tmp with pure water permeate flux of 12 5 l m2h the tfn hollow fiber membrane was able to remove 41 6 of tds 42 8 of hardness and 41 1 of iron from groundwater the addition of a small quantity of cubtc in the polyamide layer improved the throughput considerably without affecting the selectivity of arsenate therefore favorable

transmembrane pressure toc total organic carbon who world health organization xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1 introduction nowadays arsenic contamination in groundwater has become a global concern inorganic arsenic is exceedingly toxic and carcinogenic to all living entities drinking arsenic contaminated water has recently been identified as one of the most serious health concerns high levels of arsenic as in water pose a serious concern to public health since they can lead to skin diseases and ultimately cancer 1 world health organization who guidelines state that arsenic levels in drinking water should not exceed 10 μg l as concentrations has been frequently reported to be in the range from 0 5 to 5000 μg l in groundwater samples of over 70 nations in the world 2 arsenic exists in various oxidation states including arsenite as 3 arsenic as0 arsenate as 5 and arsine as 3 each with varying degrees of toxicity 3 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the two primary forms of arsenic that exist in natural water bodies according to studies as iii is more toxic compared to as v 4 arsenite is primarily present in the neutral form in ph ranging from 1 to 9 22 and begins to dissociate at ph 9 22 to create h2aso3 ions before further dissociating to haso3 2 ions at ph 12 3 at ph 1 2 2 arsenate appears as the neutral form of h3aso4 and begins to deprotonate at ph 2 2 7 08 and 11 5 to create h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 ions respectively 5 arsenate removal is often easier compared to arsenite removal due to the existence of uncharged arsenite in water whereas negatively charged arsenate can be easily attracted due to electrostatic interaction thus removing arsenic from water is frequently the only practical alternative for obtaining safe drinking water several conventional methods have been used for the remediation of arsenic from drinking water like adsorption coagulation ion exchange oxidation precipitation etc 6 9 most of the processes are material intensive expensive to operate have poor throughput and generate toxic sludge as well as liquid waste membrane technology can be a feasible solution for arsenic removal because of several advantages such as physical separation no additional chemical use easy scalability room temperature filtering and high efficiency for arsenic removal reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are the most often utilized membrane filtration techniques 10 polyamide pa based thin film composite tfc technology is extensively used to make ro and nf membranes 11 however both techniques have drawbacks such as the need for higher transmembrane pressure tmp and poor throughput nanotechnology offers new ways to improve the performance of ro and nf membranes by embedding nanomaterial into the thin selective layer of polyamide pa these new categories of membranes with incorporated nanomaterials in the pa layer are known as thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes nanomaterials doped into the dense layer of pa tfc membrane may enhance the membranes surface charge as a result selectivity of the membrane improved due to charge charge repulsion with enhanced permeate flux jeong et al 2007 first reported the preparation of the tfn membrane 12 they prepared a naa zeolite incorporated tfn ro membrane by embedding nanomaterials into the dense layer of pa the prepared tfn membrane exhibited improved permeability compared to the pristine tfc membrane while maintaining the rejection of salt several types of porous and nonporous nanomaterials such as silver carbon nanotube cnt graphene oxide multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt silica metal oxide tio2 alumina zeolites metal organic framework mof were utilized for tfn membrane the majority of tfc and tfn membranes are reported in flat sheet configuration 13 16 few studies are reported on tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes the high surface to volume ratio of this membrane arrangement allows for a scalable and compact design with increased throughput at lower tmp parthasarathy et al 1994 17 first reported the tfc hollow fiber membrane they coated the outer surface of porous hf by interfacial polymerization verissimo et al 2005 18 first

hollow fiber membrane for desalination at low pressure few studies are reported on the development of nanoparticle incorporated hollow fiber tfn membranes for water treatment for instance liu et al

cof in the pa layer respectively lan et al 2021 26 reported a novel 3 dimensional 3d hollow cup like macrocyclic compound based tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for boron removal gorriz et al 2021 27 developed mil 101 cr mof based tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for dye removal very few studies reported on mof incorporated tfn hollow fiber membranes for water treatment copper benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylate cubtc is a well studied mof used for membrane application cubtc framework containing cu metal units coordinated by four carboxylic functional groups thus creating a three dimensional network with nanoscale channels 0 9 0 9 nm2 28 29 these unique channels are suitable to transport water molecules and are capable of rejecting solutes of a certain size this mof provides a highly porous structure and hydrophilic functional cooh group suitable for polyamide dense layer modification therefore cubtc incorporated tfn membrane used for nf application is promising due to water molecules moving quickly through the framework flow channel and enhanced solute rejection as a result of the steric exclusion effects 30 cubtc can be mixed with an aqueous phase monomer to form a dense layer of pa that can improve the membrane pure water flux and surface charge without affecting its selectivity only a few research have been reported about cubtc nanoparticles for nf membrane application misdan et al 2019 31 developed a novel cubtc incorporated tfn flat sheet nanofiltration membrane they first prepared a nanocomposite substrate membrane by incorporation of cubtc nanoparticle in psf followed by the ip process of pip and tmc to develop a top selective layer over the membrane surface the permeability salt selectivity and antifouling nature of the membrane were enhanced due to the addition of the cubtc in the polymer matrix sharma et al 2021 32 modify the active layer of commercial flat sheet nf membrane surface by cubtc pva coating to enhance the performance of the membrane mozafari et al 2019 33 developed a loose flat sheet nf membrane by the formation of a thin film cubtc cluster on the chitosan cs coated pes membrane surface the developed cubtc cs coated membrane exhibits higher manganese rejection 86 compared to cs coated membrane manganese rejection 78 sani et al 2015 2016 34 35 developed a mixed matrix solvent resistant nanofiltration srnf flat sheet membrane by incorporation of cubtc in polyphenylsulfone ppsu polymer the developed mixed matrix membranes were used for dye methanol separation permeate flux and dye rejection of the membrane improved due to the addition of cubtc nanoparticles in ppsu as detailed in the perceiving discussion hf configuration is more suited for real life application due to their high scalability and improved performance at lower tmp however there is no study reporting cubtc incorporated tfn nf hollow fiber membrane for real life application like arsenic remediation from groundwater thus cubtc incorporated tfn nf hollow fiber membrane has become an interesting research topic with much scope to study with this notion tfn hf membrane was developed by incorporating cubtc in the pa layer on the inner surface of the psf hollow fiber membrane substrate in this study a small amount of cubtc mof was mixed in organic tmc solution for the ip reaction between mpd and cubtc

repulsion donnan exclusion between the negatively charged arsenate oxide and the negative membrane surface arsenate rejection is similar for tfc and tfn membranes although the tfn membrane has a higher permeate flux compared to the tfc membrane although the tfn membrane has a higher porosity than the tfc membrane as shown in table 1 the donnan exclusion is influential more than the size exclusion for arsenate rejection at neutral ph the zeta potential of the tfn membrane 37 4 mv is higher than that of the tfc membrane 17 2 mv cubtc embedded tfn hf membranes are thus appropriate for arsenate rejection with enhanced permeate flux as a result the tfn membrane was chosen for future investigation 3 3 2 tfn membrane salt rejection the permeate flux and rejection of nacl and na2so4 for tfn membrane at 1 bar tmp 1000 mg l feed concentration and ph 7 are shown in fig 10 tfn membrane tests were carried out with synthetic nacl and na2so4 solutions na2so4 salt rejection is higher compared to nacl rejection due to the electrostatic repulsion of so4 2 in the divalent na2so4 salt being greater than that of cl in monovalent nacl salt na2so4 and nacl salts are rejected because the tfn membrane has a negative surface charge at normal ph tfn hollow fiber membrane exhibits the rejection of nacl and na2so4 is 41 8 and 72 9 with permeate fluxes of 15 2 l m2h and 15 4 l m2h respectively 3 3 3 rejection of arsenic at different tmp by tfn membrane tfn hollow fiber membrane was performed for arsenic rejection studies of synthetic feed solution of 70 μg l arsenic concentration at different tmp with solution ph 7 arsenic rejection and permeate flux at different tmp by tfn hollow fiber membrane is presented in fig 11 it is observed in fig 9 that permeate flux of the membrane increase and arsenic rejection slightly decreases with tmp for example permeate flux of the membrane increases from 15 4 l m2h to 44 7 l m2h and the rejection of the as v decreases from 85 8 to 80 7 as the tmp increases from 1 bar to 3 bar due to increased driving force at higher tmp more as v ions are convected across the membrane reducing its rejection convective flux through the nf membrane predominates at higher tmp which reduces the rejection of as v 3 3 4 arsenic contaminated natural groundwater treatment tfn hollow fiber membrane was performed for arsenate rejection studies of artificially arsenic contaminated groundwater feed solution of 35 50 70 and 90 μg l arsenate concentration at 1 bar tmp with solution ph 7 rejection and permeate concentration of arsenate with different feed concentrations by tfn hollow fiber membrane is presented in fig 12 a it is observed from fig 12 a that as v rejections were in the range of 83 to 85 for the feed concentrations of as v varying from 35 μg l to 90 μg l tfn hollow fiber membrane shows less than 10 μg l permissible limit of arsenic is 10 μg l arsenic permeate concentration at 35 μg l and 50 μg l feed concentration permeate concentration increases from 5 2 μg l to 15 μg l as the feed concentration increases from 35 μg l to 90 μg l for the tfn membrane the arsenic permeates flux of the tmf membrane at 1 bar tmp remains constant at 15 2 1 2 l m2h for different arsenic feed concentrations at lower feed arsenic concentrations tfn membranes exhibit arsenic permeate concentrations within the permissible limit less than 10 μg l long duration arsenic contaminated groundwater filtration experiment was carried out at 1 bar tmp with 70 μg l arsenic concentration by tfn membrane fig 12 b shows the permeate flux and arsenic concentration profiles by tfn membrane permeates flux decreases from 15 6 l m2h to 12 5 l m2h for groundwater in 36 h as shown in fig 12 b high molecular weight solutes are present in natural groundwater which results in the formation of a gel layer over the membrane surface that grows with time leading to declining of permeate flux with time after 15 h operation the membrane reached almost steady state transport behaviour with permeate flux and arsenate rejection about 13 l m2h and 80 respectively at normal ph the tfn membrane has a negative zeta potential mentioned in section 3 5 due to the negative membrane surface charge arsenate was rejected by the donnan exclusion mechanism due to the existence of other competing ions in groundwater arsenic rejection reduces from 84 4 to 79 4 after 36 h table 3 reported the other feed and permeate parameters after 36 h run tfn membrane was also able to reject 41 6 of tds 42 8 of hardness and 41 1 of iron from groundwater long term stability and durability of tfn membrane exhibited for arsenate remediation from arsenic contaminated groundwater fig 12 c represents the edx spectrum of the inner surface of the tfn membrane after filtration of the as v synthetic solution to confirm the mechanism of arsenate rejection by the donnan exclusion principle by the tfn membrane therefore regeneration of the membrane is not required for long duration run only periodical water backwash is sufficient to minimize the reversible fouling of the membrane the weight percent of different elements are carbon 69 67 oxygen 54 52 nitrogen 1 95 sulfur 3 35 and copper 0 51 it can be observed that the inner surface of the tfn membrane does not contain as indicating that arsenic is not adsorbed on the membrane surface 4 comparison of the prepared hollow fiber membrane separation performance with other nf membranes a comparison of the performance of cubtc incorporated tfn hollow fiber membrane developed in this work with other commercial nf grade membranes is presented in table 4 it is observed from this table that most of the commercial nf membranes are operated at high tmp 5 to 15 5 bar and exhibit arsenate rejection between 70 and 96 the arsenate permeability of commercial nf membrane shows in the range of 0 24 to 8 l m2h bar the arsenate permeability in the present work is 15 6 l m2h bar which is higher than the reported commercial nf membrane in the present work the developed hollow fiber cubtc tfn nf membrane is operated at lower tmp 1 bar compare to the flat sheet nf membrane arsenate rejection by cubtc tfn nf hollow fiber membrane attained is as high as 85 8 and is comparable with other references 5 conclusions for nanofiltration application cubtc integrated tfn hollow fiber membranes were developed using an interfacial polymerization method the lumen surface of the psf hf membrane was coated with a selective thin polyamide layer adding a small amount of cubtc into polyamide film increased the permeability of the tfn hf membrane significantly the tfn hf membrane exhibit 16 6 l m2h bar pure water permeability 1723 da mwco and 10 6 å average pore radius furthermore at neutral ph the developed tfn membrane had a substantially negative zeta potential 37 4 mv and a hydrophilic surface contact angle 40 at 1 bar operating tmp the tfc and tfn membranes rejected 84 9 and 85 8 of arsenate with permeate fluxes of 3 8 l m2h and 15 6 l m2h respectively tfn membrane was used to treat arsenic affected natural groundwater that had been artificially contaminated arsenate rejection in groundwater was 84 4 79 4 at 1 bar tmp with pure water permeate flux of 12 5 l m2h the tfn hollow fiber membrane was able to remove 41 6 of tds 42 8 of hardness and 41 1 of iron from groundwater the addition of a small quantity of cubtc in the polyamide layer improved the throughput considerably without affecting the selectivity of arsenate therefore favorable modifications were introduced by the formation of a thin film nanocomposite pa layer on the lumen surface of the hf membrane for removing arsenic from an aqueous solution credit authorship

12599,greywater could take up a major portion of domestic wastewater thus recycling and reuse of greywater positively promote sustainable water to cope with water shortage and demand in this study ammonium adsorption from greywater via natural zeolites and ammonium recovery using nacl and naoh were comparatively investigated column tests were performed for ammonium adsorption as well as natural zeolite regeneration ammonium adsorption was terminated after ct c0 10 following adsorption regeneration phase was carried out using 25 l of regenerant for 2 5 h in the treatment with naoh as the regenerant solution accumulated ammonia was subsequently eliminated by air stripping using a newly developed water spray reactor it was found that no significant ammonium exchange capacity was observed between treatments which was 3 23 0 03 and 3 24 0 03 mg nh4 per g zeolites for nacl and naoh respectively the average regeneration efficiency by nacl was 95 7 1 2 whereas 94 4 9 5 was obtained from that of naoh regeneration in general the amount of nacl needed for traditional regeneration was 181 g to recover 1 g of ammonium whereas the combination of air stripping with naoh only required 12 g naoh theoretically the conventional method by utilizing nacl for regeneration burdens the chemical expenses as much as 50 more expensive than that of using naoh with the combination of air stripping technique furthermore unlike ion exchange loop stripping method no supplementary naoh and ph adjustment was done within 10 times of regeneration cycles which enabled a simple operation and an efficient utilization of naoh ammonia removal efficiency using water spray reactor was relatively stable effective and satisfying 97 compared to that of using a stripping vessel graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords air stripping ammonium removal and recovery greywater natural zeolites data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction greywater any household wastewater excluding toilet discharges can take up to 91 of global domestic wastewater 1 this type of domestic wastewater contains some substantial amounts of pollutant such as ammonium due to ammonium salts and surfactants from detergents and other cleaning agents thus proper treatment of greywater is necessary prior to recycling and reuse unfortunately greywater reclamation and segregation from domestic wastewater are not common practices in developing countries although segregation and recycling of greywater are advantageous to cope with water shortage and demand problems one study 2 presumed that 17 separation of greywater from the main stream could lessen the operational prerequisite of aeration in wastewater plant furthermore recycling and reuse of greywater might have helped to sustain water of 30 for gardening and toilet flushing 3 other useful applications of greywater could involve irrigation for lawns golf field vehicle washing fire protection and wetland preservation 4 communal scale of greywater treatment with simple operation can be a direction to start for enforcing the water sustainability in developing countries advances in technologies for water and wastewater treatments have been rapidly evolved 5 10 as well as those that have been investigated specifically for ammonium removal and recovery ion exchange via natural zeolites has drawn attention for applications because these materials are able to offer several advantages i e ease and simplicity of operation and maintenance relatively abundant availability and possibility for species recovery 11 12 the efficiency of natural zeolites upon ammonium removal is subject to numerous factors contact time type of zeolites initial concentration zeolite loading and particle sizes are usually taken into account in determining the characteristics of natural zeolites applications of natural zeolites to remove ammonium are wide open for treating water and wastewater such as anaerobic membrane bioreactor permeates 13 landfill leachate 14 municipal wastewater 15 swine wastewater permeates 16 more applications of natural zeolites for ammonium removal are encouraged since this technique shows a promising alternative for water and wastewater treatment even though the studies of ammonium removal from greywater particularly via natural zeolites and its recovery have been investigated 17 however the ones focusing on the regeneration of natural zeolites with the combination of air stripping have rarely been investigated regeneration of natural zeolites is one of the challenges during operation because regeneration normally requires a large volume of regenerant solutions sodium chloride nacl is commonly used for regeneration sodium ions replace the ammonium ions adsorbed on active sites in the natural zeolites thus ammonium ions can be eventually released the amount of sodium chloride for regeneration can range between 30 and 116 g l to attain the desired regeneration efficiency of 90 18 19 remarkably the consumptions of regenerant often take up around 50 60 of the total operational cost 20 more studies are thus encouraged to develop better approaches and alleviate operational and maintenance cost due to high dosage of regenerant in addition some studies examined the combination of ion exchange and simultaneous air stripping technique in ion exchange loop stripping process one study used naoh as the sole regenerant solutions and concluded that the benefit of air stripping technique was to lower the usage of chemicals and energy during regeneration phase that led to overall process intensification 21 while ellersdorfer 22 investigated the ion exchange loop stripping of sludge liquor that used nacl for regenerant and found that simultaneous air stripping helped to enhance the regeneration rate up to 64 8 compared to that in conventional nacl regeneration which yielded around 50 efficiency while both studies 21 22 succinctly introduced a breakthrough concept for zeolite regeneration through ion exchange loop stripping method however both did not further discuss the comparative examinations of two different regenerants i e nacl naoh nor did they review on how the usage of typical regenerant could economically improve or burden the expenses during regeneration phase furthermore the concentration of undesorbed ammonium was around 50 which implies that the regeneration process was quite ineffective another issue pertaining to the operation of ion exchange loop stripping was the instability of ammonia removal by a stripping vessel the average concentration of stripped ammonia was only 62 21 based on these issues this paper offers an approach that shows an efficient utilization of naoh and performs an improvement of ammonia removal efficiency using a water spray reactor via air stripping method in this paper the feasibility of an alternative approach for ammonia removal and recovery from greywater using the combination of ion exchange and air stripping method was assessed following adsorption the recovery of ammonium was carried out using naoh and subsequently air stripping technique was performed to remove ammonia from regenerant so that the solution could be utilized up to ten sequential cycles unlike ion exchange loop stripping method no supplementary naoh and ph adjustment was done which allowed a simple operation and an efficient utilization of naoh in the final discussion section an economic analysis was further examined to gain an insight on how chemical expenses could be improved when using naoh instead of nacl 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorption phase the commercial natural zeolites were obtained from the district of gyeongbuk south korea zeolites were prepared by washing and drying in the oven 105 c prior to use particle size chosen was between 1 18 and 2 36 mm no chemical modification nor any additional procedure was done during the preparation of natural zeolites customarily characterization of materials used was technically carried out by x ray diffraction xrd and or x ray fluorescent xrf and any other additional analyses such as scanning electron microscope sem and or transmission electron microscopy tem 7 9 23 25 the characteristics of natural zeolites used in this study i e chemical composition mineral characterization adsorption kinetic isotherm and thermodynamics had been examined and discussed elsewhere clinoptilolite and mordenite were among the identified minerals in the natural zeolites with 80 89 sio2 and 9 34 al2o3 19 the synthetic greywater was made from nh4cl stock samchun south korea 50 mg l n concentration was attained by dilution other chemical compounds were added and formulated according to abed scholz 26 with some modifications table 1 all chemicals used were analytical grade with the purity approximately around 99 adsorption of ammonium from greywater solutions was carried out in an acrylic column 5 cm internal diameter 100 cm height packed with 1 32 kg natural zeolites a peristaltic pump at vertical velocity of 5 m h 164 ml min was used to feed the influent in an up flow direction the adsorption was terminated when breakthrough was achieved at 5 mg l ct c0 10 the calculation eq 1 of loaded ammonium was as follows 1 loaded ammonium q l c 0 c t v g m z wherein ql total mass g of ammonium adsorbed until breakthrough time per mass of zeolites g c0 initial ammonium concentration mg l ct ammonium concentration in the effluent solutions during adsorption phase mg l vg refers to the volume of greywater for the given operation time l and mz mass of the natural zeolites g any amount of ammonium left in the zeolites was also added in the loaded ammonium calculation the column was washed with water prior to entering regeneration phase ammonium concentration was measured spectrophotometrically with dr 3900 hach usa the ion exchange during adsorption was analytically observed by ion chromatography instrument dionex aquion thermofisher usa 2 2 regeneration phase and air stripping of ammonia regeneration between two types of regenerant was compared nacl and naoh both with similar 0 5 mol l molarity were separately made for different regeneration treatments concentration of 0 5 mol l was chosen based on the preliminary experiments data not shown the total amount of regenerant solutions was 25 l for each treatment which lasted for 2 5 h the regeneration was carried out in a downflow direction using a peristaltic pump at vertical velocity of 5 m h 164 ml min the recovered amount of ammonium or ammonia in the regenerant solutions was measured by spectrophotometer dr 3900 hach usa regeneration efficiency was calculated below eq 2 2 regeneration efficiency x r x l 100 in which xr ammonium mass accumulated in the regenerant solutions mg xl ammonium mass adsorbed onto the natural zeolites mg after regeneration nacl solutions conventional method containing recovered ammonium did not undergo air stripping experimental setup for that of conventional nacl regeneration was performed according to fig 1 newly fresh nacl solutions were prepared for every cycle of regeneration with the total volume of 25 l conversely naoh solutions that contained the accumulated ammonium were recycled by air stripping method no adjustment of ph temperature nor additional fresh naoh was applied during air stripping of ammonia a water spray typed reactor was run to perform the air stripping of ammonia for 7 h the air stripping system worked as follows the regenerant solutions containing naoh were pumped and sprayed via the nozzles the liquid went back to the influent tank due to gravitational pull while spraying the blower produced subsequential air that enabled the mass transfer of ammonia in the liquid to the gas phase the ammonia was then pulled through and finally reacted with phosphoric acid in the acid tank the optimization of the reactor had been investigated separately 27 by the end of the stripping treatment ammonium free naoh solutions could be reused up to ten regeneration cycles the overall ammonium removal and recovery of ion exchange and air stripping system is illustrated in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium removal from greywater via adsorption using natural zeolites the influent solution during adsorption phase was prepared synthetically to resemble greywater characteristics and analyzed as presented in table 2 below depending on the sources of the greywater the concentrations of tn and tp could range from 1 1 to 74 mg l and 0 11 to 171 mg l respectively cod might vary from 26 to 2950 mg l turbidity could be up to 444 ntu whereas tss concentrations were between 7 and 1300 mg l 4 a study 26 categorized the type of greywater into two groups i e low and high concentration of greywater high concentration of greywater has the high strength chemical concentrations and the low ones are those solutions with lower strength of chemical concentrations the type of greywater in this study belongs to the low concentration greywater with the emphasis of ammonium concentrations because ammonium removal by natural zeolites is the main focus of this study in table 2 tn concentrations decreased drastically in the effluent in both nacl and naoh regeneration due to massive adsorption of ammonium ions onto the natural zeolites turbidity and ss also showed reductions in the effluents this might be due to the entrapment of solids in the column during adsorption nevertheless clogging did not occur until the tenth cycle ph of effluent generated from naoh regeneration was more alkaline than that of the influent solutions this might occur because small portions of remnants of regenerant were still found in the column in general the adsorption by natural zeolites has the striking impact on the reduction of the ammonium concentrations rather than other parameters as shown in table 2 prior to regeneration adsorption for both two treatments i e regeneration with nacl and naoh had been carried out in similar conditions table 3 shows the summary of ammonium exchange capacity aec and breakthrough time at 10 ct c0 for ten cycles breakthrough times for ten cycles were reached after 9 h with the tendency to slightly decrease as the cycles proceeded the average breakthrough times were 557 13 3 and 562 12 7 minutes for nacl and naoh regeneration respectively the aec describes the ammonium exchange capacity of the natural zeolites aec was calculated by determining the ratio of adsorbed ammonium ion in mg mass per g mass of natural zeolites it was found that average aec for both treatments was not significantly different this suggests that regeneration using nacl or naoh does not affect on overall aec the average aec values over ten cycles were 3 23 0 03 and 3 24 0 03 mg nh4 per g zeolites for nacl and naoh regeneration respectively the likelihood of decreasing exchange capacity compared to virgin zeolites was obvious after ten cycles for both treatments this agrees with other studies that aec decreased after repetitive usage 13 20 the exchange of ions during adsorption was observed by ion chromatography in fig 3 a several anions do not exhibit any significant change of concentration in samples taken before and after adsorption of ammonium from greywater the existence of anions such as f no2 no3 po4 3 so4 2 was derived either from the addition of chemical compounds or the readily available substances dissolved in the tap water solvent prepared for the influent no significant difference was recognized between anion concentrations in the influent and the effluent during adsorption stage cl concentration derived mostly from nh4cl was excluded from fig 3 a since the concentration outnumbered other anions the dynamics of cation concentrations can be identified in fig 3 b significant portions of na and nh4 were exchanged during the adsorption of ammonium and only small portions of extra framework cations i e k mg2 and ca2 evidently contributed to ion exchange during adsorption phase 3 2 ammonium recovery with two different regenerant solutions desorption of ammonium was done in 2 5 h by applying 25 l of regenerant solutions all analyses were presented in the unit concentration because the idea is to obtain the general insights on the mass balance between ammonium removal and recovery in a closed system fig 4 a presents the balance of ammonium adsorption and desorption for the entire cycles the average regeneration efficiency re by nacl was 95 7 1 2 with the average of undesorbed portions of ammonium was 0 14 0 04 mg per mass of zeolites g whereas the average re by naoh was 94 4 9 5 the average of undesorbed amount of ammonium was 0 18 0 14 mg per zeolite mass g fig 4 b additionally the performance of a newly developed water spray reactor was evaluated fig 5 the average ammonia removal efficiency of air striping process by the reactor was 97 9 0 9 the fluctuations of the efficiency occur since the air stripping process relies on the available alkaline ph while in this experiment no additional fresh naoh regenerant was included generally compared to ion exchange loop stripping our method exhibited more stable and satisfying performance especially during air stripping of ammonia by newly developed reactor the ammonia removal efficiency was relatively high using water spray reactor in water spray reactor the influent water went through some serial nozzles so that the water droplets were subsequentially scattered in the molecular perspective the driving force of mass transfer of gaseous ammonia from liquid to air phase was effectively promoted by sheer stress on the water droplets surface which created interfacial area between air water 29 30 ph is considered one of the notable parameters beside temperature water and air flow rate in air stripping of ammonia when ph of the solution is moved towards alkaline condition i e ph above 9 the equilibrium is shifted to the right side of the equation eq 3 below 3 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o more available molecular ammonia is present if the ph is higher than ph 9 conversely ammonium ions are more readily available if the ph is below ph 9 in ph 9 25 at 25 c ionization fraction of total ammonia nitrogen tan species appeared in equivalent proportions 31 fig 6 a describes ion exchange between sodium and ammonium ions during regeneration phase by nacl in general more sodium ions were required to desorb ammonium ions on the natural zeolites it was notice that in average 9 43 mg of sodium ions were exchanged to attain 1 mg of ammonium ions in the experiments with naoh as the regenerant it was concluded that 1 mg of ammonium ions was desorbed by 7 27 mg of sodium ions fig 6 b according to fig 6 b the strength of sodium solutions weakens as the cycles proceed further the apparent loss of sodium starts after the sixth cycle following the loss of sodium ions there is a significant drop of desorbed ammonium ions by the end of the tenth cycle the dynamics of sodium ion concentration before and after regeneration phase are presented in fig 7 in fig 7 a the average amount of sodium ion 11 549 101 mg l regenerant in the influent is similar to each other in all cycles this is due to the supply of the newly fresh nacl regenerants every time the regeneration phase took place while in the effluent the average amount of available sodium ion is consistent around 10 032 105 mg l regenerant for every cycle it is worth to notice that the remaining sodium ions in the regenerant solutions were incredibly excessive roughly only 13 of the total sodium ions were actually exchanged with ammonium ions which equated re of 95 during a cycle of regeneration consequently 87 of sodium ions were wasted and unused furthermore fresh water should be prepared for every cycle of nacl regeneration meanwhile in the regenerant solutions that used naoh a remarkable decline of available sodium ions was evident fig 7 b the decline occurred due to no additional fresh naoh in every cycle of the regeneration the first four cycles of regeneration provided 100 re and it had declined as the cycles carried on this strategy is considered more efficient than that of traditional regeneration using nacl because the available sodium ions were efficiently used during regeneration with less excessive amount being wasted 3 3 economic analysis with respect to chemical expenses for regeneration phase in the previous section the combination of air stripping system coupled with naoh as the regenerant solution was able to aid the regeneration of natural zeolites up to ten cycles although significant drop of ammonium desorption was obvious in the last cycle due to a considerable loss of sodium ions in the regenerant solutions to highlight the advantages of this approach are as follows 1 the approach by applying the combination of air stripping of ammonia with naoh does not involve additional fresh regenerant for every cycle of regeneration thus the usage of water and chemical can be carefully managed 2 there is no adjustment of ph because no additional naoh is needed 3 the air stripping system is a closed system which enables an efficient usage of recycling air gas for mass transfer of ammonia and lastly 4 the ammonium recovery in the form of ammonium phosphate is possible which can be used as materials for fertilizer ultimately the concept of environmentally friendly approach is encouraged as opposed to the conventional nacl regeneration which obliges the preparation of newly fresh regenerant solutions the requirement of chemicals for regeneration of the natural zeolites for ammonium removal from the greywater was determined in table 4 the daily volume of greywater putatively collected from the residential area was projected around 100 m3 32 which was derived from 400 households the estimation was made based on the ammonium concentration at 50 mg l with 95 desorption by nacl regeneration and 94 desorption by naoh this study revealed that in conventional method 181 g of nacl is required to recover 1 g of ammonium while the mass of naoh needed is around 12 g table 4 reviews the total dosage of both nacl and naoh needed in the regeneration and the expenses attributed to it the price was based on nacl price at 40 ton and naoh at 300 ton 13 according to table 4 the annual cost when employing naoh with no additional fresh naoh involvement can be reduced almost up to 50 compared to that of nacl regeneration it shall be noticed that the additional cost for running air stripping method should apply when naoh regeneration is chosen likewise the additional cost for handling the nacl regenerant should be considered to summarize the combination of air stripping technique with naoh during zeolite regeneration has numerous benefits in terms of economic and environmental impacts 4 conclusions regeneration has always been one of the challenges when natural zeolites are utilized for ammonium removal traditional regeneration using nacl prompts excess use of chemical and water meanwhile ion exchange loop stripping might be feasible for an alternative simultaneous regeneration of natural zeolites however additional naoh and ph adjustment monitoring had to be constantly maintained this study introduces a new approach of naoh utilization in which additional naoh and ph adjustment monitoring can simply be negligible during the operation additionally it was also found that ammonia removal efficiency via air stripping using water spray reactor was relatively more stable and satisfying than that from a stripping vessel the lab scale demonstration of ammonium removal and recovery from greywater with the combination of air stripping of ammonia was thoroughly investigated the adsorption of ammonium of both two treatments i e nacl and naoh showed relatively similar aec values aec from nacl regeneration was 3 23 0 03 and 3 24 0 03 mg nh4 per g zeolites for naoh regeneration this suggests that regeneration of natural zeolites using naoh which also brings alkaline ph does not affect on overall aec na and nh4 were strongly exchanged compared to other cations such as k mg2 and ca2 in the desorption phase the average re by nacl was 95 7 1 2 and 94 4 9 5 was identified from naoh regeneration ammonia removal efficiency using water spray reactor was relatively more stable effective and satisfying 97 9 than that of using a stripping vessel 62 this study also revealed that 181 g nacl should be prepared however less mass of naoh 12 g was needed for recovering 1 g of ammonium mass in the economic analysis for treating 100 m3 greywater chemical expenses could be decreased up to 50 by utilizing naoh instead of nacl in summary this approach not only helps with chemical cost relief but also environmental considerations since this approach efficiently reduces the utilization of water and naoh with satisfying performance of ammonium removal and recovery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

exchange loop stripping process one study used naoh as the sole regenerant solutions and concluded that the benefit of air stripping technique was to lower the usage of chemicals and energy during regeneration phase that led to overall process intensification 21 while ellersdorfer 22 investigated the ion exchange loop stripping of sludge liquor that used nacl for regenerant and found that simultaneous air stripping helped to enhance the regeneration rate up to 64 8 compared to that in conventional nacl regeneration which yielded around 50 efficiency while both studies 21 22 succinctly introduced a breakthrough concept for zeolite regeneration through ion exchange loop stripping method however both did not further discuss the comparative examinations of two different regenerants i e nacl naoh nor did they review on how the usage of typical regenerant could economically improve or burden the expenses during regeneration phase furthermore the concentration of undesorbed ammonium was around 50 which implies that the regeneration process was quite ineffective another issue pertaining to the operation of ion exchange loop stripping was the instability of ammonia removal by a stripping vessel the average concentration of stripped ammonia was only 62 21 based on these issues this paper offers an approach that shows an efficient utilization of naoh and performs an improvement of ammonia removal efficiency using a water spray reactor via air stripping method in this paper the feasibility of an alternative approach for ammonia removal and recovery from greywater using the combination of ion exchange and air stripping method was assessed following adsorption the recovery of ammonium was carried out using naoh and subsequently air stripping technique was performed to remove ammonia from regenerant so that the solution could be utilized up to ten sequential cycles unlike ion exchange loop stripping method no supplementary naoh and ph adjustment was done which allowed a simple operation and an efficient utilization of naoh in the final discussion section an economic analysis was further examined to gain an insight on how chemical expenses could be improved when using naoh instead of nacl 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorption phase the commercial natural zeolites were obtained from the district of gyeongbuk south korea zeolites were prepared by washing and drying in the oven 105 c prior to use particle size chosen was between 1 18 and 2 36 mm no chemical modification nor any additional procedure was done during the preparation of natural zeolites customarily characterization of materials used was technically carried out by x ray diffraction xrd and or x ray fluorescent xrf and any other additional analyses such as scanning electron microscope sem and or transmission electron microscopy tem 7 9 23 25 the characteristics of natural zeolites used in this study i e chemical composition mineral characterization adsorption kinetic isotherm and thermodynamics had been examined and discussed elsewhere clinoptilolite and mordenite were among the identified minerals in the natural zeolites with 80 89 sio2 and 9 34 al2o3 19 the synthetic greywater was made from nh4cl stock samchun south korea 50 mg l n concentration was attained by dilution other chemical compounds were added and formulated according to abed scholz 26 with some modifications table 1 all chemicals used were analytical grade with the purity approximately around 99 adsorption of ammonium from greywater solutions was carried out in an acrylic column 5 cm internal diameter 100 cm height packed with 1 32 kg natural zeolites a peristaltic pump at vertical velocity of 5 m h 164 ml min was used to feed the influent in an up flow direction the adsorption was terminated when breakthrough was achieved at 5 mg l ct c0 10 the calculation eq 1 of loaded ammonium was as follows 1 loaded ammonium q l c 0 c t v g m z wherein ql total mass g of ammonium adsorbed until breakthrough time per mass of zeolites g c0 initial ammonium concentration mg l ct ammonium concentration in the effluent solutions during adsorption phase mg l vg refers to the volume of greywater for the given operation time l and mz mass of the natural zeolites g any amount of ammonium left in the zeolites was also added in the loaded ammonium calculation the column was washed with water prior to entering regeneration phase ammonium concentration was measured spectrophotometrically with dr 3900 hach usa the ion exchange during adsorption was analytically observed by ion chromatography instrument dionex aquion thermofisher usa 2 2 regeneration phase and air stripping of ammonia regeneration between two types of regenerant was compared nacl and naoh both with similar 0 5 mol l molarity were separately made for different regeneration treatments concentration of 0 5 mol l was chosen based on the preliminary experiments data not shown the total amount of regenerant solutions was 25 l for each treatment which lasted for 2 5 h the regeneration was carried out in a downflow direction using a peristaltic pump at vertical velocity of 5 m h 164 ml min the recovered amount of ammonium or ammonia in the regenerant solutions was measured by spectrophotometer dr 3900 hach usa regeneration efficiency was calculated below eq 2 2 regeneration efficiency x r x l 100 in which xr ammonium mass accumulated in the regenerant solutions mg xl ammonium mass adsorbed onto the natural zeolites mg after regeneration nacl solutions conventional method containing recovered ammonium did not undergo air stripping experimental setup for that of conventional nacl regeneration was performed according to fig 1 newly fresh nacl solutions were prepared for every cycle of regeneration with the total volume of 25 l conversely naoh solutions that contained the accumulated ammonium were recycled by air stripping method no adjustment of ph temperature nor additional fresh naoh was applied during air stripping of ammonia a water spray typed reactor was run to perform the air stripping of ammonia for 7 h the air stripping system worked as follows the regenerant solutions containing naoh were pumped and sprayed via the nozzles the liquid went back to the influent tank due to gravitational pull while spraying the blower produced subsequential air that enabled the mass transfer of ammonia in the liquid to the gas phase the ammonia was then pulled through and finally reacted with phosphoric acid in the acid tank the optimization of the reactor had been investigated separately 27 by the end of the stripping treatment ammonium free naoh solutions could be reused up to ten regeneration cycles the overall ammonium removal and recovery of ion exchange and air stripping system is illustrated in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium removal from greywater via adsorption using natural zeolites the influent solution during adsorption phase was prepared synthetically to resemble greywater characteristics and analyzed as presented in table 2 below depending on the sources of the greywater the concentrations of tn and tp could range from 1 1 to 74 mg l and 0 11 to 171 mg l respectively cod might vary from 26 to 2950 mg l turbidity could be up to 444 ntu whereas tss concentrations were between 7 and 1300 mg l 4 a study 26 categorized the type of greywater into two groups i e low and high concentration of greywater high concentration of greywater has the high strength chemical concentrations and the low ones are those solutions with lower strength of chemical concentrations the type of greywater in this study belongs to the low concentration greywater with the emphasis of ammonium concentrations because ammonium removal by natural zeolites is the main focus of this study in table 2 tn concentrations decreased drastically in the effluent in both nacl and naoh regeneration due to massive adsorption of ammonium ions onto the natural zeolites turbidity and ss also showed reductions in the effluents this might be due to the entrapment of solids in the column during adsorption nevertheless clogging did not occur until the tenth cycle ph of effluent generated from naoh regeneration was more alkaline than that of the influent solutions this might occur because small portions of remnants of regenerant were still found in the column in general the adsorption by natural zeolites has the striking impact on the reduction of the ammonium concentrations rather than other parameters as shown in table 2 prior to regeneration adsorption for both two treatments i e regeneration with nacl and naoh had been carried out in similar conditions table 3 shows the summary of ammonium exchange capacity aec and breakthrough time at 10 ct c0 for ten cycles breakthrough times for ten cycles were reached after 9 h with the tendency to slightly decrease as the cycles proceeded the average breakthrough times were 557 13 3 and 562 12 7 minutes for nacl and naoh regeneration respectively the aec describes the ammonium exchange capacity of the natural zeolites aec was calculated by determining the ratio of adsorbed ammonium ion in mg mass per g mass of natural zeolites it was found that average aec for both treatments was not significantly different this suggests that regeneration using nacl or naoh does not affect on overall aec the average aec values over ten cycles were 3 23 0 03 and 3 24 0 03 mg nh4 per g zeolites for nacl and naoh regeneration respectively the likelihood of decreasing exchange capacity compared to virgin zeolites was obvious after ten cycles for both treatments this agrees with other studies that aec decreased after repetitive usage 13 20 the exchange of ions during adsorption was observed by ion chromatography in fig 3 a several anions do not exhibit any significant change of concentration in samples taken before and after adsorption of ammonium from greywater the existence of anions such as f no2 no3 po4 3 so4 2 was derived either from the addition of chemical compounds or the readily available substances dissolved in the tap water solvent prepared for the influent no significant difference was recognized between anion concentrations in the influent and the effluent during adsorption stage cl concentration derived mostly from nh4cl was excluded from fig 3 a since the concentration outnumbered other anions the dynamics of cation concentrations can be identified in fig 3 b significant portions of na and nh4 were exchanged during the adsorption of ammonium and only small portions of extra framework cations i e k mg2 and ca2 evidently contributed to ion exchange during adsorption phase 3 2 ammonium recovery with two different regenerant solutions desorption of ammonium was done in 2 5 h by applying 25 l of regenerant solutions all analyses were presented in the unit concentration because the idea is to obtain the general insights on the mass balance between ammonium removal and recovery in a closed system fig 4 a presents the balance of ammonium adsorption and desorption for the entire cycles the average regeneration efficiency re by nacl was 95 7 1 2 with the average of undesorbed portions of ammonium was 0 14 0 04 mg per mass of zeolites g whereas the average re by naoh was 94 4 9 5 the average of undesorbed amount of ammonium was 0 18 0 14 mg per zeolite mass g fig 4 b additionally the performance of a newly developed water spray reactor was evaluated fig 5 the average ammonia removal efficiency of air striping process by the reactor was 97 9 0 9 the fluctuations of the efficiency occur since the air stripping process relies on the available alkaline ph while in this experiment no additional fresh naoh regenerant was included generally compared to ion exchange loop stripping our method exhibited more stable and satisfying performance especially during air stripping of ammonia by newly developed reactor the ammonia removal efficiency was relatively high using water spray reactor in water spray reactor the influent water went through some serial nozzles so that the water droplets were subsequentially scattered in the molecular perspective the driving force of mass transfer of gaseous ammonia from liquid to air phase was effectively promoted by sheer stress on the water droplets surface which created interfacial area between air water 29 30 ph is considered one of the notable parameters beside temperature water and air flow rate in air stripping of ammonia when ph of the solution is moved towards alkaline condition i e ph above 9 the equilibrium is shifted to the right side of the equation eq 3 below 3 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o more available molecular ammonia is present if the ph is higher than ph 9 conversely ammonium ions are more readily available if the ph is below ph 9 in ph 9 25 at 25 c ionization fraction of total ammonia nitrogen tan species appeared in equivalent proportions 31 fig 6 a describes ion exchange between sodium and ammonium ions during regeneration phase by nacl in general more sodium ions were required to desorb ammonium ions on the natural zeolites it was notice that in average 9 43 mg of sodium ions were exchanged to attain 1 mg of ammonium ions in the experiments with naoh as the regenerant it was concluded that 1 mg of ammonium ions was desorbed by 7 27 mg of sodium ions fig 6 b according to fig 6 b the strength of sodium solutions weakens as the cycles proceed further the apparent loss of sodium starts after the sixth cycle following the loss of sodium ions there is a significant drop of desorbed ammonium ions by the end of the tenth cycle the dynamics of sodium ion concentration before and after regeneration phase are presented in fig 7 in fig 7 a the average amount of sodium ion 11 549 101 mg l regenerant in the influent is similar to each other in all cycles this is due to the supply of the newly fresh nacl regenerants every time the regeneration phase took place while in the effluent the average amount of available sodium ion is consistent around 10 032 105 mg l regenerant for every cycle it is worth to notice that the remaining sodium ions in the regenerant solutions were incredibly excessive roughly only 13 of the total sodium ions were actually exchanged with ammonium ions which equated re of 95 during a cycle of regeneration consequently 87 of sodium ions were wasted and unused furthermore fresh water should be prepared for every cycle of nacl regeneration meanwhile in the regenerant solutions that used naoh a remarkable decline of available sodium ions was evident fig 7 b the decline occurred due to no additional fresh naoh in every cycle of the regeneration the first four cycles of regeneration provided 100 re and it had declined as the cycles carried on this strategy is considered more efficient than that of traditional regeneration using nacl because the available sodium ions were efficiently used during regeneration with less excessive amount being wasted 3 3 economic analysis with respect to chemical expenses for regeneration phase in the previous section the combination of air stripping system coupled with naoh as the regenerant solution was able to aid the regeneration of natural zeolites up to ten cycles although significant drop of ammonium desorption was obvious in the last cycle due to a considerable loss of sodium ions in the regenerant solutions to highlight the advantages of this approach are as follows 1 the approach by applying the combination of air stripping of ammonia with naoh does not involve additional fresh regenerant for every cycle of regeneration thus the usage of water and chemical can be carefully managed 2 there is no adjustment of ph because no additional naoh is needed 3 the air stripping system is a closed system which enables an efficient usage of recycling air gas for mass transfer of ammonia and lastly 4 the ammonium recovery in the form of ammonium phosphate is possible which can be used as materials for fertilizer ultimately the concept of environmentally friendly approach is encouraged as opposed to the conventional nacl regeneration which obliges the preparation of newly fresh regenerant solutions the requirement of chemicals for regeneration of the natural zeolites for ammonium removal from the greywater was determined in table 4 the daily volume of greywater putatively collected from the residential area was projected around 100 m3 32 which was derived from 400 households the estimation was made based on the ammonium concentration at 50 mg l with 95 desorption by nacl regeneration and 94 desorption by naoh this study revealed that in conventional method 181 g of nacl is required to recover 1 g of ammonium while the mass of naoh needed is around 12 g table 4 reviews the total dosage of both nacl and naoh needed in the regeneration and the expenses attributed to it the price was based on nacl price at 40 ton and naoh at 300 ton 13 according to table 4 the annual cost when employing naoh with no additional fresh naoh involvement can be reduced almost up to 50 compared to that of nacl regeneration it shall be noticed that the additional cost for running air stripping method should apply when naoh regeneration is chosen likewise the additional cost for handling the nacl regenerant should be considered to summarize the combination of air stripping technique with naoh during zeolite regeneration has numerous benefits in terms of economic and environmental impacts 4 conclusions regeneration has always been one of the challenges when natural zeolites are utilized for ammonium removal traditional regeneration using nacl prompts excess use of chemical and water meanwhile ion exchange loop stripping might be feasible for an alternative simultaneous regeneration of natural zeolites however additional naoh and ph adjustment monitoring had to be constantly maintained this study introduces a new approach of naoh utilization in which additional naoh and ph adjustment monitoring can simply be negligible during the operation additionally it was also found that ammonia removal efficiency via air stripping using water spray reactor was relatively more stable and satisfying than that from a stripping vessel the lab scale demonstration of ammonium removal and recovery from greywater with the combination of air stripping of ammonia was thoroughly investigated the adsorption of ammonium of both two treatments i e nacl and naoh showed relatively similar aec values aec from nacl regeneration was 3 23 0 03 and 3 24 0 03 mg nh4 per g zeolites for naoh regeneration this suggests that regeneration of natural zeolites using naoh which also brings alkaline ph does not affect on overall aec na and nh4 were strongly exchanged compared to other cations such as k mg2 and ca2 in the desorption phase the average re by nacl was 95 7 1 2 and 94 4 9 5 was identified from naoh regeneration ammonia removal efficiency using water spray reactor was relatively more stable effective and satisfying 97 9 than that of using a stripping vessel 62 this study also revealed that 181 g nacl should be prepared however less mass of naoh 12 g was needed for recovering 1 g of ammonium mass in the economic analysis for treating 100 m3 greywater chemical expenses could be decreased up to 50 by utilizing naoh instead of nacl in summary this approach not only helps with chemical cost relief but also environmental considerations since this approach efficiently reduces the utilization of water and naoh with satisfying performance of ammonium removal and recovery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
