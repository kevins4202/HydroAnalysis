21020,landslide generated wave lgw events are particularly dangerous as they are associated with a high risk of loss of life and severe economic damage the lifecycle of a lgw can be decomposed into various distinct stages such as generation and propagation the modeling of the entire lgw lifecycle through the use of a single model is difficult as the hazard characteristics of lgws differ widely across spatial and temporal scales therefore this study proposed a hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph boussinesq model to overcome the limitations of individual models and to acquire a more reliable method of analyzing lgws an sph two layer depth integrated model was combined with a boussinesq model funwave through the implementation of a transformation zone the proposed hybrid model was then applied within the evaluation of the potential risk for the generation of lgws by impulsive waves generated by the halaowo landslide in jinsha river china this study provides a discussion of the process for predicting waves and generated a risk map according to the reference emergency response plan keywords sph two layer depth integrated model coupling technique funwave landslide induced waves in the reservoir area 1 introduction landslide generated waves lgws have the potential to inflict enormous casualties and economic losses the occurrence of lgws in a restricted water body such as a reservoir results in the channeling of dissipating energy over a narrow space thereby further exacerbating the resulting damage manenti et al 2016 panizzo et al 2005 yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 a variety of models based on different mathematical formulations and numerical implementations have been developed to investigate lgws however as depicted in fig 1 the lifecycle of an lgw in a reservoir after initiation can be divided into several distinct stages including slide motion displacement of water generation of the impulsive wave wave propagation runup to the dam wall and overtopping of the dam wall in addition records of past lgws have shown that the hazards associated with lgws may occur over multiple different spatial and temporal scales these variabilities in scales poses a challenge to the simulation of the entire lifecycle of an lgw through the use of a single model to overcome this challenge various studies have attempted to couple different models to simulate the different stages of the wave field cui and williams 1998 proposed a one step downstream characteristic lagrangian hybrid method dsclh this hybrid method employed a numerically stable lagrangian method to simulate convection as a grid along the route of a fluid particle the capacity of this scheme to handle shocks was then verified by several experiments pun et al 2000 attempted to predict the behavior of merging jets in a coflowing ambient fluid through a multiple point hybrid method developed by combining the modular structure of a length scale model with a eulerian integral model this method overcame the limitation of length scale models of assuming the transition between flow regimes by applying a multiple point approach the accuracy of the proposed hybrid model was verified by comparing the simulations with those of an equivalent single point hybrid model and a eulerian integral solution soares and zech 2002 developed a numerical approach to solve weak non hydrostatic problems in which the boussinesq equations were solved by a hybrid finite volume method this hybrid model incorporated a finite volume scheme and a finite difference scheme for conservative and non hydrostatic terms respectively the use of multiple schemes allowed this approach to accurately predict wave celerity height and wavelength without any artificial treatment for numerical stability the general goal behind the development of such hybrid approaches has been to integrate the advantages of multiple individual models into a single model as shown in fig 2 the lifecycle of an lgw after initiation can be divided into two stages to facilitate numerical computation 1 generation of lgws within the near field area and 2 propagation of lgws in the far field area hence a hybrid method for the numerical simulation of lgws should be able to robustly and efficiently represent the behaviors of these two stages within the impulsive wave generation stage waves are generated by displacement of water by a sliding mass of debris this process is considered to be very complex from a numerical modelling perspective due to the influences of various processes including solid fluid moving interfaces large deformation and wave breaking phenomena smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a mesh less method widely used for overcoming the challenges posed by large deformable free surfaces to numerical modeling and is also frequently employed to explore lgw problems ataie ashtiani and jilani 2007 ataie ashtiani and shobeyri 2008 capone et al 2010 gomez gesteira et al 2012 gotoh and sakai 2006 heller et al 2016 manenti et al 2018 monaghan and kos 1999 panizzo and dalrymple 2005 pastor et al 2009 viroulet et al 2013 wang et al 2016 the various mathematical formulations that can be used to represent lgw processes show widely different accuracies among these formulations the depth integrated equations are most frequently adopted as they minimize computational costs while maintaining acceptable accuracy the present study applied the sph two layer model proposed by pastor et al 2009 this model represents a landslide as a sliding mass moving beneath a layer of water represented as two sets of sph particles within the representation of the second stage of an lgw fig 2 boussinesq equations require fewer prior assumptions of linearity or dispersion compared to other equations such as linear or nonlinear shallow water equations therefore boussinesq equations are widely applied by scholars to describe propagation of lgws cruz et al 1997 flaten and rygg 1991 huang et al 2016 madsen et al 1991 shi et al 2012 tappin et al 2008 watts et al 2003 funwave is an open source model based on a fully nonlinear boussinesq model within funwave the boussinesq equations are solved by a finite difference model moreover the solver of funwave supports the message passing interface mpi for parallel computing thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the software a few sph funwave hybrid methods have been previously reported gianguzzi et al 2015 narayanaswamy et al 2010 however most of these methods were developed through the use of artificial numerical tests or experimental results furthermore the two dimensional schemes of these methods can limit their application to real life problems the application of hybrid approaches to analyze the lifecycle of an lgw is important given their potential catastrophic effects on life and property the current study aimed to present a hybrid approach for the simulation of the initiation and propagation of lgws a novel approach of combining an sph two layer model with a finite difference boussinesq model in funwave is proposed the objectives of the present study were to 1 analyze the generation of impulsive waves using the sph two layer model to capture the dramatic interactions between the landslide body and the water body based on the capacity of the sph model to deal with a complex free surface 2 apply the information collected for the generated waves in the near field area to the funwave model to investigate wave propagation to achieve these two objectives the two methods were linked through a transition zone in which data were passed through the two models via interpolation 3 the proposed hybrid model was employed within the study of a potential lgw event in the xiangjiaba reservoir area china 2 the hybrid model this section provides a brief description of both models and the method used to integrate them 2 1 sph two layer model pastor et al 2009b proposed the sph two layer model to represent the dynamic process of water displacement resulting from a landslide this model is constructed through the incorporation of fluidized soil rheology into a depth integrated model water flow characteristics are described using the depth integrated model the present study first explores representation of a single fluid following which the method of discriminating between two materials is described the governing equations fora single fluid are given by a balance of mass 1 d ρ d t ρ div v 0 b balance of linear momentum 2 ρ d v d t div σ ρ g in eq 1 and eq 2 ρ is density v is velocity σ represents total stresses and g represents the acceleration of gravity these equations should be combined with a suitable rheological law to link displacements or velocities to strains or rate of strains boundary and initial conditions are also required for calculation as stated above solving real life three dimensional 3d problems can be computationally expensive as a less computationally expensive alternative depth integrated models have been extensively used for the investigation of actual events the application of depth integrated models to simulate landslide propagation was initiated by savage and hutter 1991 whereafter further research facilitated the extension of the approach to more general situations gray et al 1999 hutter and koch 1991 hutter et al 1993 laigle and coussot 1997 lin et al 2018 mcdougall and hungr 2004 pastor et al 2002 2009 2018 pudasaini and hutter 2007 quecedo et al 2004 pudasaini and hutter 2007 provide a discussion of the limitations of depth integrated models as shown in fig 3 the balance of mass and momentum equations can be integrated along x 3 in this system a a is a typical section of the sliding

based on leibniz s rule 4 a b s f r s d r s a b f r s d r f b s b s f a s a s the depth integrated equations of the fluidized solid can be derived in the same way as for water by assuming the presence of a single fluid as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the integration of sliding mass and water is implemented between z z h s and between z h s z h s h w respectively and gives rise to a balance of mass 5 d

represents the elevation of the terrain τ b is the friction between soil and the basal surface and τ i the interface friction the superscript indices s and w represent soil and water respectively sph methods approximate physical variables by estimating surrounding values through representing continuum media as a set of particles after applying the sph discretization technique the continuity

the gradient of the weighting function w x h the present study then examined the balance of the momentum equations 6 and eq 7 a portion of the balance common to both layers can be represented as a single phase fluid the present study introduced additional terms for water and fluidized soil individually hence the sph discretized momentum equations including the portion common to both phases and correction terms for each are as follows the common part 9 d d t v i j m j p i p j h i h j grad w i j 1 ρ j m j σ i σ j h i h j grad w i j b 1 ρ h i n b t i b or 10 d d t v i j m j p i h i 2 p j h j 2

fluidized soil the current study has thus far introduced the mathematical formulations and associated sph discretized forms for the two layer model the funwave model which is another component of the hybrid model for simulation of wave propagation is briefly described below 2 2 a nonlinear boussinesq model funwave peregrine 1967 proposed the depth averaged boussinesq equations with the assumption of weak dispersion and nonlinearity comparable to water flows various numerical models of these equations have subsequently been proposed to study the wave transformation processes madisen 1992 madsen et al 1991 nwogu 1993 the boussinesq equations used in funwave were proposed based on the work of wei and kirby 1995 in contrast to the standard and other extended boussinesq models the models provided by wei and kirby 1995 are fully nonlinear this ensures that the equations can capture nonlinear effects and are able to describe strong wave wave interactions occurring near the shore a finite difference model is used to solve the fully nonlinear boussinesq equations in funwave with more detailed descriptions as well as some benchmark tests provided by the funwave user manual shi et al 2013 a brief introduction of the funwave model is given below the two unknown variables within the funwave model are surface elevation η and velocity u α u x z α at a reference elevation z z α x and can be defined as 13 η t m 0 14 u α t u α u α g η v 1 v 2 0 in eq 13 eq 14 the subscript t denotes the partial time derivative hence u α t is the time derivative of the velocity at x z α η t represents the time derivative of the local surface displacement g represents the acceleration of gravity m is the horizontal volume flux term and the dispersive boussinesq terms v 1 v 2 are given as 15 m m 1 m 2 16 m 1 h η u α 17 m 2 h η 1 2 z α 2 1 6 h 2 h η η 2 u α z α 1 2 h η h u α 18 v 1 1 2 z α 2 u α t z α h u α t 1 2 η 2 u α t η h u α t 19 v 2 z α η u α h u α 1 2 z α 2 η 2 u α u α 1 2 h u α t η u α 2 it is worth mentioning that the value of the reference level z α in the above equations needs to be predetermined the choice of z α is suggested to be z α 0 531 h x to minimize the maximum error in wave phase speed nwogu 1993 a simple wetting drying scheme is used in the funwave model to simulate moving shorelines shi et al 2012 as a minimum water depth is defined in the simulation with a suggested field scale value of 0 01 the water depth at the grid is compared with this criterion to determine if it is wet or dry the normal flux n m at the cell interface of a dry cell is set to zero and the wave speeds of the riemann solver for a dry cell are modified as 20 s l v l n g h η l s l v l n 2 g h η l right dry cell 21 s l v r n g h η r s r v r n 2 g h η r left dry cell 2 3 method used to couple the two model components the production of a hybrid model by integrating the sph two layer model with funwave is founded on the implementation of a transformation or overlap zone fig 6 under this approach the sph two layer model is run to capture the generation of waves in the near field once the landslide process halts and the process generating the strong impact has terminated the primary kinetic energy of the landslide has already been transferred to the water and the hydrodynamic conditions velocity and height of water in the overlap zone will be delivered to funwave as the initial state of the subsequent calculation since both models employed in the present study are formulated within a depth integrated framework the velocity and depth of the water constitute unknowns in the simulation of problem fig 7 represents transmission of the flow field including both velocity and depth of the considered domain and illustrates the sph particles to the finite difference mesh each sph particle was first traversed and the relative positions of the particles within the fdm grid were determined the unknowns velocity and depth at every mesh point were then estimated by the values of surrounding particles according to their position relationship see fig 7 b the sph method uses a pure lagrangian mesh free approach to represent continuum media by utilizing a set of distributed particles carrying field variables such as mass density velocity and depth therefore as the depth of each grid point had been calculated by the surrounding particles after the interpolation the wet dry boundary over the simulation domain was obtained by comparing the interpolated depth of each mesh point with the given minimum water depth the transmission process is achieved through an interpolation approach widely used in mesh based methods 22 φ i j 1 n φ j d i j m j 1 n 1 d i j m in eq 2 φ i is the physical quantity at the mesh point i φ j the physical quantity at sph particles j d i j the distance between them and m is set to 1 in the present study 3 benchmark test a numerical benchmark test of solitary wave propagation was conducted to confirm the capability of the proposed hybrid model which is described in the documentation for funwave fig 8 illustrates the initial configuration of the test in which the water depth was taken to be 10 m and the tank had a length of 1024 m the solitary wave was generated at x 300 m with an initial amplitude of 1 0 m and the right sloped started at x 750 with a slope angle of 0 05 rad moreover the water surface elevation and the velocity of the generated wave can be obtained according to the weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations proposed by wei and kirby 1995 the validation strategy used in the present study involved running the one dimension wave propagation case using both the sph funwave hybrid approach and the funwave model respectively the changes in waves over the entire domain estimated by the two methods were then compared and discussed for the sake of brevity the domain considered in the present study was chosen to be the transformation region in the sph funwave hybrid model consequently the steps taken to calculate the hybrid model are described below see fig 9 i run the sph model to simulate the initial wave propagation state ii output the simulated results of the sph model 20 s after the wave generation to act as the input files for funwave iii execute the funwave code to continue the simulation of wave evolution the sph modelling stage involved 1024 sph particles and an absorbing buffer was imposed at the left boundary to prevent the appearance of spurious reflected wave oscillations lin et al 2019 provides further details of this boundary treatment method during the funwave calculation 1 024 3 computational grids were created with an interval of 1 m along the x direction table 1 provides a summary of the numerical and physical parameters used in the funwave model whereas values left unspecified took on default values the generated solitary wave was determined by solving the weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations proposed by wei et al 1995 including the equations for initial free surface and velocity 23 η x t 0 c 1 c 3 sec h 2 c 2 x 24 u α x t 0 c 4 sec h 2 c 2 x the expressions for c i i 1 4 are defined in the appendix of wei et al 1995 the above equations stipulate that the initial velocity and the water depth of each sph particle at a given position can be determined and the calculated values have been verified against the results produced by the wavemaker in funwave froudecap represents the cap for froude number in the velocity calculation for efficiency mindepth is the minimum water depth m for the wetting and drying scheme logical parameters c 1 and c 2 were re calibrated according to choi et al 2018 following the above strategy fig 10 presents and compares the estimated results of the hybrid model with the reference values from funwave the results obtained by the hybrid model showed good general agreement with the reference results from the funwave model the solitary wave propagated towards the right slope with a velocity of 10 m s 1 this propagation speed could be considered reasonable taking into account that wave propagation velocity in still water can be evaluated by v g h furthermore the effect of the slope in reducing wave spread can be observed in fig 10 e in which the solitary wave was obstructed by the boundary and the kinetic energy of wave transfers to its geopotential resulting in a higher wave height 4 case study this section presents a validation of the hybrid model through its application to simulate a potential lgw event including the generation and propagation of impulsive waves in the xiangjiaba reservoir jinsha river china 4 1 geologic setting and computing environment as illustrated in fig 11 the xiangjiaba hydropower station is the furthest downstream large scale hydropower station third largest in china in the lower reaches of the jinsha river this hydropower station forms an integral component of the chinese mega project the west to east electricity transmission project and plays a key role in the regulation of the cascade of power stations operating in the reservoir by collaborating with other hydraulic projects table 2 provides some details and operation parameters of the station geological reports have indicated over 47 potential landslides and 37 incidents of collapsed deposits in the mainstream and main tributaries of the jinsha river these unstable geologic bodies became agitated after initiation of reservoir impoundment as filling up of the reservoir probably further reduced the stability of those unstable masses included in these unstable masses is the halaowo slope with a volume of over 7 106 m3 there is a short distance between the slope and the downstream station of 18 km as the crow flies therefore the triggering of the landslide will generate waves that pose a serious threat to people living along the shore of the dam and to the safe operation of the power station the halaowo slope is composed of purplish red mudstone and grayish yellow sandstone of the jurassic artesian formation and the strike direction of the rock strata is roughly the same as that of the river two landslides have developed in the two upstream gullies adjacent to the halaowo gully the effects of water as well as groundwater seepage can be seen on the slope in addition tensile cracks subsidence and other sliding deformations of the loose materials can be seen on the slope the elevation of the rear edge of the slope is 450 m 460 m and the maximum thickness is 20 m the sliding material is mainly composed of purple clay with block stone and no large block stone is found on the surface of the sliding body field investigations showed that the landslide occurred through the reactivation of an old landslide mass and could be defined as a bedrock bedding landslide with the direction of slide consistent with the tendency of the bedrock the landslide occurred through cutting of the rock strata by the halaowo gully and the consequent formation of a slope composed of purplish red mudstone and sandstone along the eastern side of the gully the influence of heavy rainstorms and other factors resulted in rock strata sliding down the slope and disintegrating to form the present halaowogou landslide mass the geological report refers to the landslide mass as a bingham type fluid with a yield stress and viscosity of 1 kpa and 50 pa s respectively with fig 12 illustrating a typical section of the slope the proposed coupling method aimed to ensure adequate representation of the potential hazards of the landslide event and fig 13 depicts the regional division of the near and far fields including a diagram of sph particles the finite difference mesh as well as the transformation zone with respect to the two layer model the established sph model included 916 landslide particles and 2349 water particles respectively see fig 16 a buffer zones were imposed along the two borders of the computational domain to avoid spurious perturbation near the boundary 1 137 264 unstructured grids were established for the funwave model a sponge layer with a width of 100 m was also imposed along the inflow boundary 4 2 establishment of the transformation zone the reasonable establishment of the transformation zone can achieve good lgw simulation accuracy at a reasonable computational cost the present study defined the transformation zone to cover the area of water body affected by the landslide according to this principle an overlap zone was identified by assessing the domain of waves generated by the landslide fig 14 illustrates the selected zone the velocity of the landslide and the locations of the six gauging points as shown in fig 14 at t 50 s the landslide remained at a maximum velocity of 0 43 m s 1 fig 15 shows the evolution of the water surface at these near boundary points the generated waves reached these monitoring points after t 50 s at both the northern and western borders which ensured that all of the effected water affected the transformation zone by the time of the completion of the landslide and indicated the feasibility of the further computation 4 3 numerical results the simulation of the entire process was initiated by calculating the waves generated in the near field since the sph two layer model was adopted in the current study fig 16 shows the dynamics of water and landslide particles during the wave generation process the semi submerged landslide accelerated after initiation and propagated along both the directions of the original landslide and the river course as the primary kinetic energy from the landslide was transferred to the water column the moving mass deaccelerated after reaching a maximum velocity at t 20 s after which the moving mass gradually stopped and debris were deposited onto the riverbed as mentioned in section 4 2 the comparison of the mobility of the sliding mass and the front of the generated waves resulted in the selection of t 50 s for investigating the transformation with fig 17 showing the simulations of impulsive waves at 50 s by the sph model the behaviors of the waves including the wave height and the propagation velocity within the overlap zone were then passed to the finite difference grids using the above mentioned interpolation method eq 22 section 2 3 provides a description of the method with fig 18 showing the results of interpolation the funwave model was used from this point to examine the propagation of the water waves fig 19 shows the computational domain of the wave propagation as simulated using funwave the considered domain had a length and width of 14 km and 6 4 km respectively and was divided into a 10 m 10 m grid for a total of 64 rows and 140 columns a sponge layer with a width of 50 m was imposed along the western border to avoid numerical instability and spurious wave reflections at the numerical boundary moreover the grid at the position of the dam was modified according to the profile of the dam to consider the potential reflected waves generated by the dam the river channel was divided into four sections with three monitoring points in each section to investigate the wave propagation process in the river basin fig 19 shows the positions of the sections the slope and the hydropower station figs 20 23 show the evolution of the water surface at the referenced points since section 1 is located inside the transformation zone the three monitoring points within the section measured the initial wave height at the beginning of the simulation of wave propagation moreover as shown in fig 20 among points 1 to 3 point 3 experienced the largest height of the first wave crest this result can be attributed to point 3 being positioned closest to the opposite slope of the landslide with the run up of waves on the slope resulting at a higher water level at point 3 subsequently the water levels at the three monitoring points in section 1 gradually converged toward uniformity as shown in fig 21 the generated waves propagated to section 2 after 250 s at which time all three points in section 2 experienced very similar waveforms the continuous dissipation of energy during the propagation of the generated waves along the river resulted in a reduction in the maximum wave crest height in section 2 see fig 21 from 5 m in section 1 to less than 3 m as shown in fig 22 by the time the waves arrived at section 3 the maximum wave heights had declined to 2 m from this point until the end of the calculation the amplitudes of the waves in section 3 gradually declined and oscillated slightly at the still water level unlike the upstream sections the peak wave height appeared in section 4 at the second wave crest as shown in fig 23 the reflections of the wave remarkably influenced the propagation of the wave in the area near the dam wall and resulted in a wave amplitude of 2 m compared with the first wave crest of 1 6 m in addition it should be noted that the three points in section 4 showed consistent changes in the water surface over time thereby demonstrating that the distribution of waves in the channel tends to become synchronized as the distance from the source of the impulsive wave increases fig 24 a f illustrate the entire process of wave propagation at t 100 s t 200 s t 400 s t 600 s t 1000 s and t 1200 s respectively as shown in fig 24 the generated waves remained at a relatively high level in the near field at t 100 s whereas the maximum wave height dropped significantly below 10 m after 200 s subsequently the front of the impulsive waves gradually developed downstream as shown on the right side of the fig 24 as shown in fig 24 e the wavefront arrived at the upstream surface of xiangjiaba dam at 800 s at the same time the wave was reflected and started to propagate upwards due to the dam body blocking the path of the wave finally at the end of the computation at t 1200 s most areas of the river return to a normal water surface level as the reflected waves exhibited considerable decay due to the dissipation of energy except for some areas in the vicinity of the near field in which relatively large waves could still be observed 4 4 management of risk to navigation as shown in fig 25 the present study investigated the potential impact of the generated waves on the watercourse and coastal regions through model simulations of maximum wave height there remains scope for improvement in the national standard for risk management of potential impulsive waves in inland waterways in china since the potential scale of impulsive waves has been widely used to assess security in waterways within ocean shipping management huang et al 2016 proposed the application of ocean shipping management risk classification methods to inland waterways in accordance with the classification of watercourse hazard alert levels specified in the emergency plan for storm surge sea wave tsunami and sea ice disasters published by the state oceanic administration of the people s republic of china the present study set four risk zones 1 a red alert zone for wave heights exceeding 3 m 2 an orange alert zone for wave heights from 2 m to 3 m 3 a yellow alert zone for wave heights from 1 m to 2 m and 4 a blue alert zone for wave heights of below 1 m hence the risk posed by impulsive waves resulting from the halaowo landslide can be characterized according to this grading system fig 26 shows the spatial distribution of the potential risks resulting from the halaowo landslide in the xiangjiaba reservoir area 5 conclusions and future work the sph model is considered to be a powerful tool for addressing challenges associated with the simulation of lgws such as fluid solid interaction complex topography and a large deformable free surface these phenomena usually occur in a limited enclosed spatial area close to the landslide source referred to as the near field in lgw analysis more cost effective methods are considered more appropriate for simulation of the wave propagation in the far field such as the finite difference method the present study attempted to combine the advantages of different methods for the study of the entire lifecycle of an lgw in a reservoir area by presenting a hybrid sph funwave model the basic concept of this hybrid approach is to use the sph two layer model to analyze the process of the impulsive wave generation and the funwave model to simulate the propagation of waves in the river basin this hybrid approach effectively allows the disadvantages of the two individual models to be overcome and allows full exploitation of the capabilities of each model through the integration consequently the hybrid model can be a powerful tool for studying and simulating lgws one of the key points within this hybridization strategy is the imposition of the overlap zone in which information is transferred from the sph model to the funwave model finally the present study applied the proposed hybrid method to examine a potential lgw event in the jinsha river area china the present study presented the results obtained from the hybrid model and produced a map showing the spatial distribution of risk of lgws resulting from the halaowo landslide in the jinsha river which could be used to mitigate potential lgw disasters in the region of the jinsha river basin the limitations of the hybrid approach presented in the current paper are given blow the original flow characteristics in the river require further consideration the current study assumed the initial flow before the triggering of the landslide to be static which does not match reality the dynamic behavior of landslides are controlled by geologic and tectonic conditions and landslides may change direction and spread contract split or join in response to local terrain the use of 3d models would be more appropriate to solve these problems in which complicated topography and interactions need to be considered rather than the depth integrated scheme applied in the present work the hybridization presented in the current study was conducted by implementing the transformation zone through the use of the restart function in the funwave code consequently the sph and the funwave models were not integrated during the simulation the simulations of the sph model can also be transferred to funwave by imposing dynamic boundaries which can improve the continuity of the computation and reduce the computational effort when a large near field domain requires consideration the sph funwave hybrid model presented in the current study was established based on an integration of the two models among the two models the sph model has been widely applied to the analysis of landslide problems including fully submerged or semi submerged landslide events many studies in the literature have successfully applied the funwave model to the simulation of tsunami waves hence the hybrid model proposed in the current study shows promise for simulating submarine landslides or landslides triggered along the coastal shorelines the model could be applied to investigate landslide induced nearshore wave transformation refraction and wave propagation and inundation from ocean basin to nearshore scales credit authorship contribution statement chuan lin has

21020,landslide generated wave lgw events are particularly dangerous as they are associated with a high risk of loss of life and severe economic damage the lifecycle of a lgw can be decomposed into various distinct stages such as generation and propagation the modeling of the entire lgw lifecycle through the use of a single model is difficult as the hazard characteristics of lgws differ widely across spatial and temporal scales therefore this study proposed a hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph boussinesq model to overcome the limitations of individual models and to acquire a more reliable method of analyzing lgws an sph two layer depth integrated model was combined with a boussinesq model funwave through the implementation of a transformation zone the proposed hybrid model was then applied within the evaluation of the potential risk for the generation of lgws by impulsive waves generated by the halaowo landslide in jinsha river china this study provides a discussion of the process for predicting waves and generated a risk map according to the reference emergency response plan keywords sph two layer depth integrated model coupling technique funwave landslide induced waves in the reservoir area 1 introduction landslide generated waves lgws have the potential to inflict enormous casualties and economic losses the occurrence of lgws in a restricted water body such as a reservoir results in the channeling of dissipating energy over a narrow space thereby further exacerbating the resulting damage manenti et al 2016 panizzo et al 2005 yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 a variety of models based on different mathematical formulations and numerical implementations have been developed to investigate lgws however as depicted in fig 1 the lifecycle of an lgw in a reservoir after initiation can be divided into several distinct stages including slide motion displacement of water generation of the impulsive wave wave propagation runup to the dam wall and overtopping of the dam wall in addition records of past lgws have shown that the hazards associated with lgws may occur over multiple different spatial and temporal scales these variabilities in scales poses a challenge to the simulation of the entire lifecycle of an lgw through the use of a single model to overcome this challenge various studies have attempted to couple different models to simulate the different stages of the wave field cui and williams 1998 proposed a one step downstream characteristic lagrangian hybrid method dsclh this hybrid method employed a numerically stable lagrangian method to simulate convection as a grid along the route of a fluid particle the capacity of this scheme to handle shocks was then verified by several experiments pun et al 2000 attempted to predict the behavior of merging jets in a coflowing ambient fluid through a multiple point hybrid method developed by combining the modular structure of a length scale model with a eulerian integral model this method overcame the limitation of length scale models of assuming the transition between flow regimes by applying a multiple point approach the accuracy of the proposed hybrid model was verified by comparing the simulations with those of an equivalent single point hybrid model and a eulerian integral solution soares and zech 2002 developed a numerical approach to solve weak non hydrostatic problems in which the boussinesq equations were solved by a hybrid finite volume method this hybrid model incorporated a finite volume scheme and a finite difference scheme for conservative and non hydrostatic terms respectively the use of multiple schemes allowed this approach to accurately predict wave celerity height and wavelength without any artificial treatment for numerical stability the general goal behind the development of such hybrid approaches has been to integrate the advantages of multiple individual models into a single model as shown in fig 2 the lifecycle of an lgw after initiation can be divided into two stages to facilitate numerical computation 1 generation of lgws within the near field area and 2 propagation of lgws in the far field area hence a hybrid method for the numerical simulation of lgws should be able to robustly and efficiently represent the behaviors of these two stages within the impulsive wave generation stage waves are generated by displacement of water by a sliding mass of debris this process is considered to be very complex from a numerical modelling perspective due to the influences of various processes including solid fluid moving interfaces large deformation and wave breaking phenomena smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a mesh less method widely used for overcoming the challenges posed by large deformable free surfaces to numerical modeling and is also frequently employed to explore lgw problems ataie ashtiani and jilani 2007 ataie ashtiani and shobeyri 2008 capone et al 2010 gomez gesteira et al 2012 gotoh and sakai 2006 heller et al 2016 manenti et al 2018 monaghan and kos 1999 panizzo and dalrymple 2005 pastor et al 2009 viroulet et al 2013 wang et al 2016 the various mathematical formulations that can be used to represent lgw processes show widely different accuracies among these formulations the depth integrated equations are most frequently adopted as they minimize computational costs while maintaining acceptable accuracy the present study applied the sph two layer model proposed by pastor et al 2009 this model represents a landslide as a sliding mass moving beneath a layer of water represented as two sets of sph particles within the representation of the second stage of an lgw fig 2 boussinesq equations require fewer prior assumptions of linearity or dispersion compared to other equations such as linear or nonlinear shallow water equations therefore boussinesq equations are widely applied by scholars to describe propagation of lgws cruz et al 1997 flaten and rygg 1991 huang et al 2016 madsen et al 1991 shi et al 2012 tappin et al 2008 watts et al 2003 funwave is an open source model based on a fully nonlinear boussinesq model within funwave the boussinesq equations are solved by a finite difference model moreover the solver of funwave supports the message passing interface mpi for parallel computing thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the software a few sph funwave hybrid methods have been previously reported gianguzzi et al 2015 narayanaswamy et al 2010 however most of these methods were developed through the use of artificial numerical tests or experimental results furthermore the two dimensional schemes of these methods can limit their application to real life problems the application of hybrid approaches to analyze the lifecycle of an lgw is important given their potential catastrophic effects on life and property the current study aimed to present a hybrid approach for the simulation of the initiation and propagation of lgws a novel approach of combining an sph two layer model with a finite difference boussinesq model in funwave is proposed the objectives of the present study were to 1 analyze the generation of impulsive waves using the sph two layer model to capture the dramatic interactions between the landslide body and the water body based on the capacity of the sph model to deal with a complex free surface 2 apply the information collected for the generated waves in the near field area to the funwave model to investigate wave propagation to achieve these two objectives the two methods were linked through a transition zone in which data were passed through the two models via interpolation 3 the proposed hybrid model was employed within the study of a potential lgw event in the xiangjiaba reservoir area china 2 the hybrid model this section provides a brief description of both models and the method used to integrate them 2 1 sph two layer model pastor et al 2009b proposed the sph two layer model to represent the dynamic process of water displacement resulting from a landslide this model is constructed through the incorporation of fluidized soil rheology into a depth integrated model water flow characteristics are described using the depth integrated model the present study first explores representation of a single fluid following which the method of discriminating between two materials is described the governing equations fora single fluid are given by a balance of mass 1 d ρ d t ρ div v 0 b balance of linear momentum 2 ρ d v d t div σ ρ g in eq 1 and eq 2 ρ is density v is velocity σ represents total stresses and g represents the acceleration of gravity these equations should be combined with a suitable rheological law to link displacements or velocities to strains or rate of strains boundary and initial conditions are also required for calculation as stated above solving real life three dimensional 3d problems can be computationally expensive as a less computationally expensive alternative depth integrated models have been extensively used for the investigation of actual events the application of depth integrated models to simulate landslide propagation was initiated by savage and hutter 1991 whereafter further research facilitated the extension of the approach to more general situations gray et al 1999 hutter and koch 1991 hutter et al 1993 laigle and coussot 1997 lin et al 2018 mcdougall and hungr 2004 pastor et al 2002 2009 2018 pudasaini and hutter 2007 quecedo et al 2004 pudasaini and hutter 2007 provide a discussion of the limitations of depth integrated models as shown in fig 3 the balance of mass and momentum equations can be integrated along x 3 in this system a a is a typical section of the sliding

based on leibniz s rule 4 a b s f r s d r s a b f r s d r f b s b s f a s a s the depth integrated equations of the fluidized solid can be derived in the same way as for water by assuming the presence of a single fluid as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the integration of sliding mass and water is implemented between z z h s and between z h s z h s h w respectively and gives rise to a balance of mass 5 d

methods approximate physical variables by estimating surrounding values through representing continuum media as a set of particles after applying the sph discretization technique the continuity

fluidized soil the current study has thus far introduced the mathematical formulations and associated sph discretized forms for the two layer model the funwave model which is another component of the hybrid model for simulation of wave propagation is briefly described below 2 2 a nonlinear boussinesq model funwave peregrine 1967 proposed the depth averaged boussinesq equations with the assumption of weak dispersion and nonlinearity comparable to water flows various numerical models of these equations have subsequently been proposed to study the wave transformation processes madisen 1992 madsen et al 1991 nwogu 1993 the boussinesq equations used in funwave were proposed based on the work of wei and kirby 1995 in contrast to the standard and other extended boussinesq models the models provided by wei and kirby 1995 are fully nonlinear this ensures that the equations can capture nonlinear effects and are able to describe strong wave wave interactions occurring near the shore a finite difference model is used to solve the fully nonlinear boussinesq equations in funwave with more detailed descriptions as well as some benchmark tests provided by the funwave user manual shi et al 2013 a brief introduction of the funwave model is given below the two unknown variables within the funwave model are surface elevation η and velocity u α u x z α at a reference elevation z z α x and can be defined as 13 η t m 0 14 u α t u α u α g η v 1 v 2 0 in eq 13 eq 14 the subscript t denotes the partial time derivative hence u α t is the time derivative of the velocity at x z α η t represents the time derivative of the local surface displacement g represents the acceleration of gravity m is the horizontal volume flux term and the dispersive boussinesq terms v 1 v 2 are given as 15 m m 1 m 2 16 m 1 h η u α 17 m 2 h η 1 2 z α 2 1 6 h 2 h η η 2 u α z α 1 2 h η h u α 18 v 1 1 2 z α 2 u α t z α h u α t 1 2 η 2 u α t η h u α t 19 v 2 z α η u α h u α 1 2 z α 2 η 2 u α u α 1 2 h u α t η u α 2 it is worth mentioning that the value of the reference level z α in the above equations needs to be predetermined the choice of z α is suggested to be z α 0 531 h x to minimize the maximum error in wave phase speed nwogu 1993 a simple wetting drying scheme is used in the funwave model to simulate moving shorelines shi et al 2012 as a minimum water depth is defined in the simulation with a suggested field scale value of 0 01 the water depth at the grid is compared with this criterion to determine if it is wet or dry the normal flux n m at the cell interface of a dry cell is set to zero and the wave speeds of the riemann solver for a dry cell are modified as 20 s l v l n g h η l s l v l n 2 g h η l right dry cell 21 s l v r n g h η r s r v r n 2 g h η r left dry cell 2 3 method used to couple the two model components the production of a hybrid model by integrating the sph two layer model with funwave is founded on the implementation of a transformation or overlap zone fig 6 under this approach the sph two layer model is run to capture the generation of waves in the near field once the landslide process halts and the process generating the strong impact has terminated the primary kinetic energy of the landslide has already been transferred to the water and the hydrodynamic conditions velocity and height of water in the overlap zone will be delivered to funwave as the initial state of the subsequent calculation since both models employed in the present study are formulated within a depth integrated framework the velocity and depth of the water constitute unknowns in the simulation of problem fig 7 represents transmission of the flow field including both velocity and depth of the considered domain and illustrates the sph particles to the finite difference mesh each sph particle was first traversed and the relative positions of the particles within the fdm grid were determined the unknowns velocity and depth at every mesh point were then estimated by the values of surrounding particles according to their position relationship see fig 7 b the sph method uses a pure lagrangian mesh free approach to represent continuum media by utilizing a set of distributed particles carrying field variables such as mass density velocity and depth therefore as the depth of each grid point had been calculated by the surrounding particles after the interpolation the wet dry boundary over the simulation domain was obtained by comparing the interpolated depth of each mesh point with the given minimum water depth the transmission process is achieved through an interpolation approach widely used in mesh based methods 22 φ i j 1 n φ j d i j m j 1 n 1 d i j m in eq 2 φ i is the physical quantity at the mesh point i φ j the physical quantity at sph particles j d i j the distance between them and m is set to 1 in the present study 3 benchmark test a numerical benchmark test of solitary wave propagation was conducted to confirm the capability of the proposed hybrid model which is described in the documentation for funwave fig 8 illustrates the initial configuration of the test in which the water depth was taken to be 10 m and the tank had a length of 1024 m the solitary wave was generated at x 300 m with an initial amplitude of 1 0 m and the right sloped started at x 750 with a slope angle of 0 05 rad moreover the water surface elevation and the velocity of the generated wave can be obtained according to the weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations proposed by wei and kirby 1995 the validation strategy used in the present study involved running the one dimension wave propagation case using both the sph funwave hybrid approach and the funwave model respectively the changes in waves over the entire domain estimated by the two methods were then compared and discussed for the sake of brevity the domain considered in the present study was chosen to be the transformation region in the sph funwave hybrid model consequently the steps taken to calculate the hybrid model are described below see fig 9 i run the sph model to simulate the initial wave propagation state ii output the simulated results of the sph model 20 s after the wave generation to act as the input files for funwave iii execute the funwave code to continue the simulation of wave evolution the sph modelling stage involved 1024 sph particles and an absorbing buffer was imposed at the left boundary to prevent the appearance of spurious reflected wave oscillations lin et al 2019 provides further details of this boundary treatment method during the funwave calculation 1 024 3 computational grids were created with an interval of 1 m along the x direction table 1 provides a summary of the numerical and physical parameters used in the funwave model whereas values left unspecified took on default values the generated solitary wave was determined by solving the weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations proposed by wei et al 1995 including the equations for initial free surface and velocity 23 η x t 0 c 1 c 3 sec h 2 c 2 x 24 u α x t 0 c 4 sec h 2 c 2 x the expressions for c i i 1 4 are defined in the appendix of wei et al 1995 the above equations stipulate that the initial velocity and the water depth of each sph particle at a given position can be determined and the calculated values have been verified against the results produced by the wavemaker in funwave froudecap represents the cap for froude number in the velocity calculation for efficiency mindepth is the minimum water depth m for the wetting and drying scheme logical parameters c 1 and c 2 were re calibrated according to choi et al 2018 following the above strategy fig 10 presents and compares the estimated results of the hybrid model with the reference values from funwave the results obtained by the hybrid model showed good general agreement with the reference results from the funwave model the solitary wave propagated towards the right slope with a velocity of 10 m s 1 this propagation speed could be considered reasonable taking into account that wave propagation velocity in still water can be evaluated by v g h furthermore the effect of the slope in reducing wave spread can be observed in fig 10 e in which the solitary wave was obstructed by the boundary and the kinetic energy of wave transfers to its geopotential resulting in a higher wave height 4 case study this section presents a validation of the hybrid model through its application to simulate a potential lgw event including the generation and propagation of impulsive waves in the xiangjiaba reservoir jinsha river china 4 1 geologic setting and computing environment as illustrated in fig 11 the xiangjiaba hydropower station is the furthest downstream large scale hydropower station third largest in china in the lower reaches of the jinsha river this hydropower station forms an integral component of the chinese mega project the west to east electricity transmission project and plays a key role in the regulation of the cascade of power stations operating in the reservoir by collaborating with other hydraulic projects table 2 provides some details and operation parameters of the station geological reports have indicated over 47 potential landslides and 37 incidents of collapsed deposits in the mainstream and main tributaries of the jinsha river these unstable geologic bodies became agitated after initiation of reservoir impoundment as filling up of the reservoir probably further reduced the stability of those unstable masses included in these unstable masses is the halaowo slope with a volume of over 7 106 m3 there is a short distance between the slope and the downstream station of 18 km as the crow flies therefore the triggering of the landslide will generate waves that pose a serious threat to people living along the shore of the dam and to the safe operation of the power station the halaowo slope is composed of purplish red mudstone and grayish yellow sandstone of the jurassic artesian formation and the strike direction of the rock strata is roughly the same as that of the river two landslides have developed in the two upstream gullies adjacent to the halaowo gully the effects of water as well as groundwater seepage can be seen on the slope in addition tensile cracks subsidence and other sliding deformations of the loose materials can be seen on the slope the elevation of the rear edge of the slope is 450 m 460 m and the maximum thickness is 20 m the sliding material is mainly composed of purple clay with block stone and no large block stone is found on the surface of the sliding body field investigations showed that the landslide occurred through the reactivation of an old landslide mass and could be defined as a bedrock bedding landslide with the direction of slide consistent with the tendency of the bedrock the landslide occurred through cutting of the rock strata by the halaowo gully and the consequent formation of a slope composed of purplish red mudstone and sandstone along the eastern side of the gully the influence of heavy rainstorms and other factors resulted in rock strata sliding down the slope and disintegrating to form the present halaowogou landslide mass the geological report refers to the landslide mass as a bingham type fluid with a yield stress and viscosity of 1 kpa and 50 pa s respectively with fig 12 illustrating a typical section of the slope the proposed coupling method aimed to ensure adequate representation of the potential hazards of the landslide event and fig 13 depicts the regional division of the near and far fields including a diagram of sph particles the finite difference mesh as well as the transformation zone with respect to the two layer model the established sph model included 916 landslide particles and 2349 water particles respectively see fig 16 a buffer zones were imposed along the two borders of the computational domain to avoid spurious perturbation near the boundary 1 137 264 unstructured grids were established for the funwave model a sponge layer with a width of 100 m was also imposed along the inflow boundary 4 2 establishment of the transformation zone the reasonable establishment of the transformation zone can achieve good lgw simulation accuracy at a reasonable computational cost the present study defined the transformation zone to cover the area of water body affected by the landslide according to this principle an overlap zone was identified by assessing the domain of waves generated by the landslide fig 14 illustrates the selected zone the velocity of the landslide and the locations of the six gauging points as shown in fig 14 at t 50 s the landslide remained at a maximum velocity of 0 43 m s 1 fig 15 shows the evolution of the water surface at these near boundary points the generated waves reached these monitoring points after t 50 s at both the northern and western borders which ensured that all of the effected water affected the transformation zone by the time of the completion of the landslide and indicated the feasibility of the further computation 4 3 numerical results the simulation of the entire process was initiated by calculating the waves generated in the near field since the sph two layer model was adopted in the current study fig 16 shows the dynamics of water and landslide particles during the wave generation process the semi submerged landslide accelerated after initiation and propagated along both the directions of the original landslide and the river course as the primary kinetic energy from the landslide was transferred to the water column the moving mass deaccelerated after reaching a maximum velocity at t 20 s after which the moving mass gradually stopped and debris were deposited onto the riverbed as mentioned in section 4 2 the comparison of the mobility of the sliding mass and the front of the generated waves resulted in the selection of t 50 s for investigating the transformation with fig 17 showing the simulations of impulsive waves at 50 s by the sph model the behaviors of the waves including the wave height and the propagation velocity within the overlap zone were then passed to the finite difference grids using the above mentioned interpolation method eq 22 section 2 3 provides a description of the method with fig 18 showing the results of interpolation the funwave model was used from this point to examine the propagation of the water waves fig 19 shows the computational domain of the wave propagation as simulated using funwave the considered domain had a length and width of 14 km and 6 4 km respectively and was divided into a 10 m 10 m grid for a total of 64 rows and 140 columns a sponge layer with a width of 50 m was imposed along the western border to avoid numerical instability and spurious wave reflections at the numerical boundary moreover the grid at the position of the dam was modified according to the profile of the dam to consider the potential reflected waves generated by the dam the river channel was divided into four sections with three monitoring points in each section to investigate the wave propagation process in the river basin fig 19 shows the positions of the sections the slope and the hydropower station figs 20 23 show the evolution of the water surface at the referenced points since section 1 is located inside the transformation zone the three monitoring points within the section measured the initial wave height at the beginning of the simulation of wave propagation moreover as shown in fig 20 among points 1 to 3 point 3 experienced the largest height of the first wave crest this result can be attributed to point 3 being positioned closest to the opposite slope of the landslide with the run up of waves on the slope resulting at a higher water level at point 3 subsequently the water levels at the three monitoring points in section 1 gradually converged toward uniformity as shown in fig 21 the generated waves propagated to section 2 after 250 s at which time all three points in section 2 experienced very similar waveforms the continuous dissipation of energy during the propagation of the generated waves along the river resulted in a reduction in the maximum wave crest height in section 2 see fig 21 from 5 m in section 1 to less than 3 m as shown in fig 22 by the time the waves arrived at section 3 the maximum wave heights had declined to 2 m from this point until the end of the calculation the amplitudes of the waves in section 3 gradually declined and oscillated slightly at the still water level unlike the upstream sections the peak wave height appeared in section 4 at the second wave crest as shown in fig 23 the reflections of the wave remarkably influenced the propagation of the wave in the area near the dam wall and resulted in a wave amplitude of 2 m compared with the first wave crest of 1 6 m in addition it should be noted that the three points in section 4 showed consistent changes in the water surface over time thereby demonstrating that the distribution of waves in the channel tends to become synchronized as the distance from the source of the impulsive wave increases fig 24 a f illustrate the entire process of wave propagation at t 100 s t 200 s t 400 s t 600 s t 1000 s and t 1200 s respectively as shown in fig 24 the generated waves remained at a relatively high level in the near field at t 100 s whereas the maximum wave height dropped significantly below 10 m after 200 s subsequently the front of the impulsive waves gradually developed downstream as shown on the right side of the fig 24 as shown in fig 24 e the wavefront arrived at the upstream surface of xiangjiaba dam at 800 s at the same time the wave was reflected and started to propagate upwards due to the dam body blocking the path of the wave finally at the end of the computation at t 1200 s most areas of the river return to a normal water surface level as the reflected waves exhibited considerable decay due to the dissipation of energy except for some areas in the vicinity of the near field in which relatively large waves could still be observed 4 4 management of risk to navigation as shown in fig 25 the present study investigated the potential impact of the generated waves on the watercourse and coastal regions through model simulations of maximum wave height there remains scope for improvement in the national standard for risk management of potential impulsive waves in inland waterways in china since the potential scale of impulsive waves has been widely used to assess security in waterways within ocean shipping management huang et al 2016 proposed the application of ocean shipping management risk classification methods to inland waterways in accordance with the classification of watercourse hazard alert levels specified in the emergency plan for storm surge sea wave tsunami and sea ice disasters published by the state oceanic administration of the people s republic of china the present study set four risk zones 1 a red alert zone for wave heights exceeding 3 m 2 an orange alert zone for wave heights from 2 m to 3 m 3 a yellow alert zone for wave heights from 1 m to 2 m and 4 a blue alert zone for wave heights of below 1 m hence the risk posed by impulsive waves resulting from the halaowo landslide can be characterized according to this grading system fig 26 shows the spatial distribution of the potential risks resulting from the halaowo landslide in the xiangjiaba reservoir area 5 conclusions and future work the sph model is considered to be a powerful tool for addressing challenges associated with the simulation of lgws such as fluid solid interaction complex topography and a large deformable free surface these phenomena usually occur in a limited enclosed spatial area close to the landslide source referred to as the near field in lgw analysis more cost effective methods are considered more appropriate for simulation of the wave propagation in the far field such as the finite difference method the present study attempted to combine the advantages of different methods for the study of the entire lifecycle of an lgw in a reservoir area by presenting a hybrid sph funwave model the basic concept of this hybrid approach is to use the sph two layer model to analyze the process of the impulsive wave generation and the funwave model to simulate the propagation of waves in the river basin this hybrid approach effectively allows the disadvantages of the two individual models to be overcome and allows full exploitation of the capabilities of each model through the integration consequently the hybrid model can be a powerful tool for studying and simulating lgws one of the key points within this hybridization strategy is the imposition of the overlap zone in which information is transferred from the sph model to the funwave model finally the present study applied the proposed hybrid method to examine a potential lgw event in the jinsha river area china the present study presented the results obtained from the hybrid model and produced a map showing the spatial distribution of risk of lgws resulting from the halaowo landslide in the jinsha river which could be used to mitigate potential lgw disasters in the region of the jinsha river basin the limitations of the hybrid approach presented in the current paper are given blow the original flow characteristics in the river require further consideration the current study assumed the initial flow before the triggering of the landslide to be static which does not match reality the dynamic behavior of landslides are controlled by geologic and tectonic conditions and landslides may change direction and spread contract split or join in response to local terrain the use of 3d models would be more appropriate to solve these problems in which complicated topography and interactions need to be considered rather than the depth integrated scheme applied in the present work the hybridization presented in the current study was conducted by implementing the transformation zone through the use of the restart function in the funwave code consequently the sph and the funwave models were not integrated during the simulation the simulations of the sph model can also be transferred to funwave by imposing dynamic boundaries which can improve the continuity of the computation and reduce the computational effort when a large near field domain requires consideration the sph funwave hybrid model presented in the current study was established based on an integration of the two models among the two models the sph model has been widely applied to the analysis of landslide problems including fully submerged or semi submerged landslide events many studies in the literature have successfully applied the funwave model to the simulation of tsunami waves hence the hybrid model proposed in the current study shows promise for simulating submarine landslides or landslides triggered along the coastal shorelines the model could be applied to investigate landslide induced nearshore wave transformation refraction and wave propagation and inundation from ocean basin to nearshore scales credit authorship contribution statement chuan lin has

of interest in a broad range of engineering applications fio involves complex fluid structure interaction mechanisms and instabilities williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 the two frequently encountered fio phenomena are vortex induced vibration viv and galloping viv is excited by alternating vortex shedding and is characterized by self limited amplitude extensive literature on viv has been comprehensively and extensively reviewed to understand the underlying mechanics and hydrodynamic interactions for decades starting in the early 1900 and more recently by bearman 1984 2011 bernitsas 2016 gabbai and benaroya 2005 2004 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 1979 sumner 2010 2013 rostami and armandei 2017 and williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 galloping is another fio phenomenon which involves aero hydro elastic instability its salient features include lower frequencies and larger amplitudes than viv blevins 1990 chang et al 2011 javed and abdelkefi 2018 galloping is usually induced by asymmetrical flow caused by a bluff structure or by incoming perturbed flow it is more powerful and detrimental than viv and does not depend on vortex formation ding et al 2015 bernitsas 2016 fio which may cause undesirable damage deterioration and even collapse of engineering structures is mostly treated as a destructive phenomenon to prevent instead of mitigating destructive fio bernitsas and raghavan 2009 strengthened these destructive phenomena for extracting hydrokinetic marine energy using the vivace vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy converter it enhances fio s and extends their synchronization range to maximize hydrokinetic energy extracted from a fluid flow this kind of hydrokinetic energy conversion based on alternating rather than steady lift is an environmentally compatible way for harnessing mhk marine hydrokinetic energy ma et al 2016 sun et al 2019 sun and bernitsas 2019 to further increase the energy extracting performance of the vivace converter the synergistic fios of two or more tandem cylinders have been investigated experimentally in the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab park et al 2012 2014 kim and bernitsas 2016 bernitsas 2016 sun et al 2017 sun and bernitsas 2019 local roughness passive turbulence control ptc is applied to the cylinders to impose turbulent stimulation as shown in figs 1 and 2 multiple cylinders in transverse flow direction are generally employed in a large number of engineering applications the interactive fios between two adjacent elastically mounted cylinders may affect flow separation shear layer reattachment vortex impingement on downstream cylinders and vortex interaction which are strongly dependent upon the configurational arrangement of the adjacent cylinders as well as reynolds number zdravkovich 2003a 2003b although some researchers borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 have investigated fios of two adjacent elastically mounted circular cylinders and improved our understanding of interactive mechanisms systematic and deep understanding fios are still lacking major previous investigations were performed at low reynolds numbers which were located in the flow regimes trsl1 and trsl2 which are defined as trsl1 300 500 re 1 103 2 103 and trsl2 1 103 2 103 re 2 104 4 104 trsl stands for transition in shear layer in the trsl3 2 104 4 104 re 1 105 2 105 flow regime the shear layers are fully turbulent forming stronger vortices closer to the afterbody and thus resulting in the highest lift coefficient zdravkovich 2003a accordingly the alternating lift force achieves its highest level in trsl3 resulting in a larger displacement amplitude and intensive fio bernitsas et al 2008 in addition the mass ratio values measured in some previous investigations alam and meyer 2013 alam and kim 2009 kim et al 2009 were rather high during wind tunnel experiments a high mass ratio can decrease the amplitude response and shrink the fio synchronization range significantly in the trsl3 flow regime there are few investigations focusing on interactive fio s of two adjacent elastically mounted tandem rough circular cylinders with low mass ratio the mrelab research team has primarily investigated fio of two or more rough or smooth cylinders in the trsl3 flow regime experimentally park et al 2014 kim and bernitsas 2016 sun et al 2017 2019 2020 2019 lan et al 2018 ji et al 2018 xu et al 2018 2019 yuan et al 2020 and numerically ding et al 2013 2015 2017 2019 a summary of the mrelab relevant research is presented in table 1 park et al 2014 experimentally studied the selective surface roughness effect on suppression of flow induced motions of two cylinders in tandem by varying flow velocity and cylinder center to center spacing kim and bernitsas 2016 presented an investigation on performance prediction of horizontal hydrokinetic energy converter using multiple cylinder synergy in fio they showed that multiple cylinders in proximity can synergistically work and harness more energy than the same number of single cylinders in isolation sun et al 2017 experimentally investigated spacing and stiffness effect on hydrokinetic energy conversion by two rough tandem cylinders in fio sun et al 2019 presented an experimental investigation on spacing effect damping effect and stiffness effect on fio of two cylinders sun et al 2020 experimentally studied hydrokinetic energy conversion by two rough tandem cylinders in fio with nonlinear adaptive damping rather than adjusting the configuration parameters of the converter the results show that introducing adaptive damping into the tandem cylinders overcomes the shielding effect lan et al 2018 investigated experimentally the relation between oscillation patterns and frequency response of two rough cylinders in tandem three dominant patterns of oscillation of two tandem rough cylinders were revealed by calculating the instantaneous phase difference between the two cylinders ji et al 2018 presented an experimental investigation on fio of two elastically mounted smooth circular cylinders in staggered arrangement based on the characteristics of the displacement response five interactive oscillation patterns were identified and their corresponding regions in the staggered parametric plane of the in flow spacing and transverse cylinder spacing were defined xu et al 2018 experimentally studied fio s and hydrokinetic power conversion of two staggered rough cylinders xu et al 2019 experimentally investigated fio s of two elastically mounted tandem smooth cylinders in cross flow at subcritical reynolds numbers yuan et al 2020 experimentally identified and classified five major patterns with nine sub patterns based on the amplitudes frequencies and the phase angle differences between the two cylinders in tandem ding et al 2013 presented a numerical investigation on fio of two cylinders by studying their amplitude response frequency response and near wake structure ding et al 2015 numerically studied the flow patterns of four configurations with 1 2 3 and 4 cylinders in tandem to show the interaction between multiple ptc cylinders ding et al 2017 presented a numerical study on tandem spacing effect on fio of two cylinders ding et al 2019 numerically investigated interactive fio of two cylinders to elucidate hydrokinetic energy harvesting further it should be pointed out that within the reynolds range tested trsl3 flow regime some flow particulars remain constant and some change the major constant properties are a the shear layers are fully turbulent over the entire trsl3 flow regime regardless of re as a result vortex roll up is strong and formation length is short resulting in a high and constant lift coefficient zdravkovich 2003a b the amplitude of response increases slightly with the energy of the flow in viv the relation between response amplitude a d and re was shown in model tests by raghavan and bernitsas 2011 and explained in a major development by bernitsas et al 2019 as a d was decoupled from the generic strouhal number st n and linked only to re st n was linked to the added mass and mass ratio only through an eigen relation the major changing properties are c in transition from viv to galloping vortices shed and are in synchronization with the galloping instability mechanism which is dominant in higher speeds then the dependence of a d on re becomes much stronger d in galloping vortex shedding is not in synchronization with the cylinder oscillation and some vortices may oppose the motion the galloping instability dominates the fio and a d increases strongly with re nevertheless systematic investigations of reynolds number effect on interactive fio s with numerical flow visualization are still lacking the flow patterns associated with the modes and the characteristics of the oscillations of the two adjacent tandem rough cylinders need to be analyzed for maximizing energy harvesting by the vivace converter the flow visualization and identification of the flow patterns are critical in understanding the fluid mechanism of multi cylinder arrangements for this converter moreover reynolds number has a significant effect on fio s of two adjacent elastically mounted circular cylinders and their wake several researchers have investigated this effect for different configurational arrangements igarashi and tamotsu 1981 1984 xu and zhou 2004 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 sumner 2010 ji et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the reynolds number effect on the interactive fio s of two adjacent elastically mounted tandem rough circular cylinders numerically with experimental verification and thus gaining insight into the underlying flow mechanism the cylinders are free to oscillate transversely to the flow direction experiments are conducted in reynolds number range 30 000 re 120 000 which falls in the high lift trsl3 flow regime the reduced velocity range is u 2 48 14 22 the mass ratio is constant m 1 343 the damping ratio is set ζ 0 14 and 0 26 for k 600n m ζ 0 26 for k 1 200n m and the center to center in flow spacing ratio is d d 2 57 2d urans equations with the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model are utilized for numerical simulations the cfd codes were originally developed by wu et al 2014 in previous work the numerical simulations achieved good agreement with experimentally measured data ding et al 2013 2015 2016 the amplitude response and frequency response are presented together with the vortex shedding sequence divergent interactive fios between the two tandem rough cylinders are observed in the simulations with different reynolds number the underlying mechanism is discussed this paper is organized as follows the physical model in experiments and simulations is described in section 2 in section 3 the mathematical models of the flow and the oscillators are presented the amplitude and frequency response of simulation results for two tandem rough cylinders are shown in section 4 and in section 5 respectively in section 6 five interactive flow patterns between two tandem rough cylinders are discussed using experimental data and numerical results conclusions are presented at the end 2 physical model in this study the physical model consists of two oscillatory systems as shown in fig 1 a the main parameters of each oscillator are a a controller imposed virtual spring of stiffness k and b a controller imposed virtual damping c the rigid circular cylinder diameter d and length l and the cylinder in flow spacing d remain constant a damper spring vck controller originated and implemented by sun et al 2015 2016 2017 was utilized for emulating the physical dampers and springs of the oscillator this vck system generates the damping and spring stiffness without including the hydrodynamic force in the control loop thus avoiding bias lee et al 2011 the two adjacent rigid rough cylinders elastically supported are positioned in a tandem arrangement and are constrained to oscillate in the cross flow direction a photograph of two tandem rough cylinder oscillators installed in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel of the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab is shown in fig 1 b detailed description of the ltfsw channel is provided by sun et al 2016 in the present study the center to center in flow spacing ratio d d is set at 2 57 this region is traditionally considered as proximity wake interference regime d d 4 zdravkovich 1987 the fio of the upstream cylinder is enhanced by the presence of the downstream cylinder so that the two cylinder vivace converter can achieve higher efficiency sun et al 2017 ding et al 2019 through synergistic fio s the wake dynamics of the two adjacent cylinders are coupled resulting in complex and rich flow variations borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 sun et al 2017 2019 xu et al 2019 the configurational parameters in numerical simulations are identical with those used in the corresponding experiments as listed in tables 2 and 3 to extend the synchronization range of fio s of cylinders passive turbulence control in the form of two straight roughness trips is utilized chang et al 2011 according to the fio to ptc map park et al 2017 the placement angle is set at α p t c 20 the coverage provided by each ptc is 16 the detailed configuration of ptc is shown in fig 2 chang et al 2011 the thickness of ptc is matching with the thickness of the boundary layer and impacts fio profoundly chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 table 4 shows the detailed parameters of the roughness strip utilized in the present study 3 mathematical models 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model the 2d urans equations in conjunction with the spalart allmaras 1992 turbulence model are employed to solve the flow around the two oscillating tandem cylinders a developed cfd code based on openfoam beaudoina and jasakb 2008 is utilized for simulating interactive fio s wu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 the detailed cfd parameter selections can be obtained in ding et al 2019 briefly the 2d urans governing equations are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s j i u j u i where u i is the corresponding mean flow velocity components x i denotes cartesian coordinates ν represents the molecular kinematic viscosity and s i j is the mean strain rate tensor 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the symmetric quantity τ i j u i u j denotes the reynolds stress tensor in the spalart allmaras model the boussinesq approximation is utilized to associate the reynolds stress with the mean velocity gradient the expression is 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j where ν t denotes the kinematic eddy viscosity defined as ν t ν f ν 1 f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 χ ν ν ν represents an intermediate working variable of the turbulence model and performs as modeled by the following transport equation 5 ν t u j ν x j c b 1 1 f t 2 s ν c w 1 f w c b 1 κ 2 f t 2 ν d 2 1 σ x j ν ν ν x j c b 2 ν x i ν x i f t 1 δ u 2 additional information on functions and constants can be found in spalart and allmaras 1992 in this study the trip terms f t 1 and f t 2 are shut off and the trip less initial condition travin et al 2000 for ν is employed wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 2015 2016 3 2 oscillator equations and numerical schemes the cylinder dynamics in fio is introduced by a classical mass damper spring oscillator model the equation is briefly expressed as 6 m y c y k y f f l u i d y where m represents the total inertial mass of the oscillatory system c is the total damping which encompasses the structural damping c s t r u c t u r e and the harness damping c h a r n e s s f f l u i d y is the lift force on the cylinder in direction y transversely to the flow direction the system of first order differential equations equivalent to eq 6 is 7 m u f f l u i d y c y k y 8 y u where u denotes the velocity of the oscillating cylinder in the cross flow direction velocity u and displacement y of the two oscillating tandem rough cylinders are achieved in a compounded implicit explicit way through solving the equation of motion together with the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the superscript n denotes values at the current time step and n 1 for the new time step then 9 u n u n 1 u n δ t 10 u n 1 u n δ t f f l u i d y c y k y m 11 y n 1 y n δ t u n 1 in addition a second order gauss integration scheme with linear interpolation is utilized to calculate the divergence gradient and laplacian terms in the governing equations the time integration is decoded through a second order backward euler method therefore the numerical discretization scheme can achieve second order accuracy in space and time the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is employed for resolving the momentum and continuity equations together in a segregated way ding et al 2019 3 3 computational domain as shown in fig 3 the computational flow domain for the two adjacent tandem ptc cylinders is prescribed as a rectangular area of 52 57d diameters in the flow direction by 13 2d in the cross flow direction the entire domain encompasses five boundaries inflow outflow top bottom and two cylinder walls the equilibrium positions of the two adjacent tandem cylinders in the flow domain are located at the middle of the cross flow direction the length between the center of the upstream cylinder downstream cylinder and the inlet boundary outlet boundary l up l down is 25d for capturing the wake information of the two tandem rough cylinders at the inflow boundary a uniform and constant velocity with a zero gradient pressure and a fixed ν are considered at the outlet boundary a zero gradient condition is specified for velocity pressure and ν the bottom is defined as a wall boundary to match the experimental conditions the top boundary is simplified by defining it as a wall ding et al 2019 the effect of the free surface on the fio presented in the experiments was not considered in the numerical study ding et al 2019 bernitsas et al 2007 raghavan et al 2009 a moving wall boundary is set for the two ptc cylinders in fio s the ptc strip consists of commercial grade sandpaper p60 with sand grits as shown in fig 2 and table 3 in the computational grid the sandpaper thickness of the ptc is modeled as part of the cylinder surface fig 5 then a wall function type boundary condition is imposed for ν t and ν to implement the effect of sand grids wu et al 2014 in addition the trip less initial condition for the eddy viscosity is employed wu et al 2014 travin et al 2000 3 4 grid generation two dimensional structured computational grids were generated in each numerical simulation case to avoid the mesh deformation in fio s a dynamic topological mesh technique combined with general grid interface ggi is utilized beaudoin and jasak 2008 ding et al 2019 in order to capture the boundary layer separation around the cylinder a 2d 2d square subdomain with mesh refinement is set the 2d 2d square sub domain can move together with the cylinder during fio s with no mesh changing ding et al 2019 using the topological mesh technique the first layer adjoint to the top or bottom boundary of each square can be merged into the second layer when the mesh is compressed and can be split into two layers when the mesh is dilated ding et al 2019 the left and right boundaries of the 2d 2d square sub domain are defined as ggi which allows mapping one boundary to another thus low deformation and high quality mesh are maintained when the two cylinders are undergoing large amplitude fio s in the present work the grid resolution around the cylinders was set at 240 35 circumferential radial as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 close up images of the grids total of 138 208 cells for the case of two ptc cylinders are presented when the cylinders are in fio s the value of y produced by the selected near wall grid spacing was between 30 and 50 depending on the reynolds number the computational time step was set as 5 10 5s ensuring that the courant number remains less than 1 the grid sensitivity study can be found in earlier publications wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 the physical and numerical models in this paper are the same as in previously published papers ding et al 2013 2015 2016 2017 2019 sun et al 2019 thus they were presented only briefly above keeping the models the same is essential for comparison to experiments and makes it possible to investigate complementary questions as shown in table 1 4 amplitude response three series of simulation of fio s for the two rough cylinders in tandem were performed with k 600n m ζ 0 14 k 600n m ζ 0 26 and k 1 200n m ζ 0 26 the range of reynolds number is 30 000 re 120 000 which is located in the trsl3 flow regime characterized by high lift the corresponding reduced velocity ranges are 3 50 u 14 22 for k 600n m and 2 48 u 10 06 for k 1 200n m the parameters in the numerical simulations are identical with those in the experimental tests in this section the amplitude response of the two adjacent elastically mounted tandem cylinders is analyzed comparison between simulations and experiments is presented in fig 6 for the upstream cylinder and fig 7 for the downstream cylinder 4 1 upstream cylinder three series of numerical and experimental results of amplitude response for the upstream cylinder are presented in fig 6 for comparison it is obvious that back to back viv and galloping phenomena are achieved in all three amplitude ratio plots in spite of the high damping which delays the onset of galloping the reason is that the fio is enhanced by introducing passive turbulence control chang et al 2011 within the tested re range four regions are clearly observed initial branch of viv the upper branch of viv transition region from viv to galloping and galloping region a 30 000 re 45 000 this is the initial branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the initial viv branch region is 45 000 re 60 000 nevertheless for all parameters the initial branch starts at about the same reduced velocity value u 4 the numerical amplitude ratio vs re u u follows well the experimental results the amplitude ratio increases gradually with increasing reduced velocity experimental and numerical results show that at the end of the initial viv branch the amplitude ratio reaches 0 9 for ζ 0 14 and 0 75 for ζ 0 26 for low k and low ζ the amplitude ratio increases much faster than for high k or high ζ b 45 000 re 75 000 this is the upper branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the upper viv branch region is 60 000 re 75 000 which is shrunk by 50 due to high stiffness and high damping ratio high stiffness results in the viv region moving to higher velocity and high damping ratio causes shifting of the galloping region to lower velocity which instigates back to back viv and galloping but shrinks the viv region in this region the amplitude ratio of numerical results at re 50 000 re 60 000 and re 70 000 in the three series agree well with the experimental results moreover experimental and numerical results show that the amplitude ratio in the upper branch is kept at a constant value of 0 9 for ζ 0 14 and 0 75 for ζ 0 26 c 75 000 re 90 000 this is the transition region from viv to galloping which encompasses the lower branch of viv the gap between viv and galloping and the onset of galloping it is evident that the back to back viv and galloping is achieved for all three amplitude ratio values the viv range shifts as the stiffness changes and shrinks with increasing damping in addition the onset of galloping increases with increasing damping ratio ζ blevins 1990 the trends for numerical results in this region are delayed compared to the experimental results as function of re u u which are all proportional to u several effects may contribute to this discrepancy a the ptc effect in numerical simulation is not as prominent as in experiments chang et al 2011 which leads to the ptc being unable to trigger fio s of the cylinders into galloping as early as in the experiments ding et al 2019 b the 3d flow distortion due to the support frames of the cylinder in the channel reducing the uniformity of the flow along the cylinders ding et al 2019 c the effect of blockage fig 1 albeit limited adds an error to the experiments bernitsas 2016 ding et al 2019 d in spite of the ptc presence which forces flow separation and consequently minimizes three dimensional effects some three dimensionality in the flow is expected in experimental fio ding et al 2019 the cfd simulations performed are two dimensional e tip effects may be significant even though ptc reduces them kinaci et al 2016 ding et al 2019 nevertheless experimental and cfd results exhibit the same phenomena and trend d 90 000 re this is the galloping region the experimental amplitude ratio of the rough cylinder reaches 2 2 for k 600n m ζ 0 14 at re 118 000 however for k 1 200n m ζ 0 26 the ratio only reaches 1 2 due to high stiffness and high damping as in c above the numerical results in the galloping region are delayed in comparison to the experimental data however the trend agrees with the experimental results as the amplitude ratio increases quickly at the beginning of the galloping region 4 2 downstream cylinder three series of amplitude ratio for the numerical and experimental results for the downstream cylinder are plotted in fig 7 for comparison the trend of the numerical results follows well with the experimental data the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is severely suppressed by the upstream cylinder in viv the four regions are not very clearly observed in the three amplitude ratio curves a 30 000 re 45 000 this is the initial branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the initial viv branch region is 45 000 re 60 000 fig 7 shows that the numerical results at re 40 000 for k 600n m and re 50 000 for k 1 200n m follow closely with the experimental data at the end of the initial viv branch the amplitude ratio reaches 0 4 at k 600n m ζ 0 14 the numerical and experimental results show that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is lower than their counterparts in the upstream cylinder in other words the downstream cylinder is strongly suppressed among the dynamic wake of the upstream cylinder this phenomenon will be interpreted in section 6 1 b 45 000 re 75 000 this is the upper branch for k 600n m the experimental amplitude ratios show that the downstream cylinder is suppressed in the whole upper viv branch and kept at a constant value around 0 3 0 4 however the numerical results show that at the beginning of the upper branch the downstream cylinder is suppressed but as the flow velocity increases the amplitude increases starting at re 60 000 this observation indicates that the vorticity intensity from the upstream cylinder in experiments is stronger than in simulations for k 1 200n m the upper viv branch region is 60 000 re 80 000 the cfd results agree well with the experimental data the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is suppressed by the upstream cylinder c 75 000 re 90 000 this is the transition region from viv to galloping for the upstream cylinder which encompasses the lower branch of viv the gap between viv and galloping and the onset of galloping for k 600n m the experimental data show that the amplitude ratio in the transition region has a great jump from 0 5 to 1 25 for ζ 0 14 and from 0 4 to 0 75 for ζ 0 26 however the numerical results show that the amplitude ratio increases slowly from 0 2 to 1 from the end of the upper branch in the transition region the numerical amplitude ratio does not exhibit such a great jump but gradually increases and follows the experimental trend after some delay in re u u for k 1 200n m the experimental amplitude ratio has no notable change and is kept at about 0 4 and the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data d 90 000 re this is the galloping region for k 600n m as the velocity increases the experimental amplitude ratio increases from 1 0 to 1 5 for ζ 0 14 and from 0 75 to 1 3 for ζ 0 26 the numerical results have a similar trend from re 110 000 for ζ 0 14 and from re 120 000 for ζ 0 26 there is a lag for numerical simulations compared to experiments the reasons were explained in section 4 1 for the upstream cylinder for k 1 200n m the experimental amplitude ratio increases from 0 5 to 0 9 from re 90 000 however after re 120 000 there is a drop appearing and the amplitude ratio decreases to 0 5 then increases slowly as the velocity increases the numerical results have a lag compared to the experimental data and follow the same trend after re 120 000 the numerical results show a drop like the experimental data the reason for the drop needs to be researched further in the future 5 frequency response fast fourier transform fft is used to calculate the numerical frequency for each case and for each cylinder the frequency ratios f f o s c f n v a c u u m of the oscillation cylinders are plotted versus reynolds number re flow velocity u and reduced velocity u w a t e r in figs 8 and 9 the frequency ratio f f o s c f n v a c c u m of each cylinder is non dimensionalized by the corresponding system natural frequency in air the experimental data is presented with the numerical frequency results for verification a 35 000 re 75 000 this is the initial branch and upper branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the initial viv branch region is 45 000 re 75 000 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data showing the same trend the oscillation frequency ratio increases from 0 7 to 1 0 for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the oscillation frequency ratio increases from 0 7 to 0 9 b 75 000 re 90 000 this is the transition region from viv to galloping for the upstream cylinder which encompasses the lower branch of viv the gap between viv and galloping and the onset of galloping in experiments the oscillation frequency ratio decreases from 1 0 to 0 8 for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the oscillation frequency ratio declines from 0 9 to 0 8 the numerical frequency ratio has a similar behavior delayed as was observed in the amplitude response in addition to the explanations provided in section 4 1 this delay may be attributed to the effectiveness of the ptc as a turbulent stimulator in the cfd simulations the roughness of the strips in experiments is not modeled in cfd c 90 000 re this is the galloping region the oscillation frequency ratio in both experimental data and numerical results stay nearly unchanged this observation agrees with those of sun et al 2016 2017 within the galloping region the numerical oscillation frequency ratios are 0 9 higher than experimental data 0 8 the reasons were explained above and this is consistent with previous investigations by ding et al 2019 6 interactive flow induced oscillations of two tandem ptc cylinders overall the numerical results of amplitude response and frequency response for the two rough cylinders in tandem are in good agreement with experimental measurements different oscillations are observed with increasing reynolds number it is obvious that the reynolds number has an important effect on the wake of two tandem rough cylinders in this section five interactive flow patterns of the two rough cylinders in tandem are observed in the proximity wake region in the range of 30 000 re 120 000 they are analyzed using displacement response frequency spectrum lift coefficient and vortex sequence to elucidate the mechanisms of this complex dynamic response in previous tests sun et al 2019 the vortex structures as animated by cfd matched very well with experimentally visualized vortex structures for this discussion the experimental results with displacement response and frequency spectrum are selected from k 600n m ζ 0 14 the numerical results with displacement response frequency spectrum and lift coefficient are selected from k 600n m ζ 0 14 k 600n m ζ 0 26 and k 1 200n m ζ 0 26 the presented vortex sequences are selected from k 600n m ζ 0 14 it should be noted that the chosen velocity or re number from experimental data is not strictly identical to the velocity or re number from the numerical results with k 600n m ζ 0 14 however the observed phenomena are identical between experiments and simulations in our subsequent analysis wherever possible the terminology introduced by williamson 1988 to identify vortex shedding structures 2s 2p etc is adopted which has been extensively utilized to descript flow patterns around cylinders table 5 shows some research related to the flow pattern terminology in the past decade the terminology introduced by sumner 2010 and zhou and alam 2016 to elucidate fluid structure interactions e g vortex pairing and enveloping is also used for each reynolds number instantaneous flow fields with several time instants are presented the specific time instants are marked with letters a b c etc and with points on the plots at the top of each set of figures showing the variation of the cylinder displacement and lift force the characteristics of the five identified interactive flow patterns are discussed in detail in following subsections a summary of characteristics of the five flow patterns is presented in table 6 6 1 pattern ⅰ absorbed vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder in initial viv branch main characteristics of pattern i in the initial viv branch the vortices shed from the downstream cylinder are absorbed by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder fig 11 resulting in the downstream cylinder being always submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder the two cylinders oscillate synchronously as an extended body the two cylinders oscillate in phase with the same frequency fig 10 yuan et al 2020 also observed this phenomenon through systematic analysis of extensive experimental data as shown in fig 10 the displacement histories and frequency spectra of experimental and numerical results in the initial branch present similar characteristics the two cylinders move synchronously with the same oscillating frequency the upstream cylinder is leading the downstream cylinder in oscillation and the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is slightly higher than the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 11 in the initial viv branch the 2s two single shedding vortices per cycle vortex shedding model is clearly observed in the back of the upstream cylinder similar observation can be found in ding et al 2013 and ding et al 2019 as the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder pass close to the downstream cylinder they may absorb the same rotation vortices from the downstream cylinder limiting the vortex formations behind the downstream cylinder and exerting shedding effect on the downstream cylinder as shown in instant d t 5 55s thus the downstream cylinder is always submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder and the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is lower this phenomenon only allows small scale and very weak vortices generating after the downstream cylinder thus limiting vortex shedding formation therefore the fio of the downstream cylinder is induced by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder oscillating with the upstream cylinder similar to an extended body as shown in fig 10 that is the downstream cylinder is forced to oscillate by the vortices from the upstream cylinder this can also be observed in the displacement ratio curves and fft analysis in fig 10 the two cylinders have the same oscillating frequency the displacement of the downstream cylinder is slightly suppressed 6 2 pattern ⅱ interfered vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder at the beginning of the upper viv branch main characteristics of pattern ⅱ at the beginning of the upper viv branch the vortices shed from the downstream cylinder are interfered by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder fig 13 resulting in the downstream cylinder having two oscillating frequencies one is equal to the upstream cylinder s oscillation frequency the other one being its own independent oscillating frequency of the downstream cylinder fig 12 this observation agrees with that of yuan et al 2020 as shown in fig 12 the experimental results and numerical results both show a prominent beating phenomenon that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shown in the time history of displacement response appears periodic variation at a lower frequency the maximum amplitude reaches 0 5d but in some places the amplitude ratio is close to zero as shown in the frequency spectra the upstream cylinder only has one dominant frequency but the downstream cylinder has two dominant frequencies one is the same as that of the upstream cylinder the other one is a lower frequency it should be noted that the phenomenon occurs at different reynolds numbers in experiment and simulation with the same system parameters as explained in section 4 1 c one characteristic of this interfered vortex shedding phenomenon is that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder begins to increase with increasing flow velocity as shown in fig 7 the reason is that the downstream cylinder cannot escape from the wake of the upstream cylinder the interpretation will be presented in the following vortex sequence as shown in fig 13 the displacement history of the downstream cylinder has a prominent crest or trough between sequential crest or trough there is a small crest and trough synchronizing with the upstream cylinder s crest and trough this phenomenon indicates that the downstream cylinder oscillates with two frequencies the time sequence of vortex shedding shows that in the vortex structure of the near wake of the upstream cylinder a clear quasi 2p vortex pattern is observed as shown at instance g t 6 50s this vortex structure is similar to that simulated by ding et al 2015 quasi 2p represents that two pairs of vortices shed per cycle but in each pair one vortex is weaker than the other for the downstream cylinder the 2s vortex pattern is observed as shown in instant g t 6 50s as explained in section 6 1 the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder pass the downstream cylinder closely absorbing part of the same rotation vorticity from the downstream cylinder instant a t 5 60s the downstream cylinder is induced to oscillate due to the wake induced force from the upstream cylinder meanwhile 2s vortex shedding can be observed after the downstream cylinder instant g t 6 50s with a lower frequency in here this phenomenon is identified as interfered vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder 6 3 pattern ⅲ independent vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder in the middle of upper viv branch main characteristics of pattern iii in the middle of the upper viv branch the downstream cylinder can oscillate independently but the oscillating frequency is lower than the upstream cylinder shown in fig 14 this observation agrees with that of yuan et al 2020 as shown in fig 14 the frequency spectra of numerical results show that the two cylinders have only one dominant oscillation frequency in the middle of the upper viv branch the oscillation frequency of the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the upstream cylinder due to the shielding effect in this case the downstream cylinder completely escapes from the wake of the upstream cylinder and oscillates independently in experiments however the phenomenon is more complicated as the downstream cylinder also has two dominant frequencies as in pattern ii the reason is that the downstream cylinder does not escape from the wake of the upstream cylinder in the experiments this is consistent with the delay in numerical results compared to experiments as shown in fig 15 the regular displacement histories of the two cylinders have different frequencies the upstream cylinder s frequency is higher than that of the downstream cylinder each crest or trough of the downstream cylinder lift coefficient has a saddle which is generated by the separation of a pair of vortices from the upstream cylinder this phenomenon is related to the shed vortex structures which is analyzed in the following discussion on vortex sequences as shown in fig 15 the time sequence of vortex shedding shows that in the vortex structure of the near wake of the upstream cylinder a clear quasi 2p vortex pattern ding et al 2015 is observed instant g t 6 95s the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder do not impinge on the downstream cylinder and do not reattach the shear layer of the downstream cylinder instant c t 6 35s and instant e t 6 65s therefore the vortices can independently shed from the downstream cylinder this trend is not be surprising since the downstream cylinder at all times remains submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder it should be noted that the effective flow velocity in the wake of the upstream cylinder is lower than the open flow encountered by the upstream cylinder consequently the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the upstream cylinder this is the reason that the downstream cylinder has only one dominant frequency which is lower compared to the upstream cylinder in both numerical simulations the pair of vortices shed from the top or bottom of the upstream cylinder do not shed simultaneously but alternatingly hence a deep is induced near the crest or trough of the lift coefficient curve of the upstream cylinder for the downstream cylinder the traditional 2s vortex pattern is observed instant g t 6 95s in the simulation results and the lift coefficient time histories are nearly of sinusoidal shape 6 4 pattern ⅳ out of phase impinged vortex shedding in the transition region main characteristics of pattern ⅳ in the transition region a strong gap flow occurs pushing one shear layer of the upstream cylinder into the gap region then triggers a sequence of very complex interactive vortex to vortex and vortex to cylinder impingements fig 17 the displacement responses of the two cylinders are out of phase with the same oscillating frequency fig 16 sun et al 2019 presented the experimental visualization of out of phase oscillations using two 5w argon lasers and aluminum oxide particles of 100 μm as shown in fig 16 the displacement time histories and frequency spectra reveal that the two tandem rough cylinders oscillate about 180o out of phase with the same frequency both in the experimental measurements and numerical simulations the amplitude response of the upstream cylinder is a bit higher than the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 17 although the two tandem rough cylinders oscillate with regular sinusoidal trajectories the lift coefficient curves are not sinusoidal and have one more peak in each period this observation indicates that the interactive flow induced oscillations between the two cylinders are more intensive according to the time instants a b c accompanying displacement history at the top of fig 17 the underlying interactive flow induced motions can be described as follows from instance b to instance e is half of the cycle of the oscillating cylinders in instance b t 5 15s the gap flow is originated when the downstream cylinder reaches its top maximum position and the upstream cylinder is close to its bottom maximum position the width of the vertical separation amid the two adjacent rough cylinders is sufficient to expose the downstream cylinder into the free stream velocity field which results in the stagnation point at its upper front and diverts part of the flow impinging on the downstream cylinder causing a strong gap flow in instance c t 5 25s the gap flow is strong enough to push the upper shear layer of the upstream cylinder into the gap region and give rise to the upstream cylinder vortex shedding in instance d t 5 35s the upper shear layer of the upstream cylinder has now been entirely displaced by the flow into the gap region underneath the downstream cylinder a pair of vortices are shed from the upstream cylinder and begin to interact with vorticity from the lower shear layer of the downstream cylinder in instance e t 5 45s the negative vortex of the pair of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder begins to impinge on the descending downstream cylinder then the crashed negative vortex splits into two parts the upward part merges with the upper shear layer of the downstream cylinder to enhance the negative vorticity the downward part interacts with the lower shear layer of the downstream cylinder to eliminate the positive vorticity the 2p vortex shedding pattern two vortex pairs shed per cycle ding et al 2013 from the upstream cylinder can be clearly identified however due to the impingement by the upstream cylinder vortices the vortex structure of the near wake of the downstream cylinder cannot be clearly distinguished 6 5 pattern ⅴ in phase impinged vortex shedding in galloping region main characteristics of pattern ⅴ in the galloping region the downstream cylinder is trapped by the wake of the upstream cylinder and oscillates in phase with the upstream cylinder with the same oscillating frequency fig 18 this observation agrees with that of yuan et al 2020 the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder still impinge on the downstream cylinder fig 19 as shown in fig 18 in the galloping region the two tandem rough cylinders oscillate with the same frequency and move in phase contrary to the characteristic of the out of phase in pattern ⅳ the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is slightly higher than the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 19 the lift coefficients of the two cylinders are also in phase and have similar but irregular curve shape these observations indicate that the interactive flow induced oscillations between the two cylinders in the galloping region are different from pattern ⅳ in the transition region with reference to the time instants a b c in the accompanying displacement history at the top of fig 19 the underlying interactive flow induced motions are described next from instance b to instance e is half of the cycle of the oscillating cylinders in instance c t 5 25s a pair of vortices initiates to shed from the top of the upstream cylinder then the negative vortex of this vortex pair impinges on the top left of the downstream cylinder and interacts with the top shear layer of the downstream cylinder however the impingement does not affect the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder in instance d t 5 35s a small single negative vortex sheds from the top of the upstream cylinder after a pair of vortices the pair of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder begins to merge with the vortices behind the downstream cylinder in instance e t 5 45s the merged vortices shed from the downstream cylinder together from these time instances the gap flow does not initiate between the two tandem rough cylinders in other words the two cylinders are relatively close to each other at high reynolds numbers thus not allowing gap flow then the downstream cylinder is trapped by the wake of the upstream cylinder again the 2p 2s vortex shedding pattern two vortex pairs and two single vortices shed per cycle ding et al 2013 from the upstream cylinder can be observed clearly however due to vortex impingement on the downstream cylinder and vortices merging behind the downstream cylinder the vortex structure of the near wake of the downstream cylinder cannot be clearly distinguished 7 conclusions the interactive flow induced oscillations of two tandem rough cylinders were investigated using 2 d urans numerically and verified experimentally in the range of 30 000 re 120 000 the characteristics of amplitude response frequency response lift force and interactive wake patterns were discussed the following major conclusions are drawn 1 the trends of the amplitude ratio of the numerical results agree well with the experimental results four ranges are clearly observed the initial branch of viv the upper branch of viv the transition from viv to galloping and galloping 2 for the frequency response in the initial and upper branches the numerical results are in great agreement with the experimental data in the galloping region the frequency response of the numerical results is slightly higher than the experimental data however the results follow the same trend with the experimental data and appear to attain the same values with delay in reynolds number this is attributed to the effectiveness of modeling the turbulence stimulation numerically specifically the roughness on the sandpaper in the experiments is not modeled in the numerical simulations the ptc is a smooth step 3 five significant and distinct flow patterns between the two rough cylinders in tandem were identified for different reynolds numbers by analyzing the complex but stable interactions between vortices and cylinders the typical detailed fluid field and vortex structures were studied as well the five patterns exhibit rich fluid dynamics including in phase and out of phase oscillations impingement of upstream vortices on the downstream cylinder merging of vortices splitting of vortices independent vortex shedding and interaction of vortices with shear layers and gap flow 4 the major contribution of cfd in investigating and understanding the complexity of fio of two cylinders in tandem is that once the code has been validated against experimental results it enables vortex structure animation this is very helpful in understanding the differences of interactive fio mechanisms between the two cylinders credit authorship contribution statement wenjun ding writing original

of interest in a broad range of engineering applications fio involves complex fluid structure interaction mechanisms and instabilities williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 the two frequently encountered fio phenomena are vortex induced vibration viv and galloping viv is excited by alternating vortex shedding and is characterized by self limited amplitude extensive literature on viv has been comprehensively and extensively reviewed to understand the underlying mechanics and hydrodynamic interactions for decades starting in the early 1900 and more recently by bearman 1984 2011 bernitsas 2016 gabbai and benaroya 2005 2004 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 1979 sumner 2010 2013 rostami and armandei 2017 and williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 galloping is another fio phenomenon which involves aero hydro elastic instability its salient features include lower frequencies and larger amplitudes than viv blevins 1990 chang et al 2011 javed and abdelkefi 2018 galloping is usually induced by asymmetrical flow caused by a bluff structure or by incoming perturbed flow it is more powerful and detrimental than viv and does not depend on vortex formation ding et al 2015 bernitsas 2016 fio which may cause undesirable damage deterioration and even collapse of engineering structures is mostly treated as a destructive phenomenon to prevent instead of mitigating destructive fio bernitsas and raghavan 2009 strengthened these destructive phenomena for extracting hydrokinetic marine energy using the vivace vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy converter it enhances fio s and extends their synchronization range to maximize hydrokinetic energy extracted from a fluid flow this kind of hydrokinetic energy conversion based on alternating rather than steady lift is an environmentally compatible way for harnessing mhk marine hydrokinetic energy ma et al 2016 sun et al 2019 sun and bernitsas 2019 to further increase the energy extracting performance of the vivace converter the synergistic fios of two or more tandem cylinders have been investigated experimentally in the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab park et al 2012 2014 kim and bernitsas 2016 bernitsas 2016 sun et al 2017 sun and bernitsas 2019 local roughness passive turbulence control ptc is applied to the cylinders to impose turbulent stimulation as shown in figs 1 and 2 multiple cylinders in transverse flow direction are generally employed in a large number of engineering applications the interactive fios between two adjacent elastically mounted cylinders may affect flow separation shear layer reattachment vortex impingement on downstream cylinders and vortex interaction which are strongly dependent upon the configurational arrangement of the adjacent cylinders as well as reynolds number zdravkovich 2003a 2003b although some researchers borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 have investigated fios of two adjacent elastically mounted circular cylinders and improved our understanding of interactive mechanisms systematic and deep understanding fios are still lacking major previous investigations were performed at low reynolds numbers which were located in the flow regimes trsl1 and trsl2 which are defined as trsl1 300 500 re 1 103 2 103 and trsl2 1 103 2 103 re 2 104 4 104 trsl stands for transition in shear layer in the trsl3 2 104 4 104 re 1 105 2 105 flow regime the shear layers are fully turbulent forming stronger vortices closer to the afterbody and thus resulting in the highest lift coefficient zdravkovich 2003a accordingly the alternating lift force achieves its highest level in trsl3 resulting in a larger displacement amplitude and intensive fio bernitsas et al 2008 in addition the mass ratio values measured in some previous investigations alam and meyer 2013 alam and kim 2009 kim et al 2009 were rather high during wind tunnel experiments a high mass ratio can decrease the amplitude response and shrink the fio synchronization range significantly in the trsl3 flow regime there are few investigations focusing on interactive fio s of two adjacent elastically mounted tandem rough circular cylinders with low mass ratio the mrelab research team has primarily investigated fio of two or more rough or smooth cylinders in the trsl3 flow regime experimentally park et al 2014 kim and bernitsas 2016 sun et al 2017 2019 2020 2019 lan et al 2018 ji et al 2018 xu et al 2018 2019 yuan et al 2020 and numerically ding et al 2013 2015 2017 2019 a summary of the mrelab relevant research is presented in table 1 park et al 2014 experimentally studied the selective surface roughness effect on suppression of flow induced motions of two cylinders in tandem by varying flow velocity and cylinder center to center spacing kim and bernitsas 2016 presented an investigation on performance prediction of horizontal hydrokinetic energy converter using multiple cylinder synergy in fio they showed that multiple cylinders in proximity can synergistically work and harness more energy than the same number of single cylinders in isolation sun et al 2017 experimentally investigated spacing and stiffness effect on hydrokinetic energy conversion by two rough tandem cylinders in fio sun et al 2019 presented an experimental investigation on spacing effect damping effect and stiffness effect on fio of two cylinders sun et al 2020 experimentally studied hydrokinetic energy conversion by two rough tandem cylinders in fio with nonlinear adaptive damping rather than adjusting the configuration parameters of the converter the results show that introducing adaptive damping into the tandem cylinders overcomes the shielding effect lan et al 2018 investigated experimentally the relation between oscillation patterns and frequency response of two rough cylinders in tandem three dominant patterns of oscillation of two tandem rough cylinders were revealed by calculating the instantaneous phase difference between the two cylinders ji et al 2018 presented an experimental investigation on fio of two elastically mounted smooth circular cylinders in staggered arrangement based on the characteristics of the displacement response five interactive oscillation patterns were identified and their corresponding regions in the staggered parametric plane of the in flow spacing and transverse cylinder spacing were defined xu et al 2018 experimentally studied fio s and hydrokinetic power conversion of two staggered rough cylinders xu et al 2019 experimentally investigated fio s of two elastically mounted tandem smooth cylinders in cross flow at subcritical reynolds numbers yuan et al 2020 experimentally identified and classified five major patterns with nine sub patterns based on the amplitudes frequencies and the phase angle differences between the two cylinders in tandem ding et al 2013 presented a numerical investigation on fio of two cylinders by studying their amplitude response frequency response and near wake structure ding et al 2015 numerically studied the flow patterns of four configurations with 1 2 3 and 4 cylinders in tandem to show the interaction between multiple ptc cylinders ding et al 2017 presented a numerical study on tandem spacing effect on fio of two cylinders ding et al 2019 numerically investigated interactive fio of two cylinders to elucidate hydrokinetic energy harvesting further it should be pointed out that within the reynolds range tested trsl3 flow regime some flow particulars remain constant and some change the major constant properties are a the shear layers are fully turbulent over the entire trsl3 flow regime regardless of re as a result vortex roll up is strong and formation length is short resulting in a high and constant lift coefficient zdravkovich 2003a b the amplitude of response increases slightly with the energy of the flow in viv the relation between response amplitude a d and re was shown in model tests by raghavan and bernitsas 2011 and explained in a major development by bernitsas et al 2019 as a d was decoupled from the generic strouhal number st n and linked only to re st n was linked to the added mass and mass ratio only through an eigen relation the major changing properties are c in transition from viv to galloping vortices shed and are in synchronization with the galloping instability mechanism which is dominant in higher speeds then the dependence of a d on re becomes much stronger d in galloping vortex shedding is not in synchronization with the cylinder oscillation and some vortices may oppose the motion the galloping instability dominates the fio and a d increases strongly with re nevertheless systematic investigations of reynolds number effect on interactive fio s with numerical flow visualization are still lacking the flow patterns associated with the modes and the characteristics of the oscillations of the two adjacent tandem rough cylinders need to be analyzed for maximizing energy harvesting by the vivace converter the flow visualization and identification of the flow patterns are critical in understanding the fluid mechanism of multi cylinder arrangements for this converter moreover reynolds number has a significant effect on fio s of two adjacent elastically mounted circular cylinders and their wake several researchers have investigated this effect for different configurational arrangements igarashi and tamotsu 1981 1984 xu and zhou 2004 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 sumner 2010 ji et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the reynolds number effect on the interactive fio s of two adjacent elastically mounted tandem rough circular cylinders numerically with experimental verification and thus gaining insight into the underlying flow mechanism the cylinders are free to oscillate transversely to the flow direction experiments are conducted in reynolds number range 30 000 re 120 000 which falls in the high lift trsl3 flow regime the reduced velocity range is u 2 48 14 22 the mass ratio is constant m 1 343 the damping ratio is set ζ 0 14 and 0 26 for k 600n m ζ 0 26 for k 1 200n m and the center to center in flow spacing ratio is d d 2 57 2d urans equations with the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model are utilized for numerical simulations the cfd codes were originally developed by wu et al 2014 in previous work the numerical simulations achieved good agreement with experimentally measured data ding et al 2013 2015 2016 the amplitude response and frequency response are presented together with the vortex shedding sequence divergent interactive fios between the two tandem rough cylinders are observed in the simulations with different reynolds number the underlying mechanism is discussed this paper is organized as follows the physical model in experiments and simulations is described in section 2 in section 3 the mathematical models of the flow and the oscillators are presented the amplitude and frequency response of simulation results for two tandem rough cylinders are shown in section 4 and in section 5 respectively in section 6 five interactive flow patterns between two tandem rough cylinders are discussed using experimental data and numerical results conclusions are presented at the end 2 physical model in this study the physical model consists of two oscillatory systems as shown in fig 1 a the main parameters of each oscillator are a a controller imposed virtual spring of stiffness k and b a controller imposed virtual damping c the rigid circular cylinder diameter d and length l and the cylinder in flow spacing d remain constant a damper spring vck controller originated and implemented by sun et al 2015 2016 2017 was utilized for emulating the physical dampers and springs of the oscillator this vck system generates the damping and spring stiffness without including the hydrodynamic force in the control loop thus avoiding bias lee et al 2011 the two adjacent rigid rough cylinders elastically supported are positioned in a tandem arrangement and are constrained to oscillate in the cross flow direction a photograph of two tandem rough cylinder oscillators installed in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel of the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab is shown in fig 1 b detailed description of the ltfsw channel is provided by sun et al 2016 in the present study the center to center in flow spacing ratio d d is set at 2 57 this region is traditionally considered as proximity wake interference regime d d 4 zdravkovich 1987 the fio of the upstream cylinder is enhanced by the presence of the downstream cylinder so that the two cylinder vivace converter can achieve higher efficiency sun et al 2017 ding et al 2019 through synergistic fio s the wake dynamics of the two adjacent cylinders are coupled resulting in complex and rich flow variations borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 sun et al 2017 2019 xu et al 2019 the configurational parameters in numerical simulations are identical with those used in the corresponding experiments as listed in tables 2 and 3 to extend the synchronization range of fio s of cylinders passive turbulence control in the form of two straight roughness trips is utilized chang et al 2011 according to the fio to ptc map park et al 2017 the placement angle is set at α p t c 20 the coverage provided by each ptc is 16 the detailed configuration of ptc is shown in fig 2 chang et al 2011 the thickness of ptc is matching with the thickness of the boundary layer and impacts fio profoundly chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 table 4 shows the detailed parameters of the roughness strip utilized in the present study 3 mathematical models 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model the 2d urans equations in conjunction with the spalart allmaras 1992 turbulence model are employed to solve the flow around the two oscillating tandem cylinders a developed cfd code based on openfoam beaudoina and jasakb 2008 is utilized for simulating interactive fio s wu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 the detailed cfd parameter selections can be obtained in ding et al 2019 briefly the 2d urans governing equations are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s j i u j u i where u i is the corresponding mean flow velocity components x i denotes cartesian

in the spalart allmaras model the boussinesq approximation is utilized to associate the reynolds stress with the mean velocity gradient the expression is 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j where ν t denotes the

allmaras 1992 in this study the trip terms f t 1 and f t 2 are shut off and the trip less initial condition travin et al 2000 for ν is employed wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 2015 2016 3 2 oscillator equations and numerical schemes the cylinder dynamics in fio is introduced by a classical mass damper spring oscillator model the equation is briefly expressed as 6 m y c y k y f f l u i d y where m

gradient and laplacian terms in the governing equations the time integration is decoded through a second order backward euler method therefore the numerical discretization scheme can achieve second order accuracy in space and time the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is employed for resolving the momentum and continuity equations together in a segregated way ding et al 2019 3 3 computational domain as shown in fig 3 the computational flow domain for the two adjacent tandem ptc cylinders is prescribed as a rectangular area of 52 57d diameters in the flow direction by 13 2d in the cross flow direction the entire domain encompasses five boundaries inflow outflow top bottom and two cylinder walls the equilibrium positions of the two adjacent tandem cylinders in the flow domain are located at the middle of the cross flow direction the length between the center of the upstream cylinder downstream cylinder and the inlet boundary outlet boundary l up l down is 25d for capturing the wake information of the two tandem rough cylinders at the inflow boundary a uniform and constant velocity with a zero gradient pressure and a fixed ν are considered at the outlet boundary a zero gradient condition is specified for velocity pressure and ν the bottom is defined as a wall boundary to match the experimental conditions the top boundary is simplified by defining it as a wall ding et al 2019 the effect of the free surface on the fio presented in the experiments was not considered in the numerical study ding et al 2019 bernitsas et al 2007 raghavan et al 2009 a moving wall boundary is set for the two ptc cylinders in fio s the ptc strip consists of commercial grade sandpaper p60 with sand grits as shown in fig 2 and table 3 in the computational grid the sandpaper thickness of the ptc is modeled as part of the cylinder surface fig 5 then a wall function type boundary condition is imposed for ν t and ν to implement the effect of sand grids wu et al 2014 in addition the trip less initial condition for the eddy viscosity is employed wu et al 2014 travin et al 2000 3 4 grid generation two dimensional structured computational grids were generated in each numerical simulation case to avoid the mesh deformation in fio s a dynamic topological mesh technique combined with general grid interface ggi is utilized beaudoin and jasak 2008 ding et al 2019 in order to capture the boundary layer separation around the cylinder a 2d 2d square subdomain with mesh refinement is set the 2d 2d square sub domain can move together with the cylinder during fio s with no mesh changing ding et al 2019 using the topological mesh technique the first layer adjoint to the top or bottom boundary of each square can be merged into the second layer when the mesh is compressed and can be split into two layers when the mesh is dilated ding et al 2019 the left and right boundaries of the 2d 2d square sub domain are defined as ggi which allows mapping one boundary to another thus low deformation and high quality mesh are maintained when the two cylinders are undergoing large amplitude fio s in the present work the grid resolution around the cylinders was set at 240 35 circumferential radial as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 close up images of the grids total of 138 208 cells for the case of two ptc cylinders are presented when the cylinders are in fio s the value of y produced by the selected near wall grid spacing was between 30 and 50 depending on the reynolds number the computational time step was set as 5 10 5s ensuring that the courant number remains less than 1 the grid sensitivity study can be found in earlier publications wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 the physical and numerical models in this paper are the same as in previously published papers ding et al 2013 2015 2016 2017 2019 sun et al 2019 thus they were presented only briefly above keeping the models the same is essential for comparison to experiments and makes it possible to investigate complementary questions as shown in table 1 4 amplitude response three series of simulation of fio s for the two rough cylinders in tandem were performed with k 600n m ζ 0 14 k 600n m ζ 0 26 and k 1 200n m ζ 0 26 the range of reynolds number is 30 000 re 120 000 which is located in the trsl3 flow regime characterized by high lift the corresponding reduced velocity ranges are 3 50 u 14 22 for k 600n m and 2 48 u 10 06 for k 1 200n m the parameters in the numerical simulations are identical with those in the experimental tests in this section the amplitude response of the two adjacent elastically mounted tandem cylinders is analyzed comparison between simulations and experiments is presented in fig 6 for the upstream cylinder and fig 7 for the downstream cylinder 4 1 upstream cylinder three series of numerical and experimental results of amplitude response for the upstream cylinder are presented in fig 6 for comparison it is obvious that back to back viv and galloping phenomena are achieved in all three amplitude ratio plots in spite of the high damping which delays the onset of galloping the reason is that the fio is enhanced by introducing passive turbulence control chang et al 2011 within the tested re range four regions are clearly observed initial branch of viv the upper branch of viv transition region from viv to galloping and galloping region a 30 000 re 45 000 this is the initial branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the initial viv branch region is 45 000 re 60 000 nevertheless for all parameters the initial branch starts at about the same reduced velocity value u 4 the numerical amplitude ratio vs re u u follows well the experimental results the amplitude ratio increases gradually with increasing reduced velocity experimental and numerical results show that at the end of the initial viv branch the amplitude ratio reaches 0 9 for ζ 0 14 and 0 75 for ζ 0 26 for low k and low ζ the amplitude ratio increases much faster than for high k or high ζ b 45 000 re 75 000 this is the upper branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the upper viv branch region is 60 000 re 75 000 which is shrunk by 50 due to high stiffness and high damping ratio high stiffness results in the viv region moving to higher velocity and high damping ratio causes shifting of the galloping region to lower velocity which instigates back to back viv and galloping but shrinks the viv region in this region the amplitude ratio of numerical results at re 50 000 re 60 000 and re 70 000 in the three series agree well with the experimental results moreover experimental and numerical results show that the amplitude ratio in the upper branch is kept at a constant value of 0 9 for ζ 0 14 and 0 75 for ζ 0 26 c 75 000 re 90 000 this is the transition region from viv to galloping which encompasses the lower branch of viv the gap between viv and galloping and the onset of galloping it is evident that the back to back viv and galloping is achieved for all three amplitude ratio values the viv range shifts as the stiffness changes and shrinks with increasing damping in addition the onset of galloping increases with increasing damping ratio ζ blevins 1990 the trends for numerical results in this region are delayed compared to the experimental results as function of re u u which are all proportional to u several effects may contribute to this discrepancy a the ptc effect in numerical simulation is not as prominent as in experiments chang et al 2011 which leads to the ptc being unable to trigger fio s of the cylinders into galloping as early as in the experiments ding et al 2019 b the 3d flow distortion due to the support frames of the cylinder in the channel reducing the uniformity of the flow along the cylinders ding et al 2019 c the effect of blockage fig 1 albeit limited adds an error to the experiments bernitsas 2016 ding et al 2019 d in spite of the ptc presence which forces flow separation and consequently minimizes three dimensional effects some three dimensionality in the flow is expected in experimental fio ding et al 2019 the cfd simulations performed are two dimensional e tip effects may be significant even though ptc reduces them kinaci et al 2016 ding et al 2019 nevertheless experimental and cfd results exhibit the same phenomena and trend d 90 000 re this is the galloping region the experimental amplitude ratio of the rough cylinder reaches 2 2 for k 600n m ζ 0 14 at re 118 000 however for k 1 200n m ζ 0 26 the ratio only reaches 1 2 due to high stiffness and high damping as in c above the numerical results in the galloping region are delayed in comparison to the experimental data however the trend agrees with the experimental results as the amplitude ratio increases quickly at the beginning of the galloping region 4 2 downstream cylinder three series of amplitude ratio for the numerical and experimental results for the downstream cylinder are plotted in fig 7 for comparison the trend of the numerical results follows well with the experimental data the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is severely suppressed by the upstream cylinder in viv the four regions are not very clearly observed in the three amplitude ratio curves a 30 000 re 45 000 this is the initial branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the initial viv branch region is 45 000 re 60 000 fig 7 shows that the numerical results at re 40 000 for k 600n m and re 50 000 for k 1 200n m follow closely with the experimental data at the end of the initial viv branch the amplitude ratio reaches 0 4 at k 600n m ζ 0 14 the numerical and experimental results show that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is lower than their counterparts in the upstream cylinder in other words the downstream cylinder is strongly suppressed among the dynamic wake of the upstream cylinder this phenomenon will be interpreted in section 6 1 b 45 000 re 75 000 this is the upper branch for k 600n m the experimental amplitude ratios show that the downstream cylinder is suppressed in the whole upper viv branch and kept at a constant value around 0 3 0 4 however the numerical results show that at the beginning of the upper branch the downstream cylinder is suppressed but as the flow velocity increases the amplitude increases starting at re 60 000 this observation indicates that the vorticity intensity from the upstream cylinder in experiments is stronger than in simulations for k 1 200n m the upper viv branch region is 60 000 re 80 000 the cfd results agree well with the experimental data the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is suppressed by the upstream cylinder c 75 000 re 90 000 this is the transition region from viv to galloping for the upstream cylinder which encompasses the lower branch of viv the gap between viv and galloping and the onset of galloping for k 600n m the experimental data show that the amplitude ratio in the transition region has a great jump from 0 5 to 1 25 for ζ 0 14 and from 0 4 to 0 75 for ζ 0 26 however the numerical results show that the amplitude ratio increases slowly from 0 2 to 1 from the end of the upper branch in the transition region the numerical amplitude ratio does not exhibit such a great jump but gradually increases and follows the experimental trend after some delay in re u u for k 1 200n m the experimental amplitude ratio has no notable change and is kept at about 0 4 and the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data d 90 000 re this is the galloping region for k 600n m as the velocity increases the experimental amplitude ratio increases from 1 0 to 1 5 for ζ 0 14 and from 0 75 to 1 3 for ζ 0 26 the numerical results have a similar trend from re 110 000 for ζ 0 14 and from re 120 000 for ζ 0 26 there is a lag for numerical simulations compared to experiments the reasons were explained in section 4 1 for the upstream cylinder for k 1 200n m the experimental amplitude ratio increases from 0 5 to 0 9 from re 90 000 however after re 120 000 there is a drop appearing and the amplitude ratio decreases to 0 5 then increases slowly as the velocity increases the numerical results have a lag compared to the experimental data and follow the same trend after re 120 000 the numerical results show a drop like the experimental data the reason for the drop needs to be researched further in the future 5 frequency response fast fourier transform fft is used to calculate the numerical frequency for each case and for each cylinder the frequency ratios f f o s c f n v a c u u m of the oscillation cylinders are plotted versus reynolds number re flow velocity u and reduced velocity u w a t e r in figs 8 and 9 the frequency ratio f f o s c f n v a c c u m of each cylinder is non dimensionalized by the corresponding system natural frequency in air the experimental data is presented with the numerical frequency results for verification a 35 000 re 75 000 this is the initial branch and upper branch of viv for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the initial viv branch region is 45 000 re 75 000 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data showing the same trend the oscillation frequency ratio increases from 0 7 to 1 0 for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the oscillation frequency ratio increases from 0 7 to 0 9 b 75 000 re 90 000 this is the transition region from viv to galloping for the upstream cylinder which encompasses the lower branch of viv the gap between viv and galloping and the onset of galloping in experiments the oscillation frequency ratio decreases from 1 0 to 0 8 for k 600n m for k 1 200n m the oscillation frequency ratio declines from 0 9 to 0 8 the numerical frequency ratio has a similar behavior delayed as was observed in the amplitude response in addition to the explanations provided in section 4 1 this delay may be attributed to the effectiveness of the ptc as a turbulent stimulator in the cfd simulations the roughness of the strips in experiments is not modeled in cfd c 90 000 re this is the galloping region the oscillation frequency ratio in both experimental data and numerical results stay nearly unchanged this observation agrees with those of sun et al 2016 2017 within the galloping region the numerical oscillation frequency ratios are 0 9 higher than experimental data 0 8 the reasons were explained above and this is consistent with previous investigations by ding et al 2019 6 interactive flow induced oscillations of two tandem ptc cylinders overall the numerical results of amplitude response and frequency response for the two rough cylinders in tandem are in good agreement with experimental measurements different oscillations are observed with increasing reynolds number it is obvious that the reynolds number has an important effect on the wake of two tandem rough cylinders in this section five interactive flow patterns of the two rough cylinders in tandem are observed in the proximity wake region in the range of 30 000 re 120 000 they are analyzed using displacement response frequency spectrum lift coefficient and vortex sequence to elucidate the mechanisms of this complex dynamic response in previous tests sun et al 2019 the vortex structures as animated by cfd matched very well with experimentally visualized vortex structures for this discussion the experimental results with displacement response and frequency spectrum are selected from k 600n m ζ 0 14 the numerical results with displacement response frequency spectrum and lift coefficient are selected from k 600n m ζ 0 14 k 600n m ζ 0 26 and k 1 200n m ζ 0 26 the presented vortex sequences are selected from k 600n m ζ 0 14 it should be noted that the chosen velocity or re number from experimental data is not strictly identical to the velocity or re number from the numerical results with k 600n m ζ 0 14 however the observed phenomena are identical between experiments and simulations in our subsequent analysis wherever possible the terminology introduced by williamson 1988 to identify vortex shedding structures 2s 2p etc is adopted which has been extensively utilized to descript flow patterns around cylinders table 5 shows some research related to the flow pattern terminology in the past decade the terminology introduced by sumner 2010 and zhou and alam 2016 to elucidate fluid structure interactions e g vortex pairing and enveloping is also used for each reynolds number instantaneous flow fields with several time instants are presented the specific time instants are marked with letters a b c etc and with points on the plots at the top of each set of figures showing the variation of the cylinder displacement and lift force the characteristics of the five identified interactive flow patterns are discussed in detail in following subsections a summary of characteristics of the five flow patterns is presented in table 6 6 1 pattern ⅰ absorbed vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder in initial viv branch main characteristics of pattern i in the initial viv branch the vortices shed from the downstream cylinder are absorbed by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder fig 11 resulting in the downstream cylinder being always submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder the two cylinders oscillate synchronously as an extended body the two cylinders oscillate in phase with the same frequency fig 10 yuan et al 2020 also observed this phenomenon through systematic analysis of extensive experimental data as shown in fig 10 the displacement histories and frequency spectra of experimental and numerical results in the initial branch present similar characteristics the two cylinders move synchronously with the same oscillating frequency the upstream cylinder is leading the downstream cylinder in oscillation and the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is slightly higher than the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 11 in the initial viv branch the 2s two single shedding vortices per cycle vortex shedding model is clearly observed in the back of the upstream cylinder similar observation can be found in ding et al 2013 and ding et al 2019 as the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder pass close to the downstream cylinder they may absorb the same rotation vortices from the downstream cylinder limiting the vortex formations behind the downstream cylinder and exerting shedding effect on the downstream cylinder as shown in instant d t 5 55s thus the downstream cylinder is always submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder and the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is lower this phenomenon only allows small scale and very weak vortices generating after the downstream cylinder thus limiting vortex shedding formation therefore the fio of the downstream cylinder is induced by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder oscillating with the upstream cylinder similar to an extended body as shown in fig 10 that is the downstream cylinder is forced to oscillate by the vortices from the upstream cylinder this can also be observed in the displacement ratio curves and fft analysis in fig 10 the two cylinders have the same oscillating frequency the displacement of the downstream cylinder is slightly suppressed 6 2 pattern ⅱ interfered vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder at the beginning of the upper viv branch main characteristics of pattern ⅱ at the beginning of the upper viv branch the vortices shed from the downstream cylinder are interfered by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder fig 13 resulting in the downstream cylinder having two oscillating frequencies one is equal to the upstream cylinder s oscillation frequency the other one being its own independent oscillating frequency of the downstream cylinder fig 12 this observation agrees with that of yuan et al 2020 as shown in fig 12 the experimental results and numerical results both show a prominent beating phenomenon that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder shown in the time history of displacement response appears periodic variation at a lower frequency the maximum amplitude reaches 0 5d but in some places the amplitude ratio is close to zero as shown in the frequency spectra the upstream cylinder only has one dominant frequency but the downstream cylinder has two dominant frequencies one is the same as that of the upstream cylinder the other one is a lower frequency it should be noted that the phenomenon occurs at different reynolds numbers in experiment and simulation with the same system parameters as explained in section 4 1 c one characteristic of this interfered vortex shedding phenomenon is that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder begins to increase with increasing flow velocity as shown in fig 7 the reason is that the downstream cylinder cannot escape from the wake of the upstream cylinder the interpretation will be presented in the following vortex sequence as shown in fig 13 the displacement history of the downstream cylinder has a prominent crest or trough between sequential crest or trough there is a small crest and trough synchronizing with the upstream cylinder s crest and trough this phenomenon indicates that the downstream cylinder oscillates with two frequencies the time sequence of vortex shedding shows that in the vortex structure of the near wake of the upstream cylinder a clear quasi 2p vortex pattern is observed as shown at instance g t 6 50s this vortex structure is similar to that simulated by ding et al 2015 quasi 2p represents that two pairs of vortices shed per cycle but in each pair one vortex is weaker than the other for the downstream cylinder the 2s vortex pattern is observed as shown in instant g t 6 50s as explained in section 6 1 the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder pass the downstream cylinder closely absorbing part of the same rotation vorticity from the downstream cylinder instant a t 5 60s the downstream cylinder is induced to oscillate due to the wake induced force from the upstream cylinder meanwhile 2s vortex shedding can be observed after the downstream cylinder instant g t 6 50s with a lower frequency in here this phenomenon is identified as interfered vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder 6 3 pattern ⅲ independent vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder in the middle of upper viv branch main characteristics of pattern iii in the middle of the upper viv branch the downstream cylinder can oscillate independently but the oscillating frequency is lower than the upstream cylinder shown in fig 14 this observation agrees with that of yuan et al 2020 as shown in fig 14 the frequency spectra of numerical results show that the two cylinders have only one dominant oscillation frequency in the middle of the upper viv branch the oscillation frequency of the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the upstream cylinder due to the shielding effect in this case the downstream cylinder completely escapes from the wake of the upstream cylinder and oscillates independently in experiments however the phenomenon is more complicated as the downstream cylinder also has two dominant frequencies as in pattern ii the reason is that the downstream cylinder does not escape from the wake of the upstream cylinder in the experiments this is consistent with the delay in numerical results compared to experiments as shown in fig 15 the regular displacement histories of the two cylinders have different frequencies the upstream cylinder s frequency is higher than that of the downstream cylinder each crest or trough of the downstream cylinder lift coefficient has a saddle which is generated by the separation of a pair of vortices from the upstream cylinder this phenomenon is related to the shed vortex structures which is analyzed in the following discussion on vortex sequences as shown in fig 15 the time sequence of vortex shedding shows that in the vortex structure of the near wake of the upstream cylinder a clear quasi 2p vortex pattern ding et al 2015 is observed instant g t 6 95s the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder do not impinge on the downstream cylinder and do not reattach the shear layer of the downstream cylinder instant c t 6 35s and instant e t 6 65s therefore the vortices can independently shed from the downstream cylinder this trend is not be surprising since the downstream cylinder at all times remains submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder it should be noted that the effective flow velocity in the wake of the upstream cylinder is lower than the open flow encountered by the upstream cylinder consequently the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the upstream cylinder this is the reason that the downstream cylinder has only one dominant frequency which is lower compared to the upstream cylinder in both numerical simulations the pair of vortices shed from the top or bottom of the upstream cylinder do not shed simultaneously but alternatingly hence a deep is induced near the crest or trough of the lift coefficient curve of the upstream cylinder for the downstream cylinder the traditional 2s vortex pattern is observed instant g t 6 95s in the simulation results and the lift coefficient time histories are nearly of sinusoidal shape 6 4 pattern ⅳ out of phase impinged vortex shedding in the transition region main characteristics of pattern ⅳ in the transition region a strong gap flow occurs pushing one shear layer of the upstream cylinder into the gap region then triggers a sequence of very complex interactive vortex to vortex and vortex to cylinder impingements fig 17 the displacement responses of the two cylinders are out of phase with the same oscillating frequency fig 16 sun et al 2019 presented the experimental visualization of out of phase oscillations using two 5w argon lasers and aluminum oxide particles of 100 μm as shown in fig 16 the displacement time histories and frequency spectra reveal that the two tandem rough cylinders oscillate about 180o out of phase with the same frequency both in the experimental measurements and numerical simulations the amplitude response of the upstream cylinder is a bit higher than the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 17 although the two tandem rough cylinders oscillate with regular sinusoidal trajectories the lift coefficient curves are not sinusoidal and have one more peak in each period this observation indicates that the interactive flow induced oscillations between the two cylinders are more intensive according to the time instants a b c accompanying displacement history at the top of fig 17 the underlying interactive flow induced motions can be described as follows from instance b to instance e is half of the cycle of the oscillating cylinders in instance b t 5 15s the gap flow is originated when the downstream cylinder reaches its top maximum position and the upstream cylinder is close to its bottom maximum position the width of the vertical separation amid the two adjacent rough cylinders is sufficient to expose the downstream cylinder into the free stream velocity field which results in the stagnation point at its upper front and diverts part of the flow impinging on the downstream cylinder causing a strong gap flow in instance c t 5 25s the gap flow is strong enough to push the upper shear layer of the upstream cylinder into the gap region and give rise to the upstream cylinder vortex shedding in instance d t 5 35s the upper shear layer of the upstream cylinder has now been entirely displaced by the flow into the gap region underneath the downstream cylinder a pair of vortices are shed from the upstream cylinder and begin to interact with vorticity from the lower shear layer of the downstream cylinder in instance e t 5 45s the negative vortex of the pair of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder begins to impinge on the descending downstream cylinder then the crashed negative vortex splits into two parts the upward part merges with the upper shear layer of the downstream cylinder to enhance the negative vorticity the downward part interacts with the lower shear layer of the downstream cylinder to eliminate the positive vorticity the 2p vortex shedding pattern two vortex pairs shed per cycle ding et al 2013 from the upstream cylinder can be clearly identified however due to the impingement by the upstream cylinder vortices the vortex structure of the near wake of the downstream cylinder cannot be clearly distinguished 6 5 pattern ⅴ in phase impinged vortex shedding in galloping region main characteristics of pattern ⅴ in the galloping region the downstream cylinder is trapped by the wake of the upstream cylinder and oscillates in phase with the upstream cylinder with the same oscillating frequency fig 18 this observation agrees with that of yuan et al 2020 the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder still impinge on the downstream cylinder fig 19 as shown in fig 18 in the galloping region the two tandem rough cylinders oscillate with the same frequency and move in phase contrary to the characteristic of the out of phase in pattern ⅳ the amplitude of the upstream cylinder is slightly higher than the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 19 the lift coefficients of the two cylinders are also in phase and have similar but irregular curve shape these observations indicate that the interactive flow induced oscillations between the two cylinders in the galloping region are different from pattern ⅳ in the transition region with reference to the time instants a b c in the accompanying displacement history at the top of fig 19 the underlying interactive flow induced motions are described next from instance b to instance e is half of the cycle of the oscillating cylinders in instance c t 5 25s a pair of vortices initiates to shed from the top of the upstream cylinder then the negative vortex of this vortex pair impinges on the top left of the downstream cylinder and interacts with the top shear layer of the downstream cylinder however the impingement does not affect the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder in instance d t 5 35s a small single negative vortex sheds from the top of the upstream cylinder after a pair of vortices the pair of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder begins to merge with the vortices behind the downstream cylinder in instance e t 5 45s the merged vortices shed from the downstream cylinder together from these time instances the gap flow does not initiate between the two tandem rough cylinders in other words the two cylinders are relatively close to each other at high reynolds numbers thus not allowing gap flow then the downstream cylinder is trapped by the wake of the upstream cylinder again the 2p 2s vortex shedding pattern two vortex pairs and two single vortices shed per cycle ding et al 2013 from the upstream cylinder can be observed clearly however due to vortex impingement on the downstream cylinder and vortices merging behind the downstream cylinder the vortex structure of the near wake of the downstream cylinder cannot be clearly distinguished 7 conclusions the interactive flow induced oscillations of two tandem rough cylinders were investigated using 2 d urans numerically and verified experimentally in the range of 30 000 re 120 000 the characteristics of amplitude response frequency response lift force and interactive wake patterns were discussed the following major conclusions are drawn 1 the trends of the amplitude ratio of the numerical results agree well with the experimental results four ranges are clearly observed the initial branch of viv the upper branch of viv the transition from viv to galloping and galloping 2 for the frequency response in the initial and upper branches the numerical results are in great agreement with the experimental data in the galloping region the frequency response of the numerical results is slightly higher than the experimental data however the results follow the same trend with the experimental data and appear to attain the same values with delay in reynolds number this is attributed to the effectiveness of modeling the turbulence stimulation numerically specifically the roughness on the sandpaper in the experiments is not modeled in the numerical simulations the ptc is a smooth step 3 five significant and distinct flow patterns between the two rough cylinders in tandem were identified for different reynolds numbers by analyzing the complex but stable interactions between vortices and cylinders the typical detailed fluid field and vortex structures were studied as well the five patterns exhibit rich fluid dynamics including in phase and out of phase oscillations impingement of upstream vortices on the downstream cylinder merging of vortices splitting of vortices independent vortex shedding and interaction of vortices with shear layers and gap flow 4 the major contribution of cfd in investigating and understanding the complexity of fio of two cylinders in tandem is that once the code has been validated against experimental results it enables vortex structure animation this is very helpful in understanding the differences of interactive fio mechanisms between the two cylinders credit authorship contribution statement wenjun ding writing original

21022,the bio inspired oscillating hydrofoils are capable of harvesting energy from tidal currents in this study the effects of mechanical spring and damping coefficients and kinematic pitching amplitude and oscillation frequency parameters on the performance of the semi passive oscillating hydrofoil naca 0015 system were numerically studied at a high reynolds number of 106 it is found that the spring k is necessary to obtain a stable heaving response the initial pitching angle has a significant effect on the heaving response while it has a little impact on the power output the balance position of the heaving response deviates notably from the initial position especially when the initial pitching angle is zero a larger damping coefficient c results in poor energy harvesting performance due to a smaller oscillation amplitude the heaving amplitude increases firstly and decreases afterward with the increase of the pitching amplitude θ 0 while it decreases monotonically with increasing oscillation frequency f when f 0 15 the heaving and pitching power coefficients increase and decrease with increasing f respectively the net power coefficient decreases at high oscillation frequencies because the increase in the heaving power coefficient is smaller than the decrease in the pitching power coefficient when k 0 5 and c 0 8π an optimal energy harvesting efficiency of 40 84 is achieved at θ 0 85 and f 0 125 keywords oscillating hydrofoil semi passive hydrodynamic characteristic heaving response 1 introduction as conventional fossil energy consumption increases it is necessary to develop new sustainable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase power resource sustainability among renewable energy forms tidal energy shows the potential for future electricity generation because it is more predictable compared with conventional turbines with rotating blades turbines based on oscillating foils are a novel design oscillating hydrofoil turbines show obvious advantages in harvesting tidal energy 1 it is more suitable for application in shallow waters because the foil sweeps across a rectangular cross section of flow 2 the lower tip speed reduces both the structural requirements and the negative impacts on the aquatic animals 3 the simple foil geometry reduces designing and manufacturing costs as well as necessary maintenance needs oscillating foils are inspired by bird wings or fish fins birnbaum 1924 reported that it could be used as novel propeller in 1924 since then a lot of efforts have been taken on exploring its application such as wave gliders and ship propulsion the propulsive performance of rigid oscillating foils depends on key parameters including the strouhal number reduced frequencies floryan et al 2017 and heaving and pitching amplitudes andersen et al 2017 while it is almost independent of the mean free stream velocity ma et al 2018a van buren et al 2018 and the reynolds number medjroubi et al 2011 the aero hydro dynamics of the oscillating foil is a hot topic and has been investigated over several decades a key component of the optimal thrust production is the formation and timing of a coherent leading edge vortex lev and trailing edge vortex tev lev and tev are frequently observed from wake structures behind an oscillating foil both of them are sensitive to variations of reynolds number however ohmi et al 1990 revealed that the variation of reynolds number has no major effect on the formation of the periodic vortex and the establishment of the subsequent wake behind an oscillating foil in the range of 1500 10000 increasing the reynolds number while keeping the same frequency and amplitude of oscillations has no apparent effects either on the flow structure or on the aerodynamic loads medjroubi et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2020 found that all high efficiency kinematics is a coherent lev that forms on the heave stroke and sheds at or just after the heave stroke reversal at large angles of attack moreover the coherent lev forms earlier and is slightly stronger in high reynolds numbers resulting in high efficiency conversion baik et al 2012 noticed that increasing reduced frequency causes slower lev and tev growth rate hemmati et al 2019 found that the maximum instantaneous thrust coincides with the detachment of a tev the lev eventually wraps around the trailing edge and merges with side edge shear layer and connects to the legs of tevs in all cases it is certain that lev affects the hydrodynamics significantly however there remain significant differences in opinion as to the actual mechanism by which the lift is enhanced nabawy and crowther 2017 in addition to utilizing the oscillating foil for propulsion purposes energy harvesting devices which make use of oscillating foils to extract energy from tidal currents and wind have been proposed jones and platzer 1997 found that the oscillating foil will change from the thrust mode to the energy extraction mode when the pitching amplitude is sufficiently large and they provided criteria to distinguish the two modes for the oscillating hydrofoil following their study a series of computations and experiments were performed to study the effects of various parameters in the early stage the fully activated model was adopted to study the performance of the oscillating foil just as the propellers the energy harvesting performance of oscillating foils is related to many parameters including hydrofoil geometrics flow conditions kinematic and mechanical parameters systematic numerical and experimental investigations have been done to clarify the effects of these parameters based on the fully activated model extensive study also has been carried out to improve the energy harvesting performance of the oscillating hydrofoil however a crucial question for this type of oscillation motion is how to realize the ideal heaving and pitching motions to get rid of the complex control system the fully passive model which the foil is free to respond to the incoming flow in both pitching and heaving motions has been proposed peng and zhu proposed a device in which the foil is mounted on a simple structural system containing a rotational spring in the pitching direction and a damper in the heaving direction peng and zhu 2009 four different responses were recorded in that novel system veilleux and dumas developed a fully passive hydrokinetic energy flow harvester which consists of self sustained pitch heave oscillations of an elastically mounted airfoil and 2d efficiencies as high as 34 have been obtained veilleux and dumas 2017 wang et al achieved a highest efficiency of 32 in the similar system dumas proposed a hydraulic system to combine the pitching and heaving motions of two foil to achieve a fully induced and self sustained oscillation motion dumas et al 2011 and ma et al demonstrated the feasibility of such systems ma et al 2018b 2018c however the energy harvesting efficiency of this fully passive system is not as high as that of the fully activated and semi passive systems compared with fully activated and fully passive models the semi passive model is more promising for commercial application of oscillating foil turbines conventionally the semi passive model is characterized by a forced pitching motion but a free heaving motion for simplicity the generator is typically idealized as a damper which is attached to the heaving motion shimizu et al 2008 performed a multi objective optimization to improve both power and efficiency their results demonstrated that large power is achieved at low frequencies and large motion amplitudes while high efficiency occurs at high frequencies and small motion amplitudes by using a fluid structure interaction model based upon a finite difference solver of the n s equations zhu and peng 2009 examined the effects of both mechanical and operational parameters in low reynolds numbers 1000 under the same reynolds number deng et al 2015 studied the inertial effect of oscillating foils and the results showed that the energy harvesting efficiency decreases monotonically with increasing mass ratio they also have taken efforts to improve the efficiency through non sinusoidal pitching motion teng et al 2016 more recently boudreau et al boudreau 2019 proposed a novel semi passive oscillating foil system with an activated heaving motion and a passive pitching motion and they reported achieving maximum efficiency of 45 4 at a high reynolds number of 3 9 106 most of the existing studies focus on the performance of semi passive oscillating foils at low reynolds numbers 1000 as pointed out by deng et al 2015 the results at low reynolds number cannot be directly applied to actual engineering projects moreover unlike the thrust mode the efficiency of oscillating hydrofoils slightly improves with increasing reynolds number in energy harvesting mode kinsey and dumas 2012a therefore this study will analyze the energy harvesting performance of the semi passive oscillating hydrofoil at a high reynolds number of 106 since the initial pitching angle affects the heaving response its effects will also be discussed in the present study the rest of this article is organized by first defining the hydrofoil motion system this is followed by a description of the numerical method and validation studies then the numerical results are presented and discussed at the end of the study several conclusions are given 2 semi passive system the oscillating hydrofoil system consists of a pitching motion θ t and a heaving motion h t for the semi passive model the pitching motion is governed by a controller with the prescribed frequency f and amplitude θ 0 which is expressed as 1 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ the oscillation frequency f is usually dealt as the reduced frequency f f l u where l is the chord length and u is the flow velocity the phase difference ϕ determines the initial angle of the pitching motion the heaving motion is supported by a generator for simplicity the generator is idealized as a damper a linear spring is attached to the foil to increase the stability of the system as shown in fig 1 the equation of the heaving motion can be derived as follows 2 m h t c h t k h t f where m c k are the total mass of the hydrofoil including the physical mass and the added mass the damping of the damper and the stiffness of the spring respectively f is the lift for the semi passive model an external torque m out is required to activate the pitching motion the pitch axis is in the 1 3 chord from the leading edge it is assumed that the pitch axis coincides with the center of the mass of the hydrofoil considering the rib structure this assumption is practically reasonable m out is calculated as 3 m o u t i θ m where i is the moment of inertia and m is the pitching moment the coefficients m c k and i are defined as boudreau et al 2019 wu et al 2015 4 m m ρ l c c ρ u l s k k ρ u 2 l i i ρ s l 4 where ρ is the fluid density and s is the span length for a 2d model the span length is 1 s 1 the power of the pitching motion is p m m o u t θ and the power consumption of the external controller is p m the power output is achieved via the damper by assuming that the consumption of the damper is completely converted into power thus the total power output is equal to the heaving motion harvested in one cycle because the spring neither produces nor consumes energy the power output is expressed by the instantaneous heaving power p h f h rather than c h 2 for the purpose of analysis thus the instantaneous net power output is calculated as p p h p m p h p m the dimensionless coefficients of the lift the moment and the power are defined as 5 c f f 1 2 ρ u 2 l s c m m 1 2 ρ u 2 l 2 s 6 c p h c p m c p p h p m p 1 2 ρ u 2 l s the cycle averaged power coefficients c p h c p m and c p are the average values of c p h c p m and c p in ten cycles the energy harvesting efficiency is defined as 7 η p 1 2 ρ u 3 d s c p l u d where the swept height d is the distance between the highest and the lowest positions of the trailing edge 3 numerical approach 3 1 governing equations the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow around the hydrofoil are the navier stokes equations 8 u i t u i u j x j μ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x

decomposed into mean and fluctuating parts 10 u i u i u i p p p substituting expressions of this form for the flow variables into the instantaneous continuity and momentum equations and taking the time average yields the ensemble averaged momentum equations thus the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans can be derived as follows alfonsi 2009 11 u i t u j u i x j μ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x

software fluent is used to solve the unsteady rans equations about the oscillating foil 3 2 computational set up a grid model used for computation is constructed with sliding interface as shown in fig 2 the mesh is composed of two sub domains with a sliding interface except the boundary layer which employs quadrilateral cells triangle cells unstructured mesh are used for meshing ma et al 2017 2018a the far field boundary is set to a long distance 35l from the foil such that its effect on the flow surrounding the moving surface is negligible kinsey and dumas 2008 the inlet free stream velocity is u 1 6 m s and the turbulence intensity is 5 at the pressure outlet boundary the pressure is set to the free stream value the velocity pressure coupling is based on a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm the second order upwind spatial discretization and the second order accurate backward implicit scheme are used for transient terms the convergence criterion is selected as 10 5 for all variables the spalart allmaras s a model is a one equation model used to solve a modeled transport equation for the kinematic eddy turbulent viscosity it is designed specifically for aerospace applications kinsey and dumas 2012a revealed that the instantaneous predictions of the s a model compares advantageously with those of the sst model following their study the s a turbulence model is adopted in this study the heaving motion is solved using an iteration scheme based on the classical runge kutta method the iteration scheme is described as follows ma et al 2021 at the beginning the hydrofoil keeps stationary the lift of the flow acting on the hydrofoil is computed by the fluent solver the heaving acceleration at n 0 is calculated by 13 h 0 f c h 0 k h 0 m the heaving motion displacement and velocity at n 1 is given by 14 h n 1 h n 1 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 δ t 15 h n 1 h n 1 6 l 1 2 l 2 2 l 3 l 4 δ t where 16 k 1 h n l 1 h n 17 k 2 h n l 1 δ t 2 l 2 h n l 1 δ t 2 18 k 3 h n l 2 δ t 2 l 3 h n l 2 δ t 2 19 k 4 h n l 3 δ t l 4 h n l 3 δ t a small time step δ t is employed to obtain a higher accuracy the user defined function udf is compiled to achieve the iteration scheme and it is loaded into the fluent solver to control the hydrofoil movement grid and time step sensitivity analysis were performed to select a suitable grid and time step for simulations fig 3 plots the lift coefficient and the heaving response at different levels of the grid 85000 cells and 600 nodes on the foil 130000 cells and 900 nodes on the foil 175000 cells and 900 nodes on the foil and time refinement 1000 5000 and 10000 timesteps per cycle the difference of the results obtained on different grids and time steps is minimal based on this observation a grid of 85000 cells and a time resolution of 1000 t cycle are used in this study to reduce the time consumption 3 3 validation studies simulations were performed to verify the settings of the numerical model and the iteration scheme kinsey and dumas conducted a lot of computational research on the oscillating foil based on the fully activated model as shown in fig 4 a the moment coefficient of the naca0015 foil from the present study and that from the study of kinsey et al kinsey and dumas 2008 are in good agreement in the latter study the same cfd software fluent and simulation method rans are employed the parameters of the validation case re 1100 θ 0 76 33 f 0 14 both 2d and 3d simulations were performed to further validate the numerical method the numerical results are compared with the experiment results from ref prier 2018 as shown in fig 4 b the experiment was carried out with a fully activated oscillating foil device in a wind tunnel a foil with an aspect ratio of 2 was adopted in the experiment other experimental parameters are re 30000 θ 0 70 f 0 08 the 3d numerical results match the experimental results well if considering the experimental errors green line in fig 4 b the 2d numerical results are larger than the experimental results because the formation of tip vortices significantly reduces the lift for a foil with a small aspect ratio kinsey and dumas demonstrated that the relative decrease in performance owing to 3d hydrodynamic losses can be limited to 10 of the 2d prediction when the aspect ratio is greater than 7 kinsey and dumas 2012b consequently in order to reduce the time consumption the 2d model is used in this study teng et al used the open source cfd code openfoam to simulate the flow around a flapping foil teng et al 2016 the time dependent navier stokes equations were solved using the finite volume method the effects of non sinusoidal pitching motions on the semi passive oscillating foil system was studied at re 1000 fig 4 c plots the lift coefficient of teng et al and the present study the parameters of the validation case are naca0015 foil θ 0 75 f 0 2 c π and k 0 no turbulence model was used in that study since the flow around flapping foils was considered at a laboratory scale with re 1000 although discrepancies are observed near the peak two curves are in good agreement at other stages kinsey and dumas 2012a performed simulations for different turbulence models discrepancies are essentially observed when the oscillating foil is near its top and bottom positions because of the slight differences in the timing of flow separations and subsequent vortex shedding therefore considering the difference in the choice of numerical methods and turbulence models it can be deemed that the results of the present study are in line with that of teng et al 4 results and discussions for a semi passive oscillating hydrofoil system many parameters are related to the heaving response in this study the effects of mechanical and kinematic parameters are analyzed at a high reynolds number the details of parameters used in this study are listed in table 1 4 1 effects of mechanical parameters the mechanical parameters include the spring stiffness and the damping coefficient for the semi passive system in fig 1 at low reynolds numbers sometimes only the damper is employed in the system which means k 0 deng et al 2015 liu et al 2013 zhu and peng 2009 at high reynolds numbers the hydrodynamic characteristic is not exactly the same on the up and down strokes although the difference is small the balance position deviates from the initial position h l 0 and the heaving response cannot converge when k 0 due to the accumulation of the difference the balance position is defined as the midpoint of the highest and the lowest of the heaving response the spring can increase the stability of the heaving response a spring with a small stiffness will slightly affect the energy harvesting performance because it neither produces nor consumes energy therefore a small stiffness spring was added to the semi passive system and k is fixed at 0 5 in this study the initial pitching angle depends on the phase difference of the pitching motion when ϕ 0 the initial pitching angle is zero when ϕ 90 the hydrofoil is at the maximum pitching angle at t t 0 there is no doubt that the initial pitching angle will affect the balance position of the heaving response fig 5 plots the heaving responses at different initial pitching angles if the power coefficients at different initial pitching angles are not significantly different it can be proved that the spring with a small stiffness has little effect on the energy harvesting performance of the system the hydrofoil can obtain stable heaving responses at different initial pitching angles at low oscillation frequencies e g f 0 025 the discrepancy in the heaving response of different initial pitching angles is negligible at a larger oscillation frequency e g f 0 20 it takes a long time for the hydrofoil to reach a stable heaving response obvious discrepancies are observed in the heaving response at different initial pitching angles when ϕ 0 the heaving response converges after the 15th cycle and the balance position deviates noticeably this is reasonable considering that the hydrofoil is located in the highest point of the heaving motion and the spring force is zero at the beginning the heaving response reaches a steady state after the 8th cycle for ϕ 90 in this study 50 cycles of simulation were performed in each case fig 5 just plots 16 cycles to clearly show the heaving response the lift coefficients of the first two cycles are plotted to explain the entirely different behaviors with varying initial pitching angles and oscillating frequencies as shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the lift is not zero at t t 0 for all cases for case i the lift shows similar profile except a phase difference of 90 resulting in an insignificant difference in the balance position of the heaving response between ϕ 0 and 90 for case ii the lift at t t 0 for ϕ 0 is larger than that at t t 0 for ϕ 90 due to a high oscillating frequency although the pitching angle is zero at t t 0 for ϕ 0 the lift decreases after a short period of increase as the pitching angle expands for ϕ 0 while the lift decreases as the pitching angle narrows for ϕ 90 there is always a significant difference between the lift for ϕ 0 and 90 which is the main reason why the balance position of the heaving response deviates from different directions the hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating hydrofoil is obviously related to differences in the timing of flow separations and subsequent vortex shedding therefore the lift at t t 0 determines the balance position of the heaving response table 2 gives the heaving response parameters at different initial pitching angles the heaving amplitude h is calculated by averaging the heaving amplitude of ten cycles for case i the heaving amplitudes are slightly different and the power coefficients are identical at different initial pitching angles for case ii at different initial pitching angles there is a difference of 4 73 in the heaving amplitude a difference of 7 54 in the heaving power coefficient and a difference of 13 71 in the pitching power coefficient however the difference in the net power coefficient is relatively small fig 7 plots the variation of the balance position of the heaving response at different cases for ϕ 0 the deviation of the balance position is closely related to the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency when θ 0 45 the balance position is near the initial position at f 0 025 the deviation of the balance position increases sharply from f 0 025 to 0 05 and then hardly changes as oscillation frequency increases the deviation is more noticeable at large pitching amplitudes at θ 0 60 and 75 the balance position deviates to the negative direction first and then shifts to the positive direction with increasing f when θ 0 75 the maximum deviation of the balance position reaches 0 8l which is larger than the heaving amplitude for ϕ 90 although the results are not shown in fig 7 the deviation of the heaving response is negligible when θ 0 60 when θ 0 75 the balance position is close to zero in most cases although the balance position deviation of ϕ 90 is relatively small compared with that of ϕ 0 ϕ 0 is employed in the rest of the study because the initial pitching angle is usually zero in practical applications the heaving response of the hydrofoil depends on the pitching motion under normal conditions the hydrofoil changes the heaving direction at the highest and lowest points however the heaving motion changes the direction six times in one cycle for case i in fig 5 the hydrofoil briefly moves in the opposite direction near the end of the stroke a possible reason is that the formation and the shedding of the leading edge vortex causes the lift to rise and fall sharply fig 8 plots the lift coefficient and the heaving velocity and fig 9 shows the corresponding vortex fields at f 0 025 the balance position has a small deviation the hydrodynamic behavior at the second half cycle is similar to that at the first half cycle therefore only the first half cycle is discussed the heaving velocity is related to the lift and the spring and damping forces the spring and damping forces are proportional to the heaving displacement and velocity respectively when t t t0 the lift has not yet reached its peak the heaving velocity starts to decrease due to the increase of damping and spring forces at t t t1 a leading edge vortex has detached from the hydrofoil surface the formation of this vortex creates a deep negative pressure zone on the lower surface and enhances the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces resulting in a larger lift peak the lift drops sharply resulting from the shedding of the leading edge vortex the sum of the spring and damping forces is opposite to the heaving direction and larger than the lift the heaving velocity decreases rapidly and shifts from negative to positive which indicates a change in the direction of the heaving motion at t t t2 the pitching angle of the hydrofoil is the largest the leading edge vortex has completely fallen off a trailing edge vortex has detached from the hydrofoil surface it has little effects on the hydrodynamic behavior because it was formed at the trailing edge when the pitching angle was close to the maximum although the trailing edge vortex enlarges the pressure difference of the upper and lower surfaces it is attached on the foil surface for a short period of time and the windward area in the lift direction decreases from t t t1 to t2 thus the lift did not increase the spring and damping forces decrease with the decrease of the displacement and the heaving velocity respectively from t1 t3 at t t t3 the pitching angle is still larger than the dynamic stall angle a new leading edge vortex is formed and attached to the hydrofoil surface even if the vortex is not as strong as the first one the lift increases and is larger than the sum of the spring and damping forces as a result the heaving motion changes the direction again at large pitching amplitudes and low oscillation frequencies dynamic stall occurs due to the large angle of attack the high intensity leading edge vortex forms and sheds twice during the stroke up or down stroke which causes the hydrofoil to change the heaving direction six times in one cycle this heaving response type should be avoided because the hydrofoil moving in the opposite direction will consume energy the energy harvested by the hydrofoil is used to maintain the oscillating motion and the power output assuming that the consumption of the damper is completely converted into power output the damping coefficient will determine the heaving response as well as the power output fig 10 shows the variation of the heaving amplitude and the power coefficient with the change of the damping coefficient the heaving amplitude drops with increasing damping coefficients within the range of the research the heaving amplitude is less than half of the chord when c 4 the hydrofoil has a poor energy harvesting performance under large damping coefficients due to the small oscillation amplitude at a smaller damping coefficient the heaving motion will harvest more energy but the pitching motion will also consume more the heaving power coefficient decreases with increasing damping coefficients the pitching power coefficient improves when c 4 and it is almost unchanged when c 4 as a result the net power coefficient decreases as the damping coefficient increases zhan et al plotted the heaving and the net power coefficient versus the damping coefficient at a reynolds number of 1100 zhan et al 2017 at high reynolds numbers the change in the power coefficient with the variation of the damping coefficient shows a similar trend as that at low reynolds numbers 4 2 effects of kinematic parameters for the semi passive system the kinematic parameters are the oscillation frequency and the pitching amplitude heaving and pitching motions have the same oscillation frequency because the heaving response depends on the pitching motion the oscillation frequency not only indicates the time of one cycle but also is related to the effective angle of attack the pitching amplitude mainly determines the angle of attack therefore the oscillation frequency and the pitching amplitude will significantly affect the heaving response in this section the damping coefficient c 0 8π is used fig 11 a plots the heaving response at different pitching amplitudes and oscillation frequencies and fig 11 b depicts the variation of the heaving amplitude with changing oscillation frequencies at a fixed oscillation frequency the heaving amplitude increases first and then decreases as the pitching amplitude increases at low oscillation frequencies the highest heaving amplitude the peak value marked in fig 11 b is obtained at a smaller pitching amplitude generally the heaving amplitude decreases with increasing oscillation frequency a special case is observed at θ 0 85 the heaving amplitude at f 0 25 is slightly larger than that of f 0 20 this phenomenon only occurs at large pitching amplitudes θ 0 75 and high oscillation frequencies f 0 25 within the range of this research the effective angle of attack decreases with increasing f thereby improving the hydrodynamic performance at large pitching amplitudes on the other hand the foil presses the fluid at an extremely high pitching amplitude and oscillation frequency because of a large angular velocity causing the lift to reach a huge peak early see fig 12 b fig 15 and fig 17 differences in oscillation periods get smaller with increasing f when the lift is significantly increased it can compensate the decrease in oscillation period thus the heaving amplitude may increase with increasing f fig 12 a plots the lift coefficient at different pitching amplitudes and fig 13 shows the corresponding vortex fields in fig 11 a the hydrofoil reaches a larger heaving amplitude at θ 0 55 for θ 0 40 the effective angle of attack is relatively small the weak boundary separation at t t t3 has a slight impact on the hydrodynamic performance the lift coefficient curve is smooth but it reaches a relatively small peak resulting in a small heaving amplitude at large pitching amplitudes e g θ 0 70 the occurrence of deep dynamic stall leads to a poor hydrodynamic performance the boundary layer separates at t t t1 a large leading edge vortex forms before the largest pitching angle which creates a deep negative pressure zone on the upper surface therefore the lift coefficient reaches a higher peak however the lift drops rapidly at t t t2 due to the shedding of the leading edge vortex at t t t4 a trailing edge vortex is observed on the hydrofoil surface the lift is slightly increased because the intensity of trailing edge vortex is relatively low for θ 0 55 the boundary layer begins to separate at t t t2 and a leading edge vortex is formed at t t t3 the vortex enhances the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces resulting in a large lift at t t t4 the shedding of the leading edge vortex causes the lift to fluctuate slightly because the vortex is small and sheds when the pitching angle narrows thus the heaving motion reaches a large amplitude due to better hydrodynamic performance a lower oscillation frequency indicates a longer oscillation period it is easy to understand that large heaving amplitudes are achieved at low oscillation frequencies fig 12 b plots the lift coefficient at different oscillation frequencies at f 0 05 the occurrence of dynamic stall causes the lift to drop rapidly after reaching a small peak the heaving motion of the hydrofoil starts the upstroke before t t 1 2 even if the pitching angle is positive the increased oscillation frequency decreases the effective angle of attack although the lift peak at f 0 05 is slightly larger than that at f 0 15 the lift maintains a large value for a long time at f 0 15 the hydrofoil has an excellent hydrodynamic performance for f 0 25 the heaving velocity at f 0 25 is therefore larger than that at f 0 05 fig 12 b reveals that the foil achieves a large heaving amplitude at low oscillation frequencies due to a longer oscillation period rather than better hydrodynamic performance although the oscillation period decreases with increasing oscillation frequencies a larger heaving amplitude may be achieved at a higher oscillation frequency due to the significant increase of the lift of course this usually happens at large pitching amplitudes and high oscillation frequencies as in the case of θ 0 85 in fig 11 b compared with the heaving response we are more concerned with the energy harvesting performance fig 14 plots the variation of cycle averaged heaving and pitching power coefficients the heaving velocity is one of the key factors that determine the heaving power coefficient the heaving velocity increases with larger oscillation frequencies which leads to an increase in the heaving power coefficient the pitching power coefficient changes slightly as the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency change when f 0 15 and it drops significantly with the increase of the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency when f 0 15 the variation trend of the pitching and heaving power coefficients at high oscillation frequencies is similar to that of reference kim et al 2017 case i θ 0 70 f 0 075 case ii θ 0 70 f 0 25 the heaving power coefficient is determined by the lift the heaving velocity and the synchronicity of the two similarly the pitching power coefficient is up to the moment the pitching velocity and the synchronicity of the two fig 15 plots the hydrodynamics and power coefficients for two typical cases for case i even if the lift and heaving velocity are well synchronized the hydrofoil achieves a small heaving power coefficient peak due to the smaller lift and heaving velocity for the most time of a cycle the moment is in the same direction as the pitching motion thereby reducing its energy consumption for case ii although the synchronization between the lift and the heaving velocity is not very good the larger lift and heaving velocity allow the hydrofoil to obtain a larger heaving power coefficient however the pitching motion consumes a lot of energy because the direction of the moment is opposite to the angular velocity for a long time as discussed above the heaving velocity is small at low oscillation frequencies which has little effect on the effective angle of attack for case i the angular velocity is small the angle of attack or pitching angle plays a leading role in the vortex formation and pressure distribution the formation and the shedding of the vortex are caused by the larger effective angle of attack as shown in fig 16 at t t t1 the shedding vortex creates a deep negative pressure zone near the trailing edge fig 17 which makes the moment in the same direction as the pitching motion at t t t2 and t3 it is difficult to distinguish the moment direction from the pressure contour however the moment acting on the hydrofoil is negligible due to the small pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces at t t t4 the moment is small because the pressure center is close to the pitching axis for case ii the high oscillation frequency leads to a large angular velocity which greatly affects the formation of the vortex and the pressure distribution the vortex is formed on the fore surface at high oscillation frequencies as shown in fig 16 these vortices are caused by a higher oscillation frequency rather than a larger effective angle of attack at the front of the pitching axis the pitching motion squeezes the fluid on the upper surface thereby creating a high pressure region the opposite phenomenon occurs at the rear of the pitching axis the moment acting on the hydrofoil by the fluid in the front and rear of the pitching axis has the same direction consequently the moment is large and hinders the pitching motion which causes the pitching motion to consume a large amount of energy fig 14 indicates that as the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency increase the heaving power coefficient improves while the pitching power coefficient decreases when the increase in the heaving power coefficient is less than the decrease in the pitching power coefficient the net power coefficient decreases at extremely large pitching amplitudes and high oscillation frequencies e g θ 0 90 and f 0 30 the net power coefficient is negative which indicates that the oscillating hydrofoil system cannot harvest energy from tidal currents fig 18 shows the efficiency contour on the space of the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency the highest efficiency of 40 84 is achieved at θ 0 80 and f 0 125 deng et al drew the efficiency contours of a semi passive system without springs at a reynolds number of 1100 the maximum calculated efficiency of 34 was obtained in the case of θ 0 75 and f 0 16 deng et al 2015 which is lower than the optimal efficiency of the present study the hydrofoil obtains higher energy harvesting efficiencies at high reynolds numbers which meets the conclusion that the energy harvesting efficiency increases with the reynolds number xiao and zhu 2014 5 conclusions in this study the heaving response of the semi passive oscillating hydrofoil system was investigated at a high reynolds number the following conclusions are given 1 a small stiffness spring is necessary for the semi passive system at high reynolds numbers the heaving response will diverge when k 0 due to the difference in the hydrodynamics of up and down strokes this behavior is different from the results at low reynolds numbers 1000 at large pitching amplitudes and low oscillation frequencies the heaving motion will change directions during the strokes up and down strokes due to the formation and the shedding of high intensity leading edge vortices at large damping coefficients c 4 the small oscillation amplitude of the hydrofoil will result in poor energy harvesting performance 2 the hydrofoil can achieve stable heaving responses at different initial pitching angles at high oscillation frequencies it takes a long time for the hydrofoil to obtain a stable heaving response the initial pitching angle has a slight effect on the heaving response at low oscillation frequencies but a significant one at high oscillation frequencies however differences in the net power coefficient are small at different initial pitching angles the balance position of the heaving response deviates from the initial position h l 0 especially when the initial pitching angle is zero and the pitching amplitude is large moreover the deviation of the balance position does not show a constant pattern with the change of the oscillation frequency 3 the hydrofoil cannot obtain a larger lift at small pitching amplitudes and the occurrence of the dynamic stall will result in poor hydrodynamic performance at large pitching amplitudes therefore at a fixed oscillation frequency the heaving amplitude increases first and then decreases as the pitching amplitude increases at a fixed pitching amplitude the heaving amplitude decreases with increasing oscillation frequencies the large heaving amplitudes obtained at low frequencies are due to longer oscillation periods rather than better hydrodynamic performance 4 the heaving power coefficient improves with increasing oscillating frequencies the pitching power coefficient changes slightly at low oscillation frequencies but it drops sharply at high oscillation frequencies since the increase in the heaving power coefficient is less than the decrease in the pitching power coefficient the hydrofoil has a poor energy harvesting performance at high oscillation frequencies the optimal efficiency of 40 84 is obtained when θ 0 80 and f 0 125 this value is larger than the maximum efficiency achieved at low reynolds numbers credit

21022,the bio inspired oscillating hydrofoils are capable of harvesting energy from tidal currents in this study the effects of mechanical spring and damping coefficients and kinematic pitching amplitude and oscillation frequency parameters on the performance of the semi passive oscillating hydrofoil naca 0015 system were numerically studied at a high reynolds number of 106 it is found that the spring k is necessary to obtain a stable heaving response the initial pitching angle has a significant effect on the heaving response while it has a little impact on the power output the balance position of the heaving response deviates notably from the initial position especially when the initial pitching angle is zero a larger damping coefficient c results in poor energy harvesting performance due to a smaller oscillation amplitude the heaving amplitude increases firstly and decreases afterward with the increase of the pitching amplitude θ 0 while it decreases monotonically with increasing oscillation frequency f when f 0 15 the heaving and pitching power coefficients increase and decrease with increasing f respectively the net power coefficient decreases at high oscillation frequencies because the increase in the heaving power coefficient is smaller than the decrease in the pitching power coefficient when k 0 5 and c 0 8π an optimal energy harvesting efficiency of 40 84

show obvious advantages in harvesting tidal energy 1 it is more suitable for application in shallow waters because the foil sweeps across a rectangular cross section of flow 2 the lower tip speed reduces both the structural requirements and the negative impacts on the aquatic animals 3 the simple foil geometry reduces designing and manufacturing costs as well as necessary maintenance needs oscillating foils are inspired by bird wings or fish fins birnbaum 1924 reported that it could be used as novel propeller in 1924 since then a lot of efforts have been taken on exploring its application such as wave gliders and ship propulsion the propulsive performance of rigid oscillating foils depends on key parameters including the strouhal number reduced frequencies floryan et al 2017 and heaving and pitching amplitudes andersen et al 2017 while it is almost independent of the mean free stream velocity ma et al 2018a van buren et al 2018 and the reynolds number medjroubi et al 2011 the aero hydro dynamics of the oscillating foil is a hot topic and has been investigated over several decades a key component of the optimal thrust production is the formation and timing of a coherent leading edge vortex lev and trailing edge vortex tev lev and tev are frequently observed from wake structures behind an oscillating foil both of them are sensitive to variations of reynolds number however ohmi et al 1990 revealed that the variation of reynolds number has no major effect on the formation of the periodic vortex and the establishment of the subsequent wake behind an oscillating foil in the range of 1500 10000 increasing the reynolds number while keeping the same frequency and amplitude of oscillations has no apparent effects either on the flow structure or on the aerodynamic loads medjroubi et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2020 found that all high efficiency kinematics is a coherent lev that forms on the heave stroke and sheds at or just after the heave stroke reversal at large angles of attack moreover the coherent lev forms earlier and is slightly stronger in high reynolds numbers resulting in high efficiency conversion baik et al 2012 noticed that increasing reduced frequency causes slower lev and tev growth rate hemmati et al 2019 found that the maximum instantaneous thrust coincides with the detachment of a tev the lev eventually wraps around the trailing edge and merges with side edge shear layer and connects to the legs of tevs in all cases it is certain that lev affects the hydrodynamics significantly however there remain significant differences in opinion as to the actual mechanism by which the lift is enhanced nabawy and crowther 2017 in addition to utilizing the oscillating foil for propulsion purposes energy harvesting devices which make use of oscillating foils to extract energy from tidal currents and wind have been proposed jones and platzer 1997 found that the oscillating foil will change from the thrust mode to the energy extraction mode when the pitching amplitude is sufficiently large and they provided criteria to distinguish the two modes for the oscillating hydrofoil following their study a series of computations and experiments were performed to study the effects of various parameters in the early stage the fully activated model was adopted to study the performance of the oscillating foil just as the propellers the energy harvesting performance of oscillating foils is related to many parameters including hydrofoil geometrics flow conditions kinematic and mechanical parameters systematic numerical and experimental investigations have been done to clarify the effects of these parameters based on the fully activated model extensive study also has been carried out to improve the energy harvesting performance of the oscillating hydrofoil however a crucial question for this type of oscillation motion is how to realize the ideal heaving and pitching motions to get rid of the complex control system the fully passive model which the foil is free to respond to the incoming flow in both pitching and heaving motions has been proposed peng and zhu proposed a device in which the foil is mounted on a simple structural system containing a rotational spring in the pitching direction and a damper in the heaving direction peng and zhu 2009 four different responses were recorded in that novel system veilleux and dumas developed a fully passive hydrokinetic energy flow harvester which consists of self sustained pitch heave oscillations of an elastically mounted airfoil and 2d efficiencies as high as 34 have been obtained veilleux and dumas 2017 wang et al achieved a highest efficiency of 32 in the similar system dumas proposed a hydraulic system to combine the pitching and heaving motions of two foil to achieve a fully induced and self sustained oscillation motion dumas et al 2011 and ma et al demonstrated the feasibility of such systems ma et al 2018b 2018c however the energy harvesting efficiency of this fully passive system is not as high as that of the fully activated and semi passive systems compared with fully activated and fully passive models the semi passive model is more promising for commercial application of oscillating foil turbines conventionally the semi passive model is characterized by a forced pitching motion but a free heaving motion for simplicity the generator is typically idealized as a damper which is attached to the heaving motion shimizu et al 2008 performed a multi objective optimization to improve both power and efficiency their results demonstrated that large power is achieved at low frequencies and large motion amplitudes while high efficiency occurs at high frequencies and small motion amplitudes by using a fluid structure interaction model based upon a finite difference solver of the n s equations zhu and peng 2009 examined the effects of both mechanical and operational parameters in low reynolds numbers 1000 under the same reynolds number deng et al 2015 studied the inertial effect of oscillating foils and the results showed that the energy harvesting efficiency decreases monotonically with increasing mass ratio they also have taken efforts to improve the efficiency through non sinusoidal pitching motion teng et al 2016 more recently boudreau et al boudreau 2019 proposed a novel semi passive oscillating foil system with an activated heaving motion and a passive pitching motion and they reported achieving maximum efficiency of 45 4 at a high reynolds number of 3 9 106 most of the existing studies focus on the performance of semi passive oscillating foils at low reynolds numbers 1000 as pointed out by deng et al 2015 the results at low reynolds number cannot be directly applied to actual engineering projects moreover unlike the thrust mode the efficiency of oscillating hydrofoils slightly improves with increasing reynolds number in energy harvesting mode kinsey and dumas 2012a therefore this study will analyze the energy harvesting performance of the semi passive oscillating hydrofoil at a high reynolds number of 106 since the initial pitching angle affects the heaving response its effects will also be discussed in the present study the rest of this article is organized by first defining the hydrofoil motion system this is followed by a description of the numerical method and validation studies then the numerical results are presented and discussed at the end of the study several conclusions are given 2 semi passive system the oscillating hydrofoil system consists of a pitching motion θ t and a heaving motion h t for the semi passive model the pitching motion is governed by a controller with the prescribed frequency f and amplitude θ 0 which is expressed as 1 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ the oscillation frequency f is usually dealt as the reduced frequency f f l u where l is the chord length and u is the flow velocity the phase difference ϕ determines the initial angle of the pitching motion the heaving motion is supported by a generator for simplicity the generator is idealized as a damper a linear spring is attached to the foil to increase the stability of the system as shown in fig 1 the equation of the heaving motion can be derived as follows 2 m h t c h t k h t f where m c k are the total mass of the hydrofoil including the physical mass and the added mass the damping of the damper and the stiffness of the spring respectively f is the lift for the semi passive model an external torque m out is required to activate the pitching motion the pitch axis is in the 1 3 chord from the leading edge it is assumed that the pitch axis coincides with the center of the mass of the hydrofoil considering the rib structure this assumption is practically reasonable m out is calculated as 3 m o u t i θ m where i is the moment of inertia and m is the pitching moment the coefficients m c k and i are defined as boudreau et al 2019 wu et al 2015 4 m m ρ l c c ρ u l s k k ρ u 2 l i i ρ s l 4 where ρ is the fluid density and s is the span length for a 2d model the span length is 1 s 1 the power of the pitching motion is p m m o u t θ and the power consumption of the external controller is p m the power output is achieved via the damper by assuming that the consumption of the damper is completely converted into power thus the total power output is equal to the heaving motion harvested in one cycle because the spring neither produces nor consumes energy the power output is expressed by the instantaneous heaving power p h f h rather than c h 2 for the purpose of analysis thus the instantaneous net power output is calculated as p p h p m p h p m the dimensionless coefficients of the lift the moment and the power are defined as 5 c f f 1 2 ρ u 2 l s c m m 1 2 ρ u 2 l 2 s 6 c p h c p m c p p h p m p 1 2 ρ u 2 l s the cycle averaged power coefficients c p h c p m and c p are the average values of c p h c p m and c p in ten cycles the energy harvesting efficiency is defined as 7 η p 1 2 ρ u 3 d s c p l u d where the swept height d is the distance between the highest and the lowest positions of the trailing edge 3 numerical approach 3 1 governing equations the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow around the hydrofoil are the navier stokes equations 8 u i t u i u j x j μ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x

decomposed into mean and fluctuating parts 10 u i u i u i p p p substituting expressions of this form for the flow variables into the instantaneous continuity and momentum equations and taking the time average yields the ensemble averaged momentum equations thus the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans can be derived as follows alfonsi 2009 11 u i t u j u i x j μ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x

software fluent is used to solve the unsteady rans equations about the oscillating foil 3 2 computational set up a grid model used for computation is constructed with sliding interface as shown in fig 2 the mesh is composed of two sub domains with a sliding interface except the boundary layer which employs quadrilateral cells triangle cells unstructured mesh are used for meshing ma et al 2017 2018a the far field boundary is set to a long distance 35l from the foil such that its effect on the flow surrounding the moving surface is negligible kinsey and dumas 2008 the inlet free stream velocity is u 1 6 m s and the turbulence intensity is 5 at the pressure outlet boundary the pressure is set to the free stream value the velocity pressure coupling is based on a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm the second order upwind spatial discretization and the second order accurate backward implicit scheme are used for transient terms the convergence criterion is selected as 10 5 for all variables the spalart allmaras s a model is a one equation model used to solve a modeled transport equation for the kinematic eddy turbulent viscosity it is designed specifically for aerospace applications kinsey and dumas 2012a revealed that the instantaneous predictions of the s a model compares advantageously with those of the sst model following their study the s a turbulence model is adopted in this study the heaving motion is solved using an iteration scheme based on the classical runge kutta method the iteration scheme is described as follows ma et al 2021 at the beginning the hydrofoil keeps stationary the lift of the flow acting on the hydrofoil is computed by the fluent solver the heaving acceleration at n 0 is calculated by 13 h 0 f c h 0 k h 0 m the heaving motion displacement and velocity at n 1 is given by 14 h n 1 h n 1 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 δ t 15 h n 1 h n 1 6 l 1 2 l 2 2 l 3 l 4 δ t where 16 k 1 h n l 1 h n 17 k 2 h n l 1 δ t 2 l 2 h n l 1 δ t 2 18 k 3 h n l 2 δ t 2 l 3 h n l 2 δ t 2 19 k 4 h n l 3 δ t l 4 h n l 3 δ t a small time step δ t is employed to obtain a higher accuracy the user defined function udf is compiled to achieve the iteration scheme and it is loaded into the fluent solver to control the hydrofoil movement grid and time step sensitivity analysis were performed to select a suitable grid and time step for simulations fig 3 plots the lift coefficient and the heaving response at different levels of the grid 85000 cells and 600 nodes on the foil 130000 cells and 900 nodes on the foil 175000 cells and 900 nodes on the foil and time refinement 1000 5000 and 10000 timesteps per cycle the difference of the results obtained on different grids and time steps is minimal based on this observation a grid of 85000 cells and a time resolution of 1000 t cycle are used in this study to reduce the time consumption 3 3 validation studies simulations were performed to verify the settings of the numerical model and the iteration scheme kinsey and dumas conducted a lot of computational research on the oscillating foil based on the fully activated model as shown in fig 4 a the moment coefficient of the naca0015 foil from the present study and that from the study of kinsey et al kinsey and dumas 2008 are in good agreement in the latter study the same cfd software fluent and simulation method rans are employed the parameters of the validation case re 1100 θ 0 76 33 f 0 14 both 2d and 3d simulations were performed to further validate the numerical method the numerical results are compared with the experiment results from ref prier 2018 as shown in fig 4 b the experiment was carried out with a fully activated oscillating foil device in a wind tunnel a foil with an aspect ratio of 2 was adopted in the experiment other experimental parameters are re 30000 θ 0 70 f 0 08 the 3d numerical results match the experimental results well if considering the experimental errors green line in fig 4 b the 2d numerical results are larger than the experimental results because the formation of tip vortices significantly reduces the lift for a foil with a small aspect ratio kinsey and dumas demonstrated that the relative decrease in performance owing to 3d hydrodynamic losses can be limited to 10 of the 2d prediction when the aspect ratio is greater than 7 kinsey and dumas 2012b consequently in order to reduce the time consumption the 2d model is used in this study teng et al used the open source cfd code openfoam to simulate the flow around a flapping foil teng et al 2016 the time dependent navier stokes equations were solved using the finite volume method the effects of non sinusoidal pitching motions on the semi passive oscillating foil system was studied at re 1000 fig 4 c plots the lift coefficient of teng et al and the present study the parameters of the validation case are naca0015 foil θ 0 75 f 0 2 c π and k 0 no turbulence model was used in that study since the flow around flapping foils was considered at a laboratory scale with re 1000 although discrepancies are observed near the peak two curves are in good agreement at other stages kinsey and dumas 2012a performed simulations for different turbulence models discrepancies are essentially observed when the oscillating foil is near its top and bottom positions because of the slight differences in the timing of flow separations and subsequent vortex shedding therefore considering the difference in the choice of numerical methods and turbulence models it can be deemed that the results of the present study are in line with that of teng et al 4 results and discussions for a semi passive oscillating hydrofoil system many parameters are related to the heaving response in this study the effects of mechanical and kinematic parameters are analyzed at a high reynolds number the details of parameters used in this study are listed in table 1 4 1 effects of mechanical parameters the mechanical parameters include the spring stiffness and the damping coefficient for the semi passive system in fig 1 at low reynolds numbers sometimes only the damper is employed in the system which means k 0 deng et al 2015 liu et al 2013 zhu and peng 2009 at high reynolds numbers the hydrodynamic characteristic is not exactly the same on the up and down strokes although the difference is small the balance position deviates from the initial position h l 0 and the heaving response cannot converge when k 0 due to the accumulation of the difference the balance position is defined as the midpoint of the highest and the lowest of the heaving response the spring can increase the stability of the heaving response a spring with a small stiffness will slightly affect the energy harvesting performance because it neither produces nor consumes energy therefore a small stiffness spring was added to the semi passive system and k is fixed at 0 5 in this study the initial pitching angle depends on the phase difference of the pitching motion when ϕ 0 the initial pitching angle is zero when ϕ 90 the hydrofoil is at the maximum pitching angle at t t 0 there is no doubt that the initial pitching angle will affect the balance position of the heaving response fig 5 plots the heaving responses at different initial pitching angles if the power coefficients at different initial pitching angles are not significantly different it can be proved that the spring with a small stiffness has little effect on the energy harvesting performance of the system the hydrofoil can obtain stable heaving responses at different initial pitching angles at low oscillation frequencies e g f 0 025 the discrepancy in the heaving response of different initial pitching angles is negligible at a larger oscillation frequency e g f 0 20 it takes a long time for the hydrofoil to reach a stable heaving response obvious discrepancies are observed in the heaving response at different initial pitching angles when ϕ 0 the heaving response converges after the 15th cycle and the balance position deviates noticeably this is reasonable considering that the hydrofoil is located in the highest point of the heaving motion and the spring force is zero at the beginning the heaving response reaches a steady state after the 8th cycle for ϕ 90 in this study 50 cycles of simulation were performed in each case fig 5 just plots 16 cycles to clearly show the heaving response the lift coefficients of the first two cycles are plotted to explain the entirely different behaviors with varying initial pitching angles and oscillating frequencies as shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the lift is not zero at t t 0 for all cases for case i the lift shows similar profile except a phase difference of 90 resulting in an insignificant difference in the balance position of the heaving response between ϕ 0 and 90 for case ii the lift at t t 0 for ϕ 0 is larger than that at t t 0 for ϕ 90 due to a high oscillating frequency although the pitching angle is zero at t t 0 for ϕ 0 the lift decreases after a short period of increase as the pitching angle expands for ϕ 0 while the lift decreases as the pitching angle narrows for ϕ 90 there is always a significant difference between the lift for ϕ 0 and 90 which is the main reason why the balance position of the heaving response deviates from different directions the hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating hydrofoil is obviously related to differences in the timing of flow separations and subsequent vortex shedding therefore the lift at t t 0 determines the balance position of the heaving response table 2 gives the heaving response parameters at different initial pitching angles the heaving amplitude h is calculated by averaging the heaving amplitude of ten cycles for case i the heaving amplitudes are slightly different and the power coefficients are identical at different initial pitching angles for case ii at different initial pitching angles there is a difference of 4 73 in the heaving amplitude a difference of 7 54 in the heaving power coefficient and a difference of 13 71 in the pitching power coefficient however the difference in the net power coefficient is relatively small fig 7 plots the variation of the balance position of the heaving response at different cases for ϕ 0 the deviation of the balance position is closely related to the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency when θ 0 45 the balance position is near the initial position at f 0 025 the deviation of the balance position increases sharply from f 0 025 to 0 05 and then hardly changes as oscillation frequency increases the deviation is more noticeable at large pitching amplitudes at θ 0 60 and 75 the balance position deviates to the negative direction first and then shifts to the positive direction with increasing f when θ 0 75 the maximum deviation of the balance position reaches 0 8l which is larger than the heaving amplitude for ϕ 90 although the results are not shown in fig 7 the deviation of the heaving response is negligible when θ 0 60 when θ 0 75 the balance position is close to zero in most cases although the balance position deviation of ϕ 90 is relatively small compared with that of ϕ 0 ϕ 0 is employed in the rest of the study because the initial pitching angle is usually zero in practical applications the heaving response of the hydrofoil depends on the pitching motion under normal conditions the hydrofoil changes the heaving direction at the highest and lowest points however the heaving motion changes the direction six times in one cycle for case i in fig 5 the hydrofoil briefly moves in the opposite direction near the end of the stroke a possible reason is that the formation and the shedding of the leading edge vortex causes the lift to rise and fall sharply fig 8 plots the lift coefficient and the heaving velocity and fig 9 shows the corresponding vortex fields at f 0 025 the balance position has a small deviation the hydrodynamic behavior at the second half cycle is similar to that at the first half cycle therefore only the first half cycle is discussed the heaving velocity is related to the lift and the spring and damping forces the spring and damping forces are proportional to the heaving displacement and velocity respectively when t t t0 the lift has not yet reached its peak the heaving velocity starts to decrease due to the increase of damping and spring forces at t t t1 a leading edge vortex has detached from the hydrofoil surface the formation of this vortex creates a deep negative pressure zone on the lower surface and enhances the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces resulting in a larger lift peak the lift drops sharply resulting from the shedding of the leading edge vortex the sum of the spring and damping forces is opposite to the heaving direction and larger than the lift the heaving velocity decreases rapidly and shifts from negative to positive which indicates a change in the direction of the heaving motion at t t t2 the pitching angle of the hydrofoil is the largest the leading edge vortex has completely fallen off a trailing edge vortex has detached from the hydrofoil surface it has little effects on the hydrodynamic behavior because it was formed at the trailing edge when the pitching angle was close to the maximum although the trailing edge vortex enlarges the pressure difference of the upper and lower surfaces it is attached on the foil surface for a short period of time and the windward area in the lift direction decreases from t t t1 to t2 thus the lift did not increase the spring and damping forces decrease with the decrease of the displacement and the heaving velocity respectively from t1 t3 at t t t3 the pitching angle is still larger than the dynamic stall angle a new leading edge vortex is formed and attached to the hydrofoil surface even if the vortex is not as strong as the first one the lift increases and is larger than the sum of the spring and damping forces as a result the heaving motion changes the direction again at large pitching amplitudes and low oscillation frequencies dynamic stall occurs due to the large angle of attack the high intensity leading edge vortex forms and sheds twice during the stroke up or down stroke which causes the hydrofoil to change the heaving direction six times in one cycle this heaving response type should be avoided because the hydrofoil moving in the opposite direction will consume energy the energy harvested by the hydrofoil is used to maintain the oscillating motion and the power output assuming that the consumption of the damper is completely converted into power output the damping coefficient will determine the heaving response as well as the power output fig 10 shows the variation of the heaving amplitude and the power coefficient with the change of the damping coefficient the heaving amplitude drops with increasing damping coefficients within the range of the research the heaving amplitude is less than half of the chord when c 4 the hydrofoil has a poor energy harvesting performance under large damping coefficients due to the small oscillation amplitude at a smaller damping coefficient the heaving motion will harvest more energy but the pitching motion will also consume more the heaving power coefficient decreases with increasing damping coefficients the pitching power coefficient improves when c 4 and it is almost unchanged when c 4 as a result the net power coefficient decreases as the damping coefficient increases zhan et al plotted the heaving and the net power coefficient versus the damping coefficient at a reynolds number of 1100 zhan et al 2017 at high reynolds numbers the change in the power coefficient with the variation of the damping coefficient shows a similar trend as that at low reynolds numbers 4 2 effects of kinematic parameters for the semi passive system the kinematic parameters are the oscillation frequency and the pitching amplitude heaving and pitching motions have the same oscillation frequency because the heaving response depends on the pitching motion the oscillation frequency not only indicates the time of one cycle but also is related to the effective angle of attack the pitching amplitude mainly determines the angle of attack therefore the oscillation frequency and the pitching amplitude will significantly affect the heaving response in this section the damping coefficient c 0 8π is used fig 11 a plots the heaving response at different pitching amplitudes and oscillation frequencies and fig 11 b depicts the variation of the heaving amplitude with changing oscillation frequencies at a fixed oscillation frequency the heaving amplitude increases first and then decreases as the pitching amplitude increases at low oscillation frequencies the highest heaving amplitude the peak value marked in fig 11 b is obtained at a smaller pitching amplitude generally the heaving amplitude decreases with increasing oscillation frequency a special case is observed at θ 0 85 the heaving amplitude at f 0 25 is slightly larger than that of f 0 20 this phenomenon only occurs at large pitching amplitudes θ 0 75 and high oscillation frequencies f 0 25 within the range of this research the effective angle of attack decreases with increasing f thereby improving the hydrodynamic performance at large pitching amplitudes on the other hand the foil presses the fluid at an extremely high pitching amplitude and oscillation frequency because of a large angular velocity causing the lift to reach a huge peak early see fig 12 b fig 15 and fig 17 differences in oscillation periods get smaller with increasing f when the lift is significantly increased it can compensate the decrease in oscillation period thus the heaving amplitude may increase with increasing f fig 12 a plots the lift coefficient at different pitching amplitudes and fig 13 shows the corresponding vortex fields in fig 11 a the hydrofoil reaches a larger heaving amplitude at θ 0 55 for θ 0 40 the effective angle of attack is relatively small the weak boundary separation at t t t3 has a slight impact on the hydrodynamic performance the lift coefficient curve is smooth but it reaches a relatively small peak resulting in a small heaving amplitude at large pitching amplitudes e g θ 0 70 the occurrence of deep dynamic stall leads to a poor hydrodynamic performance the boundary layer separates at t t t1 a large leading edge vortex forms before the largest pitching angle which creates a deep negative pressure zone on the upper surface therefore the lift coefficient reaches a higher peak however the lift drops rapidly at t t t2 due to the shedding of the leading edge vortex at t t t4 a trailing edge vortex is observed on the hydrofoil surface the lift is slightly increased because the intensity of trailing edge vortex is relatively low for θ 0 55 the boundary layer begins to separate at t t t2 and a leading edge vortex is formed at t t t3 the vortex enhances the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces resulting in a large lift at t t t4 the shedding of the leading edge vortex causes the lift to fluctuate slightly because the vortex is small and sheds when the pitching angle narrows thus the heaving motion reaches a large amplitude due to better hydrodynamic performance a lower oscillation frequency indicates a longer oscillation period it is easy to understand that large heaving amplitudes are achieved at low oscillation frequencies fig 12 b plots the lift coefficient at different oscillation frequencies at f 0 05 the occurrence of dynamic stall causes the lift to drop rapidly after reaching a small peak the heaving motion of the hydrofoil starts the upstroke before t t 1 2 even if the pitching angle is positive the increased oscillation frequency decreases the effective angle of attack although the lift peak at f 0 05 is slightly larger than that at f 0 15 the lift maintains a large value for a long time at f 0 15 the hydrofoil has an excellent hydrodynamic performance for f 0 25 the heaving velocity at f 0 25 is therefore larger than that at f 0 05 fig 12 b reveals that the foil achieves a large heaving amplitude at low oscillation frequencies due to a longer oscillation period rather than better hydrodynamic performance although the oscillation period decreases with increasing oscillation frequencies a larger heaving amplitude may be achieved at a higher oscillation frequency due to the significant increase of the lift of course this usually happens at large pitching amplitudes and high oscillation frequencies as in the case of θ 0 85 in fig 11 b compared with the heaving response we are more concerned with the energy harvesting performance fig 14 plots the variation of cycle averaged heaving and pitching power coefficients the heaving velocity is one of the key factors that determine the heaving power coefficient the heaving velocity increases with larger oscillation frequencies which leads to an increase in the heaving power coefficient the pitching power coefficient changes slightly as the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency change when f 0 15 and it drops significantly with the increase of the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency when f 0 15 the variation trend of the pitching and heaving power coefficients at high oscillation frequencies is similar to that of reference kim et al 2017 case i θ 0 70 f 0 075 case ii θ 0 70 f 0 25 the heaving power coefficient is determined by the lift the heaving velocity and the synchronicity of the two similarly the pitching power coefficient is up to the moment the pitching velocity and the synchronicity of the two fig 15 plots the hydrodynamics and power coefficients for two typical cases for case i even if the lift and heaving velocity are well synchronized the hydrofoil achieves a small heaving power coefficient peak due to the smaller lift and heaving velocity for the most time of a cycle the moment is in the same direction as the pitching motion thereby reducing its energy consumption for case ii although the synchronization between the lift and the heaving velocity is not very good the larger lift and heaving velocity allow the hydrofoil to obtain a larger heaving power coefficient however the pitching motion consumes a lot of energy because the direction of the moment is opposite to the angular velocity for a long time as discussed above the heaving velocity is small at low oscillation frequencies which has little effect on the effective angle of attack for case i the angular velocity is small the angle of attack or pitching angle plays a leading role in the vortex formation and pressure distribution the formation and the shedding of the vortex are caused by the larger effective angle of attack as shown in fig 16 at t t t1 the shedding vortex creates a deep negative pressure zone near the trailing edge fig 17 which makes the moment in the same direction as the pitching motion at t t t2 and t3 it is difficult to distinguish the moment direction from the pressure contour however the moment acting on the hydrofoil is negligible due to the small pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces at t t t4 the moment is small because the pressure center is close to the pitching axis for case ii the high oscillation frequency leads to a large angular velocity which greatly affects the formation of the vortex and the pressure distribution the vortex is formed on the fore surface at high oscillation frequencies as shown in fig 16 these vortices are caused by a higher oscillation frequency rather than a larger effective angle of attack at the front of the pitching axis the pitching motion squeezes the fluid on the upper surface thereby creating a high pressure region the opposite phenomenon occurs at the rear of the pitching axis the moment acting on the hydrofoil by the fluid in the front and rear of the pitching axis has the same direction consequently the moment is large and hinders the pitching motion which causes the pitching motion to consume a large amount of energy fig 14 indicates that as the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency increase the heaving power coefficient improves while the pitching power coefficient decreases when the increase in the heaving power coefficient is less than the decrease in the pitching power coefficient the net power coefficient decreases at extremely large pitching amplitudes and high oscillation frequencies e g θ 0 90 and f 0 30 the net power coefficient is negative which indicates that the oscillating hydrofoil system cannot harvest energy from tidal currents fig 18 shows the efficiency contour on the space of the pitching amplitude and the oscillation frequency the highest efficiency of 40 84 is achieved at θ 0 80 and f 0 125 deng et al drew the efficiency contours of a semi passive system without springs at a reynolds number of 1100 the maximum calculated efficiency of 34 was obtained in the case of θ 0 75 and f 0 16 deng et al 2015 which is lower than the optimal efficiency of the present study the hydrofoil obtains higher energy harvesting efficiencies at high reynolds numbers which meets the conclusion that the energy harvesting efficiency increases with the reynolds number xiao and zhu 2014 5 conclusions in this study the heaving response of the semi passive oscillating hydrofoil system was investigated at a high reynolds number the following conclusions are given 1 a small stiffness spring is necessary for the semi passive system at high reynolds numbers the heaving response will diverge when k 0 due to the difference in the hydrodynamics of up and down strokes this behavior is different from the results at low reynolds numbers 1000 at large pitching amplitudes and low oscillation frequencies the heaving motion will change directions during the strokes up and down strokes due to the formation and the shedding of high intensity leading edge vortices at large damping coefficients c 4 the small oscillation amplitude of the hydrofoil will result in poor energy harvesting performance 2 the hydrofoil can achieve stable heaving responses at different initial pitching angles at high oscillation frequencies it takes a long time for the hydrofoil to obtain a stable heaving response the initial pitching angle has a slight effect on the heaving response at low oscillation frequencies but a significant one at high oscillation frequencies however differences in the net power coefficient are small at different initial pitching angles the balance position of the heaving response deviates from the initial position h l 0 especially when the initial pitching angle is zero and the pitching amplitude is large moreover the deviation of the balance position does not show a constant pattern with the change of the oscillation frequency 3 the hydrofoil cannot obtain a larger lift at small pitching amplitudes and the occurrence of the dynamic stall will result in poor hydrodynamic performance at large pitching amplitudes therefore at a fixed oscillation frequency the heaving amplitude increases first and then decreases as the pitching amplitude increases at a fixed pitching amplitude the heaving amplitude decreases with increasing oscillation frequencies the large heaving amplitudes obtained at low frequencies are due to longer oscillation periods rather than better hydrodynamic performance 4 the heaving power coefficient improves with increasing oscillating frequencies the pitching power coefficient changes slightly at low oscillation frequencies but it drops sharply at high oscillation frequencies since the increase in the heaving power coefficient is less than the decrease in the pitching power coefficient the hydrofoil has a poor energy harvesting performance at high oscillation frequencies the optimal efficiency of 40 84 is obtained when θ 0 80 and f 0 125 this value is larger than the maximum efficiency achieved at low reynolds numbers credit

21023,this study aims to model and analyse imperfect structures using real measurements employing photogrammetry technique commonly used in the geodesy the study highlights the capability of the photogrammetry in aiding the structural analysis of imperfect engineering objects firstly the photogrammetry measurements of a stiﬀened plate are carried out using a specially designed for the purpose experimental stand then the plate surface geometry and structural conﬁguration are reconstructed using commercial software the resulting cloud of points is transformed into a regular mesh with a controlled grid size using a specially developed algorithm the geometry of a stiﬀened plate with measured initial imperfections is then transferred to a ﬁnite element model and analysed the ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates considering different imperfections modelling techniques is conducted the results are compared with the one obtained for measured imperfections and several conclusions are derived the proposed methodology revealed to be cost effective and can be applied in various branches of shipbuilding and ocean engineering keywords photogrammetry stiffened plate ultimate strength fem imperfections 1 introduction the steel structures are welded which induces initial distortions and residual stresses in stiffened panels affecting the structural behaviour and capacity the welding induced phenomena are complex and difficult to estimate during the design process the effects of both residual stresses and distortions cause a reduction in load carrying capacity of stiffened plates near the collapse load smoothing the load shortening curve in the relevant region gordo and guedes soares 1993 one of the first attempts to investigate the welding induced distortion and residual stresses was conducted in dow and smith 1984 who studied buckling and post buckling behaviour of rectangular steel plates under compressive loads and concluded that the localised imperfection amplitude is one of the most important factors affecting the load carrying capacity some other early studies related to this topic may be found in smith et al 1988 ueda and yao 1985 where the impact of initial distortions into the strength of plate elements has been studied it was found that when the level of imperfections is significant the strength of plates under uniaxial loads can be significantly reduced the reduction was observed for plates with different levels of slenderness the investigations of the impact of the initial imperfections into the ultimate capacity of other structural components were also carried out including stiffened plates yu et al 2019 and panels özgüç et al 2007 pedram and khedmati 2014 and the conclusions were similar however due to the existence of stiffeners the reduction in the load carrying capacity was not significant compared to plates only some simplified methods for incorporating the initial imperfections influence in the ultimate strength predictions were proposed other experimental and numerical studies related to that problem may be found in chen and soares 2016 manco et al 2019 nowadays the most commonly used method to predict the behaviour of thin walled structures under compressive load is the non linear finite element method however some closed form solutions are useful too there are various methods to take into account the initial imperfections the first one is the implicit one thus some imperfections are taken into account during formula development using rules and norms such as the ultimate strength approach as stipulated by the common structural rules international association of classification societies 2018 the second method is to perform the linear buckling analysis firstly and the shape of the first mode is to be used for the further non linear calculation the third method is applying some priorly assumed shape and level of the initial imperfections directly to the fe model in the plates and stiffened plates the commonly used method here is the smith method smith 1975 finally one can measure the actual value and shape of the initial imperfections of any particular structural element employing various methods the measurement of the initial imperfections is the essential work that needs to be done when evaluating the ultimate strength of different structural members experimentally furtherly there need to be applied to the fe model although photogrammetry originates mostly from the geodetic applications founding a firm place in archaeological paleontological and antique techniques in terms of the latter an extraordinary precision is required to preserve details for archiving or recovery purposes lo brutto and spera 2012 carried out a curious study measuring a historic statue using two sister methods photogrammetry ibm image based and laser scanning rbm range based the study found that both methods produce similar detail and precision with minor strengths and weaknesses over each other in several parts of the statue it should be noted that not all cameras are appropriate for performing photogrammetry measurements although it does not have to be a professional kit at least a decent consumer grade dslr camera should be used still a photogrammetric hardware kit is significantly cheaper than a laser scanner suitable for scanning large objects it was shown in hellmuth et al 2020 that even popular smartphone cameras have some success in measuring complex geometries although limited by their insufficient optical capabilities photogrammetry is not limited to large scale objects it copes well with small targets and if executed properly it can be even used for nano scale metrology in the study performed in gontard et al 2016 a standard turntable image sequence is used to capture images of a single particle employing electron microscopy the study transitions from multiple sem images to a volume model and then to its 3d print representation in human scale it is interesting to note that even though only recently such operations became technically accessible the idea to reconstruct the 3d geometry from microscopic images is nearly as long standing as digital imagery itself as can be shown in crowther et al 1970 where the term photogrammetry is not even used or piazzesi 1973 mathematical formulation in garbatov et al 2014 the photogrammetry has been employed to scan the corroded surface of small scale fatigue specimens koelman 2010 employed the photogrammetry to capture complete ship hulls for further analysis it was noted that from an industrial point of view the method was fairly simple and adequate while exhibiting numerous advantages over alternative methods inclusion of texture in the measured material in addition to the standard geometry point cloud was proven to be a major asset allowing human aided recognition of ship parts a feature absent in akin laser scanning method the other advantage is scale independence of the photogrammetry since capturing a larger object requires just taking more images or different scale images reaching for photogrammetry to measure initial imperfections of a modelled structure has been known for some time it has been performed e g in chen et al 2011 where a structure was first measured then modelled and both experimentally and numerically tested the procedure included tedious marker placement and recognition designed to recreate structure deformation marker placement is one of the core photogrammetry features although it is not always necessary in this study we opted for markerless measurement to ensure that the original object surface is captured in many applications however markers cannot be avoided the most obvious purpose of using markers is model scaling but there are others it applies especially to the tasks where several measurements of a single object are made over time and they are later compared to compute the deformation of the object whether it is an evolution of the terrain surface in aerial photography with large markers hastaoğlu et al 2019 displacements of a composite tank goda et al 2019 or a strain field in a loaded steel plate li et al 2014 a set of markers coded or not is required to identify individual points in two compared models and compute the displacement field nonetheless these are advanced techniques which bring photogrammetry close to dic digital image correlation systems in terms of automatic marker or pattern recognition and correlation generic photogrammetry often relies on surface measurement alone such as in barbero garcía et al 2017 in a medical application skull shape assessment even in this case it was later supplemented with markers barbero garcía et al 2020 to track shape changes over time in the future in 3d geometry reconstruction tasks a 3d surface model is usually sought as a final result however both the photogrammetry and the laser scanning produce unhampered 3d point clouds which in principle do not form any specific surfaces surface generation is one of the geometry processing steps generic point clouds often include varying density and quality areas resulting in uneven point distribution out of plane points and artefacts it was noticed in armesto et al 2009 who decided to manually mark characteristic points in a measured truss construction and used only these selected points as a wireframe geometry base for subsequent fe analysis pre processing of point cloud with a resultant surface in mind is a tedious task and algorithms supporting this process are still an open question efforts have been made to create universal tools for this task such as edge aware algorithm huang et al 2013 or resampling method based on advanced mathematical tools chen et al 2018 in this study we also propose a numerical procedure which while simple is specially designed for our measurement interests and works well for this case it can be noticed that although the photogrammetry measurements were carried out for stiffened plates there were rarely applied to the fe model to investigate the structural behaviour additionally the presented approach is compared with the method that takes into account the assumed shape of initial imperfections which is a commonly used methodology when considering numerical analysis 2 photogrammetry measurements the analysed plates were of 1 265 m length breadth 0 4 m with the flat bar stiffener of 0 1 m height they were made from normal strength steel the plates with stiffeners are with three different thicknesses 5 mm 6 mm and 8 mm for each thickness the four specimens were fabricated with the identical welding parameters the specimens have been welded automatically with the identical parameters of the welding process which were monitored during welding a special experimental setup was prepared to perform the measurements of imperfections four cameras were attached to a frame which was placed over a heavy steel table the table was covered with a dark blanket and a measured specimen was lying on that blanket during the measurement a series of four images were taken simultaneously using a remote shutter then the plate was slided to a next position together with the blanket and photos were taken the process was repeated until the whole plate surface was captured in the images the experimental rig was presented in fig 1 the approximate camera to object distance was 60 cm while camera to camera distances were 32 cm for side pairs 1 2 and 3 4 and 48 cm for the middle 2 3 pair the 1 and 4 cameras were pointed at the stiffener while 2 and 3 cameras focused on the main plate surface the change in position between subsequent slides was small enough to ensure a 50 overlap in neighbouring images the four cameras used for the measurement were nikon d3300 equipped with nikon af s dx vr nikkor 18 55 mm f 3 5 5 6g ii interchangeable lenses nikon d3300 is a digital 24 mpx camera capable of capturing 6000 4000 px images all the images were taken with iso sensitivity set to 100 lowest possible on the used cameras 18 mm focal length and f 3 5 aperture aperture priority settings with neutral exposure compensation were used shutter speed varied slightly between shots depending on the light distribution and camera location however it mostly revolved around 1 20s and rarely exceeded 1 10s the aperture chosen was rather on the broadside however we decided to use it because of a poor lighting conditions and lack of separate external lights possible reflexes and b mostly perpendicular orientation of the measured surfaces concerning the lens optical axis admittedly a narrower aperture and longer exposure time could have been used to improve the subsequent post processing of the point cloud all cameras were equipped with remote control shutters which allowed the contactless and simultaneous acquisition of images these traits are important for proper photogrammetry remote control eliminates unwanted vibrations of the camera rig caused by manual operation even when the timer is utilised while simultaneity speeds up the process by capturing a whole series at once instead of manipulating each camera separately in the case of more unstable objects it also ensures that the same moment and shape are captured in all the photos but it is not that significant examined plates are stiff and immobilised real dimensions of the measured object need to be captured to achieve this scale bars or referencing markers are usually used in our case however it was not advised because surface topology was the essential part of capturing placing a scale bar or a marker on the object would alter or overlay its surface placing markers beyond the object was not an option because the entire background was masked out later required by the sliding method of acquiring successive image series to overcome these obstacles markers crosses were drawn directly on the surface of the plates using a felt tip pen fig 4 distances between the markers were measured in the real world and later introduced to the model during the post processing stage however not the most precise this approach allowed to capture the full original surface of the object because of space limitations and practical reasons the camera rig was immobilised and the plates were slided under the rig during image acquisition an image capture example is shown in fig 2 by the camera during the measurement steel reflexes were reduced by using potato flour since they have a negative impact on photogrammetric measurements results agisoft ll 2020 in the corners of the plate there are white cross markers the distance between the markers along the plate was measured and then used to scale the photogrammetric model the majority of image processing was executed in two software pieces agisoft metashape agisoft ll 2020 a commercial package for photogrammetry and rawtherapee the rawtherapee team 2020 an open source image editing software original images are taken in a nikon owned raw nef format agisoft photoscan requires prior conversion to jpg or tiff format with the latter lossless format preferred conversion from nef to tiff was performed using rawtherapee software it is important to note that the default neutral profile includes automatically applied lens correction based on the exif data default settings apply only basic radial barrel pincushion compensation agisoft photoscan manual states that any image manipulation is undesirable at this stage so it was decided to leave the photos originally distorted as in raw files each photo includes some part of a measured object and background partially static camera stand room partially not dark blanket since in each photograph the measured plate changes its position but the background also evolved contrasting blanket it was necessary to perform the walk around masking scenario and not the more specific turntable scenario which is possible in the case of a completely static background a relevant object area was selected in each photo and the rest masked out including out of focus object surfaces edges and background irrelevant in focus areas were identified mostly visually during the camera alignment phase relative positions of cameras are calculated and a sparse point cloud of the measured object is created fig 3 camera alignment was then optimised to ensure that these points overlap in respective projection planes we used high settings which means that full resolution photos have been used to perform camera alignment and build the initial sparse point cloud masked out areas were excluded from the process fig 3 shows the initial sparse point cloud and estimated positions of cameras after performing the camera alignment step in the back yellow lines represent camera to camera distances each set of 4 photos was taken in a different position and time after the sparse cloud is created the dense cloud is built based on the aligned cameras projections this cloud requires some manual cleaning out of plane points artefacts choppy edges etc basing on the dense cloud a surface is created consisting of triangular mesh elements the aggressive depth filtering was chosen during the surface generation which means that a smooth continuous surface was desired the final step of photogrammetric reconstruction was texturing of the surface here we can choose between the mosaic mode only the sharpest photos representing given area are used for texturing or the average mode all photos covering a given area are used the average mode was selected because it provides precious information about consistency if some textured area appears blurred it means that it was reconstructed based on images of variable quality it may be an indicator of a potential problem with precision in this area this information is absent in the mosaic mode which selects only the best photographs for texturing in our study all the textures were consistently sharp which allowed us to identify their features without problems because using scale bars markers or reference points was not possible we decided to pre calibrate the camera rig using a chequerboard calibration plate as described earlier for each experimental setup an initial photogrammetric reconstruction of chequerboard was performed a coordinate system was set to align with the plate edges and a scaling factor was set to ensure the proper size of the model coordinates of a specific camera rig position were then exported these coordinates were planned to be used later in photogrammetric models of measured plates however it turned out to be unnecessary the distance between the white cross markers provided sufficient precision of global plate dimensions fig 4 shows the textured photogrammetric model with the white cross markers included and used as scale bars two scale bars along each long edge were used and the variance between them was computed it turned out to be negligible so no additional scaling methods were utilised the entire software processing time including image preparation masking manual work dense cloud generation export and resampling took about 1 h per specimen the computer used for this task was equipped with 32 gb ram intel i7 8700 3 2 ghz 6 core cpu and nvidia quadro p4000 8 gb ddr5 gpu 3 analysis of initial imperfections the geometrical model created in agisoft metashape can be exported whether as point cloud coordinates or an stl surface these models are usually not directly appropriate for fe analysis because of their excessive size and numerous inconsistencies it is possible to use a built in downsampling procedure to reduce the size of the model but the outcome also lacks quality an example result of such operation has been presented in fig 5 we can see that although the point cloud is visibly sparser the nodal lines are not aligned along the plate edges there are numerous discontinuities and shifts in the grid order fig 5 shows the built in agisoft metashape downsamples procedure at the same time the density of the point cloud is visibly reduced it can be seen that the node lines are not parallel to the plate edges and are partly non continuous this point cloud is not suitable for direct use as a fem mesh node set to overcome these obstacles an algorithm in matlab mathworks 2019 is used in creating organised nodal lines while representing global imperfections and preserving local imperfections of the measured plates automation was required since we had to prepare 14 geometrical models each in different mesh size variants for fe analysis for this purpose we started with importing the dense point cloud and getting rid of the edges which being boundary areas are the most prone for reconstruction error fig 6 the main plate and the stiffener are also separated at this stage and are processed individually in all subsequent steps because of the natural flaws of edges representation masking artefacts diffraction etc see fig 6 the point cloud was trimmed to enhance later automation of mesh generation each plate specimen had its principal axes of inertia computed and used to achieve optimal cutting planes orientation this approach allowed an automated preparation of data without manual supervision of the process afterwards the mesh grid lines were created and each point from a point cloud was assigned to a field isolated by the grid lines in each isolated field a centre of mass was calculated and a best fit plane was found based on the distribution of imported points fig 7 a normal vector of this plane represented the local tilt of a measured specimen in two directions as an effect each field of the mesh grid was equipped with a centre of mass elevation wise and a corresponding normal vector representing the distribution of the point cloud in this field a general plane equation 1 a x b y c z d 0 including a b c components of the normal vector is used eqn 1 can be simplified assuming that the component c of the normal vector is 1 this assumption can be made because the plane orientation is almost horizontal in all cases resulting in a nearly vertical normal vector the plane is only slightly tilted imperfections thus a and b components are small in comparison to c only the vertical z axis component of a node to plane distance is taken into consideration this way but it leads to a relatively small error while linearising the problem at the same time finally the plane equation is represented as 2 a x b y d z and the a b d components can be found using the relation 3 x 0 y 0 1 x 1 y 1 1 x n a b d z 0 z 1 z n where n is the total number of points in a given isolated field and x y z are the respective coordinates of these points the final normal vector can be obtained by normalisation of the a b 1 vector so that the earlier assumption of c 1 is neglected a normal vector s magnitude needs to be 1 a normal vector of a plane is found in a single step which satisfies the condition that the vertical z component of total node to plane distance is minimised fig 7 shows the method used in computing normal vectors of isolated areas groups of points isolated by grid lines from the point cloud and elevations of corner nodes based on the centre normal pairs coordinates of the corner nodes positioned along the grid lines can be calculated since most target mesh nodes except for the plate edges are common for the four neighbouring element corners their elevations are averaged from all the neighbours fig 8 this way it is possible to preserve a smooth continuous character of the surface while including the originally measured imperfect features of the specimen as a final result of the procedure a well organised node set is created closely representing the measured plate dimensions in our case two separate meshes are generated one for the main plate the other one for the stiffener they are tied together in the central axis an example of such a process has been presented in fig 9 the measured imperfections two opposite bulges are easily noticeable based on the measurements one can indicate the common shape of initial plate imperfections where the stiffener imperfections are denoted as c 0 where the positive sign is in the b 1 and b 2 imperfections the shape is similar to the one presented in fig 10 the minus sign denotes that curvature of imperfection is the opposite the values for initial imperfections are presented in table 1 the shape of the initial imperfections is consistent with other literature examples garbatov et al 2016 one can notice that when the plate is thicker the general sideways imperfections are bigger a 1 a 2 whereas the local plate imperfections are tend to be smaller b 1 b 2 similarly the stiffener imperfections are smaller with the increase of plate thickness in the case of 5 mm and 6 mm plates the local plate imperfections are of the opposite signs in both sides of the stiffener in the case of 8 mm plate the plate imperfections are of the same sign it is also notable that although the welding conditions were the same for each thickness of stiffened plates the imperfections are subjected to considerable scatter however a trend of mean values evolution along the changes in thickness is sustained leading to the conclusion that the measurements reflect the general condition of the plates the typical shapes of initial imperfections for different thicknesses of stiffened plates are presented in fig 11 one can notice that with the increase of the plate thickness the global imperfections are more dominant whereas the local imperfections are less significant 4 fe analysis commercial software ansys 2019 is used to generate finite element models the non linear static solver employing the arc length method is used to obtain the load carrying capacity of any particular studied case the four node shell181 elements are used to model both plate and stiffener there are two types of nonlinearities considered here material nonlinearity material is considered a bilinear one and geometric nonlinearity large deformations the boundary conditions are modelled as fixed ones on the shorter edges and free on the longer edges see fig 12 the stiffened plates are subjected to a displacement driven load to obtain the force displacement curve for each case and resulting in the ultimate strength the initial imperfections are based on the photogrammetry measurements and there are implemented by changing the z coordinate of each finite element node to obtain the best possible results the mesh convergence study has been performed the studied mesh sizes were in the range from 0 01 m up to 0 04 m it has been determined that the mesh size of 0 02 m lead to an accurate value of ultimate strength and providing relatively low computational time the mechanical properties are based on the tensile testing of the coupon specimens the mean values for each thickness are presented in table 2 the material model is considered as bilinear with hardening 5 results the post collapse shapes of 5 mm specimens are presented in fig 13 in all cases the post collapse is caused by local plate buckling followed by stiffener tripping nevertheless the post collapse shapes differ between each specimen resulting from differences in initial imperfections distributions the cross section position which is subjected to the highest plastic deformations varies between specimens in the case of specimen 5 2 it is even very close to the support this indicates that the imperfections are different in terms of the maximum values as presented in table 1 and has different distributions along with the specimens the differences in force displacement curves between specimens are noted too see fig 14 especially in the post collapse behaviour the ultimate force varies between 399 8 kn for 5 1 specimens up to 403 9 kn for 5 2 specimens so the impact of differences in imperfections on that value is not significant about 1 of difference the initial inclinations of the force displacement curves are different and the specimen with the highest value of local imperfections b 1 b 2 shows the lowest rigidity in opposite the most rigid is specimen 5 4 which has the lowest initial local imperfections further for a specimen of the highest initial imperfections the displacement where maximum force is reached is higher than other specimens additionally for that case the collapse is not so rapid leading to more smooth force displacement curve in the region of maximum compressive force in all cases there is no explicitly visible bifurcation point where initial buckling occurred the post collapse shapes for 6 mm specimens are presented in fig 15 the failure mode is plate buckling followed by stiffener tripping similarly to 5 mm specimens the post collapse shapes differ between each other in each case the position where maximum deflections after the collapse occurred is different additionally in the case of 6 2 specimens the plate collapsed very near the support leading to different shape of the collapsed plate and stiffener in the case of force displacement curves for 6 mm specimens see fig 16 the differences can also be visible the ultimate force is between 535 9 kn and 538 5 kn the specimen with the lowest local imperfections 6 4 has the biggest rigidity in the beginning and curve deviate concerning other ones however in this case the deviations are smaller with compared to 5 mm plates in the case of post collapse behaviour only 6 2 specimen deviates from others this is connected with different post collapse shape observed for this specimen concerning others as shown in fig 15 it could be concluded that these deviations are originated from different initial imperfections distributions in the specimens although the maximum values are rather similar similarly to 5 mm specimens the explicit bifurcation point cannot be traced the post collapse forms of 8 mm specimens are presented in fig 17 based on the stress distributions it could be noticed that in this case the failure mode was a combination of local plate buckling and global column buckling in that case the post collapse shapes are not differing much between the specimens in all cases the maximum plastic deflections occurred very close to the middle cross section the force displacement curves for 8 mm specimens are presented in fig 18 similarly to post collapse shapes the force displacement curves are not deviating between specimens much however in that case the bifurcation point is observed and some deviations in that region could be observed the most explicitly visible for 8 2 specimens is the lowest local initial imperfections only 0 25 mm and 0 11 mm it is known that when imperfections are lower the buckling behaviour is more rapid and the bifurcation point is explicitly visible in general the differences in initial imperfections has a low impact on the value of the ultimate force in the case of post collapse shape the differences are noted for thinner plates 5 mm 6 mm whereas for thicker plates the shapes are very similar the similar observation could be noted by comparison of force displacement curves the differences in places of maximum plastic deformations between the specimens indicate that the imperfections vary in terms of maximum value and the distributions along with the specimen in case of 5 mm and 6 mm specimens the initial local imperfections with opposite signs of both side of stiffener lead to collapse without clearly visible bifurcation point since the collapsed form was similar to the initial shape of specimens in the case of thinner 5 6 mm plates both the deflection and the stress distribution have more of a local concentrated character changes in deformation and stress are rapid and dramatic thicker plates manage to resist deplanation using its full length and width the stress distribution is much milder and the areas near supports are also affected this phenomenon is not noticeable using artificially generated imperfections which is discussed later in the text the support area is nearly untouched by stress which is concentrated mostly in the middle part of the plate regardless of its thickness 6 comparison with other initial imperfections modelling techniques when the initial imperfections are not known one needs to assume their value and shape based on the study of smith 1975 the initial imperfections of the stiffened plate can be modelled as presented in fig 19 where the imperfections are the superposition of global distortions in longitudinal direction modelled as a half sin wave with c 0 level and local plate distortions with the level of δ 0 and modelled as a half sin wave in both longitudinal and transverse direction the level of initial imperfections can be calculated based on the plate slenderness ratio β 4 β b t r e 0 5 where e is the elastic modulus r is the yield stress b is the plate breadth and t is the plate thickness the maximum value of plate imperfections can be calculated as follows 5 δ o t 0 1 β 2 the longitudinal imperfection of the stiffened plate c 0 l is as well as stiffener imperfections can be considered equal to 6 c 0 l 0 0015 using the following model the specimens with three different thicknesses are analysed leading to post collapse shapes as presented in fig 20 from the beginning one can notice that in the case of the assumed shape of initial imperfections the collapsed form is symmetrical with regards to middle cross section and maximum deflections occur in that place in case of plates with real imperfections the usually non symmetrical collapse was observed due to unsymmetrical distribution of initial imperfections in case of failure modes for plates with the assumed shape of imperfections a local plate buckling is followed by stiffener tripping in the case of plates with real imperfections the similar modes are observed in 5 mm and 6 mm plates however for 8 mm plate the failure mode is rather the combination of local plate buckling and global column buckling this could also be noticed when looking at stress distributions in the case of 8 mm plate with real imperfections both compressive and tensile zone are quite extended along the plate length see fig 20 and in case of smith approach these zones are localised in the middle of the specimen rather limited extension due to the differences in the yield stresses due to different plate thicknesses the normalised stress mean strain curves are introduced instead of force displacement curves the stress is divided by material yield stress on the vertical axis whereas on the horizontal axis the longitudinal displacement divided by plate length is presented the comparison between mean response for stiffened plates with real measured imperfections and following the smith approach is presented in fig 21 it could be noticed that the differences are quite significant in the case of 5 mm and 6 mm plates firstly in both cases the explicit bifurcation point is noted for plates with artificial imperfections which could not be traced for plates with the measured imperfections in the case of the measured imperfections the collapsed shape was closer to the initial shape of the specimens thus the buckling was not so dramatic additionally the initial inclination of the stress strain curve is significantly higher for the first case further the point of the ultimate capacity is reached with smaller strain in plates analysed with artificial imperfections and collapse is more rapid in plates with real imperfections the region of maximum stress is quite wide and collapse is less rapid with regards to the 8 mm plate both curves are rather similar the initial inclinations are almost the same leading to bifurcation point which occurs for slightly higher stress in case of artificial imperfections the ultimate point cover in both curves and post collapse behaviours are rather the same finally the values of normalised ultimate stress are compared in table 3 it could be observed that there are no notable differences between ultimate stress values in the case of 5 mm plate the capacity is slightly higher in real imperfections whereas for 6 mm and 8 mm plates it is the opposite 7 conclusions the approach presented in this work for imperfect structural modelling employed a photogrammetry image based technique and fe non linear analysis the tool revealed to be swift and easily applicable due to its multiple assets firstly the methodology avoids using the special markers and image based point cloud resampling is performed with the specially developed code thus it can be easily applied to analyse the strength behaviour of an existing structure especially when harsh in situ conditions exist secondly the proposed approach shows that the initial imperfections measurement via photogrammetry technique is very efficient in further processing as input for the fe analysis however it should be noted that this approach can not be used to accurately compare two measured states e g initial and deformed since physical markers are lacking and identification of individual points nodes is hindered displacement and strain fields are not to be captured this way markerless approach with automatic mesh generation is well suited for and excels in acquiring accurate geometry for further fe analysis one large advantage of this method is scale independence it can be applied to an object of any size however the object and the scene require some preparation in large reflecting surfaces such as ship hulls chalk paint can be used to obtain a matte finish this approach has been already tested with success by the authors in another yet unpublished study it has been observed that apart the identical welding parameters were provided for each specimen the imperfections varied between each other leading to differences in both post collapse shapes and force displacement responses the differences are more significant in the thinner plate this could be related to the increasing plate slenderness ratio and for higher values of that parameter the structural behaviour is more sensitive with regards to the initial imperfections level employing the real imperfections bring more variance to the deformation and stress distribution of different plate thickness although the ultimate force is hardly affected the qualitative difference is easily noticeable to the eye however using different welding parameters the differences in load carrying capacity could be significantly higher too comparing the proposed approach with the commonly used methodology of a priorly assumed shape and level of initial imperfections revealed some differences primary the assumed shape of imperfections led to a symmetrical post collapse shape of each specimen which has not been observed for real imperfections due to uneven distribution in the case of the smith approach the buckling has been more dramatic and explicit bifurcation point has been noted and post collapse behaviour has been more rapid the presented numerical approach with the application of measured initial imperfections has also been validated against experiment in woloszyk et al 2020 showing a good convergence in terms of both values of ultimate strength and the post collapse behaviour of the specimens the developed approach is highly recommended to assess the residual structural capacity of ageing structures and that subjected grounding and collision where the real deflections can be measured and analysed employing the developed approach based on the assessed maximum capacity of the structure an acceptable level of the structural imperfection for any specific structural component and environment of operation may be derived this cost effective measurement and processing method can also be used to assess the geometrical accuracy of manufactured objects against their design such as plane plate control in the shipyard the proposed methodology could also be utilised in the so called reverse engineering such as the renovation of historical boats credit authorship contribution statement krzysztof woloszyk conceptualization experimental analysis formal analysis writing

controlled grid size using a specially developed algorithm the geometry of a stiﬀened plate with measured initial imperfections is then transferred to a ﬁnite element model and analysed the ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates considering different imperfections modelling techniques is conducted the results are compared with the one obtained for measured imperfections and several conclusions are derived the proposed methodology revealed to be cost effective and can be applied in various branches of shipbuilding and ocean engineering keywords photogrammetry stiffened plate ultimate strength fem imperfections 1 introduction the steel structures are welded which induces initial distortions and residual stresses in stiffened panels affecting the structural behaviour and capacity the welding induced phenomena are complex and difficult to estimate during the design process the effects of both residual stresses and distortions cause a reduction in load carrying capacity of stiffened plates near the collapse load smoothing the load shortening curve in the relevant region gordo and guedes soares 1993 one of the first attempts to investigate the welding induced distortion and residual stresses was conducted in dow and smith 1984 who studied buckling and post buckling behaviour of rectangular steel plates under compressive loads and concluded that the localised imperfection amplitude is one of the most important factors affecting the load carrying capacity some other early studies related to this topic may be found in smith et al 1988 ueda and yao 1985 where the impact of initial distortions into the strength of plate elements has been studied it was found that when the level of imperfections is significant the strength of plates under uniaxial loads can be significantly reduced the reduction was observed for plates with different levels of slenderness the investigations of the impact of the initial imperfections into the ultimate capacity of other structural components were also carried out including stiffened plates yu et al 2019 and panels özgüç et al 2007 pedram and khedmati 2014 and the conclusions were similar however due to the existence of stiffeners the reduction in the load carrying capacity was not significant compared to plates only some simplified methods for incorporating the initial imperfections influence in the ultimate strength predictions were proposed other experimental and numerical studies related to that problem may be found in chen and soares 2016 manco et al 2019 nowadays the most commonly used method to predict the behaviour of thin walled structures under compressive load is the non linear finite element method however some closed form solutions are useful too there are various methods to take into account the initial imperfections the first one is the implicit one thus some imperfections are taken into account during formula development using rules and norms such as the ultimate strength approach as stipulated by the common structural rules international association of classification societies 2018 the second method is to perform the linear buckling analysis firstly and the shape of the first mode is to be used for the further non linear calculation the third method is applying some priorly assumed shape and level of the initial imperfections directly to the fe model in the plates and stiffened plates the commonly used method here is the smith method smith 1975 finally one can measure the actual value and shape of the initial imperfections of any particular structural element employing various methods the measurement of the initial imperfections is the essential work that needs to be done when evaluating the ultimate strength of different structural members experimentally furtherly there need to be applied to the fe model although photogrammetry originates mostly from the geodetic applications founding a firm place in archaeological paleontological and antique techniques in terms of the latter an extraordinary precision is required to preserve details for archiving or recovery purposes lo brutto and spera 2012 carried out a curious study measuring a historic statue using two sister methods photogrammetry ibm image based and laser scanning rbm range based the study found that both methods produce similar detail and precision with minor strengths and weaknesses over each other in several parts of the statue it should be noted that not all cameras are appropriate for performing photogrammetry measurements although it does not have to be a professional kit at least a decent consumer grade dslr camera should be used still a photogrammetric hardware kit is significantly cheaper than a laser scanner suitable for scanning large objects it was shown in hellmuth et al 2020 that even popular smartphone cameras have some success in measuring complex geometries although limited by their insufficient optical capabilities photogrammetry is not limited to large scale objects it copes well with small targets and if executed properly it can be even used for nano scale metrology in the study performed in gontard et al 2016 a standard turntable image sequence is used to capture images of a single particle employing electron microscopy the study transitions from multiple sem images to a volume model and then to its 3d print representation in human scale it is interesting to note that even though only recently such operations became technically accessible the idea to reconstruct the 3d geometry from microscopic images is nearly as long standing as digital imagery itself as can be shown in crowther et al 1970 where the term photogrammetry is not even used or piazzesi 1973 mathematical formulation in garbatov et al 2014 the photogrammetry has been employed to scan the corroded surface of small scale fatigue specimens koelman 2010 employed the photogrammetry to capture complete ship hulls for further analysis it was noted that from an industrial point of view the method was fairly simple and adequate while exhibiting numerous advantages over alternative methods inclusion of texture in the measured material in addition to the standard geometry point cloud was proven to be a major asset allowing human aided recognition of ship parts a feature absent in akin laser scanning method the other advantage is scale independence of the photogrammetry since capturing a larger object requires just taking more images or different scale images reaching for photogrammetry to measure initial imperfections of a modelled structure has been known for some time it has been performed e g in chen et al 2011 where a structure was first measured then modelled and both experimentally and numerically tested the procedure included tedious marker placement and recognition designed to recreate structure deformation marker placement is one of the core photogrammetry features although it is not always necessary in this study we opted for markerless measurement to ensure that the original object surface is captured in many applications however markers cannot be avoided the most obvious purpose of using markers is model scaling but there are others it applies especially to the tasks where several measurements of a single object are made over time and they are later compared to compute the deformation of the object whether it is an evolution of the terrain surface in aerial photography with large markers hastaoğlu et al 2019 displacements of a composite tank goda et al 2019 or a strain field in a loaded steel plate li et al 2014 a set of markers coded or not is required to identify individual points in two compared models and compute the displacement field nonetheless these are advanced techniques which bring photogrammetry close to dic digital image correlation systems in terms of automatic marker or pattern recognition and correlation generic photogrammetry often relies on surface measurement alone such as in barbero garcía et al 2017 in a medical application skull shape assessment even in this case it was later supplemented with markers barbero garcía et al 2020 to track shape changes over time in the future in 3d geometry reconstruction tasks a 3d surface model is usually sought as a final result however both the photogrammetry and the laser scanning produce unhampered 3d point clouds which in principle do not form any specific surfaces surface generation is one of the geometry processing steps generic point clouds often include varying density and quality areas resulting in uneven point distribution out of plane points and artefacts it was noticed in armesto et al 2009 who decided to manually mark characteristic points in a measured truss construction and used only these selected points as a wireframe geometry base for subsequent fe analysis pre processing of point cloud with a resultant surface in mind is a tedious task and algorithms supporting this process are still an open question efforts have been made to create universal tools for this task such as edge aware algorithm huang et al 2013 or resampling method based on advanced mathematical tools chen et al 2018 in this study we also propose a numerical procedure which while simple is specially designed for our measurement interests and works well for this case it can be noticed that although the photogrammetry measurements were carried out for stiffened plates there were rarely applied to the fe model to investigate the structural behaviour additionally the presented approach is compared with the method that takes into account the assumed shape of initial imperfections which is a commonly used methodology when considering numerical analysis 2 photogrammetry measurements the analysed plates were of 1 265 m length breadth 0 4 m with the flat bar stiffener of 0 1 m height they were made from normal strength steel the plates with stiffeners are with three different thicknesses 5 mm 6 mm and 8 mm for each thickness the four specimens were fabricated with the identical welding parameters the specimens have been welded automatically with the identical parameters of the welding process which were monitored during welding a special experimental setup was prepared to perform the measurements of imperfections four cameras were attached to a frame which was placed over a heavy steel table the table was covered with a dark blanket and a measured specimen was lying on that blanket during the measurement a series of four images were taken simultaneously using a remote shutter then the plate was slided to a next position together with the blanket and photos were taken the process was repeated until the whole plate surface was captured in the images the experimental rig was presented in fig 1 the approximate camera to object distance was 60 cm while camera to camera distances were 32 cm for side pairs 1 2 and 3 4 and 48 cm for the middle 2 3 pair the 1 and 4 cameras were pointed at the stiffener while 2 and 3 cameras focused on the main plate surface the change in position between subsequent slides was small enough to ensure a 50 overlap in neighbouring images the four cameras used for the measurement were nikon d3300 equipped with nikon af s dx vr nikkor 18 55 mm f 3 5 5 6g ii interchangeable lenses nikon d3300 is a digital 24 mpx camera capable of capturing 6000 4000 px images all the images were taken with iso sensitivity set to 100 lowest possible on the used cameras 18 mm focal length and f 3 5 aperture aperture priority settings with neutral exposure compensation were used shutter speed varied slightly between shots depending on the light distribution and camera location however it mostly revolved around 1 20s and rarely exceeded 1 10s the aperture chosen was rather on the broadside however we decided to use it because of a poor lighting conditions and lack of separate external lights possible reflexes and b mostly perpendicular orientation of the measured surfaces concerning the lens optical axis admittedly a narrower aperture and longer exposure time could have been used to improve the subsequent post processing of the point cloud all cameras were equipped with remote control shutters which allowed the contactless and simultaneous acquisition of images these traits are important for proper photogrammetry remote control eliminates unwanted vibrations of the camera rig caused by manual operation even when the timer is utilised while simultaneity speeds up the process by capturing a whole series at once instead of manipulating each camera separately in the case of more unstable objects it also ensures that the same moment and shape are captured in all the photos but it is not that significant examined plates are stiff and immobilised real dimensions of the measured object need to be captured to achieve this scale bars or referencing markers are usually used in our case however it was not advised because surface topology was the essential part of capturing placing a scale bar or a marker on the object would alter or overlay its surface placing markers beyond the object was not an option because the entire background was masked out later required by the sliding method of acquiring successive image series to overcome these obstacles markers crosses were drawn directly on the surface of the plates using a felt tip pen fig 4 distances between the markers were measured in the real world and later introduced to the model during the post processing stage however not the most precise this approach allowed to capture the full original surface of the object because of space limitations and practical reasons the camera rig was immobilised and the plates were slided under the rig during image acquisition an image capture example is shown in fig 2 by the camera during the measurement steel reflexes were reduced by using potato flour since they have a negative impact on photogrammetric measurements results agisoft ll 2020 in the corners of the plate there are white cross markers the distance between the markers along the plate was measured and then used to scale the photogrammetric model the majority of image processing was executed in two software pieces agisoft metashape agisoft ll 2020 a commercial package for photogrammetry and rawtherapee the rawtherapee team 2020 an open source image editing software original images are taken in a nikon owned raw nef format agisoft photoscan requires prior conversion to jpg or tiff format with the latter lossless format preferred conversion from nef to tiff was performed using rawtherapee software it is important to note that the default neutral profile includes automatically applied lens correction based on the exif data default settings apply only basic radial barrel pincushion compensation agisoft photoscan manual states that any image manipulation is undesirable at this stage so it was decided to leave the photos originally distorted as in raw files each photo includes some part of a measured object and background partially static camera stand room partially not dark blanket since in each photograph the measured plate changes its position but the background also evolved contrasting blanket it was necessary to perform the walk around masking scenario and not the more specific turntable scenario which is possible in the case of a completely static background a relevant object area was selected in each photo and the rest masked out including out of focus object surfaces edges and background irrelevant in focus areas were identified mostly visually during the camera alignment phase relative positions of cameras are calculated and a sparse point cloud of the measured object is created fig 3 camera alignment was then optimised to ensure that these points overlap in respective projection planes we used high settings which means that full resolution photos have been used to perform camera alignment and build the initial sparse point cloud masked out areas were excluded from the process fig 3 shows the initial sparse point cloud and estimated positions of cameras after performing the camera alignment step in the back yellow lines represent camera to camera distances each set of 4 photos was taken in a different position and time after the sparse cloud is created the dense cloud is built based on the aligned cameras projections this cloud requires some manual cleaning out of plane points artefacts choppy edges etc basing on the dense cloud a surface is created consisting of triangular mesh elements the aggressive depth filtering was chosen during the surface generation which means that a smooth continuous surface was desired the final step of photogrammetric reconstruction was texturing of the surface here we can choose between the mosaic mode only the sharpest photos representing given area are used for texturing or the average mode all photos covering a given area are used the average mode was selected because it provides precious information about consistency if some textured area appears blurred it means that it was reconstructed based on images of variable quality it may be an indicator of a potential problem with precision in this area this information is absent in the mosaic mode which selects only the best photographs for texturing in our study all the textures were consistently sharp which allowed us to identify their features without problems because using scale bars markers or reference points was not possible we decided to pre calibrate the camera rig using a chequerboard calibration plate as described earlier for each experimental setup an initial photogrammetric reconstruction of chequerboard was performed a coordinate system was set to align with the plate edges and a scaling factor was set to ensure the proper size of the model coordinates of a specific camera rig position were then exported these coordinates were planned to be used later in photogrammetric models of measured plates however it turned out to be unnecessary the distance between the white cross markers provided sufficient precision of global plate dimensions fig 4 shows the textured photogrammetric model with the white cross markers included and used as scale bars two scale bars along each long edge were used and the variance between them was computed it turned out to be negligible so no additional scaling methods were utilised the entire software processing time including image preparation masking manual work dense cloud generation export and resampling took about 1 h per specimen the computer used for this task was equipped with 32 gb ram intel i7 8700 3 2 ghz 6 core cpu and nvidia quadro p4000 8 gb ddr5 gpu 3 analysis of initial imperfections the geometrical model created in agisoft metashape can be exported whether as point cloud coordinates or an stl surface these models are usually not directly appropriate for fe analysis because of their excessive size and numerous inconsistencies it is possible to use a built in downsampling procedure to reduce the size of the model but the outcome also lacks quality an example result of such operation has been presented in fig 5 we can see that although the point cloud is visibly sparser the nodal lines are not aligned along the plate edges there are numerous discontinuities and shifts in the grid order fig 5 shows the built in agisoft metashape downsamples procedure at the same time the density of the point cloud is visibly reduced it can be seen that the node lines are not parallel to the plate edges and are partly non continuous this point cloud is not suitable for direct use as a fem mesh node set to overcome these obstacles an algorithm in matlab mathworks 2019 is used in creating organised nodal lines while representing global imperfections and preserving local imperfections of the measured plates automation was required since we had to prepare 14 geometrical models each in different mesh size variants for fe analysis for this purpose we started with importing the dense point cloud and getting rid of the edges which being boundary areas are the most prone for reconstruction error fig 6 the main plate and the stiffener are also separated at this stage and are processed individually in all subsequent steps because of the natural flaws of edges representation masking artefacts diffraction etc see fig 6 the point cloud was trimmed to enhance later automation of mesh generation each plate specimen had its principal axes of inertia computed and used to achieve optimal cutting planes orientation this approach allowed an automated preparation of data without manual supervision of the process afterwards the mesh grid lines were created and each point from a point cloud was assigned to a field isolated by the grid lines in each isolated field a centre of mass was calculated and a best fit plane was found based on the distribution of imported points fig 7 a normal vector of this plane represented the local tilt of a measured specimen in two directions as an effect each field of the mesh grid was equipped with a centre of mass elevation wise and a corresponding normal vector representing the distribution of the point cloud in this field a general plane equation 1 a x b y c z d 0 including a b c components of the normal vector is used eqn 1 can be simplified assuming that the component c of the normal vector is 1 this assumption can be made because the plane orientation is almost horizontal in all cases resulting in a nearly vertical normal vector the plane is only slightly tilted imperfections thus a and b components are small in comparison to c only the vertical z axis component of a node to plane distance is taken into consideration this way but it leads to a relatively small error while linearising the problem at the same time finally the plane equation is represented as 2 a x b y d z and the a b d components can be found using the relation 3 x 0 y 0 1 x 1 y 1 1 x n a b d z 0 z 1 z n where n is the total number of points in a given isolated field and x y z are the respective coordinates of these points the final normal vector can be obtained by normalisation of the a b 1 vector so that the earlier assumption of c 1 is neglected a normal vector s magnitude needs to be 1 a normal vector of a plane is found in a single step which satisfies the condition that the vertical z component of total node to plane distance is minimised fig 7 shows the method used in computing normal vectors of isolated areas groups of points isolated by grid lines from the point cloud and elevations of corner nodes based on the centre normal pairs coordinates of the corner nodes positioned along the grid lines can be calculated since most target mesh nodes except for the plate edges are common for the four neighbouring element corners their elevations are averaged from all the neighbours fig 8 this way it is possible to preserve a smooth continuous character of the surface while including the originally measured imperfect features of the specimen as a final result of the procedure a well organised node set is created closely representing the measured plate dimensions in our case two separate meshes are generated one for the main plate the other one for the stiffener they are tied together in the central axis an example of such a process has been presented in fig 9 the measured imperfections two opposite bulges are easily noticeable based on the measurements one can indicate the common shape of initial plate imperfections where the stiffener imperfections are denoted as c 0 where the positive sign is in the b 1 and b 2 imperfections the shape is similar to the one presented in fig 10 the minus sign denotes that curvature of imperfection is the opposite the values for initial imperfections are presented in table 1 the shape of the initial imperfections is consistent with other literature examples garbatov et al 2016 one can notice that when the plate is thicker the general sideways imperfections are bigger a 1 a 2 whereas the local plate imperfections are tend to be smaller b 1 b 2 similarly the stiffener imperfections are smaller with the increase of plate thickness in the case of 5 mm and 6 mm plates the local plate imperfections are of the opposite signs in both sides of the stiffener in the case of 8 mm plate the plate imperfections are of the same sign it is also notable that although the welding conditions were the same for each thickness of stiffened plates the imperfections are subjected to considerable scatter however a trend of mean values evolution along the changes in thickness is sustained leading to the conclusion that the measurements reflect the general condition of the plates the typical shapes of initial imperfections for different thicknesses of stiffened plates are presented in fig 11 one can notice that with the increase of the plate thickness the global imperfections are more dominant whereas the local imperfections are less significant 4 fe analysis commercial software ansys 2019 is used to generate finite element models the non linear static solver employing the arc length method is used to obtain the load carrying capacity of any particular studied case the four node shell181 elements are used to model both plate and stiffener there are two types of nonlinearities considered here material nonlinearity material is considered a bilinear one and geometric nonlinearity large deformations the boundary conditions are modelled as fixed ones on the shorter edges and free on the longer edges see fig 12 the stiffened plates are subjected to a displacement driven load to obtain the force displacement curve for each case and resulting in the ultimate strength the initial imperfections are based on the photogrammetry measurements and there are implemented by changing the z coordinate of each finite element node to obtain the best possible results the mesh convergence study has been performed the studied mesh sizes were in the range from 0 01 m up to 0 04 m it has been determined that the mesh size of 0 02 m lead to an accurate value of ultimate strength and providing relatively low computational time the mechanical properties are based on the tensile testing of the coupon specimens the mean values for each thickness are presented in table 2 the material model is considered as bilinear with hardening 5 results the post collapse shapes of 5 mm specimens are presented in fig 13 in all cases the post collapse is caused by local plate buckling followed by stiffener tripping nevertheless the post collapse shapes differ between each specimen resulting from differences in initial imperfections distributions the cross section position which is subjected to the highest plastic deformations varies between specimens in the case of specimen 5 2 it is even very close to the support this indicates that the imperfections are different in terms of the maximum values as presented in table 1 and has different distributions along with the specimens the differences in force displacement curves between specimens are noted too see fig 14 especially in the post collapse behaviour the ultimate force varies between 399 8 kn for 5 1 specimens up to 403 9 kn for 5 2 specimens so the impact of differences in imperfections on that value is not significant about 1 of difference the initial inclinations of the force displacement curves are different and the specimen with the highest value of local imperfections b 1 b 2 shows the lowest rigidity in opposite the most rigid is specimen 5 4 which has the lowest initial local imperfections further for a specimen of the highest initial imperfections the displacement where maximum force is reached is higher than other specimens additionally for that case the collapse is not so rapid leading to more smooth force displacement curve in the region of maximum compressive force in all cases there is no explicitly visible bifurcation point where initial buckling occurred the post collapse shapes for 6 mm specimens are presented in fig 15 the failure mode is plate buckling followed by stiffener tripping similarly to 5 mm specimens the post collapse shapes differ between each other in each case the position where maximum deflections after the collapse occurred is different additionally in the case of 6 2 specimens the plate collapsed very near the support leading to different shape of the collapsed plate and stiffener in the case of force displacement curves for 6 mm specimens see fig 16 the differences can also be visible the ultimate force is between 535 9 kn and 538 5 kn the specimen with the lowest local imperfections 6 4 has the biggest rigidity in the beginning and curve deviate concerning other ones however in this case the deviations are smaller with compared to 5 mm plates in the case of post collapse behaviour only 6 2 specimen deviates from others this is connected with different post collapse shape observed for this specimen concerning others as shown in fig 15 it could be concluded that these deviations are originated from different initial imperfections distributions in the specimens although the maximum values are rather similar similarly to 5 mm specimens the explicit bifurcation point cannot be traced the post collapse forms of 8 mm specimens are presented in fig 17 based on the stress distributions it could be noticed that in this case the failure mode was a combination of local plate buckling and global column buckling in that case the post collapse shapes are not differing much between the specimens in all cases the maximum plastic deflections occurred very close to the middle cross section the force displacement curves for 8 mm specimens are presented in fig 18 similarly to post collapse shapes the force displacement curves are not deviating between specimens much however in that case the bifurcation point is observed and some deviations in that region could be observed the most explicitly visible for 8 2 specimens is the lowest local initial imperfections only 0 25 mm and 0 11 mm it is known that when imperfections are lower the buckling behaviour is more rapid and the bifurcation point is explicitly visible in general the differences in initial imperfections has a low impact on the value of the ultimate force in the case of post collapse shape the differences are noted for thinner plates 5 mm 6 mm whereas for thicker plates the shapes are very similar the similar observation could be noted by comparison of force displacement curves the differences in places of maximum plastic deformations between the specimens indicate that the imperfections vary in terms of maximum value and the distributions along with the specimen in case of 5 mm and 6 mm specimens the initial local imperfections with opposite signs of both side of stiffener lead to collapse without clearly visible bifurcation point since the collapsed form was similar to the initial shape of specimens in the case of thinner 5 6 mm plates both the deflection and the stress distribution have more of a local concentrated character changes in deformation and stress are rapid and dramatic thicker plates manage to resist deplanation using its full length and width the stress distribution is much milder and the areas near supports are also affected this phenomenon is not noticeable using artificially generated imperfections which is discussed later in the text the support area is nearly untouched by stress which is concentrated mostly in the middle part of the plate regardless of its thickness 6 comparison with other initial imperfections modelling techniques when the initial imperfections are not known one needs to assume their value and shape based on the study of smith 1975 the initial imperfections of the stiffened plate can be modelled as presented in fig 19 where the imperfections are the superposition of global distortions in longitudinal direction modelled as a half sin wave with c 0 level and local plate distortions with the level of δ 0 and modelled as a half sin wave in both longitudinal and transverse direction the level of initial imperfections can be calculated based on the plate slenderness ratio β 4 β b t r e 0 5 where e is the elastic modulus r is the yield stress b is the plate breadth and t is the plate thickness the maximum value of plate imperfections can be calculated as follows 5 δ o t 0 1 β 2 the longitudinal imperfection of the stiffened plate c 0 l is as well as stiffener imperfections can be considered equal to 6 c 0 l 0 0015 using the following model the specimens with three different thicknesses are analysed leading to post collapse shapes as presented in fig 20 from the beginning one can notice that in the case of the assumed shape of initial imperfections the collapsed form is symmetrical with regards to middle cross section and maximum deflections occur in that place in case of plates with real imperfections the usually non symmetrical collapse was observed due to unsymmetrical distribution of initial imperfections in case of failure modes for plates with the assumed shape of imperfections a local plate buckling is followed by stiffener tripping in the case of plates with real imperfections the similar modes are observed in 5 mm and 6 mm plates however for 8 mm plate the failure mode is rather the combination of local plate buckling and global column buckling this could also be noticed when looking at stress distributions in the case of 8 mm plate with real imperfections both compressive and tensile zone are quite extended along the plate length see fig 20 and in case of smith approach these zones are localised in the middle of the specimen rather limited extension due to the differences in the yield stresses due to different plate thicknesses the normalised stress mean strain curves are introduced instead of force displacement curves the stress is divided by material yield stress on the vertical axis whereas on the horizontal axis the longitudinal displacement divided by plate length is presented the comparison between mean response for stiffened plates with real measured imperfections and following the smith approach is presented in fig 21 it could be noticed that the differences are quite significant in the case of 5 mm and 6 mm plates firstly in both cases the explicit bifurcation point is noted for plates with artificial imperfections which could not be traced for plates with the measured imperfections in the case of the measured imperfections the collapsed shape was closer to the initial shape of the specimens thus the buckling was not so dramatic additionally the initial inclination of the stress strain curve is significantly higher for the first case further the point of the ultimate capacity is reached with smaller strain in plates analysed with artificial imperfections and collapse is more rapid in plates with real imperfections the region of maximum stress is quite wide and collapse is less rapid with regards to the 8 mm plate both curves are rather similar the initial inclinations are almost the same leading to bifurcation point which occurs for slightly higher stress in case of artificial imperfections the ultimate point cover in both curves and post collapse behaviours are rather the same finally the values of normalised ultimate stress are compared in table 3 it could be observed that there are no notable differences between ultimate stress values in the case of 5 mm plate the capacity is slightly higher in real imperfections whereas for 6 mm and 8 mm plates it is the opposite 7 conclusions the approach presented in this work for imperfect structural modelling employed a photogrammetry image based technique and fe non linear analysis the tool revealed to be swift and easily applicable due to its multiple assets firstly the methodology avoids using the special markers and image based point cloud resampling is performed with the specially developed code thus it can be easily applied to analyse the strength behaviour of an existing structure especially when harsh in situ conditions exist secondly the proposed approach shows that the initial imperfections measurement via photogrammetry technique is very efficient in further processing as input for the fe analysis however it should be noted that this approach can not be used to accurately compare two measured states e g initial and deformed since physical markers are lacking and identification of individual points nodes is hindered displacement and strain fields are not to be captured this way markerless approach with automatic mesh generation is well suited for and excels in acquiring accurate geometry for further fe analysis one large advantage of this method is scale independence it can be applied to an object of any size however the object and the scene require some preparation in large reflecting surfaces such as ship hulls chalk paint can be used to obtain a matte finish this approach has been already tested with success by the authors in another yet unpublished study it has been observed that apart the identical welding parameters were provided for each specimen the imperfections varied between each other leading to differences in both post collapse shapes and force displacement responses the differences are more significant in the thinner plate this could be related to the increasing plate slenderness ratio and for higher values of that parameter the structural behaviour is more sensitive with regards to the initial imperfections level employing the real imperfections bring more variance to the deformation and stress distribution of different plate thickness although the ultimate force is hardly affected the qualitative difference is easily noticeable to the eye however using different welding parameters the differences in load carrying capacity could be significantly higher too comparing the proposed approach with the commonly used methodology of a priorly assumed shape and level of initial imperfections revealed some differences primary the assumed shape of imperfections led to a symmetrical post collapse shape of each specimen which has not been observed for real imperfections due to uneven distribution in the case of the smith approach the buckling has been more dramatic and explicit bifurcation point has been noted and post collapse behaviour has been more rapid the presented numerical approach with the application of measured initial imperfections has also been validated against experiment in woloszyk et al 2020 showing a good convergence in terms of both values of ultimate strength and the post collapse behaviour of the specimens the developed approach is highly recommended to assess the residual structural capacity of ageing structures and that subjected grounding and collision where the real deflections can be measured and analysed employing the developed approach based on the assessed maximum capacity of the structure an acceptable level of the structural imperfection for any specific structural component and environment of operation may be derived this cost effective measurement and processing method can also be used to assess the geometrical accuracy of manufactured objects against their design such as plane plate control in the shipyard the proposed methodology could also be utilised in the so called reverse engineering such as the renovation of historical boats credit authorship contribution statement krzysztof woloszyk conceptualization experimental analysis formal analysis writing

21024,a numerical study of a semi circular twin hull section under heave oscillation is presented two different time domain simulation methods were used firstly a boundary element method based on potential theory which incorporates fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions by using a mixed eulerian lagrangian scheme secondly a finite volume method in combination with a volume of fluid scheme for capturing the free surface in order to evaluate the effects of viscosity simulations with the finite volume method were carried out using inviscid as well as viscous flow assumptions hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients were derived from first order fourier coefficients and validated against results from linear theory and experiments a detailed comparison of nonlinear results from both simulation methods was carried out in vicinity of the piston mode resonance frequency and a very good agreement was found the phase angles corresponding to the fourier coefficients varied strongly with frequency which went along with a phase shift of the fluid motion in the gap influence of viscosity on the flow was found to be present but had relatively low impact on the hydrodynamic forces keywords nonlinear wave radiation multi hull hydrodynamics helmholtz resonance wall effect mixed eulerian lagrangian volume of fluid 1 introduction many applications in the field of naval and ocean engineering are arranged in such a way that vertical gaps occur within a floating structure or between adjacent structures examples for such arrangements are multi hull ships moonpools side by side arrangement of vessels multi body offshore structures or ships in a terminal violent resonant fluid motion can occur within the gap of such an arrangement leading to heavy loads and potentially harming the safety of the operation different modes of resonance are possible depending on exciting frequency and gap size in particular for narrow gap sizes the so called piston mode resonance also known as helmholtz or pumping mode resonance has an pronounced effect on the hydrodynamic forces one of the earliest studies on that phenomena was conducted by ohkusu 1969 who considered a pair of circular cylinders that were forced to heave harmonically on the free surface experimental results for the radiated wave height at a certain distance to the cylinders were compared with results from linearised potential theory using an extension of the solution procedure by ursell 1949 a similar theoretical approach was used by wang and wahab 1971 who also carried out force measurements in a set of experiments using pairs of semi circular cylinders hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients were found to vary strongly close to resonance frequency with negative values for the added mass and damping coefficients close to zero most of past investigations utilised frequency domain methods based on potential theory with linearised free surface boundary conditions to analyse the flow phenomena in gaps a series of publications was devoted to the occurrence of so called trapped wave modes e g mciver 1996 and mciver et al 2003 for certain multi hull shapes no waves are radiated to infinity which affects existence and uniqueness of solutions to the linear frequency domain radiation problem molin 2001 developed a simplified formula for the piston mode frequency of rectangular cylinders by treating the fluid in the gap like a rigid body also for rectangular cylinders yeung and seah 2007 analysed free surface shapes and force coefficients at different resonant modes using a semi analytical approach a study by faltinsen et al 2007 showed that the free surface elevation from linear theory inside a 2d moonpool at piston mode resonance deviates significantly from experimental measurements the authors suspected that free surface nonlinearities were the main reason for these deviations porter and evans 2011 as well as mciver and porter 2016 established a wide spacing approximation to derive hydrodynamic coefficients of an arbitrary shaped cylinder next to a wall in terms of similar quantities for a single cylinder without a wall a mathematical analysis regarding the sign of the added mass coefficients of two dimensional floating bodies including twin hulls was conducted by mciver and mciver 2016 as indicated by faltinsen et al 2007 nonlinear free surface effects may have an important effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a twin hull a possible way to account for these effects in the scope of potential flow is to utilize a boundary element method bem with fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions and track the free surface in time domain using a mixed eulerian lagrangian mel scheme this method was applied to the radiation problem of twin cylinders with rectangular and triangular cross sections by maiti and sen 2001 significant influence of higher order force components were found especially for small water depth however the piston mode phenomenon was not explicitly examined kristiansen and faltinsen 2010 used a bem mel approach to examine the motion of a rectangular ship section in a terminal when excited by an incoming wave they implemented a vortex sheet tracking method to account for flow separation at the sharp edges of the body and found a significantly better agreement with experimental measurements compared to results without this technique li and zhang 2016 proposed an alternative way to determine the resonance frequency of a twin hull with a bem mel technique they simulated the gravity driven flow after an initial disturbance and evaluated dominant frequencies in the free surface elevation by means of a fourier transformation while potential flow based methods usually offer relatively low computational costs their main deficiency is that they rely on inviscid flow assumptions field based methods like the finite volume method fvm are able to solve the navier stokes equations in a given fluid domain and thus include effects of viscosity in the simulation in the context of piston mode resonance the most prominent effect of viscosity which has been identified by past researches is flow separation at the bilge keels for instance the work by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 indicates that for the heave radiation problem of a box shaped twin hull even linearised free surface conditions may be sufficiently accurate as long as it is accounted for the vortex shedding at the bodies edges based on a finite volume method fvm they propose a domain decomposition into a viscous regime around the edges and a potential flow domain everywhere else including the free surface in the gap another example is ananthakrishnan 2015 who simulated heave oscillations of a rectangular twin hull with a finite difference method fdm incorporating viscous as well as inviscid flow assumptions pronounced differences between the respective results were evident in case of piston mode resonance the influence of viscosity motivated researchers to introduce empirical damping terms in the free surface boundary conditions of potential flow methods to increase their applicability for 3d side by side offloading scenarios zhao et al 2018 the three previously mentioned publications focussed on box shaped twin hull sections which are characterised by vertical side walls and sharp corners at the bilge moradi et al 2015 studied different inlet configurations using a fvm with viscous flow assumptions they found that replacing the sharp corners with rounded ones lead to significant higher resonant wave heights in the gap due to a reduction of vortex generation at the inlet these findings rise the question if a potential flow based boundary element method can be a valid alternative to the fvm for the study of multi hull ships with well rounded hull forms when only little influence of flow separation is expected the heave radiation problem of circular or semi circular cylinder sections which has been studied previously by several authors e g ohkusu 1969 wang and wahab 1971 lee et al 1971 and nordenstrøm et al 1971 can be seen as a representation of such a case a recent numerical parameter study on this case was conducted by bonfiglio and brizzolara 2018 using a viscous flow solver based on the fvm they showed that the hydrodynamic coefficients as well as the wave elevation inside the gap at resonance depend nonlineary on the heave amplitude their results indicate that viscosity may have an important effect at very high heave amplitudes however no study was found so far that quantifies the influence of viscosity on the hydrodynamic forces and shows the effects on the free surface elevation in the gap this would be of particular interest at low to moderate motion amplitudes which mark a typical scope of application for seakeeping analyses of multi hull ships aim of the present study was to validate the bem mel approach for the case of a heaving semi circular twin hull section with a focus on piston mode resonance added mass and damping coefficients were compared to experimental results as well as results from linear theory by wang and wahab 1971 in order to verify the prediction quality of higher order forces additional simulations with a fvm were conducted in the frequency range where resonant behaviour was observed simulations with the fvm were carried out using inviscid as well as viscous flow assumptions respectively to show the effects of viscosity besides the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces the free surface elevation as well as the pressure distribution resulting from the different computational approaches were compared to each other all simulations were carried out at a single hull distance and two different motion amplitudes the paper is structured as follows at first the geometrical properties of the problem are sketched and the applied motion is explained in conjunction with the evaluation method for the force coefficients next the characteristics of the two computational methods are outlined in one section respectively including the numerical setup and grid convergence studies this is followed by the presentation and discussion of the results finally the findings of the study are summarised in the conclusion 2 problem definition the examined problem is sketched in fig 1 two cylinders of infinite length with semi circular cross sections of radius a and vertical walls above the circular part are considered the cylinder axes are located in a distance 2 b away from each other the origin of the coordinate system is located in the symmetry plane between the cylinders on a level with the undisturbed free water surface for the present study a hull distance of b 1 5 a was chosen which corresponds to the narrowest gap size that was examined experimentally by wang and wahab 1971 initially the cylinders are floating in calm water at a draft equal to their radius i e the vertical position of the cylinder axes is z c y l 0 at time t 0 they are forced into harmonic heave oscillations with circular frequency ω 1 z c y l t z a t sin ω t 2 with z a t 0 if t 0 z a 2 sin ω t 2 π 2 1 if 0 t t z a otherwise during the first period t 2 π ω the instantaneous motion amplitude z a t gradually increases according to a sine function of half the frequency until it reaches a constant value of z a the advantage of this formulation opposed to a linear ramp for example is that position velocity and acceleration increase in a continuously differentiable way this in turn avoids discontinuities in the hydrodynamic force besides the free surface elevation in the gap the vertical hydrodynamic force f on the body is the main subject of interest for a comparison with the hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients presented by wang and wahab 1971 extracts from the time dependent results are transformed into fourier series using the formulation 3 f t f 0 k 1 f k sin k ω t ψ k thus the hydrodynamic force f t is split up into a mean value f 0 and a sum of harmonic oscillations the oscillations are defined as sine functions with frequency k ω amplitude f k and phase ψ k with k referring to an integer value which specifies the order of the respective component considering the definition of the motion 2 a phase angle of ψ 1 π means that the first order force f 1 is in phase with the displacement z c y l thus it acts in the opposite direction as the acceleration and behaves like an inertial force a phase angle of ψ 1 π 2 corresponds to a force that acts in the opposite direction as the current velocity and therefore has a damping effect the added mass a and the damping coefficient b can be calculated from 4 a f 1 cos ψ 1 ω 2 z a 5 b f 1 sin ψ 1 ω z a due to symmetry of geometry and motion it is sufficient to model only one cylinder with the computational methods and apply corresponding boundary conditions on the symmetry plane in case that there are no shear forces the problem described above is equivalent to a single cylinder heaving next to a vertical wall furthermore the problem can be scaled to any dimension without effecting the results for viscous simulations the same scale as in the experiments of a 0 1524 m is applied 3 boundary element method 3 1 method description the presented boundary element method is an improved version of the potential flow solver that was used by haase et al 2015 in the context of 2d t analyses of planning hulls and is based on the approach presented by greco 2001 and sun 2007 more recently it was applied by simonis et al 2020 in a 2d t based seakeeping analysis of a semi displacement hull in the following the method s basic features are outlined in the context of potential theory the flow is assumed to be incompressible and irrotational as a consequence viscosity is neglected and the velocity field q may be expressed as the gradient of a potential φ 6 q φ conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid leads to the laplace equation which in the case of a two dimensional domain can be written as 7 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 based on green s second identity a generalised solution of the laplace equation for a point x y z inside the fluid domain can be found in terms of the values for φ and φ n on the boundary s of the domain 8 α x φ x s φ n ln r φ n ln r d s the angle α describes the angular extent of an arc which has an infinitesimal radius it s center at the position of x and is entirely within the fluid domain i e it is α 2 π if x is located fully inside the fluid domain and α π if x lies on a sufficiently smooth boundary the expression n denotes a derivative in the direction of the two dimensional normal vector n y j n z k on the boundary the distance between the point x and a point on the boundary is referred to as r the boundary is subdivided in several parts the free surface which is described by the coordinates y f s and z f s the body the symmetry plane and the outer boundaries following conditions are imposed on the respective boundaries 9 d φ d t 1 2 φ y 2 1 2 φ z 2 g z f s 10 d y f s d t φ y d z f s d t φ z at the free surface with g referring to the gravitational acceleration 11 φ n z c y l t n z on the hull and 12 φ n 0 on the symmetry plane and on the outer boundaries the free surface boundary conditions 9 and 10 are used to compute the development of the free surface shape as well as the value for φ on the free surface in time via numerical integration the required values on the right hand side of the equations are obtained by numerically solving a boundary value problem with respect to φ using a discretised version of the integral equation 8 for this purpose as well as for tracking the free surface shape in time the domain boundary is divided into a finite number of straight line elements the instantaneous values for φ are imposed at the nodes of the free surface elements whereas φ n is prescribed at the nodes of the other elements a linear distribution of φ and φ n is assumed inbetween the nodes of each element the solution of the integration according to equation 8 over such an element is known analytically in terms of the nodal values see e g greco 2001 thus equation 8 can be expressed as the sum of the known solutions for all elements formulating such a discretised integral equation for each node respectively yields an equations system that is used to determine the unknown nodal values subsequently the velocities φ y and φ y which are needed to evaluate the right hand sides of equations 9 and 10 can be computed the free surface boundary conditions are integrated with respect to time using a fourth order runge kutta scheme a new free surface shape is obtained by moving the free surface nodes accordingly regridding algorithms are applied to compensate for numerical inaccuracies and increase the robustness of the method as the boundary conditions are not linearised with respect to the potential φ and evaluated at the actual instantaneous position of the free surface and the hull large deformations of the free surface can be simulated because equations 9 and 10 are substantial time derivatives the nodes on the free surface are considered as fluid particles in the solution process described above since the boundary value problem for φ is solved in the eulerian frame and the free surface is treated in a lagrangian sense at the same time the procedure is called mel approach mixed eulerian lagrangian and was used by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 for the first time to predict the shape of steep water waves the pressure p on the hull surface is calculated using the bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow 13 p p 0 ρ φ t 1 2 φ y 2 1 2 φ z 2 g z with ρ referring to the fluid density and p 0 to the reference pressure at z 0 when the fluid is at rest the dynamic pressure p d is obtained by excluding the hydrostatic pressure ρ g z 14 p d p p 0 ρ g z the dynamic force f in equation 3 is obtained by integrating the dynamic pressure over the body surface the local time derivative of the potential at a grid node with velocity x p is computed from 15 φ t d φ d t x p φ where the total time derivative d φ d t is approximated from the potential at the current and at the last time step with finite differences in order to avoid reflections of the radiated waves from the outer boundary a numerical damping zone is introduced by modifying the dynamic free surface boundary condition inbetween a position y d m p and the boundary at y b n d 16 d φ d t 1 2 φ y 2 1 2 φ z 2 g z δ y φ n the absorption coefficient δ is gradually increased over the distance l r m p and then kept constant 17 δ y 0 for y y d m p δ 0 2 y y d m p l r m p 3 3 y y d m p l r m p 2 for y d m p y y d m p l r m p δ 0 for y d m p l r m p y following the recommendation of sun 2007 a value of δ 0 0 3 g a is chosen the values for y d m p y b n d and l r m p are given in table 1 in terms of the radiated wavelength λ and further explained in the following section 3 2 numerical setup as indicated in section 3 1 only the domain boundaries need to be discretised for the bem the grid resolution required on the free surface as well as the positions of the right and lower domain boundaries and the damping zone mainly depend on the radiated wave length since a broad range of oscillation frequencies shall be considered an automated grid generation process has been established that uses the radiated wave length λ as a scale the wave length is calculated from the oscillation frequency with the dispersion relation for deep water 18 λ 2 π g ω 2 the parameters used to determine the grid generation process are summarised in table 1 all parameters except of s b d y m a x are expressed in terms of the wave length the discretisation process distinguishes between low frequency cases s b d y m a x s f s and high frequency cases s b d y m a x s f s in low frequency cases the element size on the body is determined by s b d y m a x on the free surface the same element size is kept in the vicinity of the body up to a distance equal to the gap size from there the element size gradually increases with the distance from the body the growth factor is defined such that the element size reaches s f s m a x when the damping factor has reached its maximum y y d m p l r m p the same growth factor is kept up to the right boundary which leads to very large element sizes and allows for a large domain size reflections which would normally occur if the element size grows too large are suppressed by the damping zone in high frequency cases the element size on the body is determined by s f s on the free surface the same element size is kept up to the border of the damping zone at y d m p then the element size is increased in the same manner as in low frequency cases the reason for the distinction in low and high frequency cases is the need to maintain a similar element size on the body and the free surface next to it for low frequencies the element size determined from s f s becomes too large for a proper discretisation of the body geometry at higher frequencies however the element size determined by s b d y m a x is too large to capture the flow details convergence studies regarding the spatial and temporal discretisation were carried out on the basis of heave simulations of a single cylinder these studies were used to define the expressions indicated in table 1 exemplary results for the behaviour of the force amplitudes using different mesh configurations are presented in fig 2 following the explanations above the maximum element size on the body s b d y m a x π a 60 was chosen on the basis of a low frequency case although a target element size on the free surface of s f s λ 40 seems sufficiently accurate for the single cylinder at high frequency oscillations the value was decreased to s f s λ 60 in order to account for the strong fluid motion in case of piston mode resonance to avoid any influence from the lower and right boundary they were located at large distances of about 100λ away from the body these large domain sizes become affordable due to the growth of the element sizes with increasing distance from the body the temporal discretisation was set to 200 timesteps per period when the motion amplitude was z a a 24 when the motion amplitude was z a a 12 800 timesteps per period were used to account for the higher flow velocities in the gap and ensure numerical stability 4 finite volume method 4 1 method description for the presented study the commercial simulation software star ccm was used the software incorporates a finite volume method to solve for pressure and velocities in a given fluid domain free surface effects can be captured by means of the volume of fluid technique the fundamental characteristics of the approach are outlined in the following the finite volume method requires a subdivision of the whole fluid domain into several discrete control volumes cells conservation equations are formulated for each control volume in integral form the values of interest are stored at the cell centres or the cell faces and as each equation depends on the nodal values of neighbouring cells a solvable equation system is formed for the problem at hand incompressible flow is assumed the governing equations are the conservation of mass 19 q 0 and momentum 20 ρ q t q q ρ g z p μ 2 q for the viscous simulations a laminar boundary layer is assumed if inviscid flow assumptions are made the viscosity μ is set equal to zero a segregated flow model is invoked which solves for pressure and velocity by linking the momentum and continuity equations with a predictor corrector approach this involves a colocated variable arrangement and an implicit unsteady solution scheme both phases water and air are included in the fluid domain and the free surface is captured using the volume of fluid technique this means that the local material properties ρ μ are treated as a blend of the values for water ρ w μ w and air ρ a μ a and are expressed in terms of the volume fraction of water c 21 ρ c ρ w 1 c ρ a 22 μ c μ w 1 c μ a the volume fraction on the other hand is determined by solving an additional transport equation 23 c t c q 0 the dynamic pressure p d is obtained from the pressure p by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure as specified in equation 14 the dynamic force f in equation 3 is calculated by integrating p d over the wetted part of the body surface and adding the shear forces in case viscous flow assumption were made 4 2 numerical setup an unstructured mesh was used for the finite volume simulations consisting mainly of hexahedral cells local refinements were applied in vicinity of the free surface the body and in the gap see fig 3 to account for the two dimensional flow only one layer of cells was used with respect to the x direction and symmetry conditions were imposed to the forward and backward boundary velocity inlet conditions were applied at the upper and lower boundary as in the potential flow simulations a symmetry condition was used on the left boundary on the right a pressure outlet condition was employed additionally a damping zone was defined starting at a distance of 20 a from the right boundary the total extent of the domain was 81 92 a in y direction and in z direction underneath the undisturbed free surface above the free surface it was 40 96 a the heave motion 2 was applied to the whole grid four meshes with different numbers of cells were generated and convergence of the hydrodynamic force was checked on the basis of inviscid simulations at piston mode resonance ω 0 82 g a with a motion amplitude of z a a 24 the meshing algorithm is controlled via a base size parameter which corresponds to the target edge length of the cells around the body the value was a 200 for mesh configuration a and was consecutively doubled up to a 25 for mesh d the overall cell counts were 137 433 for mesh a 41 417 for mesh b 16 537 for mesh c and 8388 for mesh d the number of time steps per period were 4000 for mesh a 2000 for mesh b 1000 for mesh c and 500 for mesh d an illustration of mesh a and the refinements next to the body can be found in fig 3 it should be noted that the grid was not fully optimised and the number of cells could possibly be further reduced without effecting the quality of the results on the left hand side of fig 4 the time history of the hydrodynamic force calculated with mesh configuration a is shown it is evident that the force amplitude reaches a nearly constant value after approximately 30 periods the right hand side of fig 4 shows a comparison of the results for the vertical hydrodynamic force using the different meshes it is noted that the forces obtained with mesh c already agree fairly well with the results from the finest mesh a while the coarsest mesh d is clearly inappropriate by comparison of the flow fields it was observed that some details of the flow e g breaking waves could not be captured with the coarser meshes therefore mesh a was chosen for all further studies with motion amplitude z a a 24 a slightly modified version with increased height of the refinement zone in the gap was used for the simulations with z a a 12 to account for the higher free surface elevation amplitudes 5 results and discussion all simulations were carried out for the motion amplitudes z a a 24 and z a a 12 a hull distance of b 1 5 a and lasted over 51 periods a total of 18 frequencies from ω 0 25 g a to ω 1 75 g a was examined with the bem additionally the frequencies ω 0 77 g a ω 0 82 g a and ω 0 88 g a were simulated with the fvm using viscous and inviscid flow assumptions respectively for each simulation the resulting hydrodynamic heave force f t inbetween t t 40 25 and t t 50 25 was transformed into a fourier series as specified in equation 3 first order fourier coefficients were compared to experimental data and linear theory in form of hydrodynamic mass and damping detailed comparison between the respective simulation approaches were based on the first three orders of fourier coefficients additionally the free surface elevation at characteristic time instants and respective pressure distributions on the body were taken into account to discuss deviations between the numerical approaches the comparison of hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients with experimental and theoretical results from wang and wahab 1971 is given in fig 5 the motion amplitude in the simulations was z a a 24 which is the same value as in the experiments the strong variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients around ω 0 8 g a corresponds to the piston mode resonance phenomena very good agreement between the nonlinear computations and the experimental results is found in that area whereas the linear method seems to overpredict the peak values at frequencies without resonant fluid motion the bem results agree very well with linear theory deviations from the experimental values occur at lower frequencies the experimental results show a strong scattering in that range which according to wang and wahab 1971 could be due to structural oscillations of the end boards the cases that were simulated with the fvm represent characteristic marks with regard to the variation of added mass and damping in fig 5 the added mass coefficient becomes rapidly negative inbetween ω 0 77 g a and ω 0 82 g a while the latter marks the minimum value at the same time the damping coefficient reaches zero at ω 0 88 g a figs 6 8 illustrate time histories of the dynamic heave force at these frequencies over one period for z a a 24 and z a a 12 respectively except for the case with ω 0 77 g a and z a a 24 all results visibly deviate from the sinusoidal course of the motion excitation this nonlinear tendency is further stressed when comparing the results corresponding to the lower motion amplitude to the respective curves corresponding to the higher motion amplitude the agreement between the numerical approaches is generally very good visible differences can be identified for z a a 24 at ω 0 82 g a and ω 0 88 g a around the peek values which are somewhat overpredicted by the bem compared to both fvm approaches a visible influence of viscosity can be identified at ω 0 77 g a and z a a 12 the curves of bem and inviscid fvm are very close together in that case while the curve from the viscous fvm shows a small deviation a comparison of the fourier coefficients derived from the respective time histories of the dynamic force at z a a 24 is shown in fig 9 up to order k 3 all results agree well and show the same trends with regard to frequency the first order force amplitude f 1 increases slightly from ω 0 77 g a to ω 0 82 g a and then decreases again towards ω 0 88 g a by looking at the corresponding phase angle the variation of added mass and damping coefficients over frequency fig 5 can be retraced at ω 0 77 g a the first order phase angle ψ 1 is between π and π 2 which according to equation 4 means a positive added mass coefficient on the contrary the phase angle is between zero and π 2 at ω 0 82 g a which leads to a negative added mass coefficient at ω 0 88 g a it becomes almost zero which according to equation 5 means that the damping coefficient is almost zero as well amongst the cases shown in fig 9 the second order force amplitudes are highest at ω 0 82 g a however the relative contribution of the second order force to the overall force is the highest at ω 0 88 g a it is interesting to note that the second order phase angle shows an even stronger variation with frequency than the first order phase angle contributions of the third order force are highest at ω 0 82 g a but rather small at all three sample frequencies the fourier coefficients corresponding to the motion amplitude z a a 12 are presented in fig 10 by comparison with the results corresponding to z a a 24 in fig 9 a very pronounced difference can be found regarding the first order force amplitudes at ω 0 82 g a the nondimensional value is significantly lower at the larger motion amplitude while at ω 0 77 g a it is higher this further demonstrates the nonlinear relationship between body motion and the forces as doubling the motion amplitude does not result in twice the force amplitude i e a constant nondimensional value additionally the significance of second order force components seems to increase with motion amplitude a factor that might influence the behaviour of force coefficients observed here is a dependence of the resonance frequency on the motion amplitude which was also found by bonfiglio and brizzolara 2018 the presented time histories of the dynamic forces and the corresponding fourier coefficients demonstrate that the three numerical approaches are all able to resolve the nonlinear characteristics of the heave radiation problem and only minor differences between the methods can be taken from the respective plots in order to analyse these differences in detail the force components resulting from the viscous fvm were subtracted from the respective results of inviscid fvm as well as bem the differences were related to the total values from the viscous fvm and are given in table 2 for z a a 24 and in table 3 for z a a 12 considering that the assumptions on fluid viscosity was the only difference between the numerical setups of the two finite volume based approaches the values in the columns titled fvm invisc are taken as a quantitative measure of the influence of viscosity on the force amplitudes amongst the analysed cases the highest value can be found at ω 0 77 g a and z a a 24 for the third order force component however it should be noted that the absolute value of that force component is close to zero thus it s contribution to the overall force is very small see fig 9 regarding the second order force components a notable influence of viscosity of about 5 3 can be found at ω 0 77 g a and z a a 12 the influence of viscosity on the first order force component which arguably has the largest impact on the overall force is below 2 4 amongst all cases the force amplitudes from the bem tend to deviate more from the viscous results than the ones from the inviscid fvm while the agreement generally seems to be better at the higher motion amplitude to further evaluate possible reason for the deviations the free surface elevation is considered in the following figs 11 and 12 show the free surface elevation in the gap at four characteristic time instants for each of the sample frequencies the time instant t 41 00 t corresponds to a motion state with z c y l 0 negative velocity and zero acceleration of the body see equation 2 at t 41 25 t the body has reached it s minimum position z c y l z a with zero velocity and positive acceleration accordingly t 41 5 t means z c y l 0 positive velocity and zero acceleration and t 41 75 t refers to the maximum position z c y l z a zero velocity and negative acceleration from the plots it is evident that all numerical approaches predict a phase shift between the fluid motion and the body motion which depends on frequency such a dependence is in line with experimental findings on moonpools faltinsen et al 2007 as was shown before in figs 9 and 10 the phase angles of the force components also depend on frequency and the strong variation of hydrodynamic coefficients fig 5 can be retraced to the variation of the first order phase angle using equation 4 as the free surface elevation might be seen as an indication of the pressure inside the gap which influences the forces on the body it is suspected that the phase shift of the forces is caused by the phase shift of the fluid motion inside of the gap this would lead to the conclusion that the phase shift of the fluid motion is a reason for the strong variation of the hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients such an explanation would fit well to the statements made by lewandowski 1992 on the matter the overall free surface level predicted by the different numerical approaches agrees very well in most cases for the motion amplitude of z a a 24 fig 11 the best agreement is found at ω 0 77 g a and ω 0 88 g a where as the term piston mode resonance implies the free surface is nearly flat and varies its level in time at ω 0 82 g a the level difference over one period is largest and the free surface is not entirely flat anymore a possible reason for this behaviour is that lateral velocities are induced when the free surface moves to a large extend along the cylindrical part of the body effectively widening the gap width notable differences regarding exact free surface shape predicted by bem and fvm are present at this frequency in order to evaluate how these differences might be connected to the deviation of force amplitudes table 2 the dynamic pressure distribution on the body at the respective timesteps is given in fig 13 it can be taken that the different shapes at t 41 00 t have no visible effect on the pressure distribution however when the differences of free surface elevation are located closer to body at t 41 25 t slight differences are evident in the pressure distribution as well this time instant roughly corresponds to the maximum dynamic force as shown on the left side of fig 8 the most significant difference in the pressure distribution can be found at t 40 75 t here the differences between the free surface shapes is not larger than before but they occur on a level with the cylindrical part of the body this time instant is close to the minimum of the force which also marks the point in time where deviations between bem and fvm are largest fig 8 left based on these findings different predictions of the free surface shape are suspected to be the main cause for deviations between bem and fvm at z a a 24 a possible reason could be the much finer resolution of the free surface in the fvm additionally the regridding algorithms used with the bem have a filtering effect and could blur certain details of the free surface shape as the influence of these techniques on the free surface shape is relatively higher when the overall free surface amplitude is low it may also give an explanation why the relative agreement between bem and fvm is better at higher motion amplitude see tables 2 and 3 from fig 12 it can be taken that the amplitude of fluid motion in the gap is considerably higher at z a a 12 an interesting case regarding the influence of viscosity is found at ω 0 77 g a both inviscid approaches show a very good agreement here while the results from the viscous fvm deviate the respective dynamic pressure distribution on the body for this case is shown in fig 14 as before the most notable difference in the pressure distribution is found when the free surface level in the gap is lowest t 41 50 t this time instant also marks the minimum of the dynamic force on the right side of fig 6 fig 15 shows the relative velocity fields close to the intersection of free surface and body resulting from the inviscid and viscous fvm calculations at that time instant beside the different level of the free surface a vortex formation can be observed in case of viscous flow assumptions a fact that may favour the vortex generation is that the body has reached it s maximum downward velocity at that time instant while the fluid in the gap is starting to move upward although a clear influence of viscosity can be observed in the flow field the impact on the first order force component is relatively low with 2 0 see table 3 the impact of viscosity on the second order force component is somewhat more pronounced with 5 2 from the relatively low influence of viscosity it is concluded that the highly nonlinear relation between body motion and hydrodynamic forces observed in this study are mainly induced by the free surface this finding is in contrast to investigations on hulls sections with rectangular shape which often indicate that a linearised free surface representation can be sufficiently accurate while viscosity has a strong influence e g kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 a likely reason is that the relevance of vortex shedding is much more pronounced when the edges of the body are sharp moradi et al 2015 at the same time less horizontal velocities are induced when the walls in the gap are exclusively vertical possibly leading to a decreased relevance of nonlinear free surface representations it is well possible that the relevance of viscosity for the semi circular hull shape will be higher if the motion amplitude is further increased according to the results given by bonfiglio and brizzolara 2018 who investigated the problem up to a motion amplitude of z a a 3 using a viscous fvm the flow would also be strongly characterized by wave breaking phenomena in this case although the bem in combination with the mel approach is capable of capturing very steep waves phenomena like wave breaking and air inclusions can not be accounted for at this point the boundary element method would reach its limit not only because it neglects viscosity but also because the free surface can not be tracked anymore in a physically meaningful way taking into consideration that the free surface already reaches very close to the bottom of the hull in certain time instances e g ω 0 77 g a t 41 50 t in fig 12 higher motion amplitudes were regarded out of scope for this study another factor that may increase the relevance of viscosity are very small hull distances zhao et al 2018 the hull distance that was chosen in this study corresponds to the closest hull distance which was experimentally studied by wang and wahab 1971 it is believed to be a realistic lower limit for practical hull distances of multi hull ships for instance the ratio between gap size and draft of the catamaran examined by lugni et al 2004 was 1 625 whereas in the case investigated here it was 1 0 6 conclusion a numerical study on the heave radiation problem of a twin hull section with semi circular shape was carried out three different numerical approaches were used to solve the flow problem in time domain a nonlinear boundary element method a finite volume method incorporating inviscid flow assumptions and a finite volume method incorporating viscous flow assumptions focus was laid on frequencies at which piston like resonant flow occurred in the gap between the hulls first order force components were validated against existing experimental measurements and compared to published results from linear potential theory subsequently the forces and free surface elevation in the gap resulting from the different numerical approaches were compared in detail at three frequencies and two motion amplitudes respectively based on the results the following conclusions are drawn all three approaches are able to predict valid added mass and damping coefficients for the presented problem and show a significant improvement over linearised potential methods in that regard the strong variation of hydrodynamic coefficients goes along with a change of the phase shift between body motion and fluid motion in the gap the nonlinear characteristics of the dynamic force predicted by the three approaches are in very good agreement a significant influence of second order force components is found with the corresponding phase angle varying strongly over frequency significance of higher order force components seem to increase with motion amplitude the free surface in the gap is considered the main cause for nonlinearity in the cases examined deviations between the dynamic force predicted by bem and fvm are mainly associated with a different prediction of the free surface elevation in vicinity to the body thus an accurate representation of the free surface shape is considered highly relevant for a numerical analysis of the problem in particular when the free surface is close to the bottom of the hull impact of viscosity on the dynamic forces was found to be relatively low throughout the examined cases vortex shedding in vicinity of the intersection between body and free surface was found in one case which had an impact on the pressure distribution in that time instant however the dynamic force amplitudes were still in good agreement all in all the study demonstrates that the nonlinear dependence of forces on body motion associated with the radiation problem of twin hulls with semi circular shape at low to moderate motion amplitudes can be recovered well using inviscid methods thus the nonlinear boundary element method presented here is considered a suitable tool for the analysis of piston mode resonance phenomena associated with bodies of rather round shape and feasible alternative to more elaborate tools like the finite volume method future studies may investigate the effects of viscosity for a variety of common hull shapes also motion excitation in different degrees of freedom by external waves may be considered preparing an application of the bem in 2d t based seakeeping analyses of multi hull ships credit authorship contribution statement

21024,a numerical study of a semi circular twin hull section under heave oscillation is presented two different time domain simulation methods were used firstly a boundary element method based on potential theory which incorporates fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions by using a mixed eulerian lagrangian scheme secondly a finite volume method in combination with a volume of fluid scheme for capturing the free surface in order to evaluate the effects of viscosity simulations with the finite volume method were carried out using inviscid as well as viscous flow assumptions hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients were derived from first order fourier coefficients and validated against results from linear theory and experiments a detailed comparison of nonlinear results from both simulation methods was carried out in vicinity of the piston mode resonance frequency and a very good agreement was found the phase angles corresponding to the fourier coefficients varied strongly with frequency which went along with a phase shift of the fluid motion in the gap influence of viscosity on the flow was found to be present but had relatively low impact on the hydrodynamic forces keywords nonlinear wave radiation multi hull hydrodynamics helmholtz resonance wall effect mixed eulerian lagrangian volume of fluid 1 introduction many applications in the field of naval and ocean engineering are arranged in such a way that vertical gaps occur within a floating structure or between adjacent structures examples for such arrangements are multi hull ships moonpools side by side arrangement of vessels multi body offshore structures or ships in a terminal violent resonant fluid motion can occur within the gap of such an arrangement leading to heavy loads and potentially harming the safety of the operation different modes of resonance are possible depending on exciting frequency and gap size in particular for narrow gap sizes the so called piston mode resonance also known as helmholtz or pumping mode resonance has an pronounced effect on the hydrodynamic forces one of the earliest studies on that phenomena was conducted by ohkusu 1969 who considered a pair of circular cylinders that were forced to heave harmonically on the free surface experimental results for the radiated wave height at a certain distance to the cylinders were compared with results from linearised potential theory using an extension of the solution procedure by ursell 1949 a similar theoretical approach was used by wang and wahab 1971 who also carried out force measurements in a set of experiments using pairs of semi circular cylinders hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients were found to vary strongly close to resonance frequency with negative values for the added mass and damping coefficients close to zero most of past investigations utilised frequency domain methods based on potential theory with linearised free surface boundary conditions to analyse the flow phenomena in gaps a series of publications was devoted to the occurrence of so called trapped wave modes e g mciver 1996 and mciver et al 2003 for certain multi hull shapes no waves are radiated to infinity which affects existence and uniqueness of solutions to the linear frequency domain radiation problem molin 2001 developed a simplified formula for the piston mode frequency of rectangular cylinders by treating the fluid in the gap like a rigid body also for rectangular cylinders yeung and seah 2007 analysed free surface shapes and force coefficients at different resonant modes using a semi analytical approach a study by faltinsen et al 2007 showed that the free surface elevation from linear theory inside a 2d moonpool at piston mode resonance deviates significantly from experimental measurements the authors suspected that free surface nonlinearities were the main reason for these deviations porter and evans 2011 as well as mciver and porter 2016 established a wide spacing approximation to derive hydrodynamic coefficients of an arbitrary shaped cylinder next to a wall in terms of similar quantities for a single cylinder without a wall a mathematical analysis regarding the sign of the added mass coefficients of two dimensional floating bodies including twin hulls was conducted by mciver and mciver 2016 as indicated by faltinsen et al 2007 nonlinear free surface effects may have an important effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a twin hull a possible way to account for these effects in the scope of potential flow is to utilize a boundary element method bem with fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions and track the free surface in time domain using a mixed eulerian lagrangian mel scheme this method was applied to the radiation problem of twin cylinders with rectangular and triangular cross sections by maiti and sen 2001 significant influence of higher order force components were found especially for small water depth however the piston mode phenomenon was not explicitly examined kristiansen and faltinsen 2010 used a bem mel approach to examine the motion of a rectangular ship section in a terminal when excited by an incoming wave they implemented a vortex sheet tracking method to account for flow separation at the sharp edges of the body and found a significantly better agreement with experimental measurements compared to results without this technique li and zhang 2016 proposed an alternative way to determine the resonance frequency of a twin hull with a bem mel technique they simulated the gravity driven flow after an initial disturbance and evaluated dominant frequencies in the free surface elevation by means of a fourier transformation while potential flow based methods usually offer relatively low computational costs their main deficiency is that they rely on inviscid flow assumptions field based methods like the finite volume method fvm are able to solve the navier stokes equations in a given fluid domain and thus include effects of viscosity in the simulation in the context of piston mode resonance the most prominent effect of viscosity which has been identified by past researches is flow separation at the bilge keels for instance the work by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 indicates that for the heave radiation problem of a box shaped twin hull even linearised free surface conditions may be sufficiently accurate as long as it is accounted for the vortex shedding at the bodies edges based on a finite volume method fvm they propose a domain decomposition into a viscous regime around the edges and a potential flow domain everywhere else including the free surface in the gap another example is ananthakrishnan 2015 who simulated heave oscillations of a rectangular twin hull with a finite difference method fdm incorporating viscous as well as inviscid flow assumptions pronounced differences between the respective results were evident in case of piston mode resonance the influence of viscosity motivated researchers to introduce empirical damping terms in the free surface boundary conditions of potential flow methods to increase their applicability for 3d side by side offloading scenarios zhao et al 2018 the three previously mentioned publications focussed on box shaped twin hull sections which are characterised by vertical side walls and sharp corners at the bilge moradi et al 2015 studied different inlet configurations using a fvm with viscous flow assumptions they found that replacing the sharp corners with rounded ones lead to significant higher resonant wave heights in the gap due to a reduction of vortex generation at the inlet these findings rise the question if a potential flow based boundary element method can be a valid alternative to the fvm for the study of multi hull ships with well rounded hull forms when only little influence of flow separation is expected the heave radiation problem of circular or semi circular cylinder sections which has been studied previously by several authors e g ohkusu 1969 wang and wahab 1971 lee et al 1971 and nordenstrøm et al 1971 can be seen as a representation of such a case a recent numerical parameter study on this case was conducted by bonfiglio and brizzolara 2018 using a viscous flow solver based on the fvm they showed that the hydrodynamic coefficients as well as the wave elevation inside the gap at resonance depend nonlineary on the heave amplitude their results indicate that viscosity may have an important effect at very high heave amplitudes however no study was found so far that quantifies the influence of viscosity on the hydrodynamic forces and shows the effects on the free surface elevation in the gap this would be of particular interest at low to moderate motion amplitudes which mark a typical scope of application for seakeeping analyses of multi hull ships aim of the present study was to validate the bem mel approach for the case of a heaving semi circular twin hull section with a focus on piston mode resonance added mass and damping coefficients were compared to experimental results as well as results from linear theory by wang and wahab 1971 in order to verify the prediction quality of higher order forces additional simulations with a fvm were conducted in the frequency range where resonant behaviour was observed simulations with the fvm were carried out using inviscid as well as viscous flow assumptions respectively to show the effects of viscosity besides the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces the free surface elevation as well as the pressure distribution resulting from the different computational approaches were compared to each other all simulations were carried out at a single hull distance and two different motion amplitudes the paper is structured as follows at first the geometrical properties of the problem are sketched and the applied motion is explained in conjunction with the evaluation method for the force coefficients next the characteristics of the two computational methods are outlined in one section respectively including the numerical setup and grid convergence studies this is followed by the presentation and discussion of the results finally the findings of the study are summarised in the conclusion 2 problem definition the examined problem is sketched in fig 1 two cylinders of infinite length with semi circular cross sections of radius a and vertical walls above the circular part are considered the cylinder axes are located in a distance 2 b away from each other the origin of the coordinate system is located in the symmetry plane between the cylinders on a level with the undisturbed free water surface for the present study a hull distance of b 1 5 a was chosen which corresponds to the narrowest gap size that was examined experimentally by wang and wahab 1971 initially the cylinders are floating in calm water at a draft equal to their radius i e the vertical position of the cylinder axes is z c y l 0 at time t 0 they are forced into harmonic heave oscillations with circular frequency ω 1 z c y l t z a t sin ω t 2 with z a t 0 if t 0 z a 2 sin ω t 2 π 2 1 if 0 t t z a otherwise during the first period t 2 π ω the instantaneous motion amplitude z a t gradually increases according to a sine function of half the frequency until it reaches a constant value of z a the advantage of this formulation opposed to a linear ramp for example is that position velocity and acceleration increase in a continuously differentiable way this in turn avoids discontinuities in the hydrodynamic force besides the free surface elevation in the gap the vertical hydrodynamic force f on the body is the main subject of interest for a comparison with the hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients presented by wang and wahab 1971 extracts from the time dependent results are transformed into fourier series using the formulation 3 f t f 0 k 1 f k sin k ω t ψ k thus the hydrodynamic force f t is split up into a mean value f 0 and a sum of harmonic oscillations the oscillations are defined as sine functions with frequency k ω amplitude f k and phase ψ k with k referring to an integer value which specifies the order of the respective component considering the definition of the motion 2 a phase angle of ψ 1 π means that the first order force f 1 is in phase with the displacement z c y l thus it acts in the opposite direction as the acceleration and behaves like an inertial force a phase angle of ψ 1 π 2 corresponds to a force that acts in the opposite direction as the current velocity and therefore has a damping effect the added mass a and the damping coefficient b can be calculated from 4 a f 1 cos ψ 1 ω 2 z a 5 b f 1 sin ψ 1 ω z a due to symmetry of geometry and motion it is sufficient to model only one cylinder with the computational methods and apply corresponding boundary conditions on the symmetry plane in case that there are no shear forces the problem described above is equivalent to a single cylinder heaving next to a vertical wall furthermore the problem can be scaled to any dimension without effecting the results for viscous simulations the same scale as in the experiments of a 0 1524 m is applied 3 boundary element method 3 1 method description the presented boundary element method is an improved version of the potential flow solver that was used by haase et al 2015 in the context of 2d t analyses of planning hulls and is based on the approach presented by greco 2001 and sun 2007 more recently it was applied by simonis et al 2020 in a 2d t based seakeeping analysis of a semi displacement hull in the following the method s basic features are outlined in the context of potential theory the flow is assumed to be incompressible and irrotational as a consequence viscosity is neglected and the velocity field q may be expressed as the gradient of a potential φ 6 q φ conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid leads to the laplace equation which in the case of a two dimensional domain can be written as 7 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 based on green s second identity a generalised solution of the laplace equation for a point x y z inside the fluid domain can be found in terms of the values for φ and φ n on the boundary s of the domain 8 α x φ x s φ n ln r φ n ln r d s the angle α describes the angular extent of an arc which has an infinitesimal radius it s center at the position of x and is entirely within the fluid domain i e it is α 2 π if x is located fully inside the fluid domain and α π if x lies on a sufficiently smooth boundary the expression n denotes a derivative in the direction of the two dimensional normal vector n y j n z k on the boundary the distance between the point x and a point on the boundary is referred to as r the boundary is subdivided in several parts the free surface which is described by the coordinates y f s and z f s the body the symmetry plane and the outer boundaries following conditions are imposed on the respective boundaries 9 d φ d t 1 2 φ y 2 1 2 φ z 2 g z f s 10 d y f s d t φ y d z f s d t φ z at the free surface with g referring to the gravitational acceleration 11 φ n z c y l t n z on the hull and 12 φ n 0 on the symmetry plane and on the outer boundaries the free surface boundary conditions 9 and 10 are used to compute the development of the free surface shape as well as the value for φ on the free surface in time via numerical integration the required values on the right hand side of the equations are obtained by numerically solving a boundary value problem with respect to φ using a discretised version of the integral equation 8 for this purpose as well as for tracking the free surface shape in time the domain boundary is divided into a finite number of straight line elements the instantaneous values for φ are imposed at the nodes of the free surface elements whereas φ n is prescribed at the nodes of the other elements a linear distribution of φ and φ n is assumed inbetween the nodes of each element the solution of the integration according to equation 8 over such an element is known analytically in terms of the nodal values see e g greco 2001 thus equation 8 can be expressed as the sum of the known solutions for all elements formulating such a discretised integral equation for each node respectively yields an equations system that is used to determine the unknown nodal values subsequently the velocities φ y and φ y which are needed to evaluate the right hand sides of equations 9 and 10 can be computed the free surface boundary conditions are integrated with respect to time using a fourth order runge kutta scheme a new free surface shape is obtained by moving the free surface nodes accordingly regridding algorithms are applied to compensate for numerical inaccuracies and increase the robustness of the method as the boundary conditions are not linearised with respect to the potential φ and evaluated at the actual instantaneous position of the free surface and the hull large deformations of the free surface can be simulated because equations 9 and 10 are substantial time derivatives the nodes on the free surface are considered as fluid particles in the solution process described above since the boundary value problem for φ is solved in the eulerian frame and the free surface is treated in a lagrangian sense at the same time the procedure is called mel approach mixed eulerian lagrangian and was used by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 for the first time to predict the shape of steep water waves the pressure p on the hull surface is calculated using the bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow 13 p p 0 ρ φ t 1 2 φ y 2 1 2 φ z 2 g z with ρ referring to the fluid density and p 0 to the reference pressure at z 0 when the fluid is at rest the dynamic pressure p d is obtained by excluding the hydrostatic pressure ρ g z 14 p d p p 0 ρ g z the dynamic force f in equation 3 is obtained by integrating the dynamic pressure over the body surface the local time derivative of the potential at a grid node with velocity x p is computed from 15 φ t d φ d t x p φ where the total time derivative d φ d t is approximated from the potential at the current and at the last time step with finite differences in order to avoid reflections of the radiated waves from the outer boundary a numerical damping zone is introduced by modifying the dynamic free surface boundary condition inbetween a position y d m p and the boundary at y b n d 16 d φ d t 1 2 φ y 2 1 2 φ z 2 g z δ y φ n the absorption coefficient δ is gradually increased over the distance l r m p and then kept constant 17 δ y 0 for y y d m p δ 0 2 y y d m p l r m p 3 3 y y d m p l r m p 2 for y d m p y y d m p l r m p δ 0 for y d m p l r m p y following the recommendation of sun 2007 a value of δ 0 0 3 g a is chosen the values for y d m p y b n d and l r m p are given in table 1 in terms of the radiated wavelength λ and further explained in the following section 3 2 numerical setup as indicated in section 3 1 only the domain boundaries need to be discretised for the bem the grid resolution required on the free surface as well as the positions of the right and lower domain boundaries and the damping zone mainly depend on the radiated wave length since a broad range of oscillation frequencies shall be considered an automated grid generation process has been established that uses the radiated wave length λ as a scale the wave length is calculated from the oscillation frequency with the dispersion relation for deep water 18 λ 2 π g ω 2 the parameters used to determine the grid generation process are summarised in table 1 all parameters except of s b d y m a x are expressed in terms of the wave length the discretisation process distinguishes between low frequency cases s b d y m a x s f s and high frequency cases s b d y m a x s f s in low frequency cases the element size on the body is determined by s b d y m a x on the free surface the same element size is kept in the vicinity of the body up to a distance equal to the gap size from there the element size gradually increases with the distance from the body the growth factor is defined such that the element size reaches s f s m a x when the damping factor has reached its maximum y y d m p l r m p the same growth factor is kept up to the right boundary which leads to very large element sizes and allows for a large domain size reflections which would normally occur if the element size grows too large are suppressed by the damping zone in high frequency cases the element size on the body is determined by s f s on the free surface the same element size is kept up to the border of the damping zone at y d m p then the element size is increased in the same manner as in low frequency cases the reason for the distinction in low and high frequency cases is the need to maintain a similar element size on the body and the free surface next to it for low frequencies the element size determined from s f s becomes too large for a proper discretisation of the body geometry at higher frequencies however the element size determined by s b d y m a x is too large to capture the flow details convergence studies regarding the spatial and temporal discretisation were carried out on the basis of heave simulations of a single cylinder these studies were used to define the expressions indicated in table 1 exemplary results for the behaviour of the force amplitudes using different mesh configurations are presented in fig 2 following the explanations above the maximum element size on the body s b d y m a x π a 60 was chosen on the basis of a low frequency case although a target element size on the free surface of s f s λ 40 seems sufficiently accurate for the single cylinder at high frequency oscillations the value was decreased to s f s λ 60 in order to account for the strong fluid motion in case of piston mode resonance to avoid any influence from the lower and right boundary they were located at large distances of about 100λ away from the body these large domain sizes become affordable due to the growth of the element sizes with increasing distance from the body the temporal discretisation was set to 200 timesteps per period when the motion amplitude was z a a 24 when the motion amplitude was z a a 12 800 timesteps per period were used to account for the higher flow velocities in the gap and ensure numerical stability 4 finite volume method 4 1 method description for the presented study the commercial simulation software star ccm was used the software incorporates a finite volume method to solve for pressure and velocities in a given fluid domain free surface effects can be captured by means of the volume of fluid technique the fundamental characteristics of the approach are outlined in the following the finite volume method requires a subdivision of the whole fluid domain into several discrete control volumes cells conservation equations are formulated for each control volume in integral form the values of interest are stored at the cell centres or the cell faces and as each equation depends on the nodal values of neighbouring cells a solvable equation system is formed for the problem at hand incompressible flow is assumed the governing equations are the conservation of mass 19 q 0 and momentum 20 ρ q t q q ρ g z p μ 2 q for the viscous simulations a laminar boundary layer is assumed if inviscid flow assumptions are made the viscosity μ is set equal to zero a segregated flow model is invoked which solves for pressure and velocity by linking the momentum and continuity equations with a predictor corrector approach this involves a colocated variable arrangement and an implicit unsteady solution scheme both phases water and air are included in the fluid domain and the free surface is captured using the volume of fluid technique this means that the local material properties ρ μ are treated as a blend of the values for water ρ w μ w and air ρ a μ a and are expressed in terms of the volume fraction of water c 21 ρ c ρ w 1 c ρ a 22 μ c μ w 1 c μ a the volume fraction on the other hand is determined by solving an additional transport equation 23 c t c q 0 the dynamic pressure p d is obtained from the pressure p by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure as specified in equation 14 the dynamic force f in equation 3 is calculated by integrating p d over the wetted part of the body surface and adding the shear forces in case viscous flow assumption were made 4 2 numerical setup an unstructured mesh was used for the finite volume simulations consisting mainly of hexahedral cells local refinements were applied in vicinity of the free surface the body and in the gap see fig 3 to account for the two dimensional flow only one layer of cells was used with respect to the x direction and symmetry conditions were imposed to the forward and backward boundary velocity inlet conditions were applied at the upper and lower boundary as in the potential flow simulations a symmetry condition was used on the left boundary on the right a pressure outlet condition was employed additionally a damping zone was defined starting at a distance of 20 a from the right boundary the total extent of the domain was 81 92 a in y direction and in z direction underneath the undisturbed free surface above the free surface it was 40 96 a the heave motion 2 was applied to the whole grid four meshes with different numbers of cells were generated and convergence of the hydrodynamic force was checked on the basis of inviscid simulations at piston mode resonance ω 0 82 g a with a motion amplitude of z a a 24 the meshing algorithm is controlled via a base size parameter which corresponds to the target edge length of the cells around the body the value was a 200 for mesh configuration a and was consecutively doubled up to a 25 for mesh d the overall cell counts were 137 433 for mesh a 41 417 for mesh b 16 537 for mesh c and 8388 for mesh d the number of time steps per period were 4000 for mesh a 2000 for mesh b 1000 for mesh c and 500 for mesh d an illustration of mesh a and the refinements next to the body can be found in fig 3 it should be noted that the grid was not fully optimised and the number of cells could possibly be further reduced without effecting the quality of the results on the left hand side of fig 4 the time history of the hydrodynamic force calculated with mesh configuration a is shown it is evident that the force amplitude reaches a nearly constant value after approximately 30 periods the right hand side of fig 4 shows a comparison of the results for the vertical hydrodynamic force using the different meshes it is noted that the forces obtained with mesh c already agree fairly well with the results from the finest mesh a while the coarsest mesh d is clearly inappropriate by comparison of the flow fields it was observed that some details of the flow e g breaking waves could not be captured with the coarser meshes therefore mesh a was chosen for all further studies with motion amplitude z a a 24 a slightly modified version with increased height of the refinement zone in the gap was used for the simulations with z a a 12 to account for the higher free surface elevation amplitudes 5 results and discussion all simulations were carried out for the motion amplitudes z a a 24 and z a a 12 a hull distance of b 1 5 a and lasted over 51 periods a total of 18 frequencies from ω 0 25 g a to ω 1 75 g a was examined with the bem additionally the frequencies ω 0 77 g a ω 0 82 g a and ω 0 88 g a were simulated with the fvm using viscous and inviscid flow assumptions respectively for each simulation the resulting hydrodynamic heave force f t inbetween t t 40 25 and t t 50 25 was transformed into a fourier series as specified in equation 3 first order fourier coefficients were compared to experimental data and linear theory in form of hydrodynamic mass and damping detailed comparison between the respective simulation approaches were based on the first three orders of fourier coefficients additionally the free surface elevation at characteristic time instants and respective pressure distributions on the body were taken into account to discuss deviations between the numerical approaches the comparison of hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients with experimental and theoretical results from wang and wahab 1971 is given in fig 5 the motion amplitude in the simulations was z a a 24 which is the same value as in the experiments the strong variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients around ω 0 8 g a corresponds to the piston mode resonance phenomena very good agreement between the nonlinear computations and the experimental results is found in that area whereas the linear method seems to overpredict the peak values at frequencies without resonant fluid motion the bem results agree very well with linear theory deviations from the experimental values occur at lower frequencies the experimental results show a strong scattering in that range which according to wang and wahab 1971 could be due to structural oscillations of the end boards the cases that were simulated with the fvm represent characteristic marks with regard to the variation of added mass and damping in fig 5 the added mass coefficient becomes rapidly negative inbetween ω 0 77 g a and ω 0 82 g a while the latter marks the minimum value at the same time the damping coefficient reaches zero at ω 0 88 g a figs 6 8 illustrate time histories of the dynamic heave force at these frequencies over one period for z a a 24 and z a a 12 respectively except for the case with ω 0 77 g a and z a a 24 all results visibly deviate from the sinusoidal course of the motion excitation this nonlinear tendency is further stressed when comparing the results corresponding to the lower motion amplitude to the respective curves corresponding to the higher motion amplitude the agreement between the numerical approaches is generally very good visible differences can be identified for z a a 24 at ω 0 82 g a and ω 0 88 g a around the peek values which are somewhat overpredicted by the bem compared to both fvm approaches a visible influence of viscosity can be identified at ω 0 77 g a and z a a 12 the curves of bem and inviscid fvm are very close together in that case while the curve from the viscous fvm shows a small deviation a comparison of the fourier coefficients derived from the respective time histories of the dynamic force at z a a 24 is shown in fig 9 up to order k 3 all results agree well and show the same trends with regard to frequency the first order force amplitude f 1 increases slightly from ω 0 77 g a to ω 0 82 g a and then decreases again towards ω 0 88 g a by looking at the corresponding phase angle the variation of added mass and damping coefficients over frequency fig 5 can be retraced at ω 0 77 g a the first order phase angle ψ 1 is between π and π 2 which according to equation 4 means a positive added mass coefficient on the contrary the phase angle is between zero and π 2 at ω 0 82 g a which leads to a negative added mass coefficient at ω 0 88 g a it becomes almost zero which according to equation 5 means that the damping coefficient is almost zero as well amongst the cases shown in fig 9 the second order force amplitudes are highest at ω 0 82 g a however the relative contribution of the second order force to the overall force is the highest at ω 0 88 g a it is interesting to note that the second order phase angle shows an even stronger variation with frequency than the first order phase angle contributions of the third order force are highest at ω 0 82 g a but rather small at all three sample frequencies the fourier coefficients corresponding to the motion amplitude z a a 12 are presented in fig 10 by comparison with the results corresponding to z a a 24 in fig 9 a very pronounced difference can be found regarding the first order force amplitudes at ω 0 82 g a the nondimensional value is significantly lower at the larger motion amplitude while at ω 0 77 g a it is higher this further demonstrates the nonlinear relationship between body motion and the forces as doubling the motion amplitude does not result in twice the force amplitude i e a constant nondimensional value additionally the significance of second order force components seems to increase with motion amplitude a factor that might influence the behaviour of force coefficients observed here is a dependence of the resonance frequency on the motion amplitude which was also found by bonfiglio and brizzolara 2018 the presented time histories of the dynamic forces and the corresponding fourier coefficients demonstrate that the three numerical approaches are all able to resolve the nonlinear characteristics of the heave radiation problem and only minor differences between the methods can be taken from the respective plots in order to analyse these differences in detail the force components resulting from the viscous fvm were subtracted from the respective results of inviscid fvm as well as bem the differences were related to the total values from the viscous fvm and are given in table 2 for z a a 24 and in table 3 for z a a 12 considering that the assumptions on fluid viscosity was the only difference between the numerical setups of the two finite volume based approaches the values in the columns titled fvm invisc are taken as a quantitative measure of the influence of viscosity on the force amplitudes amongst the analysed cases the highest value can be found at ω 0 77 g a and z a a 24 for the third order force component however it should be noted that the absolute value of that force component is close to zero thus it s contribution to the overall force is very small see fig 9 regarding the second order force components a notable influence of viscosity of about 5 3 can be found at ω 0 77 g a and z a a 12 the influence of viscosity on the first order force component which arguably has the largest impact on the overall force is below 2 4 amongst all cases the force amplitudes from the bem tend to deviate more from the viscous results than the ones from the inviscid fvm while the agreement generally seems to be better at the higher motion amplitude to further evaluate possible reason for the deviations the free surface elevation is considered in the following figs 11 and 12 show the free surface elevation in the gap at four characteristic time instants for each of the sample frequencies the time instant t 41 00 t corresponds to a motion state with z c y l 0 negative velocity and zero acceleration of the body see equation 2 at t 41 25 t the body has reached it s minimum position z c y l z a with zero velocity and positive acceleration accordingly t 41 5 t means z c y l 0 positive velocity and zero acceleration and t 41 75 t refers to the maximum position z c y l z a zero velocity and negative acceleration from the plots it is evident that all numerical approaches predict a phase shift between the fluid motion and the body motion which depends on frequency such a dependence is in line with experimental findings on moonpools faltinsen et al 2007 as was shown before in figs 9 and 10 the phase angles of the force components also depend on frequency and the strong variation of hydrodynamic coefficients fig 5 can be retraced to the variation of the first order phase angle using equation 4 as the free surface elevation might be seen as an indication of the pressure inside the gap which influences the forces on the body it is suspected that the phase shift of the forces is caused by the phase shift of the fluid motion inside of the gap this would lead to the conclusion that the phase shift of the fluid motion is a reason for the strong variation of the hydrodynamic mass and damping coefficients such an explanation would fit well to the statements made by lewandowski 1992 on the matter the overall free surface level predicted by the different numerical approaches agrees very well in most cases for the motion amplitude of z a a 24 fig 11 the best agreement is found at ω 0 77 g a and ω 0 88 g a where as the term piston mode resonance implies the free surface is nearly flat and varies its level in time at ω 0 82 g a the level difference over one period is largest and the free surface is not entirely flat anymore a possible reason for this behaviour is that lateral velocities are induced when the free surface moves to a large extend along the cylindrical part of the body effectively widening the gap width notable differences regarding exact free surface shape predicted by bem and fvm are present at this frequency in order to evaluate how these differences might be connected to the deviation of force amplitudes table 2 the dynamic pressure distribution on the body at the respective timesteps is given in fig 13 it can be taken that the different shapes at t 41 00 t have no visible effect on the pressure distribution however when the differences of free surface elevation are located closer to body at t 41 25 t slight differences are evident in the pressure distribution as well this time instant roughly corresponds to the maximum dynamic force as shown on the left side of fig 8 the most significant difference in the pressure distribution can be found at t 40 75 t here the differences between the free surface shapes is not larger than before but they occur on a level with the cylindrical part of the body this time instant is close to the minimum of the force which also marks the point in time where deviations between bem and fvm are largest fig 8 left based on these findings different predictions of the free surface shape are suspected to be the main cause for deviations between bem and fvm at z a a 24 a possible reason could be the much finer resolution of the free surface in the fvm additionally the regridding algorithms used with the bem have a filtering effect and could blur certain details of the free surface shape as the influence of these techniques on the free surface shape is relatively higher when the overall free surface amplitude is low it may also give an explanation why the relative agreement between bem and fvm is better at higher motion amplitude see tables 2 and 3 from fig 12 it can be taken that the amplitude of fluid motion in the gap is considerably higher at z a a 12 an interesting case regarding the influence of viscosity is found at ω 0 77 g a both inviscid approaches show a very good agreement here while the results from the viscous fvm deviate the respective dynamic pressure distribution on the body for this case is shown in fig 14 as before the most notable difference in the pressure distribution is found when the free surface level in the gap is lowest t 41 50 t this time instant also marks the minimum of the dynamic force on the right side of fig 6 fig 15 shows the relative velocity fields close to the intersection of free surface and body resulting from the inviscid and viscous fvm calculations at that time instant beside the different level of the free surface a vortex formation can be observed in case of viscous flow assumptions a fact that may favour the vortex generation is that the body has reached it s maximum downward velocity at that time instant while the fluid in the gap is starting to move upward although a clear influence of viscosity can be observed in the flow field the impact on the first order force component is relatively low with 2 0 see table 3 the impact of viscosity on the second order force component is somewhat more pronounced with 5 2 from the relatively low influence of viscosity it is concluded that the highly nonlinear relation between body motion and hydrodynamic forces observed in this study are mainly induced by the free surface this finding is in contrast to investigations on hulls sections with rectangular shape which often indicate that a linearised free surface representation can be sufficiently accurate while viscosity has a strong influence e g kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 a likely reason is that the relevance of vortex shedding is much more pronounced when the edges of the body are sharp moradi et al 2015 at the same time less horizontal velocities are induced when the walls in the gap are exclusively vertical possibly leading to a decreased relevance of nonlinear free surface representations it is well possible that the relevance of viscosity for the semi circular hull shape will be higher if the motion amplitude is further increased according to the results given by bonfiglio and brizzolara 2018 who investigated the problem up to a motion amplitude of z a a 3 using a viscous fvm the flow would also be strongly characterized by wave breaking phenomena in this case although the bem in combination with the mel approach is capable of capturing very steep waves phenomena like wave breaking and air inclusions can not be accounted for at this point the boundary element method would reach its limit not only because it neglects viscosity but also because the free surface can not be tracked anymore in a physically meaningful way taking into consideration that the free surface already reaches very close to the bottom of the hull in certain time instances e g ω 0 77 g a t 41 50 t in fig 12 higher motion amplitudes were regarded out of scope for this study another factor that may increase the relevance of viscosity are very small hull distances zhao et al 2018 the hull distance that was chosen in this study corresponds to the closest hull distance which was experimentally studied by wang and wahab 1971 it is believed to be a realistic lower limit for practical hull distances of multi hull ships for instance the ratio between gap size and draft of the catamaran examined by lugni et al 2004 was 1 625 whereas in the case investigated here it was 1 0 6 conclusion a numerical study on the heave radiation problem of a twin hull section with semi circular shape was carried out three different numerical approaches were used to solve the flow problem in time domain a nonlinear boundary element method a finite volume method incorporating inviscid flow assumptions and a finite volume method incorporating viscous flow assumptions focus was laid on frequencies at which piston like resonant flow occurred in the gap between the hulls first order force components were validated against existing experimental measurements and compared to published results from linear potential theory subsequently the forces and free surface elevation in the gap resulting from the different numerical approaches were compared in detail at three frequencies and two motion amplitudes respectively based on the results the following conclusions are drawn all three approaches are able to predict valid added mass and damping coefficients for the presented problem and show a significant improvement over linearised potential methods in that regard the strong variation of hydrodynamic coefficients goes along with a change of the phase shift between body motion and fluid motion in the gap the nonlinear characteristics of the dynamic force predicted by the three approaches are in very good agreement a significant influence of second order force components is found with the corresponding phase angle varying strongly over frequency significance of higher order force components seem to increase with motion amplitude the free surface in the gap is considered the main cause for nonlinearity in the cases examined deviations between the dynamic force predicted by bem and fvm are mainly associated with a different prediction of the free surface elevation in vicinity to the body thus an accurate representation of the free surface shape is considered highly relevant for a numerical analysis of the problem in particular when the free surface is close to the bottom of the hull impact of viscosity on the dynamic forces was found to be relatively low throughout the examined cases vortex shedding in vicinity of the intersection between body and free surface was found in one case which had an impact on the pressure distribution in that time instant however the dynamic force amplitudes were still in good agreement all in all the study demonstrates that the nonlinear dependence of forces on body motion associated with the radiation problem of twin hulls with semi circular shape at low to moderate motion amplitudes can be recovered well using inviscid methods thus the nonlinear boundary element method presented here is considered a suitable tool for the analysis of piston mode resonance phenomena associated with bodies of rather round shape and feasible alternative to more elaborate tools like the finite volume method future studies may investigate the effects of viscosity for a variety of common hull shapes also motion excitation in different degrees of freedom by external waves may be considered preparing an application of the bem in 2d t based seakeeping analyses of multi hull ships credit authorship contribution statement
