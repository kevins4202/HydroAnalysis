25145,urban water energy we nexus is regarded as highly important in managing resource shortage crisis in city integrating this nexus approach with metabolism framework can provide important insights for sustainable urban planning in this paper we present a comprehensive review on urban we nexus from the perspective of urban metabolism with the objective of less independence and impact on eco environment we make an inventory of alternative sources and associated optimized utilization pathways within urban water system context from resource management provision meanwhile consumption patterns of water and energy in buildings residential sectors and production sectors are also comprehensively reviewed from demand side management provision in general almost all the literatures on urban we nexus have expressed their great ambitions to achieve integrative governance which can be enhanced through a scientific management of the co benefits and trade offs with regard to development pathway planning infrastructure spatial planning as well as corresponding auxiliary intervention in addition future prospects for urban we nexus research are also proposed from the perspectives of conception development methodology improvement and target region extension the results show that 1 the water food energy nexus is a further advance of we nexus while the adoption of sustainable development goals sdgs can provide a renewed and more holistic paradigm for its conception development by incorporating other environmental social and economic systems 2 the conception improvement will also drive the urgent need for a more integrated scientific research tool 3 developing countries deserve a higher priority in urban we nexus network where both greater challenges and opportunities exist keywords water energy nexus urban metabolism urban sustainability 1 introduction worldwide more and more people now live in urban regions rather than in rural regions compared to the only 30 of the global population in 1950 cities currently accommodate 54 of the world s population and by 2050 around 2 5 billion new inhabitants will reside in urban areas un 2014 urbanization process turns out to be one of the most influential social processes in human history as urbanization rate continues to be regarded as an indicator towards economic development and modernization assessment zhao et al 2017 however how to implement sustainable development strategies can be one of the most critical challenges concerning modern city planning urbanization on the one hand is the major cause of environmental problems from air pollution to incipient crises in water and energy availability zhao et al 2017 whereas on the other hand also provides favorable circumstances for technology and policy implementation to be put to action rodriguez et al 2018 in fact a variety of initiatives and examples e g global sustainable cities network 100 resilient cities worldwide have been articulated promising renewed opportunities for cities to shift towards sustainable development rosales carreón and worrell 2018 however one of the main questions facing those opportunities still is how do we set our progress towards sustainable development sachs 2015 to set this progress here we focus on a specific opportunity the combination of urban nexus and metabolism urban areas have long been seen as metabolizing organisms with materials including water and energy distributed among various economic and ecological activities bodini et al 2012 since wolman 1965 firstly proposed the concept of urban metabolism the metabolic analysis is intended to track all the associated flows being imported from ecosystems or other economies circulating among users and leaving the city boundary as emissions or waste to the environment villarroel walker et al 2014 however unlike urban metabolism with concerns always on a single element usually water energy and nutrient urban nexus highlights the intertwined connections of various flows wang and chen 2016 with boundaries may being technological geographical political or administrative liu et al 2018 therefore urban metabolism can help to define a broaden and integrated nexus system of interest this integration thus can bring important insights for sustainable urban planning and management chen and chen 2015 in this paper we focus on two flows water and energy as two fundamental resources to maintain the normal operation and development for city they also present an intertwined linkage in the sense that the supply of one depends on the availability of the other fan et al 2017 2018a 2018b world bank 2017 this so called water energy we nexus is regarded as highly important due to that it can help to work towards an efficient management of resource scarcity chen et al 2014 fan et al 2018a 2018b up to now there have been several papers intended to make a review on the links between water and energy in the urban context for instance kenway et al 2011 systematically analyzes the studies relating to energy intensity within various urban water infrastructure from the perspective of study objectives dimensions and scales vakilifard et al 2018 presents a comprehensive review of the optimization models on the urban we nexus in water supply systems existing papers have made great contribution to a better understanding of urban we nexus with their primary focus on energy and greenhouse gas ghg emission issues within urban water infrastructure whereas some critical issues are still neglected under their review paradigms e g water and energy use in building embodied energy and virtual water flows in urban area thus there is an urgent need for a more holistic paradigm to look into the urban we nexus in a broader view with this in mind this paper attempts to present an urban we nexus review from the perspective of urban metabolism this combination allows us to track the interlinkages along the way that water and energy flows entering circulating within the urban systems and returning to the eco environment see fig 1 whereby it can provide a more profound understanding of we nexus in urban context and bring insights for practical sustainable urban resource management the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a general framework of the urban we nexus issues from the perspective of urban metabolism section 3 makes an inventory of alternative sources and associated optimized utilization pathway within urban water system section 4 provides a review of the consumption patterns of water and energy among different users as well as the issues of virtual water and embodied energy followed by a discussion on the policy implication regarding coherent policy making of the two resources in section 5 ultimately this paper also draws attention on future prospects of urban we nexus in the context of conception development methodology improvement and target region extension in section 6 and the conclusion is presented in section 7 2 we nexus within urban metabolism framework urban areas are concentrated centers of production consumption and waste disposal grimm et al 2008 the way the materials including water and energy flows are imported transformed and returned to eco environment comprises the city s fabric villarroel walker et al 2014 a sustainable urban system requires the achievement of mitigating human impact on natural ecosystems while closing open links between sources and demand subsequently this paper will be conducted from both resource management provision and demand side management provision specifically regarding the resource management city has designed its water infrastructures mostly in the way of linear urban metabolism chen and chen 2015 it gathers water from hinterlands and other cities after inefficient resource utilization waste streams with valuable remains contained are thrown away agudelo vera et al 2012 two major drawbacks of this kind of metabolism lie in that it can result in a high metabolic rate of resources consumption as well as severe pollution caused by massive waste disposal at this point circular metabolism promising less independence and impact on eco environment via a high utilizing rate of different urban potential resources has been advocated as an advanced paradigm with this in mind this paper attempts to make an inventory of alternative sources and corresponding optimized utilization pathway within water supply system with concerns on environmental sustainability and economic viability investigating it may also need to entail issues in relation to energy when considering the implications of the we nexus in terms of demand side it mainly concerns water and energy flows that circulate among various users from this side this paper will investigate the consumption patterns of water and energy within buildings residential sectors and production sectors with highlights on the twisted conservation pathways via technology improvement and behavior modification in addition the indirect interactions will also be extracted based on goods exchanges among sectors within a city as well as among various cities given that it can bring some new prospects to reduce urban metabolic rate 3 resource management in urban water system the conventional sources of water for urban areas are locally sourced surface water and groundwater smith et al 2018 as for those areas where easily available surface water and groundwater sources have been depleted a proper solution of meeting growing water demands and mitigating its dependence on eco environment is seeking for renewable and secondary sources i e the outputs from human activities that can be used as an input to other human activities hence in this section we will focus on water desamination and wastewater reclamation two dominated unconventional sources utilization technologies currently 3 1 desalinated water desalination is one of the most important methods to produce potable water by removing the salt content from sea water or brackish water in 2012 the installed seawater desalination plants can provide about 5000 million m3 potable water worldwide dawoud and mulla 2012 in the coming decades desalination capacity will sustain a rapid growth since in many regions such as the middle east and north africa the shortage of water will be met mostly through desalination world bank 2012 considering future desalination development particular emphasis should be placed on its energy use as it is responsible for one of the mostly concerned environmental issues i e climate change and the major expense in desalination as well missimer and maliva 2018 at present desalination has been regarded one of the most energy intensive water production technologies available plappally and lienhard v 2012 despite reverse osmosis ro technology owing to its advantages on lower cost and energy demand has dominated the worldwide installed desalination capacity with a share of 65 miller et al 2015 desalinating one cubic meter of water still needs electricity at the range of 2 4 kw h shemer and semiat 2017 especially given that most of the desalination plants temporally are powered by electricity generated from fossil fuels with less than 1 of capacity dependent on renewables irena 2015 operation of desalination can cause a considerable amount of ghg emissions under current technical conditions this stems from the view that desalination development is in a dilemma that it can lower the dependence on eco environment via high unconventional water consumption rate from metabolism provision whereas more impacts on eco environment will be caused from the nexus provision tackling it on the one hand relies on energy efficiency improvement amy et al 2016 warsinger et al 2016 on the other hand identifying available renewable energy and associated adoption approaches for desalination plant can also make great contribution to dilemma management khayet 2013 malek et al 2016 particularly the salinity gradient energy due to the lacking of saline solutions dealing with the considerable amounts of saline waters worldwide has been considered a potential candidate of renewable energy to provide new prospects of improving energy consumption patterns in desalination plant helfer and lemckert 2015 pressure retarded osmosis pro is one of the technologies can generate renewable energy from salinity gradient despite the pro technology development is still in its infancy helfer and lemckert 2015 sahin et al 2017a has confirmed that pro technology will help to make desalination plants more sustainable in terms of energy consumption and climate change mitigation 3 2 reclaimed water in a linear water metabolism wastewater treatment assumes the role of removing biological and chemical pollutants from water before releasing the clean water to the environment panepinto et al 2016 while in the circular metabolism reclaimed water is regarded as a crucial secondary source to address water pollution and water scarcity problems imagining that if technology enables complete recycling at lower energy consumption water efficiency will be less important pamminger and kenway 2008 especially reclaimed water is an on site water resource as it can be produced at or near the same location as water consumption chhipi shrestha et al 2017b however globally only 7000 million m3 of reclaimed water is utilized in 2011 comprising 0 59 of total water use eu 2016 for wastewater treatment water quality criteria are extremely important as they determine the application of reclaimed water as well as corresponding energy consumption for the reclamation panepinto et al 2016 the operational energy requirement and associated ghg emissions will increase when more strict disposal standards are adopted foley et al 2010 this implies a similar dilemma with desalination that it can help to work towards environment protection and less dependence on eco environment but with the cost of additional contribution to climate change regarding wastewater treatment the dilemma can be managed through several approaches first energy efficiency improvement and alternative renewable energy adoption are still major approaches to address water scarcity while improve overall ecosystem well being henriques and catarino 2017 it also has been approved that corresponding retrofit implementation can receive great promotion stimulated by economic tools such as price scheme if the levelized cost of energy is lower than the true cost of electricity around 33 55 of the electricity demand for wastewater treatment plant is capable to be covered with a power portfolio of wind turbine photovoltaic panels and internal combustion engine fueled by biogas brandoni and bošnjaković 2017 furthermore the function between reclaimed water use and energy consumption exists in the sense that the different reuse applications imply the variety of water quality required and corresponding treatment types needed which can further make implications on energy consumption chhipi shrestha et al 2017a with this in mind the notion of fit to purpose is also evolving as an attractive solution to optimize the energy use for wastewater treatment chhipi shrestha et al 2017a b finally the mostly highlighted approach in corresponding literatures to improve energy use patterns in wastewater treatment is energy recovery from advanced municipal sewage treatment systems which promises an entirely new framework of the interlinkages among water energy and pollution in urban areas kollmann et al 2017 silvestre et al 2015 it is estimated that the producing energy from the biogas generated in the process lowered the energy and ghg footprints of wastewater infrastructure by 0 10 kw h m3 and 0 08 kg co2 eq m3 respectively singh and kansal 2018 another study also shows that the reclaimed energy can nearly meet the whole energy requirement of water supply sector and even potentially generate surplus energy from wastewater kumar and saroj 2014 ghg emissions are usually generated from the energy use while it is not the case in wastewater treatment considering the diversity of both ghg emissions sources and types three major ghg emission sources are energy use treatment process and chemical use it is calculated that the average annual ghg emissions from urban water utility operation in china accounted for 41 mt co2 eq during the period of 2006 2012 58 of them come from energy use while treatment process and chemical use account for 40 and 2 respectively zhang et al 2017 furthermore what should be further emphasized in wastewater treatment plants is that co2 is not the only ghg that concerns other ghg emissions such as methane ch4 generated from specific biological or chemical process involved in the pollutant removal stage should be carefully dealt with hussey and pittock 2012 for example the ghg footprint of wastewater infrastructure assessed in singh and kansal 2018 is 1 426 kg co2 eq m3 with biogenic ghg emissions i e co2 n2o and ch4 accounted while those without biogenic ghg emissions accounting is 0 23 0 61 kg co2 eq m3 flores alsina et al 2011 and 0 47 kg co2 eq m3 jennifer and arpad 2010 as a result efficient emission control needs an integrated plan with different emission resources and ghg types in wastewater plants 4 demand side management among consumers 4 1 water and energy consumption in infrastructure buildings are responsible for a large proportion of water and energy consumption bertone et al 2018b in the united state approximately 40 of all primary energy and 75 of all electricity produced are consumed within buildings eia 2015 whilst water consumption within buildings accounts for 12 of total water withdrawals in this country maupin et al 2014 there are many major initiatives that have promised great benefits in terms of reducing water and energy demand and corresponding environmental impacts sarkar et al 2014 with respect to buildings energy performance it can be improved by use of roof top solar energy system mateus et al 2018 biomass boilers for heating las heras casas et al 2018 while in terms of water performance promotion it is usually refer to the development of decentralized water systems such as grey water recycling wanjiru and xia 2017 and rain water harvesting system silva vieira et al 2013 ward et al 2012 assessing energy issues in relation to these decentralized water systems in buildings have become one of the most stressed topics when considering water and energy uses in building from nexus thinking upshaw et al 2017 for a long time large scale centralized water system infrastructure has been regarded as the foundation of a city to provide water service for urban development however with concerns on its considerable energy consumption and ghg emissions decentralized water system has been gradually regarded as an attractive alternative solution given its economic and environmental effects mahgoub et al 2010 siems and sahin 2016 talebpour et al 2014 for example cheung et al 2013 examines the optimized pumping energy through the arrangement of water tanks in buildings and finds that the energy efficiency of high rise water supply systems can be improved from existing level of 0 25 to 0 26 0 37 via water storage tank relocations corresponding saved electricity is estimated to be 160 410 tj per year about 0 1 0 3 of the total annual electricity consumption in this region in another study a proposed integrated thermal energy and auxiliary water e g rainwater greywater etc storage and management systems can reduce on peak air conditioning electric power demand by over 75 and the rainwater collection subsystem within it can reduce municipal water consumption by approximately 53 89 upshaw et al 2017 consequently a paradigm shift based on a decentralized infrastructure turns out to be a better choice in improving overall water system and a sustainable water system is a combination of decentralized and centralized water systems rather than only investment in centralized water systems alone mahgoub et al 2010 in addition since the urban ecology has been placed high level considering urban sustainability corresponding water and energy demand are now the subjects of increasing attention in research and practice irrigation of green spaces in cities helps to reduce thermal stress which also requires a balance between water and energy results from yang and wang 2015 show that the soil temperature controlled irrigation can reduce annual building energy consumption and the combined energy water cost by around 6 compared to the no irrigation case chhipi shrestha et al 2017c put forward ecological footprint with water consumption energy use and net carbon emissions and residential landscaping systems combined and represented by neighborhood densification issues in urban planning the results reveal a high dependency of per capita ecological footprint on residential density and the xeriscaping can reduce per capita ecological footprint ranging from roughly 1 reduction in high density to 66 in low density neighborhood 4 2 water and energy consumption in residential and production sectors in residential sectors water and energy also present a significant interdependency due to the utilization patterns in household almost 33 2 of the total water consumed by resident needs a pre heating process before use while 62 of the total consumption generated by all end uses i e lighting cooling ventilation domestic hot water and other equipment for the residence is intended for heating water ndoye and sarr 2008 in fact energy demand associated with water end use is estimated far more considerable than that for water supply and wastewater treatment services kenway et al 2011 rothausen and conway 2011 subsequently a comprehensive assessment of water related energy use within residential activities can bring important insights into resource conservation through technological improvement or behavioral modification usually it is conducted via survey or in home audits to collect data kenway et al 2016 sanders and webber 2015 it shows that the activities within households that contribute most significantly to water related energy use wre include shower use hot water system efficiency losses and clothes washer usage among which shower use is highlighted as a consistent influence on wre across households binks et al 2016 in fact the highly intertwined interconnection between water and energy within residential sector also brings about great potentials to achieve the co benefits of water saving and energy conservation the effects of energy efficiency improvement strategies on water saving has been examined in the city of bologna italy where results show that with an upfront investment of 17 million euro bologna s households could be equipped with cost effective measures reducing the total domestic water consumption of 34 by 2020 compared to the 2012 with additional 28 5 million euro a more efficient appliance can reach to a 37 of water conservation by 2020 topi et al 2016 at the same time the research of jiang et al 2016 also proves that the annual saved energy thorough decreasing water use in tianjin china can reach to 16 9 billion kwh accounting for 24 of total energy consumption for non production purposes similar co benefits also exist in industrial sectors given that water and energy are both indispensable inputs for production activities it has been confirmed that the energy saving measures in industrial sector can make progress towards achieving water use conservation gu et al 2014 since the co benefits of water conservation resulting from energy saving vary greatly among different sectors to maximize the synergies energy and water conservation technologies should be promoted in key industrial sectors gu et al 2016 4 3 indirect interactions between water and energy water and energy are natural as well as economic resources thus can be investigated from either real or virtual perspective huang et al 2013 virtual water and embodied energy reflect the amount of real water and energy already used for a product or construction investigating them is of great importance due to that the indirect flows take up a large proportion of the total flows consumed by users wang et al 2017 and it can help to provide a big picture of resource utilization patterns 4 3 1 virtual water and embodied energy at city scale physical flows of water and energy resources are also hidden in economic commercial trade virtual water and embodied energy trade strategies have been shown to be an important measure to alleviate corresponding scarcity and inequitable distribution issues feng et al 2014 thinking that when virtual resource trade from cities where productivity is relatively high to cities where productivity is relatively low it may imply real resource saving at the global scale huang et al 2013 in addition investigating virtual urban metabolism at city scale can also help to identify the critical sectors and pathways for urban nexus management wang et al 2017 through investigating the inner relationships across sectors fang and chen 2017 identifies the most influential sectors in beijing the results show that agricultural sector and food processing sector provide the biggest supply push effect on the beijing economy as the upstream of water resources while the dependence of fundamental resources on other regions mainly reflected by real estate industry and the electricity sector where large amounts of water and energy resources are imported from other economic sectors or other regions to satisfy their final demand not only within one single city virtual water and embodied energy flows also frequently exchange among cities as a result urban metabolic analysis has been adopted for urban agglomerations research as well hao et al 2018 the multiregional network approach presents great potential for bridging nexus analysis with sustainable planning for urban agglomerations by simultaneously mitigating the energy and water burden besides the resource dependence relationships between sectors and regions will also show a significant change under urban agglomeration nexus framework a study with respect to beijing tianjin hebei region shows that the nexus effect on energy and water networks for beijing is bigger than those of tianjin and hebei and beijing and tianjin are dependent on hebei for water and energy resources while hebei is more self sufficient wang and chen 2016 4 3 2 embodied energy in urban water system the embedded energy refers to the amount of energy already used for a given product or for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure and equipment huang et al 2013 since modern urban water system is dominated by centralized water infrastructure the embodied energy can take a great share of the total energy use i e the direct energy use and embodied energy use previous study even shows that indirect energy of water supply is greater than direct energy mo et al 2010 shao et al 2013 an empirical study on the wastewater infrastructure in delhi indicates that the embodied energy in chemicals and infrastructures materials take the share of 10 and 30 respectively of the total energy consumed by wastewater infrastructure singh and kansal 2018 it suggests a longer designed lifetimes for it can lower its average energy footprint while this choice may increase the energy footprint in the initial years of operation therefore designing wastewater treatment plants in a modular format where capacity additions are carried out in stages to keep pace with the increase in population can be appropriate in addition different water supply options also show a significant heterogeneity with respect to embodied energy for example the embodied energy use for groundwater system turns out to be lower than that for surface water system by 31 mainly because of fewer chemicals used for treatment mo et al 2011 5 integrative policy making insights from co benefit and trade off management almost all the literatures on the we nexus have expressed their great ambitions to achieve integrative policy making and overcome the unintended consequences due to uncoherent policy among different sectors weitz et al 2017 urban nexus thinking indicates that the development plan of one sector can impose significant implications on the other either positive or negative implying both co benefit and trade off will exist in future development pathways of water and energy accordingly in this section we will identify three major fields under urban metabolism framework where great opportunities may exist on achieving optimized co benefit and trade off management in order to provide practical insights into integrative policy making 5 1 coherent macro development pathway planning a fundamental challenge for future cities transition into more sustainable and resilient forms is to reduce the metabolism throughput while improve the overall eco environment well being pamminger and kenway 2008 in general the metabolism throughput reduction can be enhanced by exploring all possible options of renewable and secondary sources to be utilized within cities while less impact on eco environment well being should be fulfilled by figuring out corresponding optimized resource utilization pathways by adopting nexus thinking accordingly in terms of urban energy metabolism promoting renewable energy power generation is preferred compared to nuclear power in the context of urban climate change adaptation strategies since water footprint in renewable power generation is much lower than that in nuclear power generation huang et al 2017 liu et al 2015 at the same time the trade off between advanced water supply and treatment technologies and the corresponding upsurge of the energy requirements and associated ghg emission require the policy makers to apply optimized water service strategies for a sustainable low carbon urban water supply system wri 2015 in addition a broader nexus thinking also indicates that policies in other fields may also impose implications on water and energy resources management for example the ultra low emission control policy on coal fired power industry in the beijing tianjin hebei region could reduce the emissions of so2 nox and dust by 89 90 and 88 respectively while at the same time it will consume an average of 2 less energy and 8 more water as trade offs wang et al 2018 5 2 optimized infrastructure spatial planning rational spatial plan for urban building and infrastructure can also make great contribution to minimize the required water and energy and improve the options for recycling of water and overall efficiencies liu et al 2017 sahin et al 2017b hybrid desalination plant is an example of integrated infrastructure to produce water and electricity it adopts an innovative process to integrate thermal power generation and desalination whereby the electricity cost of desalination processes can be lower and waste heat from power plant can be reused as heat source for desalination wwap 2014 similarly a common construction of wastewater treatment plant and power generation where wastewater is served as an available option for cooling and waste heat becomes a useful part of wastewater treament process is also capable to makes it more efficient than the stand alone option i e a separate power plant or desalination plant veil 2007 in addition sahin et al 2017b confirms that an optimized operating regime for hydropower plant and desalination can maintain adequate water security integrate renewable energy into electricity generation portfolio while simultaneously lower the long term marginal cost of water supply in sydney the complex interlinkages between water and energy systems requires a more systematic approach coping with strategic complementarities and potential synergies between domains particularly considering the rising cost of water supply mainly resulting from greater energy input it has been highlighted that taking into account the regional variability and the associated costs of water supply infrastructure yields suggestions for optimal energy technology investments that are different from the results reached when variability and costs are not included world bank 2017 consequently energy and water infrastructure planning must be better integrated to optimized investment and avoid inefficiencies 5 3 corresponding auxiliary incentive intervention there is no doubt that some cutting edge scientific and technological development can impose great implications on the production and consumption patterns of resource worldwide scientific communities have engaged in finding technological approaches to reduce urban metabolic rate via resource utilization efficiency improvement renewed resource adoption water and energy reclamation however besides the scientific challenges of such technological developments another major obstacle to appropriate implementation of all these strategies is the massive requirement of financial investment this may rely on government s support by implementing some economic incentive interventions the price shceme is one of the most effective approaches existing studies have proved that competitive water prices supported by strong regulation can lead to greater wastewater reclamation smith et al 2018 and electricity price also promote the electricity demand to be covered with a renewable less intensive as well power portfolio brandoni and bošnjaković 2017 furthermore regarding the financial barriers of building energy and water retrofit potential a novel financing and procurement model can help government s spending towards a financially responsible and net positive manner bertone et al 2018a given the barriers on the technology development roadmap approaches to addressing resource insecurity may also be supplemented with appropriate interventions to highlight the demand side resource conservation probably mainly from residential behavior modification wanjiru and xia 2017 to illustrate the viewpoint lam et al 2016 compares the long term changes in water demand and energy consumption for water supply in two australian regions i e south east queensland seq and perth the per capita water consumption and associated energy use is similar in both regions in 2002 while since then a strong effort of water conservation could be seen in seq during the drought while perth has been increasingly relying on seawater desalination as of 2014 the per capita urban water use in seq is 28 lower than that of perth while the per capita energy use in perth is about five times that of seq and the energy saving benefit from the large scale adoption of water conservation strategies is sufficient to offset the total energy use for seawater desalination and water recycling during the period a water or energy shortage crisis created an opportunity for changing urban water or energy use pattern which in turn yielded long term benefits in water and energy savings lam et al 2016 topi et al 2016 in doing so policy makers should pay priority in demand side measures compared to some technology updating to encourage conservation awareness and behavior modification through economic incentive education and public information media 6 research prospects 6 1 we nexus conception development mapping from wfe nexus to sdgs the water food energy wfe nexus is a further advance of we nexus with a broader set of resource interactions considered the idea of the wfe nexus has drawn global attention since at least the the water energy and food security nexus solutions for the green economy conference in 2011 endo et al 2017 it emphasizes the potential increased pressure on water energy and food resources particularly driven by population expanding urbanization and economic growth which presents communities with an increasing number of trade off among these resources given this more complicated nexus issues the research perspective to wfe nexus will normally depends on the perspective of policy makers if a water perspective is adopted then food and energy systems are users of the water resource fasel et al 2016 hellegers et al 2008 mouratiadou et al 2016 from a food perspective energy and water are both inputs for food supply chain khan and hanjra 2009 smidt et al 2016 while from an energy perspective research focuses include the water requirement for energy sectors the choice of energy crops for biofuel production or for food martín and grossmann 2015 pacetti et al 2015 and there is increasing tendency to discuss the availability of acquiring biofuels such as biogas from food waste and associated environmental benefit menon et al 2016 paschalidou et al 2016 in 2015 the sustainable development goals sdgs are adopted by governments at the un general assembly un 2015 the sdgs are seventeen aspirational objectives representing a broader scope of development objectives expected to guide actions for sustainability covering issues of city i e goal 11 sustainable cities and communities water i e goal 6 clean water and sanitation food i e goal 2 zero hunger and energy i e goal 7 affordable and clean energy the sdgs can bring renewed opportunities to broaden the content of wfe nexus by coupling with other objectives in doing so future nexus researches should define nexus systems of interest at first which can be socially defined or spatially bounded liu et al 2018 then a conceptual framework is required to demonstrate the complex interlinkages across sectors and provide a foundation for further analysis under such a framework methods will be applied for stimulating nexus dynamics finally working with relevant stakeholders to co design and co implement the plans and strategies throughout all the steps illustrated above can enhance the relevance of research by incorporating experiences and needs from the stakeholders endo et al 2015 6 2 main methodologies for quantify the we nexus the connection between resource systems and social economies relies on two major modeling paradigms the bottom up model is an approach that requires accumulating inventories of various processes to make quantitative assessment of the energy water linkage through a detailed description of the engineering technology life cycle assessment lca is the most commonly used bottom up model with respect to we nexus which is mainly used to investigate the energy consumption and associated ghg emissions during every stage of the water system el sayed mohamed mahgoub et al 2010 lyons et al 2009 however the most significant limitation of such models is the incompleteness and lack of reliability of current inventory data sources menzies et al 2007 top down approach in contrast take a macro level perspective to represent the economy in a wide scale to make quantitate assessment of the we nexus usually with a variety of different scenarios setting the input output analysis ioa is used empirically to examine the water and energy flows among different sectors and regions cai et al 2015 fan et al 2019 guo et al 2016 lu and chen 2016 some papers also investigate the synergies between water saving and energy saving in industry liang and zhang 2011 the main weaknesses of the ioa are the use of monetary values and the low level of detail on sector resolution because of sector aggregation this makes the results sensitive to price differences and homogeneities across sectors recently alternative approaches are being developed as hybrids with bottom up and top down combined to overcome particular disadvantages of single approach models mo et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 while many studies aim to develop new methods and tools to make a comprehensive assessment of interactions between water energy and other elements most of researches are at the physical stage dai et al 2018 paying major focus on the quantitative analysis of the nexus issues however referring to the discussion in the above section the we nexus will experience a further evolution by incoperated with a broader set of sustainable goals thereby it relies on a tool with a wilder social economic policy and environmental elements adoption that can help to work towards multidimensional planning 6 3 we nexus in developing countries where greater challenges and opportunities lie the urban we nexus literatures are unevenly distributed across regions developed countries such as the us europe and the australia are the mostly frequently investigated areas despite that in several developing countries e g china and brazil literatures in this field have experienced a rapid growth significant research gaps still remain in other developing countries in fact in the coming decades the developing countries should receive more attention where both significant challenges and opportunities exist with respect to urban we nexus management one the one hand by 2050 the population of the world resided in urban is projected to reach 66 while nearly 90 of the additional 2 5 billion people that make up this increase concentrated in development countries from asia and africa accelerating urbanization coupled by rapid economic growth as well as associated increasing demand in both energy and water demand will make those developing countries subject to the most acute water and energy security problem on the other hand given the presence of existing urban infrastructure is not targeted specifically for resource efficiency nor for the best option of less interdependence and impact on eco environment in the developed world kumar and saroj 2014 great opportunities may also exist for the growing cities of developing economies to realize a remarkable management of urban we nexus with rational infrastructure planning 7 conclusion this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of the urban we nexus from the perspective of urban metabolism the way the urban nexus and metabolism cooperate is an important step for more practical sustainable urban planning this review shows that the sustainability of water and energy for cities can be further advanced through proper measures from both resource management and demand side management generally with respect to resource management water desalination and wastewater reclamation are the two major alternative water sources utilization technologies a shift from conventional sources to renewable and secondary sources will encounter a dilemma of less dependence from metabolism provision but greater impact from nexus provision on eco environment tackling this dilemma efficiency improvement and renewable energy source adoption are the most important approaches to realize optimized utilization of them considering environmental sustainability and economic viability in addition energy reclammation will show great potentials improving the energy use pattern for water systems it has been examined and stressed in wastewater treatment while the case in desalination i e energy reclaimed from salinity gradient is still in its infancy with respect to the demand side management decentralized water system can achieve great economic and environmental effects for the water and energy utilization in building and through technological improvement or behavioral modification great potentials of water saving can be realized by implementing energy conservation measures and vice versa in residential sectors and production sectors moreover virtual water and embodied energy can stress the inner relationship between sectors within a city or the interdependence among cities in the context of water and energy flows embodied in goods transition according to this indirect interaction analysis it can identify the key sectors and pathways for urban nexus management and bring insights for an overall sustainable planning for urban agglomerations for policy makers an integrated energy and water planning can make contribution to the sustainable development of both resources for this purpose cross sectoral cooperation should be encouraged to better manage water and energy co benefit and trade off according to our review three aspects derserve particular attention by policy makers including coherent macro development pathway planning optimized infrastructure spatial planning as well as corresponding auxiliary interventions intended to financing incentive and awareness encourage in terms of future prospects of urban we nexus under metabolism framework we make a summarization from the perspectives of conception development methodology improvement and target region extension from this comprehensive review overall the we nexus is a starting point from which a broader set of resource interactions should be involved into this nexus approach the wfe nexus is a further advance of we nexus while the sdgs may bring renewed opportunities to broaden the content of wfe nexus this conception development as a result can also drive the urgent need for more integrated scientific research tools to improve the resolution and analytical capacity regarding the impacts trade offs and co benefits from interventions in one urban system on others regarding the research target region developing countries deserve a higher priority in urban we nexus network where both greater challenges and opportunities exist acknowledgements the authors

25145,urban water energy we nexus is regarded as highly important in managing resource shortage crisis in city integrating this nexus approach with metabolism framework can provide important insights for sustainable urban planning in this paper we present a comprehensive review on urban we nexus from the perspective of urban metabolism with the objective of less independence and impact on eco environment we make an inventory of alternative sources and associated optimized utilization pathways within urban water system context from resource management provision meanwhile consumption patterns of water and energy in buildings residential sectors and production sectors are also comprehensively reviewed from demand side management provision in general almost all the literatures on urban we nexus have expressed their great ambitions to achieve integrative governance which can be enhanced through a scientific management of the co benefits and trade offs with regard to development pathway planning infrastructure spatial planning as well as corresponding auxiliary intervention in addition future prospects for urban we nexus research are also proposed from the perspectives of conception development methodology improvement and target region extension the results show that 1 the water food energy nexus is a further advance of we nexus while the adoption of sustainable development goals sdgs can provide a renewed and more holistic paradigm for its conception development by incorporating other environmental social and economic systems 2 the conception improvement will also drive the urgent need for a more integrated scientific research tool 3 developing countries deserve a higher priority in urban we nexus network where both greater challenges and opportunities exist keywords water energy nexus urban metabolism urban sustainability 1 introduction worldwide more and more people now live in urban regions rather than in rural regions compared to the only 30 of the global population in 1950 cities currently accommodate 54 of the world s population and by 2050 around 2 5 billion new inhabitants will reside in urban areas un 2014 urbanization process turns out to be one of the most influential social processes in human history as urbanization rate continues to be regarded as an indicator towards economic development and modernization assessment zhao et al 2017 however how to implement sustainable development strategies can be one of the most critical challenges concerning modern city planning urbanization on the one hand is the major cause of environmental problems from air pollution to incipient crises in water and energy availability zhao et al 2017 whereas on the other hand also provides favorable circumstances for technology and policy implementation to be put to action rodriguez et al 2018 in fact a variety of initiatives and examples e g global sustainable cities network 100 resilient cities worldwide have been articulated promising renewed opportunities for cities to shift towards sustainable development rosales carreón and worrell 2018 however one of the main questions facing those opportunities still is how do we set our progress towards sustainable development sachs 2015 to set this progress here we focus on a specific opportunity the combination of urban nexus and metabolism urban areas have long been seen as metabolizing organisms with materials including water and energy distributed among various economic and ecological activities bodini et al 2012 since wolman 1965 firstly proposed the concept of urban metabolism the metabolic analysis is intended to track all the associated flows being imported from ecosystems or other economies circulating among users and leaving the city boundary as emissions or waste to the environment villarroel walker et al 2014 however unlike urban metabolism with concerns always on a single element usually water energy and nutrient urban nexus highlights the intertwined connections of various flows wang and chen 2016 with boundaries may being technological geographical political or administrative liu et al 2018 therefore urban metabolism can help to define a broaden and integrated nexus system of interest this integration thus can bring important insights for sustainable urban planning and management chen and chen 2015 in this paper we focus on two flows water and energy as two fundamental resources to maintain the normal operation and development for city they also present an intertwined linkage in the sense that the supply of one depends on the availability of the other fan et al 2017 2018a 2018b world bank 2017 this so called water energy we nexus is regarded as highly important due to that it can help to work towards an efficient management of resource scarcity chen et al 2014 fan et al 2018a 2018b up to now there have been several papers intended to make a review on the links between water and energy in the urban context for instance kenway et al 2011 systematically analyzes the studies relating to energy intensity within various urban water infrastructure from the perspective of study objectives dimensions and scales vakilifard et al 2018 presents a comprehensive review of the optimization models on the urban we nexus in water supply systems existing papers have made great contribution to a better understanding of urban we nexus with their primary focus on energy and greenhouse gas ghg emission issues within urban water infrastructure whereas some critical issues are still neglected under their review paradigms e g water and energy use in building embodied energy and virtual water flows in urban area thus there is an urgent need for a more holistic paradigm to look into the urban we nexus in a broader view with this in mind this paper attempts to present an urban we nexus review from the perspective of urban metabolism this combination allows us to track the interlinkages along the way that water and energy flows entering circulating within the urban systems and returning to the eco environment see fig 1 whereby it can provide a more profound understanding of we nexus in urban context and bring insights for practical sustainable urban resource management the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a general framework of the urban we nexus issues from the perspective of urban metabolism section 3 makes an inventory of alternative sources and associated optimized utilization pathway within urban water system section 4 provides a review of the consumption patterns of water and energy among different users as well as the issues of virtual water and embodied energy followed by a discussion on the policy implication regarding coherent policy making of the two resources in section 5 ultimately this paper also draws attention on future prospects of urban we nexus in the context of conception development methodology improvement and target region extension in section 6 and the conclusion is presented in section 7 2 we nexus within urban metabolism framework urban areas are concentrated centers of production consumption and waste disposal grimm et al 2008 the way the materials including water and energy flows are imported transformed and returned to eco environment comprises the city s fabric villarroel walker et al 2014 a sustainable urban system requires the achievement of mitigating human impact on natural ecosystems while closing open links between sources and demand subsequently this paper will be conducted from both resource management provision and demand side management provision specifically regarding the resource management city has designed its water infrastructures mostly in the way of linear urban metabolism chen and chen 2015 it gathers water from hinterlands and other cities after inefficient resource utilization waste streams with valuable remains contained are thrown away agudelo vera et al 2012 two major drawbacks of this kind of metabolism lie in that it can result in a high metabolic rate of resources consumption as well as severe pollution caused by massive waste disposal at this point circular metabolism promising less independence and impact on eco environment via a high utilizing rate of different urban potential resources has been advocated as an advanced paradigm with this in mind this paper attempts to make an inventory of alternative sources and corresponding optimized utilization pathway within water supply system with concerns on environmental sustainability and economic viability investigating it may also need to entail issues in relation to energy when considering the implications of the we nexus in terms of demand side it mainly concerns water and energy flows that circulate among various users from this side this paper will investigate the consumption patterns of water and energy within buildings residential sectors and production sectors with highlights on the twisted conservation pathways via technology improvement and behavior modification in addition the indirect interactions will also be extracted based on goods exchanges among sectors within a city as well as among various cities given that it can bring some new prospects to reduce urban metabolic rate 3 resource management in urban water system the conventional sources of water for urban areas are locally sourced surface water and groundwater smith et al 2018 as for those areas where easily available surface water and groundwater sources have been depleted a proper solution of meeting growing water demands and mitigating its dependence on eco environment is seeking for renewable and secondary sources i e the outputs from human activities that can be used as an input to other human activities hence in this section we will focus on water desamination and wastewater reclamation two dominated unconventional sources utilization technologies currently 3 1 desalinated water desalination is one of the most important methods to produce potable water by removing the salt content from sea water or brackish water in 2012 the installed seawater desalination plants can provide about 5000 million m3 potable water worldwide dawoud and mulla 2012 in the coming decades desalination capacity will sustain a rapid growth since in many regions such as the middle east and north africa the shortage of water will be met mostly through desalination world bank 2012 considering future desalination development particular emphasis should be placed on its energy use as it is responsible for one of the mostly concerned environmental issues i e climate change and the major expense in desalination as well missimer and maliva 2018 at present desalination has been regarded one of the most energy intensive water production technologies available plappally and lienhard v 2012 despite reverse osmosis ro technology owing to its advantages on lower cost and energy demand has dominated the worldwide installed desalination capacity with a share of 65 miller et al 2015 desalinating one cubic meter of water still needs electricity at the range of 2 4 kw h shemer and semiat 2017 especially given that most of the desalination plants temporally are powered by electricity generated from fossil fuels with less than 1 of capacity dependent on renewables irena 2015 operation of desalination can cause a considerable amount of ghg emissions under current technical conditions this stems from the view that desalination development is in a dilemma that it can lower the dependence on eco environment via high unconventional water consumption rate from metabolism provision whereas more impacts on eco environment will be caused from the nexus provision tackling it on the one hand relies on energy efficiency improvement amy et al 2016 warsinger et al 2016 on the other hand identifying available renewable energy and associated adoption approaches for desalination plant can also make great contribution to dilemma management khayet 2013 malek et al 2016 particularly the salinity gradient energy due to the lacking of saline solutions dealing with the considerable amounts of saline waters worldwide has been considered a potential candidate of renewable energy to provide new prospects of improving energy consumption patterns in desalination plant helfer and lemckert 2015 pressure retarded osmosis pro is one of the technologies can generate renewable energy from salinity gradient despite the pro technology development is still in its infancy helfer and lemckert 2015 sahin et al 2017a has confirmed that pro technology will help to make desalination plants more sustainable in terms of energy consumption and climate change mitigation 3 2 reclaimed water in a linear water metabolism wastewater treatment assumes the role of removing biological and chemical pollutants from water before releasing the clean water to the environment panepinto et al 2016 while in the circular metabolism reclaimed water is regarded as a crucial secondary source to address water pollution and water scarcity problems imagining that if technology enables complete recycling at lower energy consumption water efficiency will be less important pamminger and kenway 2008 especially reclaimed water is an on site water resource as it can be produced at or near the same location as water consumption chhipi shrestha et al 2017b however globally only 7000 million m3 of reclaimed water is utilized in 2011 comprising 0 59 of total water use eu 2016 for wastewater treatment water quality criteria are extremely important as they determine the application of reclaimed water as well as corresponding energy consumption for the reclamation panepinto et al 2016 the operational energy requirement and associated ghg emissions will increase when more strict disposal standards are adopted foley et al 2010 this implies a similar dilemma with desalination that it can help to work towards environment protection and less dependence on eco environment but with the cost of additional contribution to climate change regarding wastewater treatment the dilemma can be managed through several approaches first energy efficiency improvement and alternative renewable energy adoption are still major approaches to address water scarcity while improve overall ecosystem well being henriques and catarino 2017 it also has been approved that corresponding retrofit implementation can receive great promotion stimulated by economic tools such as price scheme if the levelized cost of energy is lower than the true cost of electricity around 33 55 of the electricity demand for wastewater treatment plant is capable to be covered with a power portfolio of wind turbine photovoltaic panels and internal combustion engine fueled by biogas brandoni and bošnjaković 2017 furthermore the function between reclaimed water use and energy consumption exists in the sense that the different reuse applications imply the variety of water quality required and corresponding treatment types needed which can further make implications on energy consumption chhipi shrestha et al 2017a with this in mind the notion of fit to purpose is also evolving as an attractive solution to optimize the energy use for wastewater treatment chhipi shrestha et al 2017a b finally the mostly highlighted approach in corresponding literatures to improve energy use patterns in wastewater treatment is energy recovery from advanced municipal sewage treatment systems which promises an entirely new framework of the interlinkages among water energy and pollution in urban areas kollmann et al 2017 silvestre et al 2015 it is estimated that the producing energy from the biogas generated in the process lowered the energy and ghg footprints of wastewater infrastructure by 0 10 kw h m3 and 0 08 kg co2 eq m3 respectively singh and kansal 2018 another study also shows that the reclaimed energy can nearly meet the whole energy requirement of water supply sector and even potentially generate surplus energy from wastewater kumar and saroj 2014 ghg emissions are usually generated from the energy use while it is not the case in wastewater treatment considering the diversity of both ghg emissions sources and types three major ghg emission sources are energy use treatment process and chemical use it is calculated that the average annual ghg emissions from urban water utility operation in china accounted for 41 mt co2 eq during the period of 2006 2012 58 of them come from energy use while treatment process and chemical use account for 40 and 2 respectively zhang et al 2017 furthermore what should be further emphasized in wastewater treatment plants is that co2 is not the only ghg that concerns other ghg emissions such as methane ch4 generated from specific biological or chemical process involved in the pollutant removal stage should be carefully dealt with hussey and pittock 2012 for example the ghg footprint of wastewater infrastructure assessed in singh and kansal 2018 is 1 426 kg co2 eq m3 with biogenic ghg emissions i e co2 n2o and ch4 accounted while those without biogenic ghg emissions accounting is 0 23 0 61 kg co2 eq m3 flores alsina et al 2011 and 0 47 kg co2 eq m3 jennifer and arpad 2010 as a result efficient emission control needs an integrated plan with different emission resources and ghg types in wastewater plants 4 demand side management among consumers 4 1 water and energy consumption in infrastructure buildings are responsible for a large proportion of water and energy consumption bertone et al 2018b in the united state approximately 40 of all primary energy and 75 of all electricity produced are consumed within buildings eia 2015 whilst water consumption within buildings accounts for 12 of total water withdrawals in this country maupin et al 2014 there are many major initiatives that have promised great benefits in terms of reducing water and energy demand and corresponding environmental impacts sarkar et al 2014 with respect to buildings energy performance it can be improved by use of roof top solar energy system mateus et al 2018 biomass boilers for heating las heras casas et al 2018 while in terms of water performance promotion it is usually refer to the development of decentralized water systems such as grey water recycling wanjiru and xia 2017 and rain water harvesting system silva vieira et al 2013 ward et al 2012 assessing energy issues in relation to these decentralized water systems in buildings have become one of the most stressed topics when considering water and energy uses in building from nexus thinking upshaw et al 2017 for a long time large scale centralized water system infrastructure has been regarded as the foundation of a city to provide water service for urban development however with concerns on its considerable energy consumption and ghg emissions decentralized water system has been gradually regarded as an attractive alternative solution given its economic and environmental effects mahgoub et al 2010 siems and sahin 2016 talebpour et al 2014 for example cheung et al 2013 examines the optimized pumping energy through the arrangement of water tanks in buildings and finds that the energy efficiency of high rise water supply systems can be improved from existing level of 0 25 to 0 26 0 37 via water storage tank relocations corresponding saved electricity is estimated to be 160 410 tj per year about 0 1 0 3 of the total annual electricity consumption in this region in another study a proposed integrated thermal energy and auxiliary water e g rainwater greywater etc storage and management systems can reduce on peak air conditioning electric power demand by over 75 and the rainwater collection subsystem within it can reduce municipal water consumption by approximately 53 89 upshaw et al 2017 consequently a paradigm shift based on a decentralized infrastructure turns out to be a better choice in improving overall water system and a sustainable water system is a combination of decentralized and centralized water systems rather than only investment in centralized water systems alone mahgoub et al 2010 in addition since the urban ecology has been placed high level considering urban sustainability corresponding water and energy demand are now the subjects of increasing attention in research and practice irrigation of green spaces in cities helps to reduce thermal stress which also requires a balance between water and energy results from yang and wang 2015 show that the soil temperature controlled irrigation can reduce annual building energy consumption and the combined energy water cost by around 6 compared to the no irrigation case chhipi shrestha et al 2017c put forward ecological footprint with water consumption energy use and net carbon emissions and residential landscaping systems combined and represented by neighborhood densification issues in urban planning the results reveal a high dependency of per capita ecological footprint on residential density and the xeriscaping can reduce per capita ecological footprint ranging from roughly 1 reduction in high density to 66 in low density neighborhood 4 2 water and energy consumption in residential and production sectors in residential sectors water and energy also present a significant interdependency due to the utilization patterns in household almost 33 2 of the total water consumed by resident needs a pre heating process before use while 62 of the total consumption generated by all end uses i e lighting cooling ventilation domestic hot water and other equipment for the residence is intended for heating water ndoye and sarr 2008 in fact energy demand associated with water end use is estimated far more considerable than that for water supply and wastewater treatment services kenway et al 2011 rothausen and conway 2011 subsequently a comprehensive assessment of water related energy use within residential activities can bring important insights into resource conservation through technological improvement or behavioral modification usually it is conducted via survey or in home audits to collect data kenway et al 2016 sanders and webber 2015 it shows that the activities within households that contribute most significantly to water related energy use wre include shower use hot water system efficiency losses and clothes washer usage among which shower use is highlighted as a consistent influence on wre across households binks et al 2016 in fact the highly intertwined interconnection between water and energy within residential sector also brings about great potentials to achieve the co benefits of water saving and energy conservation the effects of energy efficiency improvement strategies on water saving has been examined in the city of bologna italy where results show that with an upfront investment of 17 million euro bologna s households could be equipped with cost effective measures reducing the total domestic water consumption of 34 by 2020 compared to the 2012 with additional 28 5 million euro a more efficient appliance can reach to a 37 of water conservation by 2020 topi et al 2016 at the same time the research of jiang et al 2016 also proves that the annual saved energy thorough decreasing water use in tianjin china can reach to 16 9 billion kwh accounting for 24 of total energy consumption for non production purposes similar co benefits also exist in industrial sectors given that water and energy are both indispensable inputs for production activities it has been confirmed that the energy saving measures in industrial sector can make progress towards achieving water use conservation gu et al 2014 since the co benefits of water conservation resulting from energy saving vary greatly among different sectors to maximize the synergies energy and water conservation technologies should be promoted in key industrial sectors gu et al 2016 4 3 indirect interactions between water and energy water and energy are natural as well as economic resources thus can be investigated from either real or virtual perspective huang et al 2013 virtual water and embodied energy reflect the amount of real water and energy already used for a product or construction investigating them is of great importance due to that the indirect flows take up a large proportion of the total flows consumed by users wang et al 2017 and it can help to provide a big picture of resource utilization patterns 4 3 1 virtual water and embodied energy at city scale physical flows of water and energy resources are also hidden in economic commercial trade virtual water and embodied energy trade strategies have been shown to be an important measure to alleviate corresponding scarcity and inequitable distribution issues feng et al 2014 thinking that when virtual resource trade from cities where productivity is relatively high to cities where productivity is relatively low it may imply real resource saving at the global scale huang et al 2013 in addition investigating virtual urban metabolism at city scale can also help to identify the critical sectors and pathways for urban nexus management wang et al 2017 through investigating the inner relationships across sectors fang and chen 2017 identifies the most influential sectors in beijing the results show that agricultural sector and food processing sector provide the biggest supply push effect on the beijing economy as the upstream of water resources while the dependence of fundamental resources on other regions mainly reflected by real estate industry and the electricity sector where large amounts of water and energy resources are imported from other economic sectors or other regions to satisfy their final demand not only within one single city virtual water and embodied energy flows also frequently exchange among cities as a result urban metabolic analysis has been adopted for urban agglomerations research as well hao et al 2018 the multiregional network approach presents great potential for bridging nexus analysis with sustainable planning for urban agglomerations by simultaneously mitigating the energy and water burden besides the resource dependence relationships between sectors and regions will also show a significant change under urban agglomeration nexus framework a study with respect to beijing tianjin hebei region shows that the nexus effect on energy and water networks for beijing is bigger than those of tianjin and hebei and beijing and tianjin are dependent on hebei for water and energy resources while hebei is more self sufficient wang and chen 2016 4 3 2 embodied energy in urban water system the embedded energy refers to the amount of energy already used for a given product or for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure and equipment huang et al 2013 since modern urban water system is dominated by centralized water infrastructure the embodied energy can take a great share of the total energy use i e the direct energy use and embodied energy use previous study even shows that indirect energy of water supply is greater than direct energy mo et al 2010 shao et al 2013 an empirical study on the wastewater infrastructure in delhi indicates that the embodied energy in chemicals and infrastructures materials take the share of 10 and 30 respectively of the total energy consumed by wastewater infrastructure singh and kansal 2018 it suggests a longer designed lifetimes for it can lower its average energy footprint while this choice may increase the energy footprint in the initial years of operation therefore designing wastewater treatment plants in a modular format where capacity additions are carried out in stages to keep pace with the increase in population can be appropriate in addition different water supply options also show a significant heterogeneity with respect to embodied energy for example the embodied energy use for groundwater system turns out to be lower than that for surface water system by 31 mainly because of fewer chemicals used for treatment mo et al 2011 5 integrative policy making insights from co benefit and trade off management almost all the literatures on the we nexus have expressed their great ambitions to achieve integrative policy making and overcome the unintended consequences due to uncoherent policy among different sectors weitz et al 2017 urban nexus thinking indicates that the development plan of one sector can impose significant implications on the other either positive or negative implying both co benefit and trade off will exist in future development pathways of water and energy accordingly in this section we will identify three major fields under urban metabolism framework where great opportunities may exist on achieving optimized co benefit and trade off management in order to provide practical insights into integrative policy making 5 1 coherent macro development pathway planning a fundamental challenge for future cities transition into more sustainable and resilient forms is to reduce the metabolism throughput while improve the overall eco environment well being pamminger and kenway 2008 in general the metabolism throughput reduction can be enhanced by exploring all possible options of renewable and secondary sources to be utilized within cities while less impact on eco environment well being should be fulfilled by figuring out corresponding optimized resource utilization pathways by adopting nexus thinking accordingly in terms of urban energy metabolism promoting renewable energy power generation is preferred compared to nuclear power in the context of urban climate change adaptation strategies since water footprint in renewable power generation is much lower than that in nuclear power generation huang et al 2017 liu et al 2015 at the same time the trade off between advanced water supply and treatment technologies and the corresponding upsurge of the energy requirements and associated ghg emission require the policy makers to apply optimized water service strategies for a sustainable low carbon urban water supply system wri 2015 in addition a broader nexus thinking also indicates that policies in other fields may also impose implications on water and energy resources management for example the ultra low emission control policy on coal fired power industry in the beijing tianjin hebei region could reduce the emissions of so2 nox and dust by 89 90 and 88 respectively while at the same time it will consume an average of 2 less energy and 8 more water as trade offs wang et al 2018 5 2 optimized infrastructure spatial planning rational spatial plan for urban building and infrastructure can also make great contribution to minimize the required water and energy and improve the options for recycling of water and overall efficiencies liu et al 2017 sahin et al 2017b hybrid desalination plant is an example of integrated infrastructure to produce water and electricity it adopts an innovative process to integrate thermal power generation and desalination whereby the electricity cost of desalination processes can be lower and waste heat from power plant can be reused as heat source for desalination wwap 2014 similarly a common construction of wastewater treatment plant and power generation where wastewater is served as an available option for cooling and waste heat becomes a useful part of wastewater treament process is also capable to makes it more efficient than the stand alone option i e a separate power plant or desalination plant veil 2007 in addition sahin et al 2017b confirms that an optimized operating regime for hydropower plant and desalination can maintain adequate water security integrate renewable energy into electricity generation portfolio while simultaneously lower the long term marginal cost of water supply in sydney the complex interlinkages between water and energy systems requires a more systematic approach coping with strategic complementarities and potential synergies between domains particularly considering the rising cost of water supply mainly resulting from greater energy input it has been highlighted that taking into account the regional variability and the associated costs of water supply infrastructure yields suggestions for optimal energy technology investments that are different from the results reached when variability and costs are not included world bank 2017 consequently energy and water infrastructure planning must be better integrated to optimized investment and avoid inefficiencies 5 3 corresponding auxiliary incentive intervention there is no doubt that some cutting edge scientific and technological development can impose great implications on the production and consumption patterns of resource worldwide scientific communities have engaged in finding technological approaches to reduce urban metabolic rate via resource utilization efficiency improvement renewed resource adoption water and energy reclamation however besides the scientific challenges of such technological developments another major obstacle to appropriate implementation of all these strategies is the massive requirement of financial investment this may rely on government s support by implementing some economic incentive interventions the price shceme is one of the most effective approaches existing studies have proved that competitive water prices supported by strong regulation can lead to greater wastewater reclamation smith et al 2018 and electricity price also promote the electricity demand to be covered with a renewable less intensive as well power portfolio brandoni and bošnjaković 2017 furthermore regarding the financial barriers of building energy and water retrofit potential a novel financing and procurement model can help government s spending towards a financially responsible and net positive manner bertone et al 2018a given the barriers on the technology development roadmap approaches to addressing resource insecurity may also be supplemented with appropriate interventions to highlight the demand side resource conservation probably mainly from residential behavior modification wanjiru and xia 2017 to illustrate the viewpoint lam et al 2016 compares the long term changes in water demand and energy consumption for water supply in two australian regions i e south east queensland seq and perth the per capita water consumption and associated energy use is similar in both regions in 2002 while since then a strong effort of water conservation could be seen in seq during the drought while perth has been increasingly relying on seawater desalination as of 2014 the per capita urban water use in seq is 28 lower than that of perth while the per capita energy use in perth is about five times that of seq and the energy saving benefit from the large scale adoption of water conservation strategies is sufficient to offset the total energy use for seawater desalination and water recycling during the period a water or energy shortage crisis created an opportunity for changing urban water or energy use pattern which in turn yielded long term benefits in water and energy savings lam et al 2016 topi et al 2016 in doing so policy makers should pay priority in demand side measures compared to some technology updating to encourage conservation awareness and behavior modification through economic incentive education and public information media 6 research prospects 6 1 we nexus conception development mapping from wfe nexus to sdgs the water food energy wfe nexus is a further advance of we nexus with a broader set of resource interactions considered the idea of the wfe nexus has drawn global attention since at least the the water energy and food security nexus solutions for the green economy conference in 2011 endo et al 2017 it emphasizes the potential increased pressure on water energy and food resources particularly driven by population expanding urbanization and economic growth which presents communities with an increasing number of trade off among these resources given this more complicated nexus issues the research perspective to wfe nexus will normally depends on the perspective of policy makers if a water perspective is adopted then food and energy systems are users of the water resource fasel et al 2016 hellegers et al 2008 mouratiadou et al 2016 from a food perspective energy and water are both inputs for food supply chain khan and hanjra 2009 smidt et al 2016 while from an energy perspective research focuses include the water requirement for energy sectors the choice of energy crops for biofuel production or for food martín and grossmann 2015 pacetti et al 2015 and there is increasing tendency to discuss the availability of acquiring biofuels such as biogas from food waste and associated environmental benefit menon et al 2016 paschalidou et al 2016 in 2015 the sustainable development goals sdgs are adopted by governments at the un general assembly un 2015 the sdgs are seventeen aspirational objectives representing a broader scope of development objectives expected to guide actions for sustainability covering issues of city i e goal 11 sustainable cities and communities water i e goal 6 clean water and sanitation food i e goal 2 zero hunger and energy i e goal 7 affordable and clean energy the sdgs can bring renewed opportunities to broaden the content of wfe nexus by coupling with other objectives in doing so future nexus researches should define nexus systems of interest at first which can be socially defined or spatially bounded liu et al 2018 then a conceptual framework is required to demonstrate the complex interlinkages across sectors and provide a foundation for further analysis under such a framework methods will be applied for stimulating nexus dynamics finally working with relevant stakeholders to co design and co implement the plans and strategies throughout all the steps illustrated above can enhance the relevance of research by incorporating experiences and needs from the stakeholders endo et al 2015 6 2 main methodologies for quantify the we nexus the connection between resource systems and social economies relies on two major modeling paradigms the bottom up model is an approach that requires accumulating inventories of various processes to make quantitative assessment of the energy water linkage through a detailed description of the engineering technology life cycle assessment lca is the most commonly used bottom up model with respect to we nexus which is mainly used to

such models is the incompleteness and lack of reliability of current inventory data sources menzies et al 2007 top down approach in contrast take a macro level perspective to represent the economy in a wide scale to make quantitate assessment of the we nexus usually with a variety of different scenarios setting the input output analysis ioa is used empirically to examine the water and energy flows among different sectors and regions cai et al 2015 fan et al 2019 guo et al 2016 lu and chen 2016 some papers also investigate the synergies between water saving and energy saving in industry liang and zhang 2011 the main weaknesses of the ioa are the use of monetary values and the low level of detail on sector resolution because of sector aggregation this makes the results sensitive to price differences and homogeneities across sectors recently alternative approaches are being developed as hybrids with bottom up and top down combined to overcome particular disadvantages of single approach models mo et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 while many studies aim to develop new methods and tools to make a comprehensive assessment of interactions between water energy and other elements most of researches are at the physical stage dai et al 2018 paying major focus on the quantitative analysis of the nexus issues however referring to the discussion in the above section the we nexus will experience a further evolution by incoperated with a broader set of sustainable goals thereby it relies on a tool with a wilder social economic policy and environmental elements adoption that can help to work towards multidimensional planning 6 3 we nexus in developing countries where greater challenges and opportunities lie the urban we nexus literatures are unevenly distributed across regions developed countries such as the us europe and the australia are the mostly frequently investigated areas despite that in several developing countries e g china and brazil literatures in this field have experienced a rapid growth significant research gaps still remain in other developing countries in fact in the coming decades the developing countries should receive more attention where both significant challenges and opportunities exist with respect to urban we nexus management one the one hand by 2050 the population of the world resided in urban is projected to reach 66 while nearly 90 of the additional 2 5 billion people that make up this increase concentrated in development countries from asia and africa accelerating urbanization coupled by rapid economic growth as well as associated increasing demand in both energy and water demand will make those developing countries subject to the most acute water and energy security problem on the other hand given the presence of existing urban infrastructure is not targeted specifically for resource efficiency nor for the best option of less interdependence and impact on eco environment in the developed world kumar and saroj 2014 great opportunities may also exist for the growing cities of developing economies to realize a remarkable management of urban we nexus with rational infrastructure planning 7 conclusion this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of the urban we nexus from the perspective of urban metabolism the way the urban nexus and metabolism cooperate is an important step for more practical sustainable urban planning this review shows that the sustainability of water and energy for cities can be further advanced through proper measures from both resource management and demand side management generally with respect to resource management water desalination and wastewater reclamation are the two major alternative water sources utilization technologies a shift from conventional sources to renewable and secondary sources will encounter a dilemma of less dependence from metabolism provision but greater impact from nexus provision on eco environment tackling this dilemma efficiency improvement and renewable energy source adoption are the most important approaches to realize optimized utilization of them considering environmental sustainability and economic viability in addition energy reclammation will show great potentials improving the energy use pattern for water systems it has been examined and stressed in wastewater treatment while the case in desalination i e energy reclaimed from salinity gradient is still in its infancy with respect to the demand side management decentralized water system can achieve great economic and environmental effects for the water and energy utilization in building and through technological improvement or behavioral modification great potentials of water saving can be realized by implementing energy conservation measures and vice versa in residential sectors and production sectors moreover virtual water and embodied energy can stress the inner relationship between sectors within a city or the interdependence among cities in the context of water and energy flows embodied in goods transition according to this indirect interaction analysis it can identify the key sectors and pathways for urban nexus management and bring insights for an overall sustainable planning for urban agglomerations for policy makers an integrated energy and water planning can make contribution to the sustainable development of both resources for this purpose cross sectoral cooperation should be encouraged to better manage water and energy co benefit and trade off according to our review three aspects derserve particular attention by policy makers including coherent macro development pathway planning optimized infrastructure spatial planning as well as corresponding auxiliary interventions intended to financing incentive and awareness encourage in terms of future prospects of urban we nexus under metabolism framework we make a summarization from the perspectives of conception development methodology improvement and target region extension from this comprehensive review overall the we nexus is a starting point from which a broader set of resource interactions should be involved into this nexus approach the wfe nexus is a further advance of we nexus while the sdgs may bring renewed opportunities to broaden the content of wfe nexus this conception development as a result can also drive the urgent need for more integrated scientific research tools to improve the resolution and analytical capacity regarding the impacts trade offs and co benefits from interventions in one urban system on others regarding the research target region developing countries deserve a higher priority in urban we nexus network where both greater challenges and opportunities exist acknowledgements the authors

25146,the identification of principles explaining the development of ecosystems has been a major target of systems ecology and ecological modelling among these principles the thermodynamic goal functions gfs named emergy and eco exergy are recognised as methods unfolding the role of matter and energy flows in the functioning of ecological systems the biophysical assessment of natural capital stocks is based on the evaluation of matter and energy flows invested by nature for their generation in this paper the emergy and eco exergy methods were used to account for the natural capital value of two mediterranean marine protected areas mpas located in southern italy in particular the assessment focused on four main habitats 1 sciaphilic hard bottom coralligenous bioconstruction 2 photophilic hard bottom 3 soft bottom and 4 posidonia oceanica seagrass bed the emergy method allowed the assessment of natural capital in terms of direct and indirect solar energy flows invested for its generation while the eco exergy method accounted for the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in biomass stocks the sciaphilic hard bottom showed a high emergy density value in the two mpas 2 06 1012 and 7 22 1011 sej m 2 confirming the high convergence of input resource flows in the formation of this habitat this high value reflects the effort of nature in the formation of this habitat and therefore it suggests the need for its consideration in conservation strategies instead posidonia oceanica seagrass bed showed the highest value of eco exergy density in both mpas 3 56 106 and 3 54 106 kj m 2 the eco exergy results were influenced by two main factors 1 the large biomass density of posidonia oceanica and 2 the high ß value of posidonia oceanica reflecting its evolutionary history that involved the acquisition of key adaptations for the successful colonization of marine environments the integration between emergy and eco exergy methods resulted in a useful approach to account for different nature values based on a biophysical perspective such a perspective could complement economic evaluations based on market criteria

the value of natural capital stocks in four benthic habitats of two mediterranean marine protected areas mpas located in southern italy 2 materials and methods 2 1 the area of study santa maria di castellabate smc and costa degli infreschi e della masseta cim 40 17 n 14 56 e and 40 0 n 15 26 e are two italian mpas located along the coast of the national park of cilento vallo di diano e alburni campania region southern italy they were established in 2009 to protect their high marine biodiversity the two mpas have an extension of 7095 and 2332 ha with a coastline of 18 and 14 km respectively like all the italian mpas smc and cim are characterized by three subareas with different levels of protection and accessibility namely zone a zone b and zone c fig 1 in zone a no take no access zone the maximum level of protection is enforced e g tourist access is not allowed while diving is only authorized for research purposes in zone b general protection zone more activities are allowed e g swimming authorized professional and recreational fishing lastly zone c partial protection zone allows the highest degree of human activities the zone a b and c respectively cover about 2 42 and 56 of the total area in the smc mpa and 2 20 and 78 in the case of cim mpa all the habitats included within the boundaries of the two mpas were identified through the analysis of the bionomic maps and clustered into four macro habitats fig 2 1 sciaphilic hard bottom shb coralligenous bioconstruction 2 photophilic hard bottom phb 3 soft bottom sb and 4 posidonia oceanica seagrass bed psb in the case of smc mpa the shb phb sb and psb cover about 6 4 49 and 41 of the total protected area respectively in the case of cim mpa the shb phb sb and psb cover about 1 2 91 and 6 of the total protected area respectively a heterogeneous marine environment characterizes both the mpas noteworthy is the presence of the endemic mediterranean seagrass posidonia oceanica and coralligenous bioconstructions both representing priority habitats protected under the european directive 92 43 eec habitat directive besides their ecological importance these habitats also represent main tourist attractions enhancing recreational activities such as boating and diving 2 2 sampling procedures and data analysis ad hoc sampling campaigns were performed to collect data on macrobenthic communities and necto benthic fishes of each habitat the average depth of sampling for shb phb sb and psb were 30 m 5 m 20 m and 15 m respectively macrobenthic organisms were sampled using the air lift scraping air lift technique chemello and russo 1997 sampling was randomly replicated three times in each habitat using different frames 40 40 cm in shb and phb 50 50 20 cm in sb and 100 100 cm in psb after sorting species were identified and clustered in the following main taxonomic groups algae annelida ascidiacea bryozoa crustacea porifera echinodermata mollusca and sipuncula dry weights of the different macrobenthic groups were obtained by using a drying oven and then converted to grams of ash free dry weight afdw and grams of carbon gc through appropriate conversion factors brey 2016 necto benthic fishes were sampled through visual census strip transects of 5 20 m harmelin vivien et al 1985 randomly performed on the different investigated habitats fish biomass was eventually estimated using the length weight relationship of each species average biomass data on the groups epiphytes microphytobenthos phytoplancton and posidonia were estimated from literature boudouresque et al 2006 charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 the matrix of the biomass density calculated for all the main taxonomic groups was the basis for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy natural capital assessment 2 3 the emergy accounting method emergy is an environmental accounting method measuring the cumulative environmental support to a process odum 1988 1996 the method aims at evaluating the environmental performance of a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016a b franzese et al 2009 2014 according to this method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar equivalent joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 mass energy labor and money inputs to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to calculate the total emergy support in this study emergy accounting was used for assessing the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the investigated mpas according to the biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting method described in vassallo et al 2017 in particular the model was implemented through the following main steps 1 identification of the spatial and temporal boundaries of the main habitats of the two mpas 2 biomass inventory of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic groups in the habitats of the mpas 3 trophodynamic analysis providing an estimate of the primary productivity supporting the benthic trophic web in the different habitats 4 natural capital assessment through the calculation of the main matter and energy flows supporting the generation of natural capital stocks in the different habitats of the mpas and the conversion of these flows into solar emergy units the flows of n and p assimilated in organic matter were calculated through the ratio c n p 41 7 1 according to redfield et al 1963 the uevs used in this study table 1 were updated to the 1 20 1025 sej yr 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown et al 2016a b 2 4 the eco exergy accounting method eco exergy is a method accounting for the available energy of all living biotic components in an ecosystem compared to the non living state i e the detritus the eco exergy accounts for the chemical energy in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in living organisms providing a measure of the organizational level of an ecosystem jørgensen and mejer 1979 eco exergy for living organisms is calculated according to the following equation eco exergy ß b f where ß is a weighting factor expressing the information content of the organism s genes b is the organism s biomass in grams and f is the value of work energy per unit of biomass this value can slightly change among different aquatic taxonomic groups and it is higher for animals with a high fat content in this study according to jørgensen 2015 the average value of 18 7 kj g was used the eco exergy of an ecosystem is calculated as the sum of the eco exergy values of all the organisms present in that ecosystem in this study eco exergy was applied to assess the total work capacity of benthic ecosystems in the investigated mpas ash free dry weights per unit area of the different taxonomic groups were multiplied by the relative ß values table 2 the resulting values were then summed to obtain the total eco exergy value of each habitat 3 results fig 3 shows the systems diagram modelling the investigated mpas and drawn according to a standardized energy systems language odum 1994 1996 the systems diagram highlights a the main external driving forces supporting the generation of natural capital stocks b the producers consumers and main storages of the marine ecosystem and c the interactions among components this symbolic model is useful to implement the quantitative assessment of mass and energy flows and stocks included within the boundaries of the investigated mpas table 3 shows the main taxonomic groups identified in the habitats of the investigated mpas and relative biomass density expressed in grams of afdw per unit area these biomass values represent the basic information for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy accounting table 4 shows the emergy flows supporting the generation of natural capital stocks in the four habitats of both mpas inputs include natural flows and nutrients that supported the formation of both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks in each of the four investigated habitats in the case of smc the total emergy values range from 2 28 1018 sej for the habitat phb to 2 26 1019 sej for the habitat psb and from 1 98 1017 sej for the habitat shb to 4 95 1018 sej for the habitat sb in the case of cim table 4 the cumulative emergy value of natural capital stocks in the four habitats was 4 06 1019 sej and 6 94 1018 sej for smc and cim respectively these values are extensive measures and therefore depend on the area of the mpas and their relative habitats instead the emergy density values account for the emergy flows concentrated per unit area representing an intensive measure of the emergy support to each habitat the highest value of emergy density was 2 06 1012 sej m 2 for the habitat shb in the case of smc and 1 00 1012 sej m 2 for the habitat phb in the case of cim table 4 table 5 shows the eco exergy value of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic groups included in the four habitats of both mpas the psb habitat showed the highest values of eco exergy density 3 56 106 and 3 54 106 kj m 2 and total eco exergy 1 02 1014 and 5 32 1012 kj for smc and cim respectively the shb and phb also showed high values of eco exergy density while the lowest values were those calculated for sb habitat 4 discussion in this study emergy and eco exergy were used to focus on two complementary aspects the biosphere work needed to generate natural capital stocks and their information content the emergy method allowed for the assessment of the environmental support needed to generate natural capital stocks in the main habitats of the investigated mpas in the case of smc the emergy density value of the shb coralligenous bioconstructions resulted higher than all other habitats this outcome is mainly due to a considerable heterotrophic compartment contributing to 94 of the natural capital value of the shb habitat fig 4 the high emergy cost calculated for the shb habitat shows the high convergence of natural input flows for its generation confirming the importance of coralligenous habitats in coastal marine ecosystems ferrigno et al 2017 casas güell et al 2016 instead in the case of cim the highest emergy density value resulted for the phb habitat algal turf this outcome highlights the importance of the phb habitat playing an important role in the production of primary biomass while generating remarkable stocks of heterotrophic biomass up to the highest levels of food web fig 5 these results suggest that more attention should be placed not only on well known priority key habitats e g coralligenous but also on those habitats less considered by nature conservation strategies and potentially more exposed to human pressure the eco exergy method allowed for the assessment of natural capital stocks in terms of chemical energy stored in organic matter and genetic information embodied in living organisms psb habitat seagrass showed the highest value of eco exergy density in both mpas this result is mainly due to the high ß value of posidonia oceanica 393 table 2 and its high biomass density both determining a high value of eco exergy accounting for about 98 of the eco exergy density in both mpas figs 6 and 7 the ß value of p oceanica one of the most ancient seagrasses reflects its evolutionary history that involved the acquisition of key adaptations for successful colonization of marine environments hemminga and duarte 2000 in addition p oceanica represents one of the most important habitat formers in the mediterranean sea pergent et al 2012 whose primary production generates significant biomass stocks associated with high biodiversity aires et al 2011 figs 8 and 9 show the spatial distribution of the emergy and eco exergy values of natural capital in the two mpas and their current zonation the maps show that in both mpas areas with very high density values of natural capital are currently included in the a and b zones designed to ensure high levels of protection for marine habitats and species the generated maps can provide local managers with useful information to investigate the spatial design of mpas while supporting management plans oriented to nature conservation and sustainable development the emergy and eco exergy methods generated different results providing two complementary perspectives for the biophysical assessment of natural capital stocks in marine ecosystems the two methods showed many similarities they were based on a systemic approach were implemented on the same biomass dataset and allowed comparisons among different ecological systems in addition time dimension is a distinctive feature of both methods emergy is extended back in time to account for the environmental work needed for resource formation while eco exergy implicitly includes the time dimension as a driver of the evolutionary process a critical issue for the application of such methods to marine environments is the need of a large set of biological and physical data requiring considerable time and economic resources to perform ad hoc sampling campaigns in addition the complexity and openness of marine ecosystems represent another challenge for the implementation of environmental accounting models future studies could explore how the network complexity of marine ecosystems may affect the results of emergy and eco exergy assessments 5 conclusions in this study emergy and eco exergy were jointly used to assess the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the main habitats of two mediterranean mpas the parallel use of the emergy and eco exergy methods enabled expressing the high value of coralligenous and posidonia habitats respectively confirming the importance of their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management this study represents one of the first joint applications of emergy and eco exergy assessments to marine ecosystems these biophysical metrics can support local managers and policy makers with information that are complementary with respect to the outcomes of more conventional economic evaluations results suggest that a major effort is needed to develop multicriteria assessment frameworks capable of integrating different biophysical metrics also facilitating the interpretation of research results in decision making processes the adoption of multi criteria approaches addressing the plurality of nature values would be particularly useful in the context of mpas conceived to strike a balance between multiple human uses of marine environment and conservation goals acknowledgement thanks are due to the president and the director of the national park of cilento vallo di diano and alburni for supporting the development of this research

photophilic hard bottom 3 soft bottom and 4 posidonia oceanica seagrass bed the emergy method allowed the assessment of natural capital in terms of direct and indirect solar energy flows invested for its generation while the eco exergy method accounted for the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in biomass stocks the sciaphilic hard bottom showed a high emergy density value in the two mpas 2 06 1012 and 7 22 1011 sej m 2 confirming the high convergence of input resource flows in the formation of this habitat this high value reflects the effort of nature in the formation of this habitat and therefore it suggests the need for its consideration in conservation strategies instead posidonia oceanica seagrass bed showed the highest value of eco exergy density in both mpas 3 56 106 and 3 54 106 kj m 2 the eco exergy results were influenced by two main factors 1 the large biomass density of posidonia oceanica and 2 the high ß value of posidonia oceanica reflecting its evolutionary history that involved the acquisition of key adaptations for the successful colonization of marine environments the integration between emergy and eco exergy methods resulted in a useful approach to account for different nature values based on a biophysical perspective such a perspective could complement economic evaluations based on market criteria

castellabate smc and costa degli infreschi e della masseta cim 40 17 n 14 56 e and 40 0 n 15 26 e are two italian mpas located along the coast of the national park of cilento vallo di diano e alburni campania region southern italy they were established in 2009 to protect their high marine biodiversity the two mpas have an extension of 7095 and 2332 ha with a coastline of 18 and 14 km respectively like all the italian mpas smc and cim are characterized by three subareas with different levels of protection and accessibility namely zone a zone b and zone c fig 1 in zone a no take no access zone the maximum level of protection is enforced e g tourist access is not allowed while diving is only authorized for research purposes in zone b general protection zone more activities are allowed e g swimming authorized professional and recreational fishing lastly zone c partial protection zone allows the highest degree of human activities the zone a b and c respectively cover about 2 42 and 56 of the total area in the smc mpa and 2 20 and 78 in the case of cim mpa all the habitats included within the boundaries of the two mpas were identified through the analysis of the bionomic maps and clustered into four macro habitats fig 2 1 sciaphilic hard bottom shb coralligenous bioconstruction 2 photophilic hard bottom phb 3 soft bottom sb and 4 posidonia oceanica seagrass bed psb in the case of smc mpa the shb phb sb and psb cover about 6 4 49 and 41 of the total protected area respectively in the case of cim mpa the shb phb sb and psb cover about 1 2 91 and 6 of the total protected area respectively a heterogeneous marine environment characterizes both the mpas noteworthy is the presence of the endemic mediterranean seagrass posidonia oceanica and coralligenous bioconstructions both representing priority habitats protected under the european directive 92 43 eec habitat directive besides their ecological importance these habitats also represent main tourist attractions enhancing recreational activities such as boating and diving 2 2 sampling procedures and data analysis ad hoc sampling campaigns were performed to collect data on macrobenthic communities and necto benthic fishes of each habitat the average depth of sampling for shb phb sb and psb were 30 m 5 m 20 m and 15 m respectively macrobenthic organisms were sampled using the air lift scraping air lift technique chemello and russo 1997 sampling was randomly replicated three times in each habitat using different frames 40 40 cm in shb and phb 50 50 20 cm in sb and 100 100 cm in psb after sorting species were identified and clustered in the following main taxonomic groups algae annelida ascidiacea bryozoa crustacea porifera echinodermata mollusca and sipuncula dry weights of the different macrobenthic groups were obtained by using a drying oven and then converted to grams of ash free dry weight afdw and grams of carbon gc through appropriate conversion factors brey 2016 necto benthic fishes were sampled through visual census strip transects of 5 20 m harmelin vivien et al 1985 randomly performed on the different investigated habitats fish biomass was eventually estimated using the length weight relationship of each species average biomass data on the groups epiphytes microphytobenthos phytoplancton and posidonia were estimated from literature boudouresque et al 2006 charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 the matrix of the biomass density calculated for all the main taxonomic groups was the basis for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy natural capital assessment 2 3 the emergy accounting method emergy is an environmental accounting method measuring the cumulative environmental support to a process odum 1988 1996 the method aims at evaluating the environmental performance of a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016a b franzese et al 2009 2014 according to this method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar equivalent joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 mass energy labor and money inputs to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to calculate the total emergy support in this study emergy accounting was used for assessing the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the investigated mpas according to the biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting method described in vassallo et al 2017 in particular the model was implemented through the following main steps 1 identification of the spatial and temporal boundaries of the main habitats of the two mpas 2 biomass inventory of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic groups in the habitats of the mpas 3 trophodynamic analysis providing an estimate of the primary productivity supporting the benthic trophic web in the different habitats 4 natural capital assessment through the calculation of the main matter and energy flows supporting the generation of natural capital stocks in the different habitats of the mpas and the conversion of these flows into solar emergy units the flows of n and p assimilated in organic matter were calculated through the ratio c n p 41 7 1 according to redfield et al 1963 the uevs used in this study table 1 were updated to the 1 20 1025 sej yr 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown et al 2016a b 2 4 the eco exergy accounting method eco exergy is a method accounting for the available energy of all living biotic components in an ecosystem compared to the non living state i e the detritus the eco exergy accounts for the chemical energy in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in living organisms providing a measure of the organizational level of an ecosystem jørgensen and mejer 1979 eco exergy for living organisms is calculated according to the following equation eco exergy ß b f where ß is a weighting factor expressing the information content of the organism s genes b is the organism s biomass in grams and f is the value of work energy per unit of biomass this value can slightly change among different aquatic taxonomic groups and it is higher for animals with a high fat content in this study according to jørgensen 2015 the average value of 18 7 kj g was used the eco exergy of an ecosystem is calculated as the sum of the eco exergy values of all the organisms present in that ecosystem in this study eco exergy was applied to assess the total work capacity of benthic ecosystems in the investigated mpas ash free dry weights per unit area of the different taxonomic groups were multiplied by the relative ß values table 2 the resulting values were then summed to obtain the total eco exergy value of each habitat 3 results fig 3 shows the systems diagram modelling the investigated mpas and drawn according to a standardized energy systems language odum 1994 1996 the systems diagram highlights a the main external driving forces supporting the generation of natural capital stocks b the producers consumers and main storages of the marine ecosystem and c the interactions among components this symbolic model is useful to implement the quantitative assessment of mass and energy flows and stocks included within the boundaries of the investigated mpas table 3 shows the main taxonomic groups identified in the habitats of the investigated mpas and relative biomass density expressed in grams of afdw per unit area these biomass values represent the basic information for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy accounting table 4 shows the emergy flows supporting the generation of natural capital stocks in the four habitats of both mpas inputs include natural flows and nutrients that supported the formation of both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks in each of the four investigated habitats in the case of smc the total emergy values range from 2 28 1018 sej for the habitat phb to 2 26 1019 sej for the habitat psb and from 1 98 1017 sej for the habitat shb to 4 95 1018 sej for the habitat sb in the case of cim table 4 the cumulative emergy value of natural capital stocks in the four habitats was 4 06 1019 sej and 6 94 1018 sej for smc and cim respectively these values are extensive measures and therefore depend on the area of the mpas and their relative habitats instead the emergy density values account for the emergy flows concentrated per unit area representing an intensive measure of the emergy support to each habitat the highest value of emergy density was 2 06 1012 sej m 2 for the habitat shb in the case of smc and 1 00 1012 sej m 2 for the habitat phb in the case of cim table 4 table 5 shows the eco exergy value of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic groups included in the four habitats of both mpas the psb habitat showed the highest values of eco exergy density 3 56 106 and 3 54 106 kj m 2 and total eco exergy 1 02 1014 and 5 32 1012 kj for smc and cim respectively the shb and phb also showed high values of eco exergy density while the lowest values were those calculated for sb habitat 4 discussion in this study emergy and eco exergy were used to focus on two complementary aspects the biosphere work needed to generate natural capital stocks and their information content the emergy method allowed for the assessment of the environmental support needed to generate natural capital stocks in the main habitats of the investigated mpas in the case of smc the emergy density value of the shb coralligenous bioconstructions resulted higher than all other habitats this outcome is mainly due to a considerable heterotrophic compartment contributing to 94 of the natural capital value of the shb habitat fig 4 the high emergy cost calculated for the shb habitat shows the high convergence of natural input flows for its generation confirming the importance of coralligenous habitats in coastal marine ecosystems ferrigno et al 2017 casas güell et al 2016 instead in the case of cim the highest emergy density value resulted for the phb habitat algal turf this outcome highlights the importance of the phb habitat playing an important role in the production of primary biomass while generating remarkable stocks of heterotrophic biomass up to the highest levels of food web fig 5 these results suggest that more attention should be placed not only on well known priority key habitats e g coralligenous but also on those habitats less considered by nature conservation strategies and potentially more exposed to human pressure the eco exergy method allowed for the assessment of natural capital stocks in terms of chemical energy stored in organic matter and genetic information embodied in living organisms psb habitat seagrass showed the highest value of eco exergy density in both mpas this result is mainly due to the high ß value of posidonia oceanica 393 table 2 and its high biomass density both determining a high value of eco exergy accounting for about 98 of the eco exergy density in both mpas figs 6 and 7 the ß value of p oceanica one of the most ancient seagrasses reflects its evolutionary history that involved the acquisition of key adaptations for successful colonization of marine environments hemminga and duarte 2000 in addition p oceanica represents one of the most important habitat formers in the mediterranean sea pergent et al 2012 whose primary production generates significant biomass stocks associated with high biodiversity aires et al 2011 figs 8 and 9 show the spatial distribution of the emergy and eco exergy values of natural capital in the two mpas and their current zonation the maps show that in both mpas areas with very high density values of natural capital are currently included in the a and b zones designed to ensure high levels of protection for marine habitats and species the generated maps can provide local managers with useful information to investigate the spatial design of mpas while supporting management plans oriented to nature conservation and sustainable development the emergy and eco exergy methods generated different results providing two complementary perspectives for the biophysical assessment of natural capital stocks in marine ecosystems the two methods showed many similarities they were based on a systemic approach were implemented on the same biomass dataset and allowed comparisons among different ecological systems in addition time dimension is a distinctive feature of both methods emergy is extended back in time to account for the environmental work needed for resource formation while eco exergy implicitly includes the time dimension as a driver of the evolutionary process a critical issue for the application of such methods to marine environments is the need of a large set of biological and physical data requiring considerable time and economic resources to perform ad hoc sampling campaigns in addition the complexity and openness of marine ecosystems represent another challenge for the implementation of environmental accounting models future studies could explore how the network complexity of marine ecosystems may affect the results of emergy and eco exergy assessments 5 conclusions in this study emergy and eco exergy were jointly used to assess the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the main habitats of two mediterranean mpas the parallel use of the emergy and eco exergy methods enabled expressing the high value of coralligenous and posidonia habitats respectively confirming the importance of their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management this study represents one of the first joint applications of emergy and eco exergy assessments to marine ecosystems these biophysical metrics can support local managers and policy makers with information that are complementary with respect to the outcomes of more conventional economic evaluations results suggest that a major effort is needed to develop multicriteria assessment frameworks capable of integrating different biophysical metrics also facilitating the interpretation of research results in decision making processes the adoption of multi criteria approaches addressing the plurality of nature values would be particularly useful in the context of mpas conceived to strike a balance between multiple human uses of marine environment and conservation goals acknowledgement thanks are due to the president and the director of the national park of cilento vallo di diano and alburni for supporting the development of this research 
25147,lippia javanica l javanica is one of the commonly used ethnobotanical plant species for controlling malaria globally accurate mapping of l javanica species is important for malaria control interventions that require geospatial information for the assessment of malaria distribution and monitoring especially in communities that have limited access to western malaria medicine currently high spatial resolution information pertaining the distribution and habitat suitability of l javanica species is very rare the high resolution mapping could assist in identifying potential niche areas of ethnobotanically important species and to facilitate community health and wellness against malaria in this study we tested the ability of high spatial resolution sentinel 2 s 2 derived variables and shuttle radar topography mission srtm derived topographic variables to predict the distribution of l javanica in the vhembe district municipality south africa the relationship between remote sensing variables and the occurrence data of l javanica was assessed using coefficient of determination r2 here for the first time we compared three commonly used species distribution models logistic regression maxent and ensemble models to derive the best possible subsets of environmental predictors and to produce the species distribution map that could aid in identifying areas were l javanica occurs for use against malaria vectors various validation matrices such as the overall accuracy oa model sensitivity sn and specificity sp and the true skill statistics tss were employed to test the robustness of the resultant models the results showed a superior performance of weighted ensemble model which yielded higher overall accuracy 91 3 tss 0 66 than both logistic regression oa 84 4 tss 0 42 and maxent 95 6 tss 0 73 the indices derived from the sentinel s red edge bands were the most contributory variables in both logistic regression and maxent the normalized difference averaged red edge vegetation index ndarvi and the normalized difference red edge1 vegetation index ndvire contributed 39 25 p 0 0002 and 32 50 in lr and maxent models respectively slope was the most significant srtm derived variable correlated to l javanica occurrence in all models the results of this study show that high resolution sentinel 2 data can be used to map hardy shrub species at higher accuracies using ensemble model the derived occurrence map of l javanica could assist in updating the currently coarse resolution distribution map of species required for its aromatic ecological service against malaria vectors keywords maxent world health organization ensemble modelling habitat mapping 1 introduction in 2015 the world health organization has developed a global technical strategy for malaria 2016 2030 gts 5 endorsed by the world health assembly this strategy promulgated malaria elimination efforts targeted for 2030 with milestone for measuring progress in both 2020 and 2025 who 2008 globally it was recommended that all countries particularly in africa set their own national or subnational targets for accelerating efforts aimed at eliminating malaria transmission and preventing re infections many countries especially in africa have developed their own malaria control plans and subsequent implementations resulted in the decrease in the number of malaria transmissions pierre louis et al 2018 for example many of these countries have adopted the use of insecticide treated nets itns and indoor residual sprays irs which have become cornerstones for malaria control programme who 2008 lengeler 2004 in most african communities the use of repellents of plant origin has been one of the most effective methods for controlling malaria for many years kweka et al 2008 because of their cheaper costs of treatment where such plant species are commonly found and have shown to contain low toxicity to humans and animals ansari et al 2000 many plant species have been effective alternative for repelling malaria vectors and these plant species include lantana camara omicum americanum azadirachta indica and lippia javanica seyoum et al 2002 mabogo 1990 in other parts of africa and indian subcontinent lippia javanica burm f spreng is still one of the commonly used medicinal plants for controlling malaria and for ethnoveterinary purposes maroyi 2017 lukwa 1994 samie et al 2005 kumar and dash 2012 in southern africa l javanica is one of the four indigenous lippia species verbenaceae that occur as erect woody shrubs of approximately 2 m in height viljoen et al 2005 this species is one of the widely used ethnobotanical plants for control of malaria in zimbabwe and south africa for example in the vhembe district municipality of south africa the venda people use l javanica leaf infusions as prophylactic against malaria mabogo 1990 maroyi 2017 today l javanica is still widely used in many communities in africa as a means to keep both nuisance and malaria transmitting mosquitoes at bay mavundza et al 2011 because of l javanica significance as an antimalarial species in southern africa accurate knowledge of species occurrence and habitat delineation is fundamental for continued fight against malaria infections in rural communities this knowledge will further enhance our understanding of suitable habitats for l javanica species amidst changes in climatic conditions which radically alters species distribution and functions dehayes et al 2000 delineating habitats of plant species conventionally relies on ground based surveys which are the most common means for species detection legendre et al 2002 gogol prokurat 2011 through ground based surveys efforts are made to locate plant species of interest along pre defined transects mostly biased towards readily accessible sampling areas malahlela et al 2015 edwards et al 2007 the challenge with ground based surveys rests in the difficulty to account for plant species that occur in inaccessible areas due to hostile terrain and logistical constraints associated with ground based surveys moreover although mapping of species distribution in this manner is mostly accurate the ground based surveys whether of plant or animal communities are often time consuming and costly rocchini et al 2010 in order to overcome the limitations associated with these surveys highly efficient and robust methods are more desirable for species distribution studies west et al 2016a remote sensing offers fast and efficient alternative approach for mapping the potential distribution of plant species this is because remote sensing data is acquired for much larger areas at various spatio temporal and spectral resolutions kempeneers et al 2011 the spatio temporal resolution allows for the detection of plant functioning at species cho et al 2015 kganyago et al 2018 community madonsela et al 2018 or regional levels gould 2000 over time on the other hand the spectral configuration of remote sensing instruments allows for discrimination amongst various plant species and to characterize topographical and environmental features that are associated with habitat of species of interest peng et al 2018 álvarez martínez et al 2017 one of the most ecologically important spectral wavelengths is found in the red edge region 0 705 nm 0 840 nm which is known to detect subtle differences that may arise as a result of various vegetation biophysical and biochemical characteristics mutanga and skidmore 2004 the improved configuration of recent earth observation satellites with extended spectral ranges opens new opportunities for detailed vegetation assessment the launch of sentinel 2 s 2 satellite in june 2015 by the european space agency esa has opened opportunities for high resolution vegetation habitat characterization the vegetation indices vis derived from s 2 broadband wavelengths visible near infrared region have been used to retrieve vegetation biophysical chemical parameters clevers et al 2017 in contrast some studies have shown that the narrow band vis outperform their broadband counterparts de oliveira et al 2017 ramoelo and cho 2018 korhonen et al 2017 due to ability to compensate for signal saturation problem frampton et al 2013 although the broadband vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have been used for species mapping west et al 2016a pau et al 2012 the use of narrow band indices such as those derived from red edge region have rarely been used for species distribution mapping it has not been established whether the s 2 red edge region can significantly improve on the mapping of l javanica distribution additionally the topographical variables such as digital elevation model dem aspect and slope have been widely used to describe topography associated with the species suitable habitat in species distribution mapping guisan and zimmermann 2000 zeng et al 2017 however the successful mapping of l javanica requires the model with high sensitivity to the potential habitat of the species under consideration most of the currently available species distribution models sdms offer a versatile approach to empirically relate the satellite derived environmental variables with distribution of plant species he et al 2015 dudov 2017 some of the most commonly used sdms include the logistic regression padalia et al 2010 lemke and brown 2012 and the maximum entropy model maxent chahouki and sahragard 2016 dudov 2017 ullerud et al 2016 by comparison the performance of maxent model is comparable or superior to other sdms such as the logistic regression model elith et al 2011 although these models are popular and effective for predicting areas of suitable habitat in unsampled locations they have their limitations for example despite its success in species distribution modelling maxent cannot be used to model a species fundamental niche which concerns a full range of environmental conditions a species might occupy not just environmental conditions where species is most likely to be found drake 2014 pulliam 2000 on the other hand the inability of logistic regression model to account for imperfect detection which often leads to biased estimation of habitat relationships is well documented martin et al 2005 these limitations associated with each sdm can be circumvented by ensemble sdm that combines the strength of both logistic regression and maxent thus minimizing errors associated with each model araujo and new 2006 ensemble model is a combination of individual sdm with differing structure explanatory variables and the data sources for the purpose of describing species relationship with the environment however the some pertinent questions arise what contribution do the broad band narrow band vegetation indices and topographical variables have for mapping l javanica species through the use of logistic regression maxent and ensemble models additionally how well do the performance accuracies of logistic regression maxent and ensemble models compare for predicting l javanica distribution at the malaria prone environment the aim of the current study was to map the potential distribution of l javanica lemon bush shrub species in a malaria endemic area using high resolution satellite remote sensing in the current study we hypothesize that the vegetation indices derived from red edge region narrowband of s 2 data are correlated to the potential habitats of l javanica species and can be incorporated into the sdm selected focused in this study we further hypothesized that since both logistic regression model and maxent are binary models with different parameterization requirements the derivation of an ensemble model from the binary model will outperform individual model due to combined error reduction and the leverage of models predictive power 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the vhembe district municipality vdm which is the northernmost district of south africa fig 1 the study area is located at the geographic coordinates of 23 40 s and 30 00 e malahlela et al 2015 the vdm comprises of four local municipalities i e thulamela lm musina lm makhado lm and collins chabane lm the total human population in the vdm is currently over 1 3 million statistics south africa 2016 malahlela et al 2015 with predominantly venda people occupying the western and north and north eastern part of the vdm the study area forms administrative border between south africa and zimbabwe with the limpopo river being the most notable natural boundary between these two countries it comprises of varying topography with diverse floral and faunal biodiversity with adansonia digitata baobab tree as the well known tree species occurring in this region the vdm is situated in the tropical savannah biome which comprise of mixture of c4 grasses and closed canopy trees lehmann et al 2011 asner et al 2004 the vegetation density decreases from east to west with high vegetation density found in the eastern part of the study area mainly in response to rainfall patterns in south africa bond et al 2002 the the study area receives annual rainfall of 820 mm mpandeli 2014 and varied localized rainfall frequencies and quantities occurring closer to soutpansberg mountain kabanda and munyati 2010 it is for this reason that matiwa in the vdm had recorded the average rainfall of 2004 mm over 60 year calculation which is the highest in south africa south african weather service saws 2018 due to semi aridity and tropical conditions prevailing in different parts of the study area malaria transmission exhibit seasonal variation with high malaria incidences usually occurring between september and april most communities in the study area use l javanica species for controlling mosquito bites phaswane and masevhe 2018 thus preventing potential large scale malaria transmissions 2 2 field data field data collection was undertaken in august 2017 for 21 days covering most parts of the vdm the field data was collected purposively across the frequently occurring four vegetation cover classes i shrubland ii grassland iii cropland and iv woodland in each vegetation cover class forty 40 plots of homogenous 30 30 m landscape were randomly stratified and allocated data collection was done within a randomly selected 10 m 10 m sub plot in a larger 30 m 30 m plot where species sightings were recorded as either present 1 of absent 0 the l javanica was spotted mostly under semi open canopy tree species such as young acacia tortilis and usually occurred as single stand of shrub in woodlands and shrublands the geo locations of each plot and species sightings were recorded using a handheld garmin etrex 20 global positioning system gps with the maximum positional accuracy of 3 m a total number of 151 n 151 samples were collected for analysis single or multiple sightings of l javanica within a 10 10 m were recorded as one sample point in order to avoid confusion when accounting the number of samples collected 2 3 remote sensing topographical data s 2 data was used for the study the imagery used were acquired between august 2017 and september 2017 and were downloaded free of charge from copernicus science hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home the s 2 was first launched in june 2015 by the european space agency it has spectral bands ranging from coastal aerosol 443 nm to the shortwave infrared 2190 nm the blue 490 nm green 560 nm red 660 nm and near infrared 842 nm are available at 10 m spatial resolution the red edge1 705 nm red edge2 740 nm red edge3 783 nm red edge4 865 nm shortwave1 1610 nm and shortwave2 2190 nm are available at 20 m spatial resolution while the coastal 443 nm water vapour 945 nm and cirrus band 1375 nm are available at 60 m spatial resolution the elevation data slope and aspect were derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with 30 m spatial resolution 2 4 data pre processing data pre processing was done in three sets i the s 2 data pre processing ii the srtm data pre processing and iii the field data pre processing 2 4 1 sentinel 2 data pre processing of s 2 data involved spatial resampling of wavelengths to address the objectives of the study firstly a total of ten spectral bands n 10 were selected based on their relationship with l javanica distribution these bands are centered at 490 nm absorbed by chlorophyll 560 nm sensitive to plant health such as greenness 660 nm absorbed by chlorophyll 705 nm 865 nm sensitive to subtle variations of vegetation chlorophyll 842 nm sensitive to leaf mass and chlorophyll content 1610 nm sensitive to vegetation moisture content and 2190 sensitive to vegetation moisture and soil minerals malahlela et al 2015 ustin et al 2009 secondly the 10 band s 2 data was subjected to atmospheric correction using sen2cor code in order to minimize atmospheric effect on the target spectra sen2cor uses a large database of look up tables lut derived using an atmospheric radiative transfer model based on libradtran1 müller wilm 2016 thirdly the atmospherically corrected bands were stacked in quantum gis qgis development team 2018 software resulting in six single multispectral imagery with 10 bands each and 20 m spatial resolution the subsequent processing involved spatial resampling of images to 10 m spatial resolution and this was accomplished in sentinels applications platform software snap using nearest neighbour resampling method lastly the 10 m imagery were mosaicked and clipped to cover the entire study area the broad band vegetation indices vis representing photosynthetic pigments such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi senescent vegetation and soil soil adjusted vegetation index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index vegetation and landscape water content normalized difference water index and herbaceous biomass difference vegetation index simple ratios were computed hill 2013 these indices were selected on the basis of their individual sensitivity to vegetation characteristics and their ability to minimize the soil brightness for example the difference vegetation index dvi ndvi and the green ratio vegetation index grvi have shown to be sensitive to vegetation green up biomass and biophysical characteristics such as diversity lecain et al 2000 madonsela et al 2018 however due to the vegetation composition nature of our study area very dense to very sparse vegetation with exposed soil background both the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi were selected to compensate for the effect of high bare soil to vegetation cover ratio the intention was to derive minimum number of indices which takes into account the landscape dynamics in terms of vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties of l javanica habitats at the study area moreover two narrow band red edge indices normalized difference normalized red edge vegetation index normalized difference averaged red edge vegetation index were computed and tested for the study because of their ability to detect subtle variations in vegetation characteristics mutanga and skidmore 2004 table 1 since it is well documented that remote sensing variables and wavelengths are highly correlated in nature the correlation analysis was conducted for all spectral indices used in the study wang et al 2003 only the variables with weak to moderate correlations 0 60 to 0 60 relative to other spectral indices were selected in instances where two variables are correlated with each other but uncorrelated to other variables within the set one variable was selected based on known relationship with the occurrence of l javanica 2 4 2 srtm data the srtm digital elevation dem data was downloaded from the united states geological surveys earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov the dem was clipped to the vdm boundary extent the dem was resampled to a 10 m spatial resolution in qgis for use in maxent and logistic regression models this was done by assigning the same number of spatial dimensions for both longitude x and latitude y so as to match those of a 10 m s 2 multispectral image it was from the same dem where additional environmental datasets such as slope and aspect were derived 2 4 3 field data the preparation of field point data was conducted in microsoft spreadsheet where species locations occurrence and corresponding environmental data were appended a total of 151 presence absence sampling points n 151 was collected during field survey the field data was later imported into arcmap vers 10 esri inc redlands as a shapefile for visualizing preliminary spatial distribution of species occurrence all other environmental remote sensing data were appended on the field data which formed part of the standard dataset to be used for l javanica species mapping 2 5 sample spatial autocorrelation the spatial pattern of every sample location of l javanica was assessed so as to determine the range of spatial autocorrelation of data collected in the field this is usually done because the sampling units might exhibit high similarity with their neighbours at given geographic locations which could result in problematic statistical analysis legendre 1996 for the purpose of this study we have adopted the use of moran s i to test for the spatial autocorrelation of the collected dataset moran 1948 moran s i index is the form of local spatial statistics indicator that quantifies the degree of clustering of a given geographic location of l javanica samples spatial autocorrelation prevails in many field data collection sampling methods and the remote sensing datasets although at various degrees moderate correlation 0 4 0 6 very strong correlation 0 85 0 95 griffith and chun 2016 however for this study we tested the null hypothesis that the locations of l javanica species are not significantly clustered at certain geographical areas within the study area the analysis was done for ranges of 1 km and 10 km 2 6 modelling strategy the correlation between satellite derived variables and the presence absence of l javanica was assessed through the use of pearson correlation coefficient r additionally correlation analysis was also assessed between all environmental variables in order to avoid model over fit due to adding variables with the same contribution in the models appendix 1 in order to predict the distribution of l javanica species the logistic regression hosmer et al 2013 and maxent using maxent version 3 3 3 phillips et al 2006 were tested in the current study a standard field data with presence absence data was used in logistic regression while only the presence records and background values were used for model fitting in maxent it was randomly split into 70 n 106 and 30 n 45 for model calibration and independent model validation respectively logistic regression was used to link the occurrence of l javanica with the set of environmental variables relating to vegetation greenness chlorophyll canopy moisture vegetation biomass aspect elevation and slope logistic regression is a form of generalized linear models glm which relates the binary response outcome presence absence to a linear combination of numerical and categorical variables hosmer and lemeshow 2000 it is given by eq 1 as 1 y i 1 1 e x p β 0 j 1 k β n x n j where yi is the probability of l javanica occurrence 1 or 0 xi is the environmental variable at the jth location βn is the coefficient of xn β0 is an intercept and exp is the exponential function of the regression an automated procedure for selecting variables and final model was adopted because it reduces computation time and tedious modelling malahlela et al 2015 a stepwise logistic regression slr approach was adopted through glm2 and mass packages in r software to minimize multi collinearity and model over fitting collet 1991 a total of ten 10 s 2 predictive variables table 1 and three 3 strm variables were entered in the initial slr model employed in this study in r software package glm2 all the derived variables were entered into the initial model using both forward and backward variable selection criterion this resulted in an automated variable selection without manual entry or removal of variable at each level rossiter and loza 2012 the final model was selected on the basis of lowest aikaike s information criterion aic variable significance and the model contribution the significant model was ultimately used for spatial mapping of l javanica species at the study area on the other hand the maxent algorithm phillips et al 2006 was also tested for predicting the probability of occurrence of l javanica species the modelling was done within the constraints of the listed environmental and the s 2 datasets maxent automatically includes variables interactions and can consider continuous and categorical predictor variables west et al 2016b for this modelling approach only the highest contributory variables were used to calibrate the model fig 2 the samples with data swd file format was used a comma delimited as input for presence localities of l javanica species the same number of presence points used in the logistic regression model was used in maxent with the exception that the absence points were replaced with the background values equivalent to the removed absence points maxent algorithm was implemented with the default regularization so as to avoid too complex a model fourcade et al 2014 dudík et al 2007 although model with adjusted parameters tends to yield higher prediction accuracies merow et al 2013 for the ensemble model both maxent and logistic regression models were combined to form one new model based on simple weighted averaging mean the weighted mean of the resultant combined model is derived from eq 2 as 2 y e n s i 1 n x i w i i 1 n w i where y ens is the ensemble model wi is the allocated weights of values of xi in models 1 and 2 the average weights of 0 55 and 0 45 were assigned to individually high and low performance models respectively such that the ensemble model is biased towards model that performs better the adoption of this dual model ensemble approach was dictated by the overall accuracies of each individual model in order to enhance the predictive skill of the overall ensemble method this unequal weighting would ensure the resultant model outperforms the best participating model by leveraging on the high predictive power of best model while reducing average mean error of ensemble model thuiller et al 2009 in ecology the unequal weighting for ensemble method has not been explored for species mapping although this method has shown success in other fields such as in climatology jun et al 2017 in this study we applied the unequal weighting technique to assess its utility for floral species prediction and mapping all the modelling strategies were performed at pixel size of 10 m 10 m spatial resolution of s 2 imager for the purpose of this study we chose a restricted number of predictive models because it was beyond the aim of this study to include all other available algorithms which have demonstrated higher performance for modelling species in various environmental conditions and at difference spatial scales elith et al 2011 2 7 model evaluation the independent field dataset n 45 was used to assess the accuracy of each predictive model various validation matrices were used in the study to assess the reliability of the predictive models in the current study the predicted probability of l javanica occurrence y through each model ranged from 0 to 1 with increasing likelihood of species occurrence towards a value of 1 therefore in the current study the threshold of 0 6 was used as an optimum cut off value since a value of 0 5 usually represents prediction by random chance baldwin 2009 a 2 2 contingency table with rows indicating predicted cases and columns indicating measured cases were drawn for the threshold value of 0 6 for each model west et al 2016b table 2 provides the accuracy assessment measures adopted for this study the overall accuracy which is the proportion of the correctly classified cases over the total number of cases in the validation dataset was also used as a means to validate each model malahlela et al 2015 3 results the spatial autocorrelation analysis of sampling sites indicate that the samples are not significantly different from random both at 1 km i 0 037 and at 10 km i 0 019 ranges table 3 the preliminary results of descriptive statistics table table 4 show that l javanica tends to be present in areas of higher elevation altitude mainly in the south facing slopes and at locations where vegetation exhibited increasing vigour and biomass regarding vegetation indices the dvi showed high within class dispersion from the means of both l javanica presence and absence sites 16 2 19 2 indicating how this variable may impact of species prediction in sdm s the results obtained in this study allow the acceptance of a hypothesis which states that the narrowband spectral indices red edge indices can be incorporated into sdm s for improved species distribution mapping the correlation analysis has shown that s 2 s ndarvi and the slope derived from srtm were positively and significantly correlated to l javanica occurrence r 0 48 p 0 01 r 0 47 p 0 01 respectively table 5 additionally the ndvire and elevation were the second most significant variables correlated to the species distribution r 0 29 p 0 05 r 0 27 p 0 01 respectively in all the selected predictor variables the sr1 was found to be the least and insignificant correlated variables to the l javanica presence absence r 0 09 p 0 7 the ndwi exhibited the significant and negative correlation to the species distribution r 0 26 p 0 01 the results of a stepwise logistic regression are shown in table 6 a total of six 6 variables mostly significant formed part of the final logistic regression model on the one hand the ndarvi slope and elevation were significantly and positively correlated to l javanica occurrence p 0 001 on the other hand the sr1 and aspect were also positively correlated to l javanica occurrence while ndvire exhibited negative but significant correlation p 0 05 fig 2 shows summary of variable contribution into final model with ndarvi being the highest contributory variable 39 25 moreover on the one hand using the independent validation dataset the logistic regression yielded overall prediction accuracy of 84 4 at a pre defined threshold of 0 6 on the other hand maxent model has resulted in overall classification accuracy of 91 3 in maxent the highest contributory variables were the ndvire 32 50 slope 28 6 and elevation 24 10 respectively fig 2 the combined ensemble model yielded the overall predictive accuracy of 95 6 which is approximately 11 improvement to the prediction made using logistic regression 84 4 while maxent was the second best predictive model in the current study based on these findings we accept the hypothesis that the appropriately configured ensemble method will usually outperform the candidate models used in its construction a 2 2 error matrix table for all three models is shown in table 7 the logistic regression model yielded relatively lower tss 0 42 than both the maxent 0 66 and ensemble 0 73 models fig 3 3 1 predictive maps the predicted maps of the study area through maxent logistic regression and ensemble had similar spatial pattern fig 4 especially for presence probabilities of l javanica high likelihood of l javanica occurrence is predicted in the south central part of the study area by all 3 models the minimum predicted value absence was 0 0 while 0 95 was the maximum predicted occurrence value in each model in maxent the predicted presence distribution of l javanica exhibited a narrow range than in logistic regression 4 discussion this study aimed at mapping the spatial distribution of l javanica lemon bush using s 2 and srtm variables thus providing meaningful contribution to malaria control strategies in the vhembe district of south africa such contribution is highlighted in three important ways 1 the improvement of spatial spectral resolution for species mapping 2 adding another layer of spatial data onto the already existing topographical layer for defining species habitat and potential ethnobotanical plant use and 3 ensemble species mapping for a more robust species distribution and habitat preference in this study we have demonstrated that remote sensing data can aid in predicting the occurrence of l javanica species at 10 m spatial resolution the 10 m spatial resolution allows for more detailed and appropriate species mapping valderrama landeros et al 2017 thus contributing to detailed l javanica species inventory and conservation especially when such species is used as an ethnobotanical plant for malaria control mabogo 1990 maroyi 2017 thus the higher spatial resolution l javanica map derived from s 2 data is an addition to very coarse species maps that are already available in south africa at a resolution lower than quarter degree foden and potter 2005 both the s 2 data and the srtm data can be easily used to mask environment that is clearly unsuitable for the species of interest cord et al 2013 at high spatial resolutions the ndarvi computed as the target mean reflectance of four red edge bands and the red edge1 r 705 ndvi also called ndvire in this study were the most significant s 2 variables the significant and positive correlations between these indices and l javanica distribution suggest that the likelihood of finding this plant species increases with the increase in vegetation vigour the influence of the red edge bands for mapping the distribution of l javanica could be attributed to the fact that there is apparent insensitivity of substrate background e g soil noticed in this spectral region datt and paterson 2000 the red edge bands used in computing ndarvi and red edge1 ndvi ndvire have shown sensitivity to vegetation chlorophyll concentration otunga et al 2018 thus becoming very important for characterizing the distribution of l javanica in semi arid environment for this reason we accept the hypothesis that the spectral indices computed from the narrowband region red edge are correlated to the potential habitats of l javanica and can thus be incorporated in sdm the broad band vegetation indices such as the ndvi and ndwi were among the significant s 2 variables with ndwi contributing the most in maxent while ndvi was the most contributing broadband vegetation index in logistic regression this indicates that although the narrow band indices were mostly significant p 0 001 the broadband indices are also important contributors for explaining variability of species occurrence the low ndvi and sr1 contribution to predictive model shows the inability of the broadband indices to capture subtle vegetation characteristics that define potential micro habitat of l javanica species given the vegetation composition in the study area dense to sparse vegetation types the broad band vegetation indices based on red nir reflectance ndvi have suffered from signal saturation mutanga and skidmore 2004 and this might explain low performance of these indices in individual sdms meanwhile the narrow band vegetation indices are known to circumvent saturation problem that results when using broad band vegetation indices baret et al 1992 mutanga and skidmore 2004 malahlela et al 2015 in this study it was clear that the narrow band red edge vegetation indices were superior to the broad band indices for characterizing habitat where l javanica occurrence was very likely however the correlations between remote sensing variables and the probability of occurrence of l javanica were fairly low although significant r 2 0 5 p 0 05 in the vdm august marks the end of the winter season the period during which most vegetated landscape enter green up growth period it should be noted however that september month marks the onset of spring season where savannah vegetation has reached end of peak or maximum growth cho et al 2017 at the study area the topographic variables slope and elevation derived from srtm data have shown significant correlation with the distribution of l javanica thus contributing significantly to predictive accuracies of logistic regression and maxent models our study showed that slope and elevation play a major role in determining the species potential distribution and this finding is supported by observation made elsewhere by madzimure et al 2011 who concluded that l javanica was commonly found in grasslands on hillsides in zimbabwe in south africa a study conducted by morgenthal et al 2006 found that l javanica sub community occurred predominantly in habitat located at higher altitudes findings from this study support observations made in previous studies which highlighted that the l javanica also occurs in open grassland in the bush as well as on forest margins ng weno et al 2009 although it is thought to be widely distributed on a national scale in this study the species micro scale distribution ecological niche is rather much narrower the species distribution in the vdm is more related to elevation aspect slope and vegetation greenness which are positively correlated to occurrence of l javanica in this study the ensemble sdm has shown to outperform the individual predictive models logistic and maxent this is due to the fact that ensemble modelling combines models that differ in structure explanatory variables and data sources thus allowing inferences that are robust to uncertainties associated with any individual model latif et al 2013 araujo and new 2006 in this study we accept the hypothesis that the ensemble species model will outperform individual model due to combined error reduction and the leverage of models predictive power the ensemble model leverages on the high predictive accuracies sensitivity specificity and the tss of candidate models for improved prediction the ensemble method was thus used to produce the final species distribution map at 10 m spatial resolution we have demonstrated that the ensemble model for mapping l javanica species which usually occurs as a few stands in various environments e g roadsides grassland riverine areas and bushes this finding is similar to the one by marmion et al 2009 who found that the weighted average ensemble model and mean ensemble model provided significantly more robust predictions than all the single models and the other consensus methods from the results it becomes apparent that maxent outperformed the logistic regression model with the overall accuracy difference of approximately 6 9 by utilizing the weighted average ensemble method a 10 improvement in the model overall accuracy was achieved over what was achieved through the use of binary logistic regression however it should be noted that ensemble methods do not always improve the prediction as their accuracies are largely dependent on the individual models this means that if the input models have low accuracies and perhaps statistically insignificant predictor variables the performance of a resultant ensemble model will often be negatively impacted additionally although ensemble approach usually yields better results for species prediction multiple candidate models for ensemble modelling still require careful development and selection latif et al 2013 assigning higher weight to maxent model 0 55 maxent vs 0 45 logistic regression has resulted in the improvement of prediction capability of sdm and thus this study advocates for the use of ensemble modelling for species distribution the pattern of the predicted species presence at the study area is very important to understanding the environmental factors associated with species recruitment proliferation and densities however the species absence although largely ignored in sdm s also provide more complex information about the species and the associated environment rather than a mere lack of suitability lobo et al 2010 for example l javanica is largely absent in the western part of the study area which is characterized by drier conditions than the areas of predicted species presence on the other hand due to dispersal limitations e g ecological barrier such at soutpansberg mountain it is possible that l javanica does not occupy all suitable areas and as such caution should be exercised when interpreting the presence results of the predictive maps the conservation of l javanica in its natural environment is very essential because of the species relative accessible and cost effectiveness to the local communities in areas prone to malaria moreover the distribution of l javanica is mostly valuable in areas where western medicine is inaccessible as a result of high cost or where such medicine is unavailable light et al 2005 mavundza et al 2011 due to its medicinal popularity as a mosquito repellent among the communities living in malaria prone areas l javanica occurrence and abundance warrant consistent monitoring since such species forms part of the bigger one health approach because the analysis in the current study was done from a single s 2 image set the time series analysis could aid in validating the accuracy of the ensemble modelling results found in this study by providing a multi temporal variation in vegetation phenology moreover collection of more presence points could aid in more accurate generalization of the predictive models and this could in turn improve the performance of the sdm s used in the study collecting additional data to increase the sample size is very crucial because the performance of sdm is optimal when the sample size is fairly large and when species of interest has a narrow niche than a generalist species hernandez et al 2006 the list spectral indices used in the current study is not comprehensive and other sentinel derived indices such as those sensitive to chlorophyll may be correlated to the species presence absence data lu et al 2015 sonobe and wang 2017 and thus shedding light on species detection monitoring and conservation additionally combining satellite data with environmental data such as soil type distance to the roads distance from the rivers or water bodies shrub patch characteristics and soil nutrients data could improve the modelling of l javanica species 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated for the first time modelling approaches for mapping l javanica species by combination of srtm and sentinel 2 derived variables the sentinel 2 vegetation indices have exhibited significant correlation with the distribution of lippia javanica in the vhembe district on the one hand the ndarvi a normalized index based on average reflectance four red edge bands was the most significant variable when predicting species distribution using logistic regression while red edge1 ndvi ndvire was the highest contributing predictor variable in maxent model on the other hand the ndvi and ndwi have shown correlation with the distribution of l javanica species at least at micro scale habitat the variables derived from srtm such as elevation slope and aspect were amongst the most highly contributing variables in all models pollnac et al 2012 the maxent model performed better than logistic regression 91 3 and 84 4 respectively while the combined weighted ensemble model yielded more than 11 improvement to the logistic regression model 95 6 and 84 4 respectively this study advocates the use of ensemble modelling for mapping suitable habitats for l javanica by taking advantage of high spatial and spectral resolution such as s 2 data additional to topographic variables mapping the distribution of l javanica in areas prone to malaria is crucial for malaria control particularly in communities that do not have access to western medicine and treatments due to their unavailability or high cost the new understanding obtained in this study also contributes to the update of l javanica distribution map which has been derived using high spatial resolution dataset the information will assist the locals in identifying areas suitable for l javanica occurrence thus enabling ethnobotanical efforts to malaria

25147,lippia javanica l javanica is one of the commonly used ethnobotanical plant species for controlling malaria globally accurate mapping of l javanica species is important for malaria control interventions that require geospatial information for the assessment of malaria distribution and monitoring especially in communities that have limited access to western malaria medicine currently high spatial resolution information pertaining the distribution and habitat suitability of l javanica species is very rare the high resolution mapping could assist in identifying potential niche areas of ethnobotanically important species and to facilitate community health and wellness against malaria in this study we tested the ability of high spatial resolution sentinel 2 s 2 derived variables and shuttle radar topography mission srtm derived topographic variables to predict the distribution of l javanica in the vhembe district municipality south africa the relationship between remote sensing variables and the occurrence data of l javanica was assessed using coefficient of determination r2 here for the first time we compared three commonly used species distribution models logistic regression maxent and ensemble models to derive the best possible subsets of environmental predictors and to produce the species distribution map that could aid in identifying areas were l javanica occurs for use against malaria vectors various validation matrices such as the overall accuracy oa model sensitivity sn and specificity sp and the true skill statistics tss were employed to test the robustness of the resultant models the results showed a superior performance of weighted ensemble model which yielded higher overall accuracy 91 3 tss 0 66 than both logistic regression oa 84 4 tss 0 42 and maxent 95 6 tss 0 73 the indices derived from the sentinel s red edge bands were the most contributory variables in both logistic regression and maxent the normalized difference averaged red edge vegetation index ndarvi and the normalized difference red edge1 vegetation index ndvire contributed 39 25 p 0 0002 and 32 50 in lr and maxent models respectively slope was the most significant srtm derived variable correlated to l javanica occurrence in all models the results of this study show that high resolution sentinel 2 data can be used to map hardy shrub species at higher accuracies using ensemble model the derived occurrence map of l javanica could assist in updating the currently coarse resolution distribution map of species required for its aromatic ecological service against malaria vectors keywords maxent world health organization ensemble modelling habitat mapping 1 introduction in 2015 the world health organization has developed a global technical strategy for malaria 2016 2030 gts 5 endorsed by the world health assembly this strategy promulgated malaria elimination efforts targeted for 2030 with milestone for measuring progress in both 2020 and 2025 who 2008 globally it was recommended that all countries particularly in africa set their own national or subnational targets for accelerating efforts aimed at eliminating malaria transmission and preventing re infections many countries especially in africa have developed their own malaria control plans and subsequent implementations resulted in the decrease in the number of malaria transmissions pierre louis et al 2018 for example many of these countries have adopted the use of insecticide treated nets itns and indoor residual sprays irs which have become cornerstones for malaria control programme who 2008 lengeler 2004 in most african communities the use of repellents of plant origin has been one of the most effective methods for controlling malaria for many years kweka et al 2008 because of their cheaper costs of treatment where such plant species are commonly found and have shown to contain low toxicity to humans and animals ansari et al 2000 many plant species have been effective alternative for repelling malaria vectors and these plant species include lantana camara omicum americanum azadirachta indica and lippia javanica seyoum et al 2002 mabogo 1990 in other parts of africa and indian subcontinent lippia javanica burm f spreng is still one of the commonly used medicinal plants for controlling malaria and for ethnoveterinary purposes maroyi 2017 lukwa 1994 samie et al 2005 kumar and dash 2012 in southern africa l javanica is one of the four indigenous lippia species verbenaceae that occur as erect woody shrubs of approximately 2 m in height viljoen et al 2005 this species is one of the widely used ethnobotanical plants for control of malaria in zimbabwe and south africa for example in the vhembe district municipality of south africa the venda people use l javanica leaf infusions as prophylactic against malaria mabogo 1990 maroyi 2017 today l javanica is still widely used in many communities in africa as a means to keep both nuisance and malaria transmitting mosquitoes at bay mavundza et al 2011 because of l javanica significance as an antimalarial species in southern africa accurate knowledge of species occurrence and habitat delineation is fundamental for continued fight against malaria infections in rural communities this knowledge will further enhance our understanding of suitable habitats for l javanica species amidst changes in climatic conditions which radically alters species distribution and functions dehayes et al 2000 delineating habitats of plant species conventionally relies on ground based surveys which are the most common means for species detection legendre et al 2002 gogol prokurat 2011 through ground based surveys efforts are made to locate plant species of interest along pre defined transects mostly biased towards readily accessible sampling areas malahlela et al 2015 edwards et al 2007 the challenge with ground based surveys rests in the difficulty to account for plant species that occur in inaccessible areas due to hostile terrain and logistical constraints associated with ground based surveys moreover although mapping of species distribution in this manner is mostly accurate the ground based surveys whether of plant or animal communities are often time consuming and costly rocchini et al 2010 in order to overcome the limitations associated with these surveys highly efficient and robust methods are more desirable for species distribution studies west et al 2016a remote sensing offers fast and efficient alternative approach for mapping the potential distribution of plant species this is because remote sensing data is acquired for much larger areas at various spatio temporal and spectral resolutions kempeneers et al 2011 the spatio temporal resolution allows for the detection of plant functioning at species cho et al 2015 kganyago et al 2018 community madonsela et al 2018 or regional levels gould 2000 over time on the other hand the spectral configuration of remote sensing instruments allows for discrimination amongst various plant species and to characterize topographical and environmental features that are associated with habitat of species of interest peng et al 2018 álvarez martínez et al 2017 one of the most ecologically important spectral wavelengths is found in the red edge region 0 705 nm 0 840 nm which is known to detect subtle differences that may arise as a result of various vegetation biophysical and biochemical characteristics mutanga and skidmore 2004 the improved configuration of recent earth observation satellites with extended spectral ranges opens new opportunities for detailed vegetation assessment the launch of sentinel 2 s 2 satellite in june 2015 by the european space agency esa has opened opportunities for high resolution vegetation habitat characterization the vegetation indices vis derived from s 2 broadband wavelengths visible near infrared region have been used to retrieve vegetation biophysical chemical parameters clevers et al 2017 in contrast some studies have shown that the narrow band vis outperform their broadband counterparts de oliveira et al 2017 ramoelo and cho 2018 korhonen et al 2017 due to ability to compensate for signal saturation problem frampton et al 2013 although the broadband vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have been used for species mapping west et al 2016a pau et al 2012 the use of narrow band indices such as those derived from red edge region have rarely been used for species distribution mapping it has not been established whether the s 2 red edge region can significantly improve on the mapping of l javanica distribution additionally the topographical variables such as digital elevation model dem aspect and slope have been widely used to describe topography associated with the species suitable habitat in species distribution mapping guisan and zimmermann 2000 zeng et al 2017 however the successful mapping of l javanica requires the model with high sensitivity to the potential habitat of the species under consideration most of the currently available species distribution models sdms offer a versatile approach to empirically relate the satellite derived environmental variables with distribution of plant species he et al 2015 dudov 2017 some of the most commonly used sdms include the logistic regression padalia et al 2010 lemke and brown 2012 and the maximum entropy model maxent chahouki and sahragard 2016 dudov 2017 ullerud et al 2016 by comparison the performance of maxent model is comparable or superior to other sdms such as the logistic regression model elith et al 2011 although these models are popular and effective for predicting areas of suitable habitat in unsampled locations they have their limitations for example despite its success in species distribution modelling maxent cannot be used to model a species fundamental niche which concerns a full range of environmental conditions a species might occupy not just environmental conditions where species is most likely to be found drake 2014 pulliam 2000 on the other hand the inability of logistic regression model to account for imperfect detection which often leads to biased estimation of habitat relationships is well documented martin et al 2005 these limitations associated with each sdm can be circumvented by ensemble sdm that combines the strength of both logistic regression and maxent thus minimizing errors associated with each model araujo and new 2006 ensemble model is a combination of individual sdm with differing structure explanatory variables and the data sources for the purpose of describing species relationship with the environment however the some pertinent questions arise what contribution do the broad band narrow band vegetation indices and topographical variables have for mapping l javanica species through the use of logistic regression maxent and ensemble models additionally how well do the performance accuracies of logistic regression maxent and ensemble models compare for predicting l javanica distribution at the malaria prone environment the aim of the current study was to map the potential distribution of l javanica lemon bush shrub species in a malaria endemic area using high resolution satellite remote sensing in the current study we hypothesize that the vegetation indices derived from red edge region narrowband of s 2 data are correlated to the potential habitats of l javanica species and can be incorporated into the sdm selected focused in this study we further hypothesized that since both logistic regression model and maxent are binary models with different parameterization requirements the derivation of an ensemble model from the binary model will outperform individual model due to combined error reduction and the leverage of models predictive power 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the vhembe district municipality vdm which is the northernmost district of south africa fig 1 the study area is located at the geographic coordinates of 23 40 s and 30 00 e malahlela et al 2015 the vdm comprises of four local municipalities i e thulamela lm musina lm makhado lm and collins chabane lm the total human population in the vdm is currently over 1 3 million statistics south africa 2016 malahlela et al 2015 with predominantly venda people occupying the western and north and north eastern part of the vdm the study area forms administrative border between south africa and zimbabwe with the limpopo river being the most notable natural boundary between these two countries it comprises of varying topography with diverse floral and faunal biodiversity with adansonia digitata baobab tree as the well known tree species occurring in this region the vdm is situated in the tropical savannah biome which comprise of mixture of c4 grasses and closed canopy trees lehmann et al 2011 asner et al 2004 the vegetation density decreases from east to west with high vegetation density found in the eastern part of the study area mainly in response to rainfall patterns in south africa bond et al 2002 the the study area receives annual rainfall of 820 mm mpandeli 2014 and varied localized rainfall frequencies and quantities occurring closer to soutpansberg mountain kabanda and munyati 2010 it is for this reason that matiwa in the vdm had recorded the average rainfall of 2004 mm over 60 year calculation which is the highest in south africa south african weather service saws 2018 due to semi aridity and tropical conditions prevailing in different parts of the study area malaria transmission exhibit seasonal variation with high malaria incidences usually occurring between september and april most communities in the study area use l javanica species for controlling mosquito bites phaswane and masevhe 2018 thus preventing potential large scale malaria transmissions 2 2 field data field data collection was undertaken in august 2017 for 21 days covering most parts of the vdm the field data was collected purposively across the frequently occurring four vegetation cover classes i shrubland ii grassland iii cropland and iv woodland in each vegetation cover class forty 40 plots of homogenous 30 30 m landscape were randomly stratified and allocated data collection was done within a randomly selected 10 m 10 m sub plot in a larger 30 m 30 m plot where species sightings were recorded as either present 1 of absent 0 the l javanica was spotted mostly under semi open canopy tree species such as young acacia tortilis and usually occurred as single stand of shrub in woodlands and shrublands the geo locations of each plot and species sightings were recorded using a handheld garmin etrex 20 global positioning system gps with the maximum positional accuracy of 3 m a total number of 151 n 151 samples were collected for analysis single or multiple sightings of l javanica within a 10 10 m were recorded as one sample point in order to avoid confusion when accounting the number of samples collected 2 3 remote sensing topographical data s 2 data was used for the study the imagery used were acquired between august 2017 and september 2017 and were downloaded free of charge from copernicus science hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home the s 2 was first launched in june 2015 by the european space agency it has spectral bands ranging from coastal aerosol 443 nm to the shortwave infrared 2190 nm the blue 490 nm green 560 nm red 660 nm and near infrared 842 nm are available at 10 m spatial resolution the red edge1 705 nm red edge2 740 nm red edge3 783 nm red edge4 865 nm shortwave1 1610 nm and shortwave2 2190 nm are available at 20 m spatial resolution while the coastal 443 nm water vapour 945 nm and cirrus band 1375 nm are available at 60 m spatial resolution the elevation data slope and aspect were derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with 30 m spatial resolution 2 4 data pre processing data pre processing was done in three sets i the s 2 data pre processing ii the srtm data pre processing and iii the field data pre processing 2 4 1 sentinel 2 data pre processing of s 2 data involved spatial resampling of wavelengths to address the objectives of the study firstly a total of ten spectral bands n 10 were selected based on their relationship with l javanica distribution these bands are centered at 490 nm absorbed by chlorophyll 560 nm sensitive to plant health such as greenness 660 nm absorbed by chlorophyll 705 nm 865 nm sensitive to subtle variations of vegetation chlorophyll 842 nm sensitive to leaf mass and chlorophyll content 1610 nm sensitive to vegetation moisture content and 2190 sensitive to vegetation moisture and soil minerals malahlela et al 2015 ustin et al 2009 secondly the 10 band s 2 data was subjected to atmospheric correction using sen2cor code in order to minimize atmospheric effect on the target spectra sen2cor uses a large database of look up tables lut derived using an atmospheric radiative transfer model based on libradtran1 müller wilm 2016 thirdly the atmospherically corrected bands were stacked in quantum gis qgis development team 2018 software resulting in six single multispectral imagery with 10 bands each and 20 m spatial resolution the subsequent processing involved spatial resampling of images to 10 m spatial resolution and this was accomplished in sentinels applications platform software snap using nearest neighbour resampling method lastly the 10 m imagery were mosaicked and clipped to cover the entire study area the broad band vegetation indices vis representing photosynthetic pigments such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi senescent vegetation and soil soil adjusted vegetation index optimized soil adjusted vegetation index vegetation and landscape water content normalized difference water index and herbaceous biomass difference vegetation index simple ratios were computed hill 2013 these indices were selected on the basis of their individual sensitivity to vegetation characteristics and their ability to minimize the soil brightness for example the difference vegetation index dvi ndvi and the green ratio vegetation index grvi have shown to be sensitive to vegetation green up biomass and biophysical characteristics such as diversity lecain et al 2000 madonsela et al 2018 however due to the vegetation composition nature of our study area very dense to very sparse vegetation with exposed soil background both the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi were selected to compensate for the effect of high bare soil to vegetation cover ratio the intention was to derive minimum number of indices which takes into account the landscape dynamics in terms of vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties of l javanica habitats at the study area moreover two narrow band red edge indices normalized difference normalized red edge vegetation index normalized difference averaged red edge vegetation index were computed and tested for the study because of their ability to detect subtle variations in vegetation characteristics mutanga and skidmore 2004 table 1 since it is well documented that remote sensing variables and wavelengths are highly correlated in nature the correlation analysis was conducted for all spectral indices used in the study wang et al 2003 only the variables with weak to moderate correlations 0 60 to 0 60 relative to other spectral indices were selected in instances where two variables are correlated with each other but uncorrelated to other variables within the set one variable was selected based on known relationship with the occurrence of l javanica 2 4 2 srtm data the srtm digital elevation dem data was downloaded from the united states geological surveys earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov the dem was clipped to the vdm boundary extent the dem was resampled to a 10 m spatial resolution in qgis for use in maxent and logistic regression models this was done by assigning the same number of spatial dimensions for both longitude x and latitude y so as to match those of a 10 m s 2 multispectral image it was from the same dem where additional environmental datasets such as slope and aspect were derived 2 4 3 field data the preparation of field point data was conducted in microsoft spreadsheet where species locations occurrence and corresponding environmental data were appended a total of 151 presence absence sampling points n 151 was collected during field survey the field data was later imported into arcmap vers 10 esri inc redlands as a shapefile for visualizing preliminary spatial distribution of species occurrence all other environmental remote sensing data were appended on the field data which formed part of the standard dataset to be used for l javanica species mapping 2 5 sample spatial autocorrelation the spatial pattern of every sample location of l javanica was assessed so as to determine the range of spatial autocorrelation of data collected in the field this is usually done because the sampling units might exhibit high similarity with their neighbours at given geographic locations which could result in problematic statistical analysis legendre 1996 for the purpose of this study we have adopted the use of moran s i to test for the spatial autocorrelation of the collected dataset moran 1948 moran s i index is the form of local spatial statistics indicator that quantifies the degree of clustering of a given geographic location of l javanica samples spatial autocorrelation prevails in many field data collection sampling methods and the remote sensing datasets although at various degrees moderate correlation 0 4 0 6 very strong correlation 0 85 0 95 griffith and chun 2016 however for this study we tested the null hypothesis that the locations of l javanica species are not significantly clustered at certain geographical areas within the study area the analysis was done for ranges of 1 km and 10 km 2 6 modelling strategy the correlation between satellite derived variables and the presence absence of l javanica was assessed through the use of pearson correlation coefficient r additionally correlation analysis was also assessed between all environmental variables in order to avoid model over fit due to adding variables with the same contribution in the models appendix 1 in order to predict the distribution of l javanica species the logistic regression hosmer et al 2013 and maxent using maxent version 3 3 3 phillips et al 2006 were tested in the current study a standard field data with presence absence data was used in logistic regression while only the presence records and background values were used for model fitting in maxent it was randomly split into 70 n 106 and 30 n 45 for model calibration and independent model validation respectively logistic regression was used to link the occurrence of l javanica with the set of environmental variables relating to vegetation greenness chlorophyll canopy moisture vegetation biomass aspect elevation and slope logistic regression is a form of generalized linear models glm which relates the binary response outcome presence absence to a linear combination of numerical and categorical variables hosmer and lemeshow 2000 it is given by eq 1 as 1 y i 1 1 e x p β 0 j 1 k β n x n j where yi is the probability of l javanica occurrence 1 or 0 xi is the environmental variable at the jth location βn is the coefficient of xn β0 is an intercept and exp is the exponential function of the regression an automated procedure for selecting variables and final model was adopted because it reduces computation time and tedious modelling malahlela et al 2015 a stepwise logistic regression slr approach was adopted through glm2 and mass packages in r software to minimize multi collinearity and model over fitting collet 1991 a total of ten 10 s 2 predictive variables table 1 and three 3 strm variables were entered in the initial slr model employed in this study in r software package glm2 all the derived variables were entered into the initial model using both forward and backward variable selection criterion this resulted in an automated variable selection without manual entry or removal of variable at each level rossiter and loza 2012 the final model was selected on the basis of lowest aikaike s information criterion aic variable significance and the model contribution the significant model was ultimately used for spatial mapping of l javanica species at the study area on the other hand the maxent algorithm phillips et al 2006 was also tested for predicting the probability of occurrence of l javanica species the modelling was done within the constraints of the listed environmental and the s 2 datasets maxent automatically includes variables interactions and can consider continuous and categorical predictor variables west et al 2016b for this modelling approach only the highest contributory variables were used to calibrate the model fig 2 the samples with data swd file format was used a comma delimited as input for presence localities of l javanica species the same number of presence points used in the logistic regression model was used in maxent with the exception that the absence points were replaced with the background values equivalent to the removed absence points maxent algorithm was implemented with the default regularization so as to avoid too complex a model fourcade et al 2014 dudík et al 2007 although model with adjusted parameters tends to yield higher prediction accuracies merow et al 2013 for the ensemble model both maxent and logistic regression models were combined to form one new model based on simple weighted averaging mean the weighted mean of the resultant combined model is derived from eq 2 as 2 y e n s i 1 n x i w i i 1 n w i where y ens is the ensemble model wi is the allocated weights of values of xi in models 1 and 2 the average weights of 0 55 and 0 45 were assigned to individually high and low performance models respectively such that the ensemble model is biased towards model that performs better the adoption of this dual model ensemble approach was dictated by the overall accuracies of each individual model in order to enhance the predictive skill of the overall ensemble method this unequal weighting would ensure the resultant model outperforms the best participating model by leveraging on the high predictive power of best model while reducing average mean error of ensemble model thuiller et al 2009 in ecology the unequal weighting for ensemble method has not been explored for species mapping although this method has shown success in other fields such as in climatology jun et al 2017 in this study we applied the unequal weighting technique to assess its utility for floral species prediction and mapping all the modelling strategies were performed at pixel size of 10 m 10 m spatial resolution of s 2 imager for the purpose of this study we chose a restricted number of predictive models because it was beyond the aim of this study to include all other available algorithms which have demonstrated higher performance for modelling species in various environmental conditions and at difference spatial scales elith et al 2011 2 7 model evaluation the independent field dataset n 45 was used to assess the accuracy of each predictive model various validation matrices were used in the study to assess the reliability of the predictive models in the current study the predicted probability of l javanica occurrence y through each model ranged from 0 to 1 with increasing likelihood of species occurrence towards a value of 1 therefore in the current study the threshold of 0 6 was used as an optimum cut off value since a value of 0 5 usually represents prediction by random chance baldwin 2009 a 2 2 contingency table with rows indicating predicted cases and columns indicating measured cases were drawn for the threshold value of 0 6 for each model west et al 2016b table 2 provides the accuracy assessment measures adopted for this study the overall accuracy which is the proportion of the correctly classified cases over the total number of cases in the validation dataset was also used as a means to validate each model malahlela et al 2015 3 results the spatial autocorrelation analysis of sampling sites indicate that the samples are not significantly different from random both at 1 km i 0 037 and at 10 km i 0 019 ranges table 3 the preliminary results of descriptive statistics table table 4 show that l javanica tends to be present in areas of higher elevation altitude mainly in the south facing slopes and at locations where vegetation exhibited increasing vigour and biomass regarding vegetation indices the dvi showed high within class dispersion from the means of both l javanica presence and absence sites 16 2 19 2 indicating how this variable may impact of species prediction in sdm s the results obtained in this study allow the acceptance of a hypothesis which states that the narrowband spectral indices red edge indices can be incorporated into sdm s for improved species distribution mapping the correlation analysis has shown that s 2 s ndarvi and the slope derived from srtm were positively and significantly correlated to l javanica occurrence r 0 48 p 0 01 r 0 47 p 0 01 respectively table 5 additionally the ndvire and elevation were the second most significant variables correlated to the species distribution r 0 29 p 0 05 r 0 27 p 0 01 respectively in all the selected predictor variables the sr1 was found to be the least and insignificant correlated variables to the l javanica presence absence r 0 09 p 0 7 the ndwi exhibited the significant and negative correlation to the species distribution r 0 26 p 0 01 the results of a stepwise logistic regression are shown in table 6 a total of six 6 variables mostly significant formed part of the final logistic regression model on the one hand the ndarvi slope and elevation were significantly and positively correlated to l javanica occurrence p 0 001 on the other hand the sr1 and aspect were also positively correlated to l javanica occurrence while ndvire exhibited negative but significant correlation p 0 05 fig 2 shows summary of variable contribution into final model with ndarvi being the highest contributory variable 39 25 moreover on the one hand using the independent validation dataset the logistic regression yielded overall prediction accuracy of 84 4 at a pre defined threshold of 0 6 on the other hand maxent model has resulted in overall classification accuracy of 91 3 in maxent the highest contributory variables were the ndvire 32 50 slope 28 6 and elevation 24 10 respectively fig 2 the combined ensemble model yielded the overall predictive accuracy of 95 6 which is approximately 11 improvement to the prediction made using logistic regression 84 4 while maxent was the second best predictive model in the current study based on these findings we accept the hypothesis that the appropriately configured ensemble method will usually outperform the candidate models used in its construction a 2 2 error matrix table for all three models is shown in table 7 the logistic regression model yielded relatively lower tss 0 42 than both the maxent 0 66 and ensemble 0 73 models fig 3 3 1 predictive maps the predicted maps of the study area through maxent logistic regression and ensemble had similar spatial pattern fig 4 especially for presence probabilities of l javanica high likelihood of l javanica occurrence is predicted in the south central part of the study area by all 3 models the minimum predicted value absence was 0 0 while 0 95 was the maximum predicted occurrence value in each model in maxent the predicted presence distribution of l javanica exhibited a narrow range than in logistic regression 4 discussion this study aimed at mapping the spatial distribution of l javanica lemon bush using s 2 and srtm variables thus providing meaningful contribution to malaria control strategies in the vhembe district of south africa such contribution is highlighted in three important ways 1 the improvement of spatial spectral resolution for species mapping 2 adding another layer of spatial data onto the already existing topographical layer for defining species habitat and potential ethnobotanical plant use and 3 ensemble species mapping for a more robust species distribution and habitat preference in this study we have demonstrated that remote sensing data can aid in predicting the occurrence of l javanica species at 10 m spatial resolution the 10 m spatial resolution allows for more detailed and appropriate species mapping valderrama landeros et al 2017 thus contributing to detailed l javanica species inventory and conservation especially when such species is used as an ethnobotanical plant for malaria control mabogo 1990 maroyi 2017 thus the higher spatial resolution l javanica map derived from s 2 data is an addition to very coarse species maps that are already available in south africa at a resolution lower than quarter degree foden and potter 2005 both the s 2 data and the srtm data can be easily used to mask environment that is clearly unsuitable for the species of interest cord et al 2013 at high spatial resolutions the ndarvi computed as the target mean reflectance of four red edge bands and the red edge1 r 705 ndvi also called ndvire in this study were the most significant s 2 variables the significant and positive correlations between these indices and l javanica distribution suggest that the likelihood of finding this plant species increases with the increase in vegetation vigour the influence of the red edge bands for mapping the distribution of l javanica could be attributed to the fact that there is apparent insensitivity of substrate background e g soil noticed in this spectral region datt and paterson 2000 the red edge bands used in computing ndarvi and red edge1 ndvi ndvire have shown sensitivity to vegetation chlorophyll concentration otunga et al 2018 thus becoming very important for characterizing the distribution of l javanica in semi arid environment for this reason we accept the hypothesis that the spectral indices computed from the narrowband region red edge are correlated to the potential habitats of l javanica and can thus be incorporated in sdm the broad band vegetation indices such as the ndvi and ndwi were among the significant s 2 variables with ndwi contributing the most in maxent while ndvi was the most contributing broadband vegetation index in logistic regression this indicates that although the narrow band indices were mostly significant p 0 001 the broadband indices are also important contributors for explaining variability of species occurrence the low ndvi and sr1 contribution to predictive model shows the inability of the broadband indices to capture subtle vegetation characteristics that define potential micro habitat of l javanica species given the vegetation composition in the study area dense to sparse vegetation types the broad band vegetation indices based on red nir reflectance ndvi have suffered from signal saturation mutanga and skidmore 2004 and this might explain low performance of these indices in individual sdms meanwhile the narrow band vegetation indices are known to circumvent saturation problem that results when using broad band vegetation indices baret et al 1992 mutanga and skidmore 2004 malahlela et al 2015 in this study it was clear that the narrow band red edge vegetation indices were superior to the broad band indices for characterizing habitat where l javanica occurrence was very likely however the correlations between remote sensing variables and the probability of occurrence of l javanica were fairly low although significant r 2 0 5 p 0 05 in the vdm august marks the end of the winter season the period during which most vegetated landscape enter green up growth period it should be noted however that september month marks the onset of spring season where savannah vegetation has reached end of peak or maximum growth cho et al 2017 at the study area the topographic variables slope and elevation derived from srtm data have shown significant correlation with the distribution of l javanica thus contributing significantly to predictive accuracies of logistic regression and maxent models our study showed that slope and elevation play a major role in determining the species potential distribution and this finding is supported by observation made elsewhere by madzimure et al 2011 who concluded that l javanica was commonly found in grasslands on hillsides in zimbabwe in south africa a study conducted by morgenthal et al 2006 found that l javanica sub community occurred predominantly in habitat located at higher altitudes findings from this study support observations made in previous studies which highlighted that the l javanica also occurs in open grassland in the bush as well as on forest margins ng weno et al 2009 although it is thought to be widely distributed on a national scale in this study the species micro scale distribution ecological niche is rather much narrower the species distribution in the vdm is more related to elevation aspect slope and vegetation greenness which are positively correlated to occurrence of l javanica in this study the ensemble sdm has shown to outperform the individual predictive models logistic and maxent this is due to the fact that ensemble modelling combines models that differ in structure explanatory variables and data sources thus allowing inferences that are robust to uncertainties associated with any individual model latif et al 2013 araujo and new 2006 in this study we accept the hypothesis that the ensemble species model will outperform individual model due to combined error reduction and the leverage of models predictive power the ensemble model leverages on the high predictive accuracies sensitivity specificity and the tss of candidate models for improved prediction the ensemble method was thus used to produce the final species distribution map at 10 m spatial resolution we have demonstrated that the ensemble model for mapping l javanica species which usually occurs as a few stands in various environments e g roadsides grassland riverine areas and bushes this finding is similar to the one by marmion et al 2009 who found that the weighted average ensemble model and mean ensemble model provided significantly more robust predictions than all the single models and the other consensus methods from the results it becomes apparent that maxent outperformed the logistic regression model with the overall accuracy difference of approximately 6 9 by utilizing the weighted average ensemble method a 10 improvement in the model overall accuracy was achieved over what was achieved through the use of binary logistic regression however it should be noted that ensemble methods do not always improve the prediction as their accuracies are largely dependent on the individual models this means that if the input models have low accuracies and perhaps statistically insignificant predictor variables the performance of a resultant ensemble model will often be negatively impacted additionally although ensemble approach usually yields better results for species prediction multiple candidate models for ensemble modelling still require careful development and selection latif et al 2013 assigning higher weight to maxent model 0 55 maxent vs 0 45 logistic regression has resulted in the improvement of prediction capability of sdm and thus this study advocates for the use of ensemble modelling for species distribution the pattern of the predicted species presence at the study area is very important to understanding the environmental factors associated with species recruitment proliferation and densities however the species absence although largely ignored in sdm s also provide more complex information about the species and the associated environment rather than a mere lack of suitability lobo et al 2010 for example l javanica is largely absent in the western part of the study area which is characterized by drier conditions than the areas of predicted species presence on the other hand due to dispersal limitations e g ecological barrier such at soutpansberg mountain it is possible that l javanica does not occupy all suitable areas and as such caution should be exercised when interpreting the presence results of the predictive maps the conservation of l javanica in its natural environment is very essential because of the species relative accessible and cost effectiveness to the local communities in areas prone to malaria moreover the distribution of l javanica is mostly valuable in areas where western medicine is inaccessible as a result of high cost or where such medicine is unavailable light et al 2005 mavundza et al 2011 due to its medicinal popularity as a mosquito repellent among the communities living in malaria prone areas l javanica occurrence and abundance warrant consistent monitoring since such species forms part of the bigger one health approach because the analysis in the current study was done from a single s 2 image set the time series analysis could aid in validating the accuracy of the ensemble modelling results found in this study by providing a multi temporal variation in vegetation phenology moreover collection of more presence points could aid in more accurate generalization of the predictive models and this could in turn improve the performance of the sdm s used in the study collecting additional data to increase the sample size is very crucial because the performance of sdm is optimal when the sample size is fairly large and when species of interest has a narrow niche than a generalist species hernandez et al 2006 the list spectral indices used in the current study is not comprehensive and other sentinel derived indices such as those sensitive to chlorophyll may be correlated to the species presence absence data lu et al 2015 sonobe and wang 2017 and thus shedding light on species detection monitoring and conservation additionally combining satellite data with environmental data such as soil type distance to the roads distance from the rivers or water bodies shrub patch characteristics and soil nutrients data could improve the modelling of l javanica species 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated for the first time modelling approaches for mapping l javanica species by combination of srtm and sentinel 2 derived variables the sentinel 2 vegetation indices have exhibited significant correlation with the distribution of lippia javanica in the vhembe district on the one hand the ndarvi a normalized index based on average reflectance four red edge bands was the most significant variable when predicting species distribution using logistic regression while red edge1 ndvi ndvire was the highest contributing predictor variable in maxent model on the other hand the ndvi and ndwi have shown correlation with the distribution of l javanica species at least at micro scale habitat the variables derived from srtm such as elevation slope and aspect were amongst the most highly contributing variables in all models pollnac et al 2012 the maxent model performed better than logistic regression 91 3 and 84 4 respectively while the combined weighted ensemble model yielded more than 11 improvement to the logistic regression model 95 6 and 84 4 respectively this study advocates the use of ensemble modelling for mapping suitable habitats for l javanica by taking advantage of high spatial and spectral resolution such as s 2 data additional to topographic variables mapping the distribution of l javanica in areas prone to malaria is crucial for malaria control particularly in communities that do not have access to western medicine and treatments due to their unavailability or high cost the new understanding obtained in this study also contributes to the update of l javanica distribution map which has been derived using high spatial resolution dataset the information will assist the locals in identifying areas suitable for l javanica occurrence thus enabling ethnobotanical efforts to malaria

25148,the kemp s ridley lepidochelys kempii is a critically endangered sea turtle that breeds nearly exclusively in the gulf of mexico with scattered nesting along the u s atlantic coast in 2010 an unprecedented increase in strandings concomitant with a large oil spill in the northern gulf raised concern about impacts on population recovery we used several versions of an age structured model representing hypothesized pulse press and density dependent remigration effects of the 2010 mortality event to simulate post 2010 population dynamics only a density dependent remigration version simulated population fluctuations observed from 2009 to 2014 population dynamics projected through 2035 using this version indicated essentially exponential growth with the simulated adult female population reaching 110 000 in 2035 as indicated by nest counts at the index beach of most interest within a management context is the apparent resiliency of the population to large mortality events of short duration two important caveats to this statement are the assumptions that there has been no reduction of suitable habitats and that per capita availability of food resources is sufficient to support population recovery simulation results also provide insight into the myriad of potential responses of an age structured population of long lived animals to such events keywords age structured model population projection remigration lepidochelys kempii 1 introduction the kemp s ridley lepidochelys kempii is a critically endangered sea turtle that nests almost exclusively in the gulf of mexico where the vast majority of individuals complete their life cycle although there is scattered nesting along the u s atlantic coast see appendix a for background on kemp s ridley distribution life history and conservation prior to 2010 based on nest counts and hatchling production data from the index beach in the principal nesting area in tamaulipas mexico fig 1 a the population appeared to be recovering caillouet et al 2016a nest counts from the index beaches are considered the best indicator of the status of the species caillouet et al 2016a sims et al 2008 heppell et al 2005 drawing on data from 1996 to 1999 at the index beach used an age structured model to estimate an annual growth rate of 12 16 immediately prior to 2010 an annual growth rate of 19 was projected for the period from 2010 to 2020 crowder and heppell 2011 heppell et al 2005 however in 2010 coincident with a large oil spill there was an unprecedented increase in strandings in the northern gulf of mexico and the pre 2010 trend of nesting increase was interrupted caillouet 2011 gallaway et al 2016b after a rebound in 2011 and 2012 nesting success again declined in 2013 and 2014 raising concern about the failure of the population to resume its previous rate of growth crowder and heppell 2011 gallaway et al 2016a b fig 1b parts a and b several authors stated or implied that the 2010 oil spill could have impacted specific life stages of kemp s ridley thus altering population age structure and creating a potentially long lasting demographic mark that could delay recovery by reducing population momentum caillouet 2011 caillouet et al 2016b crowder and heppell 2011 shortly after the 2010 oil spill crowder and heppell 2011 used an age structured population model developed in conjunction with the turtle expert working group to examine possible impacts of the 2010 spill or similar disasters on kemp s ridley population recovery they explored the effects of disaster related mortality on different life stages and differentiated between one year pulse and multi year slowly degrading press impacts their model results suggested that pulse impacts affecting large juveniles and adults would cause a relatively modest long term effect on population growth because of the population momentum driven by two decades of increased productivity assuming no lingering effects of survival and fertility rates however population responses to press impacts were influenced strongly by the manner in which the effects on survival and fertility rates decayed over time caillouet 2014 these results are not surprising given that not all females nest every year crowder et al 1994 lewison et al 2003 also shortly after the oil spill caillouet et al 2011 suggested that the post 2010 decline in nests could have resulted from a reduction in the numbers of sub adults and adults between the nesting seasons of 2009 and 2010 which subsequently reduced the number of nesting kemp s ridleys and therefore the number of hatchlings in 2010 and beyond more recently gallaway et al 2016a developed a new kemp s ridley stock assessment model this model was developed to examine the status and trends of the kemp s ridley stock to evaluate the impacts of shrimp trawl bycatch mortality and to provide model outputs that could be used as a baseline to evaluate the effects of the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 when the estimated 2010 oil spill related mortality was added to the initial kemp s ridley stock assessment model gallaway et al 2016a which otherwise was parameterized based on data collected up to 2009 model results suggested that the population would resume its previous growth trend the year after the oil spill cleanup similar in general to the response to pulse impacts suggested by crowder and heppell 2011 this prompted gallaway et al 2016b to propose several modifications to the initial version of kemp s ridley stock assessment model each representing a potential cause effect relationship that might explain post 2010 population trends among these modifications was a density dependent nests per adult female effect in which nests per adult female was a function of the number of individuals in the population that were 2 or more years old which we hereafter refer to as the density dependent remigration effect appendix b provides the rationale for this effect as well as for the pulse and press effects using this density dependent version of their model gallaway et al 2016b were able to project the 2014 population decline although they did not present model projections beyond 2014 in the wake of the 2010 oil spill bjorndal et al 2011 identified several key elements that should be included in strategic plans for sea turtles the first two of these elements were to 1 integrate demography with abundance trends for multiple life states and determine environmental effects on those parameters and 2 emphasize analyses of cumulative effects to date the demographic processes driving the post 2010 population dynamics of kemp s ridley remain enigmatic however more recent data from the index beach 2015 2017 fig 1b part c allow further exploration of the myriad of potential responses of an age structured population of long lived animals to a large mortality event in this paper we use several versions of an age structured model to simulate population dynamics of the endangered kemp s ridley sea turtle following the 2010 oil spill in the gulf of mexico we first present the basic model calibrate the baseline version of the model and analyze the sensitivity of simulated annual growth rate to changes in demographic parameters next we parameterize several versions of the model to represent different versions of the pulse press and density dependent remigration effects of the 2010 mortality event we then evaluate the ability of each version to simulate the fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach during the four years following the 2010 event finally we validate sensu rykiel 1996 those versions capable of simulating the 2010 2014 fluctuations against more recent 2015 2017 nest counts at the index beach and use those validated versions to project the population trend through 2035 2 materials and methods 2 1 the basic model we formulated the model as an age structured compartment model based on difference equations with a 1 year time step programmed in stella professional version 1 4 1 for windows isee systems inc 2017 fig 2 a we grouped yearly age classes into pelagic post hatchling juvenile sub adult and adult life stages table 1 for purposes of assigning stage specific mortality rates table 2 these stages were identified by ogren 1989 and heppell et al 2005 based on significant changes in mortality and sexual maturity among other life history traits we provide definitions of model components values and sources of model parameters and model equations in tables 1 2 and 3 respectively proportion of nests and hatching rates in situ versus in corrals boxes in tables 1 and 2 refers to the kemp s ridley head start program see appendix a 3 2 the primary output of the model is the simulated annual nest count at the index beach which is calculated as the product of number of reproductively mature females proportion of mature females nesting proportion remigrating to the nesting beach and number of clutches 2 5 laid per nesting female 2 2 calibration and sensitivity analysis of baseline version of model we calibrated the baseline version of the model such that the simulated annual nest counts approximated the nest counts observed from 1985 to 2009 at the index beach by increasing the post hatchling natural mortality rate to 110 of its original value from 0 682 to 0 7502 table 2 for all of the model calibration simulations we verified that the population was in the stable age class distribution and produced the number of nests recorded 702 nests at the index beach in 1985 gallaway et al 2016a the simulated nests produced by the calibrated model increased at an average annual rate λ 1 1455 within 2 of the observed average annual rate λ 1 1653 and the simulated nest count in 2009 18 289 was within 5 of the observed nest count 19 163 fig 2b we analyzed the sensitivity of annual population growth rate λ as indicated by annual increase in simulated nest counts to changes in 12 demographic parameters and 10 age specific maturity schedules we changed demographic parameters over a range of 30 of their baseline values appendix c 1 and analyzed both knife edge and continuous representations of the maturity schedule appendix c 2 for knife edge representations we changed the age at first reproduction and all females classified as old as or older than the specified age were considered reproductively capable whereas all females younger than the specified age 12 years old were considered incapable of reproduction for continuous representations gradual maturity we classified different proportions of the females in the various age classes as reproductively capable as suggested by nmfs usfws 2015 for all of the sensitivity analysis simulations we once again verified that the population was in the stable age class distribution and produced the number of nests recorded at the index beach in 1985 sensitivity analyses produced estimates of λ that ranged from 1 053 to 1 253 with the lowest and highest λ produced by increasing and decreasing respectively post hatchling mortality rate by 30 of its baseline value fig 2c postponing the knife edge age at first reproduction from 12 years to 14 years produced the third lowest λ 1 151 increasing post hatchling mortality rate by 20 produced the second lowest λ 1 105 whereas advancing the age at first reproduction to 9 years produced the second highest λ 1 241 increasing and decreasing the remigration rate by 30 of its baseline value produced λ values of 1 197 and 1 154 respectively see appendix c 3 c 4 for complete results of sensitivity analyses supplementary sensitivity analyses indicated that mortality rates could be increased uniformly across all age classes by 22 before λ fell below 1 0 and the remigration rate could be decreased by 94 from 0 5 to 0 03 thus increasing the average remigration interval from 2 to 32 years before λ fell below 1 0 note that nesting females generally account for 1 of the total population crowder et al 1994 lewison et al 2003 thus a population level average remigration interval of 32 years does not imply that any individual female would have such a biologically unreasonable remigration interval 2 3 parameterization of pulse press and density dependent remigration versions of model we parameterized several versions of the model to represent different versions of the pulse press and density dependent remigration effects of the 2010 mortality event fig 3 a we parameterized the pulse effect versions of the model by increasing the mortality rate of all or selected age classes during the year 2010 only assuming the 2010 event related mortality was additive to natural mortality gallaway et al 2016b estimated the additional 2010 event related mortality at 31 2 and we used their estimate as a point of reference however we also increased and decreased this magnitude by 10 20 and 30 and distributed the additional mortality across the age classes in a variety of ways appendix d 1 we parameterized the press effect versions of the model by extending the additional mortality past the year 2010 assuming the initial magnitude of the additive mortality decreased over time either abruptly or gradually fig 3b we extended the additional mortality for 2 3 4 and 5 years and distributed the additional mortality across the age classes in a variety of ways appendix d 2 for gradual decreases in the additional mortality rate we assumed an exponential decline 1 i f y y e a n d y y e l e t h e n a e e s e y y e where y represents year ye represents the year of the mortality event ae represents the additive mortality from the event mx represents natural mortality of age x le represents the number of years over which the increased mortality was extended and se represents the slope of an exponential decay curve the se associated with each le was assigned a value such that the total mortality rate decreased from the 2010 rate pre 2010 natural mortality rate 2010 event related mortality rate to the pre 2010 natural mortality rate in le years we parameterized the density dependent remigration effect versions of the model by replacing the remigration rate constant r 0 5 which represents a nesting female returning to nest at the index beach every 2 years with one of the following four functional relationships 2 r β1rs β0 linear decrease 3 r e β1rs exponential decrease 4 r β 2 r s 2 β 1 r s β 0 s e c o n d o r d e r p o l y n o m i a l 5 r β 0 β 1 e β 2 β 3 r s 1 e β 2 β 3 r s i n v e r s e l o g i s t i c d e c r e a s e where r represents the remigration rate rs represents the number of reproductively mature individuals in the population and βx represents the associated coefficients fig 3c we parameterized each of these equations in a variety of ways appendix d 3 we bounded r between 1 0 and 0 2 based on an analysis of sea turtle remigration rates by hays 2000 which suggested remigration intervals usually are between 1 and 5 years we assumed the decreases in r governed by these equations occurred over the range 20 000 rs 40 000 that is we assumed the density dependent effect was negligible below rs 20 000 and was not intensified beyond rs 40 000 2 4 evaluation of pulse press and density dependent remigration versions of model we evaluated each version of the model based on its ability to meet four criteria which characterize the fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 1 the simulated 2010 nest count should decrease to within 15 of the 2010 nest count at the index beach 12 377 nests 2 the simulated 2011 nest count should increase to within 15 of the 2011 nest count at the index beach 18 215 nests 3 the simulated 2012 nest count should remain within 10 of the simulated 2011 nest count the 2011 and 2012 nest counts at the index beach plateaued 4 the simulated nest counts should decrease in 2013 and decrease further in 2014 the 2013 and 2014 nest counts at the index beach continued to decline the evaluation procedure was sequential first we evaluated the 63 versions of the model representing the pulse effect appendix d 1 then we evaluated the press versions related to those pulse versions that had met at least the first two criteria appendix d 2 finally we evaluated the density dependent remigration versions related to those pulse and press versions that had met at least the first two criteria appendix d 3 2 5 model validation and population projection we validated sensu rykiel 1996 those versions of the model that met all four criteria characterizing the 2010 2014 fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach by extending simulations to 2017 and comparing simulated nest counts to more recent 2015 2017 nest counts at the index beach note that the 2015 2017 nest counts were not available during model development fig 1c part c and still are considered preliminary we used the validated version of the model to project the kemp s ridley population trend based on simulated nest counts through 2035 3 results 3 1 evaluation of pulse press and density dependent remigration versions of model of the 63 model versions representing the pulse effect appendix d 1 none met all four criteria however 11 versions met the first two criteria the universal version u4 and age specific versions as1 as10 there was little difference in the 2010 or 2011 nest counts among these 11 versions all of which included event related mortality in the last sub adult and all of the adult age classes those versions that best satisfied these criteria were version u4 fig 4 a and version as10 fig 4b these two versions produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 12 and 4 respectively of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 of the 88 model versions representing the press effect that were tested i e those related to the 11 pulse versions that had met the first two criteria appendix d 2 none met all four criteria however the age specific version as106 with event related mortality affecting only the last sub adult and all adult age classes and decreasing over 2 years met the first two criteria fig 4c this version produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 14 of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 of the 36 model versions representing the density dependent remigration effect that were tested i e those related to the single press and the 11 pulse versions that had met the first two criteria appendix d 3 all four criteria were met by 1 the exponential age specific pulse version e4 fig 4d and 2 the inverse logistic age specific pulse version i4 fig 4e both with event related mortality affecting only the last sub adult and all adult age classes version e4 produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 4 of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 as well as simulated nest counts within 5 of each other in 2011 and 2012 criterion 3 and simulated nest counts that decreased in both 2013 and 2014 criterion 4 version i4 produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 12 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 8 of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 as well as simulated nest counts within 6 of each other in 2011 and 2012 criterion 3 and simulated nest counts that decreased in both 2013 and 2014 criterion 4 one other version the linear age specific pulse version l4 with event related mortality affecting only the last sub adult and all adult age classes met the first three criteria fig 4f version l4 produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 4 of the nest count reported at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 and simulated nest counts within 10 of each other in 2011 and 2012 criterion 3 however simulated nest counts continued increasing in 2013 before decreasing in 2014 thus failing criterion 4 3 2 model validation and population projection of the two density dependent remigration versions that met all four criteria the exponential age specific pulse version e4 failed whereas the inverse logistic age specific pulse version i4 succeeded in simulating the 2015 2017 nest counts fig 5 a version e4 was invalidated in the sense that it failed to produce an increase in nest counts in 2015 although simulated nest counts did increase in 2016 and 2017 fig 5b the simulated adult female population resumed an essentially exponential growth trend after 2014 with a noticeable undulation in the curve from 2026 to 2030 reaching 110 000 in 2035 fig 5c the undulation resulted from the density dependency of the remigration interval which precludes establishment of the stable age class distribution for the sake of comparison we also projected population trends using version e4 as well as versions of the model that met two pulse versions u4 and as10 and press version as106 or three density dependent remigration version l4 of the evaluation criteria after variable lengths of time all simulated populations resumed an essentially exponential growth trend fig 5d with the two density dependent remigration versions exhibiting a noticeable undulation in the growth curve fig 5e simulated populations adult females only using versions e4 u4 as10 as106 and l4 reached approximately 110 000 355 000 568 000 568 000 and 113 000 respectively 4 discussion our simulation results suggest that the precipitous decline in kemp s ridley nesting success on the index beach in 2010 might be interpreted as the result of a pulse mortality event resulting from the oil spill in the gulf of mexico the event may or may not have altered population age structure such as to leave a lasting demographic mark but apparently it did not cause an extended delay in population recovery the fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach from 2010 to 2014 likely resulted from density dependent shifts in the remigration interval which may have resulted from the pulse mortality event a density dependent remigration effect in response to the 2010 pulse mortality event provides a more feasible explanation for the post 2010 population fluctuations than does either the pulse or the press hypothesis alone only one version of the press effect with a 2 year duration and decreased mortality the second year produced a sufficient increase in nest counts in 2011 logically extending the event related mortality past the year of the event reduces the likelihood of population recovery the following year of the 11 versions of the pulse effect that produced a sufficient increase in nest counts in 2011 none produced 2012 nest counts sufficiently close to the 2011 counts in each case nest counts resumed essentially exponential growth beginning after 2011 not surprisingly there was little difference in the 2011 nest counts among the 11 pulse versions all of which included event related mortality in the last sub adult and all of the adult age classes that is the event related mortality affected all of the cohorts that potentially could have nested in 2011 whether event related mortality had occurred in cohorts that still would have been pre reproductive in 2011 would not have been detectable based directly on nest counts only the density dependent remigration versions 29 of 36 produced fluctuations in 2010 2014 nest counts qualitatively similar to those observed at the index beach of these only two versions both with non linear density dependent relationships produced fluctuations that mirrored the timing and closely approximated the magnitudes of those at the index beach however one version with a linear density dependent relationship failed only in that its nest counts resumed their final increase a year too soon in 2014 rather than 2015 that a density dependent relationship was required to produce the 2010 2014 nest count fluctuations seems commonsensical both mathematically and ecologically mathematically each simulated population was in the stable age class distribution in 2009 at the time the mortality event was imposed the stable age class distribution is the unchanging proportional distribution of individuals among the age classes that is generated by the constant age specific mortality and recruitment rates of the population a population in the stable age class distribution can only exhibit exponential growth exponential decline or exact equilibrium for λ 1 λ 1 and λ 1 respectively we began all of the simulations in this study with the population in the stable age class in 1985 which facilitated comparison of population dynamics among different simulations both during the 1985 2009 calibration period and during the 2010 2014 evaluation period of course after cessation of the either pulse or press period of altered mortality rates the population necessarily will return to its stable age class distribution and resume its pattern of exponential growth assuming λ 1 the length of time needed to re establish the stable age class distribution as well as the details of the population fluctuations prior to re establishing the stable age class distribution depends on the exact manner in which the age specific mortality rates were altered thus although it certainly is not impossible for a particular set of temporary age specific mortality rate alterations to result in subsequent population fluctuations the overriding tendency is for the population to resume the exponential growth dictated by its set of constant age specific demographic rates we examined 56 sets of age specific pulse mortality rate alterations all of which arguably had at least some ecologically reasonable basis without successfully generating the observed nest count fluctuations the caveat of course is that we do know the real age class distribution of the population just prior to the 2010 mortality event ecologically independent of the 2010 oil spill there is of course a strong theoretical argument for density dependent negative feedback on population growth there are limits to growth in the case of the kemp s ridley in the gulf of mexico there also is an empirically based ecological argument that population size might be approaching a point at which such density dependent negative feedback on population growth could become apparent caillouet et al 2016a gallaway et al 2016b convincingly elaborate the details of this argument which might be summarized as follows the primary tenet of the argument is that mature females now need to spend more time on their foraging grounds in the northern gulf to build up sufficient energy reserves to support remigration to their nesting grounds in mexico than was typical at smaller population sizes this elongates the remigration interval of individuals and reduces the proportion of potential nesters that return to nest in any given year this density dependency of the remigration interval results not only from kemp s ridley population increase per se but also from declining food resources that further reduce per capita food availability even though mollusks vegetation and shrimp are potential food sources for neritic stage kemp s ridley shaver 1991 crabs and fish discards from shrimp trawling are the most important food sources seney and musick 2005 witzell and schmid 2005 and both have decreased markedly in the gulf over the past two decades vanderkooy 2013 it is reasonable to infer that the reduction in per capita availability of prey resources might be sufficient to lengthen the average remigration interval and hence reduce the average annual number of nests one might expect year to year variability in nest counts due to year to year variability in availability of food sources to become more pronounced as the population approaches carrying capacity caillouet et al 2018a marn et al 2017 the resulting variation in year class strengths coupled with the life history trait of delayed reproductive maturity poses a management challenge analogous to that encountered in marine fisheries based on long lived species with delayed onset of reproduction that is the population level impact of a demographic mark in the form of a weak year class would be time lagged and potentially long lasting as the small cohort passes through the reproductive age classes whether or not the 2010 oil spill left a demographic mark on the kemp s ridley population remains an open question caillouet 2014 has suggested that the loss of adults and sub adults between the end of the nesting seasons in 2009 and 2010 may have been a key factor responsible for the 2010 to 2014 decline in nest counts at the index beach gallaway et al 2016a noted that while the general timing of the mortality event corresponded with the occurrence of the oil spill typically most of the reproductively active females would have migrated out of the area of the spill before it occurred 20 april however gallaway et al 2016b added the caveat that cold temperatures might have delayed the 2010 migration 2010 winter spring seawater temperatures in the northern gulf foraging grounds were among the coldest on record elizabeth bevan unpublished data as cited in gallaway et al 2016b our simulation results are consistent with both caillouet s caillouet 2014 demographic mark hypothesis and gallaway et al s 2016a b density dependent remigration hypothesis however given the trend of increasing nest counts at the index beach from 2015 to 2017 the resumption of exponential growth projected by all of our pulse and press simulations as well as the results of our sensitivity analysis identification of the negative feedback mechanisms that ultimately will limit population growth seems a more pressing concern projections of the best version of our model suggested that the adult female population could reach 110 000 by 2035 which is approaching the historical high among our sensitivity analysis simulations the three worst scenarios increasing post hatchling mortality rate by 30 of its baseline value increasing post hatchling mortality rate by 20 of its baseline value and postponing the knife edge age at first reproduction from 12 years to 14 years all resulted in increasing populations λ values of 1 053 1 105 and 1 151 respectively decreasing the remigration rate by 30 of its baseline value also resulted in an increasing population λ value of 1 154 these sensitivity analysis simulations in essence might be interpreted as representing long lasting press effects since the altered parameter was held constant for the duration of each simulation after elaborating on these interpretations of our simulation results we hasten to acknowledge that they prove absolutely nothing arguably this acknowledgement already is implicit in the term simulation results nonetheless lest there is any doubt we offer a frank albeit unavoidably biased statement about the legitimate expectations of our model and ecological modeling in general ecological modeling provides a method to simplify reality to enhance understanding through the synthesis of data knowledge and assumptions in a disciplined way for a specific objective our objective has been to investigate the feasibility of several hypothesized cause effect relationships between population dynamics of the kemp s ridley sea turtle and the 2010 oil spill in the gulf of mexico our method has been to represent the hypothesized pulse press and density dependent remigration effects in different versions of an age structured model and attempt to simulate the observed post 2010 population fluctuations as indicated by nest counts at the index beach and also to project future population trends observational data and existing knowledge rarely are sufficient for establishing causal relationships in complex natural systems models based on this information cannot establish causality nor predict the future but can aid us in assessing the feasibility of hypothesized cause effect relationships as we have done in this study therefore the ability to explore potential population level consequences of age specific responses to environmental events is a primary strength of a model such as ours tanioka and matsumoto 2018 within a management context simulation results can provide insight into the potential responses of an age structured population of long lived animals to both natural disasters and management initiatives fuentes and porter 2013 piacenza et al 2017 in the present case perhaps of most interest among our initial results is the apparent resiliency of the population to large mortality events of short duration however two important caveats to this statement are the assumptions 1 that there will be no reduction of suitable habitat and 2 that per capita availability of food resources will be sufficient to support population recovery both of these assumptions are questionable clough et al 2017 leo et al 2016 ultimately of course suitable habitat and or food availability will limit further population growth there are indications of a reduction in suitable nearshore habitat in the northern gulf of mexico which constitutes one of the most important foraging grounds gil weir et al 2012 shaver et al 2013 due to a greatly expanded hypoxic zone scavia et al 2017 and a decreasing area of wetlands turner 1997 there also are indications that per capita availability of neritic food may already have begun to decline due to the long term trends of degradation of the gulf of mexico ecosystem and increasing population size of kemp s ridleys caillouet et al 2018b declarations of interest none acknowledgements we would like to thank rusty a feagin and charles w caillouet jr as well as three anonymous reviewers and the subject editor for providing comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript the manuscript is greatly improved as a result of their comments appendix a kemp s ridley distribution life history and conservation the kemp s ridley sea turtle lepidochelys kempii is a highly charismatic critically endangered species endemic to the gulf of mexico caillouet et al 2016b their most major decline from 1947 to 1985 was due to a number of causes a small geographic range the smallest of all sea turtle species zug et al 1997 natural and anthropogenic predation heithaus et al 2008 life history characteristics such as high hatchling mortality and a late maturity schedule bjorndal et al 2014 heppell et al 1996 commercial fisheries bycatch lewison et al 2003 and potentially oil spills gallaway et al 2016b while a number of conservation projects have been developed since the 1960s bowen et al 1994 francis 1978 and continue to contribute to species recovery they alone do not account for the recent population trends seen in the historical nesting data particularly the significant decrease in 2010 and subsequent fluctuations as evidenced by gallaway et al 2016a and gallaway et al 2016b in this appendix the kemp s ridley distribution life history and conservation efforts that led to the current study are discussed the rationale and objectives given were formulated based on an extensive scientific literature review the results of which also provided the basis for the creation of an age based population model the model was used to assess the post 2010 kemp s ridley sea turtle population dynamics and to describe potential underlying causes the goal was to develop a model that will enable researchers to fill gaps in the current knowledge of the species to refine future management strategies a 1 distribution the kemp s ridley sea turtle has the most restricted geographic range amongst all sea turtle species zug et al 1997 part of this restriction is due to some unique life history characteristics and or competition that prevent individuals from migrating too far from their natal beach morreale et al 2007 shaver et al 2013 while some adolescents make their way to the atlantic coast or are swept over to europe carreras et al 2014 insacco and spadola 2010 adults primarily forage and almost exclusively breed in the gulf of mexico zug et al 1997 it is reported that 90 of the kemp s ridley population nest along the beaches of rancho nuevo metz and landry 2016 the 60 km area from barra ostionales tepehuajes to playa dos barra del tordo fig 1 is collectively referred to as the index beach from which the majority of population survival and mortality estimates stem caillouet et al 2016b the species has also been recorded to nest along the texas coast shaver et al 2005 and in veracruz mexico carr and caldwell 1958 shaver et al 2017 and a very limited number of nests have been recorded in florida shaver et al 2016 it is known that adult females migrate to foraging grounds when they are not nesting shaver et al 2013 an early study showed the most popular foraging areas for adults and sub adults alike were the coastal waters from port aransas texas to cedar key florida ogren 1989 much later lohmann et al 2013 found that kemp s ridleys also travel south from rancho nuevo to forage around the yucatan peninsula shaver et al 2013 tracked post nesting females from pais and rancho nuevo tamaulipas mexico using satellite telemetry and found more precise foraging hotspots in the northern gulf of mexico particularly within the nearshore zones of louisiana in addition coleman et al 2017 demonstrated that the mississippi sound is crucial habitat for developmental stages of kemp s ridleys renaud et al 1996 used satellite telemetry to track the movements of a female kemp s ridley released in august 1994 off the louisiana coast and followed to rancho nuevo where she successfully nested in april and may of 1995 shaver et al 2016 conducted a similar study on a larger scale and were able to track two individuals who each made a complete remigration to and from their natal beach this study also established the importance of nearshore migratory corridors for female kemp s ridleys in the gulf of mexico which vary temporally and is supported by a subsequent analysis on inter nesting habitat and home ranges of post nesting females shaver et al 2017 a 2 life history basic life stages include pelagic post hatchling juvenile sub adult and adult heppell et al 2005 ogren 1989 pelagic post hatchlings age classes 0 and 1 years are individuals who survive long enough after hatching to enter the ocean individuals remain as pelagic post hatchlings until they reach 20 cm scl heppell et al 2005 they feed on floating sargassum sp seaweed and its associated invertebrates witherington et al 2012 juveniles age classes 2 through 5 years are individuals between 20 and 50 cm scl and feed in the benthic and neritic zones of the ocean floor heppell et al 2005 schmid and witzell 1997 these individuals are far from reaching sexual maturity and suffer from higher per capita mortality than subsequent life stages sub adults age classes 6 through 11 years are individuals between 50 and 60 cm scl that feed on benthic neritic dwelling organisms heppell et al 2005 sub adults have undergone sexual development but are not yet capable of reproduction coyne 2000 adults age classes 12 through 14 years are individuals greater than 60 cm scl feed on near shore benthic dwelling organisms and have reached sexual maturity heppell et al 2005 ogren 1989 estimates of age of sexual maturity range from 10 to 17 years snover and hohn 2004 a knife edge estimate of 12 years has been supported by skeletochronological data snover and hohn 2004 the kemp s ridley population suffers from high mortality rates during most of its life stages zug et al 1997 pelagic post hatchlings incur the highest per capita mortality rates while sub adults and adults incur the least kemp s ridley adult females lay an average of 2 5 clutches of approximately 97 eggs during the daytime hours of each participatory nesting season frey et al 2014 the nesting season typically ranges from april to june of the same calendar year at the index beach but some females nest as early as march rostal et al 1998 those participating typically congregate in near shore waters before coming to shore in massive arribadas or huge simultaneous nesting aggregations pritchard 1969 this synchronization of reproduction makes the lepidochelys genus unique and is only observed at a handful of beaches worldwide hirth 1980 kemp s ridley arribadas are particularly unique since they are always observed as diurnal pritchard 2007 though this may promote easier access of predators to nests or nesting females females dig a hole in the sand with their rear flippers lay eggs in the hole and cover them up before returning to the ocean after the eggs incubate for 50 55 days the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the ocean rostal et al 1998 many hatchlings do not survive this journey to the water due to natural predators such as coyotes ghost crabs and shore birds rostal et al 1998 those individuals that reach the water called pelagic post hatchlings may also face aquatic predators such as sharks or large predatory fish rostal et al 1998 the typical pelagic post hatchling individual that makes it to open water seeks out invertebrates living in or around floating sargassum sp to sustain the first few years of their life witherington et al 2012 it was long thought that post hatchlings were pelagic drifters meaning they did not actively swim nor choose their own course at sea they simply were pushed and pulled by the ocean s currents as the method of dispersal from the nesting beach witherington et al 2012 however recent investigations found evidence contrary to this notion putman and mansfield 2015 once the hatchlings reach the juvenile classification they begin consuming benthic dwelling invertebrates in coastal regions of the gulf of mexico and continue to do so for another three to four years of their life schmid and witzell 1997 this may include blue crab callinectes sapidus and benthic tunicates witzell and schmid 2005 as sub adults and adults blue crabs become their primary prey item followed by mollusks and fish seney and musick 2005 the fish component of the diet may be discards from shrimp trawl bycatch gallaway et al 2016a the kemp s ridley prey availability most likely plays a huge role in reproductive capacity and or remigration gallaway et al 2016b it is thought that without enough foraging time or organisms to forage on a female will not make the journey back to the nesting beach that year therefore foregoing reproduction altogether until the following nesting season hays 2000 however more explicit testing is needed to support this claim this delay of reproduction gave rise to the density dependent nature of the remigration rate hypothesis discussed later in this chapter gallaway et al 2016b still the energetics relating female body size and or weight to amount of food intake have yet to be determined a 3 conservation in 1966 mexico s instituto nacional de investigaciones biologico pesqueras began surveys in rancho nuevo to protect the kemp s ridley from egg exploitation heppell et al 2007 it was the first conservation effort reported for this species however the population continued to decline it was not until 1977 that bi national conservation efforts came to fruition heppell et al 2007 an informal kemp s ridley working group formed to create a recovery plan and in 1978 the first fenced corrals were placed in rancho nuevo heppell et al 2007 shortly following the implementation of this strategy it became clear a policy change was needed for fishing and shrimping operations conducted offshore during the nesting season heppell et al 2007 this led researchers to develop turtle excluder devices teds and policies were written to enforce this strategy crowder et al 1994 lewison et al 2003 lastly the experimental practice of imprinting and headstarting hatchlings was set in motion at the padre island national seashore pais in 1978 to promote the establishment potential for a second nesting population shaver and wibbels 2007 in 1992 a down listing criterion was set at 10 000 nesting females for the kemp s ridley heppell et al 2005 more recently new criteria have been established which require the annual release of 300 000 hatchlings and 25 000 nests laid annually at the index beach caillouet et al 2016a the 25 000 nest requirement can be converted to a 10 000 nesting female requirement by dividing the number of nests by the number of clutches laid per nesting season per female 2 5 caillouet et al 2016a caillouet et al 2016 demonstrated that conservation efforts have produced the required number of hatchlings but the population has not yet reached the requirement for number of nesting females some speculate the lasting effects that oil spills have had on coastal ecosystems can account for struggling populations crowder and heppell 2011 while others believe there could be more to the picture in this section the successes of various conservation programs and hardships the kemp s ridley has experienced throughout the past 40 years are discussed a 3 1 nesting beaches the index beach which extends from barra ostionales tepehuajes to playa dos barra del tordo in tamaulipas mexico fig 1 is where the vast majority of the kemp s ridley population nests caillouet et al 2016a as early as 1947 the herrera film documented a massive single day arribada for the first time on film from which dr henry h hildebrand estimated around 40 000 nesting females were present shaver and wibbels 2007 however bevan et al 2016 evaluated the accuracy of this estimation and found it was overestimated the group estimated closer to a mean of 26 916 nesting females came to nest at the index beach during that single day this translates to a total nesting female population of about 48 607 and a total nesting season nest count of 121 517 for 1947 compared to the 1985 nest count of 702 bevan et al 2016 the kemp s ridley population underwent a severe decline in those 38 years nearly to the point of extinction a 3 2 head start program in 1978 the united states of america and mexico teamed up to form the kemp s ridley sea turtle head start experiment in a last ditch effort to save the species from extinction shaver and wibbels 2007 one of the general ideas to support this species was to provide a second nesting beach to establish a second nesting colony at the pais shaver and wibbels 2007 the idea had been attempted before in texas but at a much smaller scale woody 1989 coupled with the head start program s objective to raise hatchlings in captivity the efforts aimed to alleviate the high post hatchling mortality rate during the first year of life and to enhance species survival in the event a disaster struck the primary nesting beach in mexico shaver and wibbels 2007 experimental by its very nature there were and perhaps still are many criticisms of the program the biggest criticisms stem from the idea of jeopardizing an already critically endangered species by using it to test a new protocol not to mention doubts concerning whether or not captive reared turtles would survive well in the wild shaver and wibbels 2007 it is also very costly to foster hatchlings for months at a time woody 1989 the original plan included anywhere from 9 to 11 months of raising hatchlings in captivity but it was intended to increase the likelihood of survival of the post hatchling life stage to the juvenile stage which experiences significantly less mortality due to larger body size shaver and wibbels 2007 these notions however may simply have been provided to delay experimental action from being taken when faced with dire circumstances management officials more often must act on behalf of saving a species from extinction before a scientific consensus is achieved supporters of the head start program contended that the kemp s ridley had already declined to the point whereby natural recovery was no longer possible otherwise known as the allee effect bell et al 2010 early kemp s ridley advocates such as dr archie carr were some of the first to suggest that young sea turtles can imprint on their natal beach and subsequently return there to nest when they reach sexual maturity carr 1987 though at the time there was limited evidence to support this claim other advocates supported the program to acquire this knowledge bell et al 2010 after developing an age structured matrix model for the kemp s ridley population heppell et al 1996 discussed the impact of the program on the overall population the authors comment on how these types of recovery programs cannot be evaluated until data exist on the survival and growth rates of both wild and headstarted shaver and wibbels 2007 similarly heppell and crowder 1998 contended that the head start program successes were minimal compared to teds even today forty years later the program is still being evaluated albeit owing some of its delay to the late sexual maturation that characterizes kemp s ridleys at the very least caillouet et al 2015 states clearly that the program provided a way to tag and subsequently identify nearly all individuals the program released especially with respect to identifying which individuals are returning to their natal beaches a 3 3 at sea mortality pelagic post hatchlings withstand the highest mortality rates of all age classes in the population witherington et al 2012 this is likely due to their small size however the estimation of this parameter is not backed by much direct evidence since it is nearly impossible to monitor these individuals once they reach the open ocean witherington et al 2012 after reaching the juvenile stage most kemp s ridleys stay close to the coast or continental shelf in the gulf of mexico unfortunately this means the turtles suffer additional mortality from high incidental capture in commercial fishing especially shrimping operations frazier et al 2007 as concern for this added mortality mounted national research council conducted a study that concluded sea turtle bycatch in shrimp trawls killed more individuals than all other human activities combined their statement supported the development and eventual mandatory use of turtle excluder devices ted in all commercial fishery operations from the united states frazier et al 2007 a ted consists of a barred metal ring that fits inside a commercial fishing or trawling net crowder et al 1994 the bars are spaced precisely such that organisms larger than the target species are not able to continue through into the net crowder et al 1994 over the years this device has been perfected to nearly a 99 success rate for a sea turtle to escape brewer et al 2006 not only do teds help prevent sea turtle bycatch mortality but other species are also excluded from the landed catch these include but are not limited to sharks stingrays and non target fishes brewer et al 2006 teds made their first appearance in 1983 as voluntarily installations in commercial shrimp trawling nets margavio et al 1993 five years later enough scientific evidence on teds had been gathered to require seasonal use of teds on all shrimping vessels operating in offshore waters and by the end of 1994 nmfs extended the mandate to include ted use on operating vessels at all times and in all waters nearshore and offshore yaninek 1995 more recently in december 2016 noaa proposed that all skimmer trawls pusher head trawls and wing net vessels should be required to have teds in their nets designed to enable smaller sea turtles to escape although public comments were accepted as late as february 2017 the results of this proposition are still forthcoming a 3 4 deepwater horizon oil spill the deepwater horizon oil spill was arguably the largest marine oil spill in the history of the united states and quite possibly the largest within the entire petroleum industry gallaway et al 2016b despite several capping attempts oil and natural gas continuously and uncontrollably spewed into the gulf of mexico for 87 consecutive days beginning april 20 2010 releasing an unprecedented 134 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico reddy et al 2012 the cumulative extent of the oil can be seen in fig 2 which covers part of the kemp s ridley s foraging grounds of the estimated 200 million gallons of oil that flowed from the wellhead roughly 3 5 6 10 million gallons has settled to the seafloor while approximately 11 25 22 50 million gallons is still unaccounted for reddy et al 2012 this has created extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats recreational and commercial fishing and tourism industries but long term effects are still being monitored white et al 2012 the event was documented to have interacted directly and indirectly with sea turtles including the kemp s ridley gallaway et al 2016b appendix b rationale for current study and cause effect hypotheses tested b 1 rationale for current study prior to 2010 the recovery of the kemp s ridley population looked promising since the lowest point in 1985 the nest count at the index beach depicted an exponential annual population growth rate increase of 19 per year largely due to the aforementioned conservation efforts heppell et al 2007 however between 2009 and 2010 nesting seasons a mortality event occurred followed by subsequent population fluctuations the deepwater horizon oil spill which occurred during this time frame have been directly responsible for the unprecedented increase in sea turtle strandings as well as the 35 reduction in nesting success along the index beach in 2010 gallaway et al 2016b reich et al 2017 this reduction in nesting success is significantly larger than previous reductions observed historically in 2001 and 2004 15 and 17 respectively see fig 3 annual nest counts at the primary nesting beach in tamaulipas mexico are considered the best index of the kemp s ridley sea turtle population dynamics fig 3 dotted lines in fig 3 indicates the partitioning of these nest count data for use in the present study a data from 1986 to 2009 were used for model calibration b data from 2010 to 2014 were used for hypothesis testing and c data from 2015 to 2017 were used for model validation these data were not available during model development and still are considered preliminary at the present time several cause effect relationships between the 2010 mortality event and the subsequent population fluctuations have been hypothesized these include but are not limited to 1 a single year pulse effect increasing kemp s ridley mortality caillouet et al 2011 crowder and heppell 2011 gallaway et al 2016b 2 a multiple year press effect increasing kemp s ridley mortality caillouet et al 2011 crowder and heppell 2011 gallaway et al 2016b 3 a density dependent negative feedback decreasing kemp s ridley hatchling recruitment due to a lengthened remigration interval caillouet et al 2011 gallaway et al 2016a b a diagram of how these hypotheses were tested can be seen in fig 4 b 2 rationale for cause effect hypotheses the rationale behind the first two hypotheses is that in 2010 and 2011 an unprecedented number of kemp s ridleys were found stranded and or dead in the gulf of mexico gallaway et al 2016a additionally caillouet 2011 noted that nest counts made at the index beach were coincidentally no longer increasing exponentially but rather had decreased in 2010 about 35 gallaway et al 2016b from this evidence it was hypothesized that a single significant mortality event occurred in 2010 which caused subsequent population fluctuations hypothesis 1 gallaway et al 2016a b it also was hypothesized that this large mortality event in 2010 was followed by increased mortality over an extended period of time which caused subsequent population fluctuations hypothesis 2 gallaway et al 2016a b implicit in both of these hypotheses is that the mortality might be age specific caillouet 2011 suggested that such age specific mortality would have altered the population age structure and could have had a long lasting effect on population dynamics the rationale behind the third hypothesis is that a decrease in food in the foraging grounds of the northern gulf of mexico over the past two decades has led to increasing density dependent competition for food which has increased the length of time necessary for adult females to regain a sufficient body condition to migrate back to the nesting beach gallaway et al 2016b thus the remigration interval has lengthened yielding an overall reduction of the annual number of adult females actually nesting in a given nesting season and decreasing recruitment of individuals into the population thereby slowing population growth feeding conditions vary from year to year and have been shown to affect the remigration rate of sea turtles gallaway et al 2016b hays 2000 hence the number of turtles nesting in different years also changes crabs constitute the bulk of the diet of adult kemp s ridleys and the western blue crab stock which occupies the main kemp s ridley feeding grounds in the northern gulf of mexico has been depressed since the mid 1990 s vanderkooy 2013 fish discarded as by catch from shrimp trawlers historically have been an important food item cannon 1998 but shrimping effort in the main kemp s ridley feeding grounds the inshore zone and the 0 to 10 fathom nearshore zone declined sharply between 2000 and 2005 and has remained low gallaway et al 2016b thus food availability may have been approaching a critical level prior to 2010 therefore it seems feasible that reduced per capita availability of blue crabs and shrimp trawl by catch in the northern gulf of mexico might result in density dependent increases in the remigration interval of adult female kemp s ridleys and concomitant decreases in the annual

25148,the kemp s ridley lepidochelys kempii is a critically endangered sea turtle that breeds nearly exclusively in the gulf of mexico with scattered nesting along the u s atlantic coast in 2010 an unprecedented increase in strandings concomitant with a large oil spill in the northern gulf raised concern about impacts on population recovery we used several versions of an age structured model representing hypothesized pulse press and density dependent remigration effects of the 2010 mortality event to simulate post 2010 population dynamics only a density dependent remigration version simulated population fluctuations observed from 2009 to 2014 population dynamics projected through 2035 using this version indicated essentially exponential growth with the simulated adult female population reaching 110 000 in 2035 as indicated by nest counts at the index beach of most interest within a management context is the apparent resiliency of the population to large mortality events of short duration two important caveats to this statement are the assumptions that there has been no reduction of suitable habitats and that per capita availability of food resources is sufficient to support population recovery simulation results also provide insight into the myriad of potential responses of an age structured population of long lived animals to such events keywords age structured model population projection remigration lepidochelys kempii 1 introduction the kemp s ridley lepidochelys kempii is a critically endangered sea turtle that nests almost exclusively in the gulf of mexico where the vast majority of individuals complete their life cycle although there is scattered nesting along the u s atlantic coast see appendix a for background on kemp s ridley distribution life history and conservation prior to 2010 based on nest counts and hatchling production data from the index beach in the principal nesting area in tamaulipas mexico fig 1 a the population appeared to be recovering caillouet et al 2016a nest counts from the index beaches are considered the best indicator of the status of the species caillouet et al 2016a sims et al 2008 heppell et al 2005 drawing on data from 1996 to 1999 at the index beach used an age structured model to estimate an annual growth rate of 12 16 immediately prior to 2010 an annual growth rate of 19 was projected for the period from 2010 to 2020 crowder and heppell 2011 heppell et al 2005 however in 2010 coincident with a large oil spill there was an unprecedented increase in strandings in the northern gulf of mexico and the pre 2010 trend of nesting increase was interrupted caillouet 2011 gallaway et al 2016b after a rebound in 2011 and 2012 nesting success again declined in 2013 and 2014 raising concern about the failure of the population to resume its previous rate of growth crowder and heppell 2011 gallaway et al 2016a b fig 1b parts a and b several authors stated or implied that the 2010 oil spill could have impacted specific life stages of kemp s ridley thus altering population age structure and creating a potentially long lasting demographic mark that could delay recovery by reducing population momentum caillouet 2011 caillouet et al 2016b crowder and heppell 2011 shortly after the 2010 oil spill crowder and heppell 2011 used an age structured population model developed in conjunction with the turtle expert working group to examine possible impacts of the 2010 spill or similar disasters on kemp s ridley population recovery they explored the effects of disaster related mortality on different life stages and differentiated between one year pulse and multi year slowly degrading press impacts their model results suggested that pulse impacts affecting large juveniles and adults would cause a relatively modest long term effect on population growth because of the population momentum driven by two decades of increased productivity assuming no lingering effects of survival and fertility rates however population responses to press impacts were influenced strongly by the manner in which the effects on survival and fertility rates decayed over time caillouet 2014 these results are not surprising given that not all females nest every year crowder et al 1994 lewison et al 2003 also shortly after the oil spill caillouet et al 2011 suggested that the post 2010 decline in nests could have resulted from a reduction in the numbers of sub adults and adults between the nesting seasons of 2009 and 2010 which subsequently reduced the number of nesting kemp s ridleys and therefore the number of hatchlings in 2010 and beyond more recently gallaway et al 2016a developed a new kemp s ridley stock assessment model this model was developed to examine the status and trends of the kemp s ridley stock to evaluate the impacts of shrimp trawl bycatch mortality and to provide model outputs that could be used as a baseline to evaluate the effects of the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 when the estimated 2010 oil spill related mortality was added to the initial kemp s ridley stock assessment model gallaway et al 2016a which otherwise was parameterized based on data collected up to 2009 model results suggested that the population would resume its previous growth trend the year after the oil spill cleanup similar in general to the response to pulse impacts suggested by crowder and heppell 2011 this prompted gallaway et al 2016b to propose several modifications to the initial version of kemp s ridley stock assessment model each representing a potential cause effect relationship that might explain post 2010 population trends among these modifications was a density dependent nests per adult female effect in which nests per adult female was a function of the number of individuals in the population that were 2 or more years old which we hereafter refer to as the density dependent remigration effect appendix b provides the rationale for this effect as well as for the pulse and press effects using this density dependent version of their model gallaway et al 2016b were able to project the 2014 population decline although they did not present model projections beyond 2014 in the wake of the 2010 oil spill bjorndal et al 2011 identified several key elements that should be included in strategic plans for sea turtles the first two of these elements were to 1 integrate demography with abundance trends for multiple life states and determine environmental effects on those parameters and 2 emphasize analyses of cumulative effects to date the demographic processes driving the post 2010 population dynamics of kemp s ridley remain enigmatic however more recent data from the index beach 2015 2017 fig 1b part c allow further exploration of the myriad of potential responses of an age structured population of long lived animals to a large mortality event in this paper we use several versions of an age structured model to simulate population dynamics of the endangered kemp s ridley sea turtle following the 2010 oil spill in the gulf of mexico we first present the basic model calibrate the baseline version of the model and analyze the sensitivity of simulated annual growth rate to changes in demographic parameters next we parameterize several versions of the model to represent different versions of the pulse press and density dependent remigration effects of the 2010 mortality event we then evaluate the ability of each version to simulate the fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach during the four years following the 2010 event finally we validate sensu rykiel 1996 those versions capable of simulating the 2010 2014 fluctuations against more recent 2015 2017 nest counts at the index beach and use those validated versions to project the population trend through 2035 2 materials and methods 2 1 the basic model we formulated the model as an age structured compartment model based on difference equations with a 1 year time step programmed in stella professional version 1 4 1 for windows isee systems inc 2017 fig 2 a we grouped yearly age classes into pelagic post hatchling juvenile sub adult and adult life stages table 1 for purposes of assigning stage specific mortality rates table 2 these stages were identified by ogren 1989 and heppell et al 2005 based on significant changes in mortality and sexual maturity among other life history traits we provide definitions of model components values and sources of model parameters and model equations in tables 1 2 and 3 respectively proportion of nests and hatching rates in situ versus in corrals boxes in tables 1 and 2 refers to the kemp s ridley head start program see appendix a 3 2 the primary output of the model is the simulated annual nest count at the index beach which is calculated as the product of number of reproductively mature females proportion of mature females nesting proportion remigrating to the nesting beach and number of clutches 2 5 laid per nesting female 2 2 calibration and sensitivity analysis of baseline version of model we calibrated the baseline version of the model such that the simulated annual nest counts approximated the nest counts observed from 1985 to 2009 at the index beach by increasing the post hatchling natural mortality rate to 110 of its original value from 0 682 to 0 7502 table 2 for all of the model calibration simulations we verified that the population was in the stable age class distribution and produced the number of nests recorded 702 nests at the index beach in 1985 gallaway et al 2016a the simulated nests produced by the calibrated model increased at an average annual rate λ 1 1455 within 2 of the observed average annual rate λ 1 1653 and the simulated nest count in 2009 18 289 was within 5 of the observed nest count 19 163 fig 2b we analyzed the sensitivity of annual population growth rate λ as indicated by annual increase in simulated nest counts to changes in 12 demographic parameters and 10 age specific maturity schedules we changed demographic parameters over a range of 30 of their baseline values appendix c 1 and analyzed both knife edge and continuous representations of the maturity schedule appendix c 2 for knife edge representations we changed the age at first reproduction and all females classified as old as or older than the specified age were considered reproductively capable whereas all females younger than the specified age 12 years old were considered incapable of reproduction for continuous representations gradual maturity we classified different proportions of the females in the various age classes as reproductively capable as suggested by nmfs usfws 2015 for all of the sensitivity analysis simulations we once again verified that the population was in the stable age class distribution and produced the number of nests recorded at the index beach in 1985 sensitivity analyses produced estimates of λ that ranged from 1 053 to 1 253 with the lowest and highest λ produced by increasing and decreasing respectively post hatchling mortality rate by 30 of its baseline value fig 2c postponing the knife edge age at first reproduction from 12 years to 14 years produced the third lowest λ 1 151 increasing post hatchling mortality rate by 20 produced the second lowest λ 1 105 whereas advancing the age at first reproduction to 9 years produced the second highest λ 1 241 increasing and decreasing the remigration rate by 30 of its baseline value produced λ values of 1 197 and 1 154 respectively see appendix c 3 c 4 for complete results of sensitivity analyses supplementary sensitivity analyses indicated that mortality rates could be increased uniformly across all age classes by 22 before λ fell below 1 0 and the remigration rate could be decreased by 94 from 0 5 to 0 03 thus increasing the average remigration interval from 2 to 32 years before λ fell below 1 0 note that nesting females generally account for 1 of the total population crowder et al 1994 lewison et al 2003 thus a population level average remigration interval of 32 years does not imply that any individual female would have such a biologically unreasonable remigration interval 2 3 parameterization of pulse press and density dependent remigration versions of model we parameterized several versions of the model to represent different versions of the pulse press and density dependent remigration effects of the 2010 mortality event fig 3 a we parameterized the pulse effect versions of the model by increasing the mortality rate of all or selected age classes during the year 2010 only assuming the 2010 event related mortality was additive to natural mortality gallaway et al 2016b estimated the additional 2010 event related mortality at 31 2 and we used their estimate as a point of reference however we also increased and decreased this magnitude by 10 20 and 30 and distributed the additional mortality across the age classes in a variety of ways appendix d 1 we parameterized the press effect versions of the model by extending the additional mortality past the year 2010 assuming the initial magnitude of the additive mortality decreased over time either abruptly or gradually fig 3b we extended the additional mortality for 2 3 4 and 5 years and distributed the additional mortality across the age classes in a variety of ways appendix d 2 for gradual decreases in the additional mortality rate we assumed an exponential decline 1 i f y y e a n d y y e l e t h e n a e e s e y y e where y represents year ye represents the year of the mortality event ae represents the additive mortality from the event mx represents natural mortality of age x le represents the number of years over which the increased mortality was extended and se represents the slope of an exponential decay curve the se associated with each le was assigned a value such that the total mortality rate decreased from the 2010 rate pre 2010 natural mortality rate 2010 event related mortality rate to the pre 2010 natural mortality rate in le years we parameterized the density dependent remigration effect versions of the model by replacing the remigration rate constant r 0 5 which represents a nesting female returning to nest at the index beach every 2 years with one of the following four functional relationships 2 r β1rs β0 linear decrease 3 r e β1rs exponential decrease 4 r β 2 r s 2 β 1 r s β 0 s e c o n d o r d e r p o l y n o m i a l 5 r β 0 β 1 e β 2 β 3 r s 1 e β 2 β 3 r s i n v e r s e l o g i s t i c d e c r e a s e where r represents the remigration rate rs represents the number of reproductively mature individuals in the population and βx represents the associated coefficients fig 3c we parameterized each of these equations in a variety of ways appendix d 3 we bounded r between 1 0 and 0 2 based on an analysis of sea turtle remigration rates by hays 2000 which suggested remigration intervals usually are between 1 and 5 years we assumed the decreases in r governed by these equations occurred over the range 20 000 rs 40 000 that is we assumed the density dependent effect was negligible below rs 20 000 and was not intensified beyond rs 40 000 2 4 evaluation of pulse press and density dependent remigration versions of model we evaluated each version of the model based on its ability to meet four criteria which characterize the fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 1 the simulated 2010 nest count should decrease to within 15 of the 2010 nest count at the index beach 12 377 nests 2 the simulated 2011 nest count should increase to within 15 of the 2011 nest count at the index beach 18 215 nests 3 the simulated 2012 nest count should remain within 10 of the simulated 2011 nest count the 2011 and 2012 nest counts at the index beach plateaued 4 the simulated nest counts should decrease in 2013 and decrease further in 2014 the 2013 and 2014 nest counts at the index beach continued to decline the evaluation procedure was sequential first we evaluated the 63 versions of the model representing the pulse effect appendix d 1 then we evaluated the press versions related to those pulse versions that had met at least the first two criteria appendix d 2 finally we evaluated the density dependent remigration versions related to those pulse and press versions that had met at least the first two criteria appendix d 3 2 5 model validation and population projection we validated sensu rykiel 1996 those versions of the model that met all four criteria characterizing the 2010 2014 fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach by extending simulations to 2017 and comparing simulated nest counts to more recent 2015 2017 nest counts at the index beach note that the 2015 2017 nest counts were not available during model development fig 1c part c and still are considered preliminary we used the validated version of the model to project the kemp s ridley population trend based on simulated nest counts through 2035 3 results 3 1 evaluation of pulse press and density dependent remigration versions of model of the 63 model versions representing the pulse effect appendix d 1 none met all four criteria however 11 versions met the first two criteria the universal version u4 and age specific versions as1 as10 there was little difference in the 2010 or 2011 nest counts among these 11 versions all of which included event related mortality in the last sub adult and all of the adult age classes those versions that best satisfied these criteria were version u4 fig 4 a and version as10 fig 4b these two versions produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 12 and 4 respectively of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 of the 88 model versions representing the press effect that were tested i e those related to the 11 pulse versions that had met the first two criteria appendix d 2 none met all four criteria however the age specific version as106 with event related mortality affecting only the last sub adult and all adult age classes and decreasing over 2 years met the first two criteria fig 4c this version produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 14 of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 of the 36 model versions representing the density dependent remigration effect that were tested i e those related to the single press and the 11 pulse versions that had met the first two criteria appendix d 3 all four criteria were met by 1 the exponential age specific pulse version e4 fig 4d and 2 the inverse logistic age specific pulse version i4 fig 4e both with event related mortality affecting only the last sub adult and all adult age classes version e4 produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 4 of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 as well as simulated nest counts within 5 of each other in 2011 and 2012 criterion 3 and simulated nest counts that decreased in both 2013 and 2014 criterion 4 version i4 produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 12 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 8 of the nest count at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 as well as simulated nest counts within 6 of each other in 2011 and 2012 criterion 3 and simulated nest counts that decreased in both 2013 and 2014 criterion 4 one other version the linear age specific pulse version l4 with event related mortality affecting only the last sub adult and all adult age classes met the first three criteria fig 4f version l4 produced simulated 2010 nest counts within 13 of the nest count at the index beach in 2010 criterion 1 and within 4 of the nest count reported at the index beach in 2011 criterion 2 and simulated nest counts within 10 of each other in 2011 and 2012 criterion 3 however simulated nest counts continued increasing in 2013 before decreasing in 2014 thus failing criterion 4 3 2 model validation and population projection of the two density dependent remigration versions that met all four criteria the exponential age specific pulse version e4 failed whereas the inverse logistic age specific pulse version i4 succeeded in simulating the 2015 2017 nest counts fig 5 a version e4 was invalidated in the sense that it failed to produce an increase in nest counts in 2015 although simulated nest counts did increase in 2016 and 2017 fig 5b the simulated adult female population resumed an essentially exponential growth trend after 2014 with a noticeable undulation in the curve from 2026 to 2030 reaching 110 000 in 2035 fig 5c the undulation resulted from the density dependency of the remigration interval which precludes establishment of the stable age class distribution for the sake of comparison we also projected population trends using version e4 as well as versions of the model that met two pulse versions u4 and as10 and press version as106 or three density dependent remigration version l4 of the evaluation criteria after variable lengths of time all simulated populations resumed an essentially exponential growth trend fig 5d with the two density dependent remigration versions exhibiting a noticeable undulation in the growth curve fig 5e simulated populations adult females only using versions e4 u4 as10 as106 and l4 reached approximately 110 000 355 000 568 000 568 000 and 113 000 respectively 4 discussion our simulation results suggest that the precipitous decline in kemp s ridley nesting success on the index beach in 2010 might be interpreted as the result of a pulse mortality event resulting from the oil spill in the gulf of mexico the event may or may not have altered population age structure such as to leave a lasting demographic mark but apparently it did not cause an extended delay in population recovery the fluctuations in nest counts at the index beach from 2010 to 2014 likely resulted from density dependent shifts in the remigration interval which may have resulted from the pulse mortality event a density dependent remigration effect in response to the 2010 pulse mortality event provides a more feasible explanation for the post 2010 population fluctuations than does either the pulse or the press hypothesis alone only one version of the press effect with a 2 year duration and decreased mortality the second year produced a sufficient increase in nest counts in 2011 logically extending the event related mortality past the year of the event reduces the likelihood of population recovery the following year of the 11 versions of the pulse effect that produced a sufficient increase in nest counts in 2011 none produced 2012 nest counts sufficiently close to the 2011 counts in each case nest counts resumed essentially exponential growth beginning after 2011 not surprisingly there was little difference in the 2011 nest counts among the 11 pulse versions all of which included event related mortality in the last sub adult and all of the adult age classes that is the event related mortality affected all of the cohorts that potentially could have nested in 2011 whether event related mortality had occurred in cohorts that still would have been pre reproductive in 2011 would not have been detectable based directly on nest counts only the density dependent remigration versions 29 of 36 produced fluctuations in 2010 2014 nest counts qualitatively similar to those observed at the index beach of these only two versions both with non linear density dependent relationships produced fluctuations that mirrored the timing and closely approximated the magnitudes of those at the index beach however one version with a linear density dependent relationship failed only in that its nest counts resumed their final increase a year too soon in 2014 rather than 2015 that a density dependent relationship was required to produce the 2010 2014 nest count fluctuations seems commonsensical both mathematically and ecologically mathematically each simulated population was in the stable age class distribution in 2009 at the time the mortality event was imposed the stable age class distribution is the unchanging proportional distribution of individuals among the age classes that is generated by the constant age specific mortality and recruitment rates of the population a population in the stable age class distribution can only exhibit exponential growth exponential decline or exact equilibrium for λ 1 λ 1 and λ 1 respectively we began all of the simulations in this study with the population in the stable age class in 1985 which facilitated comparison of population dynamics among different simulations both during the 1985 2009 calibration period and during the 2010 2014 evaluation period of course after cessation of the either pulse or press period of altered mortality rates the population necessarily will return to its stable age class distribution and resume its pattern of exponential growth assuming λ 1 the length of time needed to re establish the stable age class distribution as well as the details of the population fluctuations prior to re establishing the stable age class distribution depends on the exact manner in which the age specific mortality rates were altered thus although it certainly is not impossible for a particular set of temporary age specific mortality rate alterations to result in subsequent population fluctuations the overriding tendency is for the population to resume the exponential growth dictated by its set of constant age specific demographic rates we examined 56 sets of age specific pulse mortality rate alterations all of which arguably had at least some ecologically reasonable basis without successfully generating the observed nest count fluctuations the caveat of course is that we do know the real age class distribution of the population just prior to the 2010 mortality event ecologically independent of the 2010 oil spill there is of course a strong theoretical argument for density dependent negative feedback on population growth there are limits to growth in the case of the kemp s ridley in the gulf of mexico there also is an empirically based ecological argument that population size might be approaching a point at which such density dependent negative feedback on population growth could become apparent caillouet et al 2016a gallaway et al 2016b convincingly elaborate the details of this argument which might be summarized as follows the primary tenet of the argument is that mature females now need to spend more time on their foraging grounds in the northern gulf to build up sufficient energy reserves to support remigration to their nesting grounds in mexico than was typical at smaller population sizes this elongates the remigration interval of individuals and reduces the proportion of potential nesters that return to nest in any given year this density dependency of the remigration interval results not only from kemp s ridley population increase per se but also from declining food resources that further reduce per capita food availability even though mollusks vegetation and shrimp are potential food sources for neritic stage kemp s ridley shaver 1991 crabs and fish discards from shrimp trawling are the most important food sources seney and musick 2005 witzell and schmid 2005 and both have decreased markedly in the gulf over the past two decades vanderkooy 2013 it is reasonable to infer that the reduction in per capita availability of prey resources might be sufficient to lengthen the average remigration interval and hence reduce the average annual number of nests one might expect year to year variability in nest counts due to year to year variability in availability of food sources to become more pronounced as the population approaches carrying capacity caillouet et al 2018a marn et al 2017 the resulting variation in year class strengths coupled with the life history trait of delayed reproductive maturity poses a management challenge analogous to that encountered in marine fisheries based on long lived species with delayed onset of reproduction that is the population level impact of a demographic mark in the form of a weak year class would be time lagged and potentially long lasting as the small cohort passes through the reproductive age classes whether or not the 2010 oil spill left a demographic mark on the kemp s ridley population remains an open question caillouet 2014 has suggested that the loss of adults and sub adults between the end of the nesting seasons in 2009 and 2010 may have been a key factor responsible for the 2010 to 2014 decline in nest counts at the index beach gallaway et al 2016a noted that while the general timing of the mortality event corresponded with the occurrence of the oil spill typically most of the reproductively active females would have migrated out of the area of the spill before it occurred 20 april however gallaway et al 2016b added the caveat that cold temperatures might have delayed the 2010 migration 2010 winter spring seawater temperatures in the northern gulf foraging grounds were among the coldest on record elizabeth bevan unpublished data as cited in gallaway et al 2016b our simulation results are consistent with both caillouet s caillouet 2014 demographic mark hypothesis and gallaway et al s 2016a b density dependent remigration hypothesis however given the trend of increasing nest counts at the index beach from 2015 to 2017 the resumption of exponential growth projected by all of our pulse and press simulations as well as the results of our sensitivity analysis identification of the negative feedback mechanisms that ultimately will limit population growth seems a more pressing concern projections of the best version of our model suggested that the adult female population could reach 110 000 by 2035 which is approaching the historical high among our sensitivity analysis simulations the three worst scenarios increasing post hatchling mortality rate by 30 of its baseline value increasing post hatchling mortality rate by 20 of its baseline value and postponing the knife edge age at first reproduction from 12 years to 14 years all resulted in increasing populations λ values of 1 053 1 105 and 1 151 respectively decreasing the remigration rate by 30 of its baseline value also resulted in an increasing population λ value of 1 154 these sensitivity analysis simulations in essence might be interpreted as representing long lasting press effects since the altered parameter was held constant for the duration of each simulation after elaborating on these interpretations of our simulation results we hasten to acknowledge that they prove absolutely nothing arguably this acknowledgement already is implicit in the term simulation results nonetheless lest there is any doubt we offer a frank albeit unavoidably biased statement about the legitimate expectations of our model and ecological modeling in general ecological modeling provides a method to simplify reality to enhance understanding through the synthesis of data knowledge and assumptions in a disciplined way for a specific objective our objective has been to investigate the feasibility of several hypothesized cause effect relationships between population dynamics of the kemp s ridley sea turtle and the 2010 oil spill in the gulf of mexico our method has been to represent the hypothesized pulse press and density dependent remigration effects in different versions of an age structured model and attempt to simulate the observed post 2010 population fluctuations as indicated by nest counts at the index beach and also to project future population trends observational data and existing knowledge rarely are sufficient for establishing causal relationships in complex natural systems models based on this information cannot establish causality nor predict the future but can aid us in assessing the feasibility of hypothesized cause effect relationships as we have done in this study therefore the ability to explore potential population level consequences of age specific responses to environmental events is a primary strength of a model such as ours tanioka and matsumoto 2018 within a management context simulation results can provide insight into the potential responses of an age structured population of long lived animals to both natural disasters and management initiatives fuentes and porter 2013 piacenza et al 2017 in the present case perhaps of most interest among our initial results is the apparent resiliency of the population to large mortality events of short duration however two important caveats to this statement are the assumptions 1 that there will be no reduction of suitable habitat and 2 that per capita availability of food resources will be sufficient to support population recovery both of these assumptions are questionable clough et al 2017 leo et al 2016 ultimately of course suitable habitat and or food availability will limit further population growth there are indications of a reduction in suitable nearshore habitat in the northern gulf of mexico which constitutes one of the most important foraging grounds gil weir et al 2012 shaver et al 2013 due to a greatly expanded hypoxic zone scavia et al 2017 and a decreasing area of wetlands turner 1997 there also are indications that per capita availability of neritic food may already have begun to decline due to the long term trends of degradation of the gulf of mexico ecosystem and increasing population size of kemp s ridleys caillouet et al 2018b declarations of interest none acknowledgements we would like to thank rusty a feagin and charles w caillouet jr as well as three anonymous reviewers and the subject editor for providing comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript the manuscript is greatly improved as a result of their comments appendix a kemp s ridley distribution life history and conservation the kemp s ridley sea turtle lepidochelys kempii is a highly charismatic critically endangered species endemic to the gulf of mexico caillouet et al 2016b their most major decline from 1947 to 1985 was due to a number of causes a small geographic range the smallest of all sea turtle species zug et al 1997 natural and anthropogenic predation heithaus et al 2008 life history characteristics such as high hatchling mortality and a late maturity schedule bjorndal et al 2014 heppell et al 1996 commercial fisheries bycatch lewison et al 2003 and potentially oil spills gallaway et al 2016b while a number of conservation projects have been developed since the 1960s bowen et al 1994 francis 1978 and continue to contribute to species recovery they alone do not account for the recent population trends seen in the historical nesting data particularly the significant decrease in 2010 and subsequent fluctuations as evidenced by gallaway et al 2016a and gallaway et al 2016b in this appendix the kemp s ridley distribution life history and conservation efforts that led to the current study are discussed the rationale and objectives given were formulated based on an extensive scientific literature review the results of which also provided the basis for the creation of an age based population model the model was used to assess the post 2010 kemp s ridley sea turtle population dynamics and to describe potential underlying causes the goal was to develop a model that will enable researchers to fill gaps in the current knowledge of the species to refine future management strategies a 1 distribution the kemp s ridley sea turtle has the most restricted geographic range amongst all sea turtle species zug et al 1997 part of this restriction is due to some unique life history characteristics and or competition that prevent individuals from migrating too far from their natal beach morreale et al 2007 shaver et al 2013 while some adolescents make their way to the atlantic coast or are swept over to europe carreras et al 2014 insacco and spadola 2010 adults primarily forage and almost exclusively breed in the gulf of mexico zug et al 1997 it is reported that 90 of the kemp s ridley population nest along the beaches of rancho nuevo metz and landry 2016 the 60 km area from barra ostionales tepehuajes to playa dos barra del tordo fig 1 is collectively referred to as the index beach from which the majority of population survival and mortality estimates stem caillouet et al 2016b the species has also been recorded to nest along the texas coast shaver et al 2005 and in veracruz mexico carr and caldwell 1958 shaver et al 2017 and a very limited number of nests have been recorded in florida shaver et al 2016 it is known that adult females migrate to foraging grounds when they are not nesting shaver et al 2013 an early study showed the most popular foraging areas for adults and sub adults alike were the coastal waters from port aransas texas to cedar key florida ogren 1989 much later lohmann et al 2013 found that kemp s ridleys also travel south from rancho nuevo to forage around the yucatan peninsula shaver et al 2013 tracked post nesting females from pais and rancho nuevo tamaulipas mexico using satellite telemetry and found more precise foraging hotspots in the northern gulf of mexico particularly within the nearshore zones of louisiana in addition coleman et al 2017 demonstrated that the mississippi sound is crucial habitat for developmental stages of kemp s ridleys renaud et al 1996 used satellite telemetry to track the movements of a female kemp s ridley released in august 1994 off the louisiana coast and followed to rancho nuevo where she successfully nested in april and may of 1995 shaver et al 2016 conducted a similar study on a larger scale and were able to track two individuals who each made a complete remigration to and from their natal beach this study also established the importance of nearshore migratory corridors for female kemp s ridleys in the gulf of mexico which vary temporally and is supported by a subsequent analysis on inter nesting habitat and home ranges of post nesting females shaver et al 2017 a 2 life history basic life stages include pelagic post hatchling juvenile sub adult and adult heppell et al 2005 ogren 1989 pelagic post hatchlings age classes 0 and 1 years are individuals who survive long enough after hatching to enter the ocean individuals remain as pelagic post hatchlings until they reach 20 cm scl heppell et al 2005 they feed on floating sargassum sp seaweed and its associated invertebrates witherington et al 2012 juveniles age classes 2 through 5 years are individuals between 20 and 50 cm scl and feed in the benthic and neritic zones of the ocean floor heppell et al 2005 schmid and witzell 1997 these individuals are far from reaching sexual maturity and suffer from higher per capita mortality than subsequent life stages sub adults age classes 6 through 11 years are individuals between 50 and 60 cm scl that feed on benthic neritic dwelling organisms heppell et al 2005 sub adults have undergone sexual development but are not yet capable of reproduction coyne 2000 adults age classes 12 through 14 years are individuals greater than 60 cm scl feed on near shore benthic dwelling organisms and have reached sexual maturity heppell et al 2005 ogren 1989 estimates of age of sexual maturity range from 10 to 17 years snover and hohn 2004 a knife edge estimate of 12 years has been supported by skeletochronological data snover and hohn 2004 the kemp s ridley population suffers from high mortality rates during most of its life stages zug et al 1997 pelagic post hatchlings incur the highest per capita mortality rates while sub adults and adults incur the least kemp s ridley adult females lay an average of 2 5 clutches of approximately 97 eggs during the daytime hours of each participatory nesting season frey et al 2014 the nesting season typically ranges from april to june of the same calendar year at the index beach but some females nest as early as march rostal et al 1998 those participating typically congregate in near shore waters before coming to shore in massive arribadas or huge simultaneous nesting aggregations pritchard 1969 this synchronization of reproduction makes the lepidochelys genus unique and is only observed at a handful of beaches worldwide hirth 1980 kemp s ridley arribadas are particularly unique since they are always observed as diurnal pritchard 2007 though this may promote easier access of predators to nests or nesting females females dig a hole in the sand with their rear flippers lay eggs in the hole and cover them up before returning to the ocean after the eggs incubate for 50 55 days the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the ocean rostal et al 1998 many hatchlings do not survive this journey to the water due to natural predators such as coyotes ghost crabs and shore birds rostal et al 1998 those individuals that reach the water called pelagic post hatchlings may also face aquatic predators such as sharks or large predatory fish rostal et al 1998 the typical pelagic post hatchling individual that makes it to open water seeks out invertebrates living in or around floating sargassum sp to sustain the first few years of their life witherington et al 2012 it was long thought that post hatchlings were pelagic drifters meaning they did not actively swim nor choose their own course at sea they simply were pushed and pulled by the ocean s currents as the method of dispersal from the nesting beach witherington et al 2012 however recent investigations found evidence contrary to this notion putman and mansfield 2015 once the hatchlings reach the juvenile classification they begin consuming benthic dwelling invertebrates in coastal regions of the gulf of mexico and continue to do so for another three to four years of their life schmid and witzell 1997 this may include blue crab callinectes sapidus and benthic tunicates witzell and schmid 2005 as sub adults and adults blue crabs become their primary prey item followed by mollusks and fish seney and musick 2005 the fish component of the diet may be discards from shrimp trawl bycatch gallaway et al 2016a the kemp s ridley prey availability most likely plays a huge role in reproductive capacity and or remigration gallaway et al 2016b it is thought that without enough foraging time or organisms to forage on a female will not make the journey back to the nesting beach that year therefore foregoing reproduction altogether until the following nesting season hays 2000 however more explicit testing is needed to support this claim this delay of reproduction gave rise to the density dependent nature of the remigration rate hypothesis discussed later in this chapter gallaway et al 2016b still the energetics relating female body size and or weight to amount of food intake have yet to be determined a 3 conservation in 1966 mexico s instituto nacional de investigaciones biologico pesqueras began surveys in rancho nuevo to protect the kemp s ridley from egg exploitation heppell et al 2007 it was the first conservation effort reported for this species however the population continued to decline it was not until 1977 that bi national conservation efforts came to fruition heppell et al 2007 an informal kemp s ridley working group formed to create a recovery plan and in 1978 the first fenced corrals were placed in rancho nuevo heppell et al 2007 shortly following the implementation of this strategy it became clear a policy change was needed for fishing and shrimping operations conducted offshore during the nesting season heppell et al 2007 this led researchers to develop turtle excluder devices teds and policies were written to enforce this strategy crowder et al 1994 lewison et al 2003 lastly the experimental practice of imprinting and headstarting hatchlings was set in motion at the padre island national seashore pais in 1978 to promote the establishment potential for a second nesting population shaver and wibbels 2007 in 1992 a down listing criterion was set at 10 000 nesting females for the kemp s ridley heppell et al 2005 more recently new criteria have been established which require the annual release of 300 000 hatchlings and 25 000 nests laid annually at the index beach caillouet et al 2016a the 25 000 nest requirement can be converted to a 10 000 nesting female requirement by dividing the number of nests by the number of clutches laid per nesting season per female 2 5 caillouet et al 2016a caillouet et al 2016 demonstrated that conservation efforts have produced the required number of hatchlings but the population has not yet reached the requirement for number of nesting females some speculate the lasting effects that oil spills have had on coastal ecosystems can account for struggling populations crowder and heppell 2011 while others believe there could be more to the picture in this section the successes of various conservation programs and hardships the kemp s ridley has experienced throughout the past 40 years are discussed a 3 1 nesting beaches the index beach which extends from barra ostionales tepehuajes to playa dos barra del tordo in tamaulipas mexico fig 1 is where the vast majority of the kemp s ridley population nests caillouet et al 2016a as early as 1947 the herrera film documented a massive single day arribada for the first time on film from which dr henry h hildebrand estimated around 40 000 nesting females were present shaver and wibbels 2007 however bevan et al 2016 evaluated the accuracy of this estimation and found it was overestimated the group estimated closer to a mean of 26 916 nesting females came to nest at the index beach during that single day this translates to a total nesting female population of about 48 607 and a total nesting season nest count of 121 517 for 1947 compared to the 1985 nest count of 702 bevan et al 2016 the kemp s ridley population underwent a severe decline in those 38 years nearly to the point of extinction a 3 2 head start program in 1978 the united states of america and mexico teamed up to form the kemp s ridley sea turtle head start experiment in a last ditch effort to save the species from extinction shaver and wibbels 2007 one of the general ideas to support this species was to provide a second nesting beach to establish a second nesting colony at the pais shaver and wibbels 2007 the idea had been attempted before in texas but at a much smaller scale woody 1989 coupled with the head start program s objective to raise hatchlings in captivity the efforts aimed to alleviate the high post hatchling mortality rate during the first year of life and to enhance species survival in the event a disaster struck the primary nesting beach in mexico shaver and wibbels 2007 experimental by its very nature there were and perhaps still are many criticisms of the program the biggest criticisms stem from the idea of jeopardizing an already critically endangered species by using it to test a new protocol not to mention doubts concerning whether or not captive reared turtles would survive well in the wild shaver and wibbels 2007 it is also very costly to foster hatchlings for months at a time woody 1989 the original plan included anywhere from 9 to 11 months of raising hatchlings in captivity but it was intended to increase the likelihood of survival of the post hatchling life stage to the juvenile stage which experiences significantly less mortality due to larger body size shaver and wibbels 2007 these notions however may simply have been provided to delay experimental action from being taken when faced with dire circumstances management officials more often must act on behalf of saving a species from extinction before a scientific consensus is achieved supporters of the head start program contended that the kemp s ridley had already declined to the point whereby natural recovery was no longer possible otherwise known as the allee effect bell et al 2010 early kemp s ridley advocates such as dr archie carr were some of the first to suggest that young sea turtles can imprint on their natal beach and subsequently return there to nest when they reach sexual maturity carr 1987 though at the time there was limited evidence to support this claim other advocates supported the program to acquire this knowledge bell et al 2010 after developing an age structured matrix model for the kemp s ridley population heppell et al 1996 discussed the impact of the program on the overall population the authors comment on how these types of recovery programs cannot be evaluated until data exist on the survival and growth rates of both wild and headstarted shaver and wibbels 2007 similarly heppell and crowder 1998 contended that the head start program successes were minimal compared to teds even today forty years later the program is still being evaluated albeit owing some of its delay to the late sexual maturation that characterizes kemp s ridleys at the very least caillouet et al 2015 states clearly that the program provided a way to tag and subsequently identify nearly all individuals the program released especially with respect to identifying which individuals are returning to their natal beaches a 3 3 at sea mortality pelagic post hatchlings withstand the highest mortality rates of all age classes in the population witherington et al 2012 this is likely due to their small size however the estimation of this parameter is not backed by much direct evidence since it is nearly impossible to monitor these individuals once they reach the open ocean witherington et al 2012 after reaching the juvenile stage most kemp s ridleys stay close to the coast or continental shelf in the gulf of mexico unfortunately this means the turtles suffer additional mortality from high incidental capture in commercial fishing especially shrimping operations frazier et al 2007 as concern for this added mortality mounted national research council conducted a study that concluded sea turtle bycatch in shrimp trawls killed more individuals than all other human activities combined their statement supported the development and eventual mandatory use of turtle excluder devices ted in all commercial fishery operations from the united states frazier et al 2007 a ted consists of a barred metal ring that fits inside a commercial fishing or trawling net crowder et al 1994 the bars are spaced precisely such that organisms larger than the target species are not able to continue through into the net crowder et al 1994 over the years this device has been perfected to nearly a 99 success rate for a sea turtle to escape brewer et al 2006 not only do teds help prevent sea turtle bycatch mortality but other species are also excluded from the landed catch these include but are not limited to sharks stingrays and non target fishes brewer et al 2006 teds made their first appearance in 1983 as voluntarily installations in commercial shrimp trawling nets margavio et al 1993 five years later enough scientific evidence on teds had been gathered to require seasonal use of teds on all shrimping vessels operating in offshore waters and by the end of 1994 nmfs extended the mandate to include ted use on operating vessels at all times and in all waters nearshore and offshore yaninek 1995 more recently in december 2016 noaa proposed that all skimmer trawls pusher head trawls and wing net vessels should be required to have teds in their nets designed to enable smaller sea turtles to escape although public comments were accepted as late as february 2017 the results of this proposition are still forthcoming a 3 4 deepwater horizon oil spill the deepwater horizon oil spill was arguably the largest marine oil spill in the history of the united states and quite possibly the largest within the entire petroleum industry gallaway et al 2016b despite several capping attempts oil and natural gas continuously and uncontrollably spewed into the gulf of mexico for 87 consecutive days beginning april 20 2010 releasing an unprecedented 134 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico reddy et al 2012 the cumulative extent of the oil can be seen in fig 2 which covers part of the kemp s ridley s foraging grounds of the estimated 200 million gallons of oil that flowed from the wellhead roughly 3 5 6 10 million gallons has settled to the seafloor while approximately 11 25 22 50 million gallons is still unaccounted for reddy et al 2012 this has created extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats recreational and commercial fishing and tourism industries but long term effects are still being monitored white et al 2012 the event was documented to have interacted directly and indirectly with sea turtles including the kemp s ridley gallaway et al 2016b appendix b rationale for current study and cause effect hypotheses tested b 1 rationale for current study prior to 2010 the recovery of the kemp s ridley population looked promising since the lowest point in 1985 the nest count at the index beach depicted an exponential annual population growth rate increase of 19 per year largely due to the aforementioned conservation efforts heppell et al 2007 however between 2009 and 2010 nesting seasons a mortality event occurred followed by subsequent population fluctuations the deepwater horizon oil spill which occurred during this time frame have been directly responsible for the unprecedented increase in sea turtle strandings as well as the 35 reduction in nesting success along the index beach in 2010 gallaway et al 2016b reich et al 2017 this reduction in nesting success is significantly larger than previous reductions observed historically in 2001 and 2004 15 and 17 respectively see fig 3 annual nest counts at the primary nesting beach in tamaulipas mexico are considered the best index of the kemp s ridley sea turtle population dynamics fig 3 dotted lines in fig 3 indicates the partitioning of these nest count data for use in the present study a data from 1986 to 2009 were used for model calibration b data from 2010 to 2014 were used for hypothesis testing and c data from 2015 to 2017 were used for model validation these data were not available during model development and still are considered preliminary at the present time several cause effect relationships between the 2010 mortality event and the subsequent population fluctuations have been hypothesized these include but are not limited to 1 a single year pulse effect increasing kemp s ridley mortality caillouet et al 2011 crowder and heppell 2011 gallaway et al 2016b 2 a multiple year press effect increasing kemp s ridley mortality caillouet et al 2011 crowder and heppell 2011 gallaway et al 2016b 3 a density dependent negative feedback decreasing kemp s ridley hatchling recruitment due to a lengthened remigration interval caillouet et al 2011 gallaway et al 2016a b a diagram of how these hypotheses were tested can be seen in fig 4 b 2 rationale for cause effect hypotheses the rationale behind the first two hypotheses is that in 2010 and 2011 an unprecedented number of kemp s ridleys were found stranded and or dead in the gulf of mexico gallaway et al 2016a additionally caillouet 2011 noted that nest counts made at the index beach were coincidentally no longer increasing exponentially but rather had decreased in 2010 about 35 gallaway et al 2016b from this evidence it was hypothesized that a single significant mortality event occurred in 2010 which caused subsequent population fluctuations hypothesis 1 gallaway et al 2016a b it also was hypothesized that this large mortality event in 2010 was followed by increased mortality over an extended period of time which caused subsequent population fluctuations hypothesis 2 gallaway et al 2016a b implicit in both of these hypotheses is that the mortality might be age specific caillouet 2011 suggested that such age specific mortality would have altered the population age structure and could have had a long lasting effect on population dynamics the rationale behind the third hypothesis is that a decrease in food in the foraging grounds of the northern gulf of mexico over the past two decades has led to increasing density dependent competition for food which has increased the length of time necessary for adult females to regain a sufficient body condition to migrate back to the nesting beach gallaway et al 2016b thus the remigration interval has lengthened yielding an overall reduction of the annual number of adult females actually nesting in a given nesting season and decreasing recruitment of individuals into the population thereby slowing population growth feeding conditions vary from year to year and have been shown to affect the remigration rate of sea turtles gallaway et al 2016b hays 2000 hence the number of turtles nesting in different years also changes crabs constitute the bulk of the diet of adult kemp s ridleys and the western blue crab stock which occupies the main kemp s ridley feeding grounds in the northern gulf of mexico has been depressed since the mid 1990 s vanderkooy 2013 fish discarded as by catch from shrimp trawlers historically have been an important food item cannon 1998 but shrimping effort in the main kemp s ridley feeding grounds the inshore zone and the 0 to 10 fathom nearshore zone declined sharply between 2000 and 2005 and has remained low gallaway et al 2016b thus food availability may have been approaching a critical level prior to 2010 therefore it seems feasible that reduced per capita availability of blue crabs and shrimp trawl by catch in the northern gulf of mexico might result in density dependent increases in the remigration interval of adult female kemp s ridleys and concomitant decreases in the annual number of females nesting in mexico appendix c sensitivity analysis c 1 experimental design for population parameters below is the experimental design for sensitivity analysis of parameter values of

25149,scientists and decision makers need tools that can assess which specific pressures lead to ecosystem deterioration and which measures could reduce these pressures and or limit their effects in this context species distribution models are tools that can be used to help asses these pressures evolutionary algorithms represent a collection of promising techniques inspired by concepts observed in natural evolution to support the development of species distribution models they are suited to solve non trivial tasks such as the calibration of parameter rich models the reduction of model complexity by feature selection and or the optimization of hyperparameters of other machine learning algorithms although widely used in other scientific domains the full potential of evolutionary algorithms has yet to be explored for applied ecological research in this synthesis we study the role of evolutionary algorithms as a machine learning technique to develop the next generation of species distribution models to do so we review available methods for species distribution modelling and synthesize literature using evolutionary algorithms in addition we discuss specific advantages and weaknesses of evolutionary algorithms and present a guideline for their application we find that evolutionary algorithms are increasingly used to solve specific and challenging problems their flexibility adaptability and transferability in addition to their capacity to find adequate solutions to complex non linear problems are considered as main strengths especially for species distribution models with a large degree of complexity the need for programming and modelling skills can be considered as a drawback for novice modellers in addition setting values for hyperparameters is a challenge future ecological research should focus on exploring the potential of evolutionary algorithms that combine multiple tasks in one learning cycle in addition studies should focus on the use of novel machine learning schemes e g automated hyperparameter optimization to apply evolutionary algorithms preferably in the context of open science this way ecologists and model developers can achieve an adaptable and flexible framework for developing tools useful for decision management keywords evolutionary algorithms machine learning species distribution modelling model development automated model selection 1 introduction innovations in remote sensing and micro control units used for near real time monitoring of ecosystems are challenging ecologists to deal with a great number of data coming from different sources hampton et al 2013 machine learning plays an increasingly important role to deal with this challenge not only in the field of ecology meyers et al 2017 however ecologists often struggle with the interpretation of models developed with novel machine learning algorithms araújo and guisan 2006 as a consequence scientists are required to search for new approaches to increase reliability transparency and flexibility of the models they are developing elith and leathwick 2009 the models developed for ecological research and management with machine learning are mainly classified under species distribution models sdms these models aim to define the species environment relation and from this estimate the species geographical distribution sdms rely on the concept of an ecological niche described by hutchinson 1957 this theory conceptualizes the relation between a species environment and its occurrence hirzel and le lay 2008 niche theory hutchinson 1957 states that a species can only exist if the local combination of environmental gradients the niche allows a positive population growth rate in the absence of immigration in addition the theory states that a difference in species traits allows them to occupy a different niche and coexist in a given spatial unit to inspect these species traits machine learning algorithms are used to classify a species as present or absent given the environmental conditions often a probabilistic framework is used to express the chance for a species to occur the environmental conditions are quantified in a number of environmental features for instance temperature precipitation soil moisture he et al 2015 the number of input features after preprocessing reach up to 20 while studies using over 30 features are found in literature bennetsen et al 2016 machine learning is used to train a model estimating a response variable species occurrence based on these environmental predictors species distribution model development with machine learning embeds little ecological hypotheses in the training process as the machine learning algorithms primarily aim to uncover patterns in data saeys et al 2007 mount et al 2016 at first instance this development could be considered as black box modelling which is the case in a number of techniques e g artificial neural networks yet there are techniques such as decision trees that present interpretable models in these models the user can interpret why estimations were done in that way for example in decision trees a set of hierarchical rules can be analysed that lead to an estimated species presence in specific applications for instance in freshwater management embedding hypotheses and assumptions is of major importance to preserve ecological interpretability of the developed models adriaenssens et al 2004 also incorporating species dispersal and interactions in the next generation of species distribution models sdms requires a hypothesis driven approach evolutionary algorithms eas a collective of machine learning techniques inspired on the concept of evolution allow embedding these hypotheses by separating model performance evaluation from solution searching rauch and harremoës 1999 in these eas models with parameters and input variables are encoded in so called chromosomes specific algorithm functions called genetic operators are applied to these chromosomes to search for well performing models because eas algorithms offer this transparency and flexibility we evaluate in this synthesis the role of eas as a machine learning method for species distribution modelling we aim to answer the following questions what is the current role of eas in species distribution modelling section 2 how do eas work and what are their specific strengths section 3 what opportunities do these eas have in the field of species distribution modelling section 4 what guidelines can be given to applying an ea or another metaheuristic as a machine learning method to identify transparent and accurate models section 5 it is important to note that this paper focuses on eas having in mind that other metaheuristics such as particle swarm optimization ant colony optimization and simulated annealing also exist for an overview of these other methods we refer to supportive information 1 differences between eas and other metaheuristics are discussed throughout this manuscript for an extensive description of eas and other metaheuristics we refer readers to gendreau and potvin 2010 and kacprzyk and pedrycz 2015 2 machine learning in species distribution modelling many ecological researchers rely on machine learning for the development of sdms the use of machine learning has introduced new concepts important for ecologists to understand in contrast to previous reviews discussing the development of sdms e g guisan and thuiller 2005 araújo and guisan 2006 austin 2007 this review focusses on sdm learning and its technical challenges rather than development through ecological reasoning that is why we focus on the discussion of eas in the context of machine learning machine learning can be defined as the field of research using computer programs or algorithms that have the ability to adapt or change from an experience data given a n performance or objective measure algorithms to facilitate machine learning are widely applied in many scientific fields such as artificial intelligence telecommunication and engineering of electronics web of science accessed on 13 09 2018 machine learning algorithms can be used to train models with data so these models can make as good as possible predictions on new unseen data machine learning algorithms can be categorized based on whether output labels are not used for training i e un supervised learning box 1 to guide the readers box 1 shows a number of definitions used in the field of machine learning also used in this review paper in species distribution modelling supervised learning is typically applied to classify species occurrence in geographical and possibly the temporal dimensions to train sdms binary labelled data species presence or absence together with environmental input data are used by the machine learning algorithm in table 1 an overview of methods used in species distribution modelling are shown together with a short explanation the cumulative number of papers mentioning the method web of science accessed 08 11 2017 and key references in addition in fig 1 the first report of the method in scientific literature is shown the remainder of this section aims to shortly introduce these methods to guide readers to the most used ones acronyms of these methods can also be found in table 1 generalized linear and adaptive models respectively glms and gams and decision trees are the first machine learning techniques used in species distribution modelling fig 1 glms and gams are a collection of semi parametric techniques based on three elements a random component that assumes a probability distribution of a response variable 1 a systematic component specifying linear combination of the explanatory variables with their respective slopes 2 and a link function describing the relation between the random and systematic component 3 nelder and wedderburn 1972 decision trees are classifiers expressed as recursive partitions or trees of the feature space rokach and maimon 2015 these are tree like representations of a rule induction i e a set of if then rules that are followed leading to a probability of species presence or absence different algorithms are available to develop decision trees such as cart breiman et al 1984 and c4 5 quinlan ross 1993 using a gini index and entropy measure respectively a robust approach based on decision trees is a random forest rf breiman 2001 rf uses bootstrap aggregation to generate on a number of decision or regression trees in bootstrap aggregation several bootstrap samples from a training data set objects in the instance space are taken to develop a number of models rf is used often in species distribution modelling and has shown to be an interesting technique to model complex systems including species interactions vezza et al 2015 the genetic algorithm for rule set production garp is an ea inspired method used to produce a rule bank sdm stockwell and noble 1992 a rule bank sdm is a model based on a set of hierarchical rules estimating species presence or absence in this sense the model structures obtained with garp are similar to those obtained with decision trees garp is the first sdm software package using eas knowing a number of successful applications for instance to estimate the effect of global change on species distributions peterson et al 2002 another technique often used in combination with eas are artificial neural networks ding et al 2013 artificial neural networks which are non linear mapping structures inspired by the biological system of the brain have been successfully used for freshwater applications goethals et al 2007 muñoz mas et al 2017 from these two examples it is clear that eas are often used to support the development of the model structure i e search for the most optimal model structure despite their success the popularity of artificial neural networks and also garp is recently declining compared to that of maximum entropy modelling maxent table 1 introduced in 2006 maxent uses the principle of maximum entropy to make predictions from incomplete knowledge phillips et al 2006 the maximum entropy method maxent approach uses the principle of maximum entropy to make predictions from incomplete knowledge the principle of maximum entropy states that the best approximation to an unknown distribution given a number of constraints is the distribution which only satisfies these constraints and no others in other words maxent aims to model everything that is known constraints but assumes nothing about what is unknown maxent is currently the most used package to train sdms 200 papers in 2016 based on abstract search web of science 08 11 2017 its theoretical basis the default use of regularisation i e penalize model complexity flexibility and performance are the main factors explaining maxent s popularity elith et al 2011 model complexity can also be penalized in many other algorithms however maxent was the first approach to include it by default this default inclusion stressed the importance of regularization among users peterson et al 2007 compared the transferability test on unseen data of maxent and garp and showed that both have their specific advantages this is not surprising as the no free lunch theorem wolpert and macready 1997 depicts that no algorithm will work well on all problems a good approach to deal with the no free lunch theorem is to combine and or compare several approaches in one modelling effort thuiller 2003 developed a platform for implementing different techniques his initial aim was to present a framework able to simultaneously fit different models to data it was only six years later that thuiller et al 2009 presented a new version of biomod including the concepts of uncertainty estimation and ensemble forecasting araújo and new 2007 a weakness of the biomod is that the platform is bound by specific implementations of techniques golding et al 2017 deals with this issue by implementing a modular framework for species distribution modelling he argues that algorithm success is partly depicted by method transparency empowered by clear encoding and guidelines of use i e which method and specific settings are suitable to solve the problem at hand it is important to note that besides algorithm guidelines also appropriate data cleansing techniques can considerably improve results an excellent guide for data cleansing of ecological data is given by zuur et al 2010 other techniques are available but are not categorized under machine learning as their origins are rooted in niche theory of hutchinson 1957 these methods specifically growest nix et al 1977 climex sutherst and maywald 1985 and bioclim booth 1985 nix 1986 were used in the early days of mapping a species niche fig 1 they are currently less used because of their simplicity lack of accuracy and inability to account for variable interaction booth et al 2014 table 1 another less used approach is the development of models with fuzzy logic fuzzy logic models allow integrating expert knowledge in their model structure specifically fuzzy models allow reflecting uncertainty present in linguistic information adriaenssens et al 2004 although fuzzy logic model development might not be classified under machine learning it is often used in conjunction with a machine learning algorithm chen et al 2003 the methods discussed above generally only consider the species environment relationship to estimate species occurrence the spatial structure of the relations is implicitly included in the scale spatially explicit models which incorporate the spatial space in their structure allow describing processes such as migration and dispersal in a spatial context deangelis and yurek 2017 dunning et al 1995 up until today these explicit methods are less popular mainly because of their complexity and need for detailed information to parametrize them deangelis and yurek 2017 given these disadvantages spatially explicit models do hold a lot of potential to help uncover species behaviour and distribution as a function of environmental pressures although the role of garp is recently declining a number of specific applications of eas are observed in the literature since 2000 see table 2 these novel techniques are mainly applied in the context of freshwater management and used to estimate a link between river modification and freshwater species occurrence they facilitate feature selection feature selection for definition see box 1 for artificial neural network and decision tree models d heygere et al 2006 or to estimate model parameters of fuzzy logic sdms fukuda et al 2011 the results of our literature review for methodology see supportive information 2 show that these algorithms are often tailor made and characterized by a specific algorithm formulation in the next section we discuss this ea literature with the aim to identify which specific applications and workflows are mainly adopted before we do so we introduce the basic principles of evolutionary algorithms 3 evolutionary algorithms 3 1 introduction to evolutionary algorithms eas aim to solve complex problems by incorporating elements of structured randomness in their search behaviour motivated by principles in evolution such as selection mutation and crossover maier et al 2014 eas distinguish from single point based methods by iterating a population of candidate solutions to an optimum these solutions are quantified in a fitness mimicking the evolutionary concept eas have been successfully applied to solve specific problems in water resources management maier et al 2014 astrophysics bio informatics pal et al 2006 sirbu et al 2010 and software engineering eiben and smith 2015 even more the use of eas in artificial intelligence is pushing advances in evolving digital objects software towards physical embodied artificial evolution i e hardware robots 3d printers numerous examples exist and the number of applications is expected to increase in the coming years eiben and smith 2015 eas have mainly been used as a machine learning method also to train other methods such as artificial neural networks and decision trees their success can be explained by a number of reasons eiben and smith 2015 maier et al 2014 1 eas are assumption free which make them generally applicable and easily transferable to other problems 2 they are flexible and can easily be used in combination with other methods for instance other search methods or fuzzy logic 3 they are capable to solve complex problems without the need for model simplification often required by traditional optimization methods moreover they are able to uncover less obvious or even unexpected patterns 4 the found solutions with eas allow for an in depth analysis since a number of near optimal solutions are generated eas iterate a population of chromosomes over a number of generations with genetic operators i e selection crossover and mutation box 2 and fig 2 panel a this process is inspired by the concept of evolution where genetic information and characteristics in a population are passed on generation by generation the chromosome is the algorithms building block storing the formulation and performance of a candidate solution to a problem i e the genome and fitness the fitness can be defined as a quantification measure of how good a solution to a problem is the formulation of the candidate solution is stored in a specific data type also called genome for genetic algorithms gas binary or real valued strings are coded as data type whereas tree like structures are used for genetic programming gp fig 2 panel b both gas and gp are classified under evolutionary algorithms other types of eas such as evolutionary programming and evolution strategies exist weise 2009 gas differ from other evolutionary algorithms in the way they are designed as problem independent solvers whereas other eas are designed and implemented to solve specific problems we consider gp to be developed for specific problems the conceptual difference between gas and evolutionary programming is that the basic object is considered to be a species rather than a chromosome in evolutionary programming recombination crossover is often not considered evolutionary strategies show resemblance to real valued gas but with a focus on the selection and mutation operator these problem specific techniques are used in species distribution modelling but not often in the next section we explore the use of this problem in dependent eas the initialisation of a population with a number of chromosomes population size ps and their genomes is the first step for binary string gas this consists of creating a random string of bits example lower left panel fig 2 with every bit either having the value zero or one for real valued strings a uniform value within a defined interval is chosen for every bit after initialisation the fitness is evaluated by mapping the genome to a model with a mapper function as an example for feature selection in sdms a 011 string is translated to the exclusion of the first feature and inclusion of the last two in the model d heygere et al 2006 for parameter estimation a binary string is translated to an integer or decimal respectively 011 0 1 1 2 1 4 6 or 1 6 for the value of the model parameters van broekhoven et al 2007 the models are then evaluated with a user defined objective function and training data leading to a fitness value usually a measure of agreement between the model output and training data is calculated after fitness evaluation selection crossover and mutation operators are applied to the population the selection operator selects a number of chromosomes from the population as parents to generate offspring based on their fitness value and a selection procedure e g tournament selection roulette wheel selection in tournament selection tournaments are organised in which two candidate parents are randomly selected and the candidate with the highest fitness is selected as a parent for roulette wheel selection parents are selected with a chance proportional to their relative fitness the crossover operator generates offspring by inheriting a part of the parents genomes for instance in a ga one point crossover operator a position in the genome is randomly chosen as a breakpoint the parents substrings are then combined to form a new string for the offspring fig 2 lower panel a crossover rate determines the probability that crossover between parents occurs the mutation operator changes the values in random positions in the genomes or alleles of the offspring with a rate equal to the mutation rate after the application of the three operators the fitness of the new chromosomes is evaluated next a new generation is produced by applying the before introduced operators this procedure is repeated until a certain stopping criterion is met typically this criterion is a maximum number of generations or a fitness convergence criterion besides the context of use of gas and gp the way of problem encoding and consequently the implementation of the crossover and mutation operator is different mcdermott et al 2015 rowe 2015 for gas an example of a crossover of two binary strings with a one point uniform operator is shown in fig 2 lower left panel here a random number between two one and the length length minus one of the two parents genome is chosen and before after this position a breakpoint is appointed the genome for the first offspring is formed by merging the part before and after the breakpoint of parent one and two respectively similarly for the second offspring the parts before and after the breakpoint are used but now the genomes of parent two and one are used for gp fig 2 lower right panel breakpoints are chosen between nodes of the tree and these are switched between the parents genomes for mutation in a binary string a random position is chosen and the value for the allele at that position is flipped to the other value 0 1 or 1 0 in case of real valued strings a new random value bounded by a predefined interval is chosen at a random position for tree like structures a random terminal or non terminal node is chosen and replaced with a terminal node or random initiated subtree see fig 2 lower right panel mcdermott et al 2015 3 2 application to species distribution modelling in order to obtain an insight into the use of eas in species distribution modelling literature abstracts were scanned in the web of science catalogue the followed methodology to conduct this literature review can be found in supportive information 2 here implementations that differ from garp are discussed as these implementations vary as a function of the context of the problem the results of this literature review are shown in table 2 in this table we make a clear distinction between parameter estimation and hyperparameter optimization parameter estimation refers to the estimation of a unique set of model parameter values box 1 with respect to species distribution and ecological modelling this implies that model parameters that describe the limits of a species environmental range are estimated e g what are the threshold river temperatures in which a fish can survive or what are temperature tipping points at which species reproduction declines as such parameters are an element of the sdm hyperparameter optimization refers to the search for values of algorithm settings which influence an algorithm s performance in other words a hyperparameter can be considered as an algorithms free option available for the user the number of neurons and hidden layers are examples of two hyperparameters that need to be set in order to develop an artificial neural network or for a rf on has to set the maximum depth of a tree and the number of trees as such values for hyperparameters can be considered as choice elements of the algorithm and can thus not be directly estimated with data in the context of table 2 hyperparameter optimization in the column subject of training refers to the action of using an ea to perform hyperparameter optimization of another machine learning approach it is important to differentiate between the column subject of training from the columns hyperparameters and hyperparameter optimization as the latter two refer to the setting of hyperparameters of the ea itself table 2 shows the general characteristics of studies in which eas are applied generally they are applied in freshwater management to estimate model parameters perform feature selection or hyperparameter optimization of other machine learning techniques for 14 of the 27 an ea is used for only feature selection whereas in seven studies for only parameter estimation in five studies an ea is used for parameter estimation and feature selection and in the remaining study an ea is used for feature selection and optimization of hyperparameters of a decision tree in case of feature selection the eas are used as wrapper methods for other methods artificial neural networks e g d heygere et al 2006 and decision trees e g boets et al 2013 in this approach the genomes are translated to features for another machine learning technique fitting the response patterns to environmental conditions in the case of parameter estimation the eas are used to estimate the model parameter values of fuzzy logic models e g fukuda 2009 van broekhoven et al 2007 in other words the model parameters describing suitability range of environmental conditions for a species are estimated a noteworthy observation is that 22 papers presented in table 2 situate within the domain of freshwater science the data used in these case studies are often characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and noise and observation bias i e more less presence instances are available than absence see column prev in table 2 the latter causing a bias in model training mouton et al 2010 is the reason why a number of classification measures are typically used in these studies often used measures are listed in table 3 together with their acronyms in these measures species occurrence estimated by the classifier is tested to observations according to the study objectives and available data a set of measures is selected and analysed each weighting a degree of correct estimation of species presence on the one hand and absence on the other mouton et al 2010 non binary measures such as the root mean of squared error correlation and sum of squared errors are used for regression in these cases the probability of occurrence is not estimated but species numbers d angelo et al 1995 or density fukuda 2009 in addition the root mean square error and linear correlation is used in one case the mean squared error between the non classified preference between 0 and 1 and observed presence absence is computed fukuda et al 2012 in another case models are penalized for their complexity muñoz mas et al 2016a the trade off between omission and commission errors are never explicitly considered in model training although they are considered implicitly by weighting objectives assumed prevalence independent measures like cohen s kappa or the true skill statistic are used to cope with this trade off however there is no agreement whether these are truly prevalence independent mouton et al 2011 in three of the studies reported in table 2 the training data are stratified by sampling an equal number of presence and absence instances in order to deal with this prevalence dependency mouton et al 2009 a number of different implementations of eas have been used in species distribution modelling simple genetic algorithms are generally used and are considered problem independent these algorithms apply a ga with uniform crossover and mutation operators in conjunction with a tournament selection operator e g boets et al 2013 derivative methods have been used in combination with gas allowing to improve the local search performance of the gas muñoz mas et al 2016 muñoz mas et al 2017 in addition gps are used but only limited jeong et al 2011 mckay 2001 whigham 2000 another interesting application is the use of bayesian theory in gas mcclean et al 2005 termansen et al 2006 feature selection is always implemented in binary strings whereas binary and continuous strings are used for parameter estimation crossover rates vary from 0 6 to 0 95 whereas mutation rate are generally lower between 0 1 and 0 3 with the exception of 0 6 muñoz mas et al 2017 and 0 75 muñoz mas et al 2016 a number of 20 200 chromosomes are reported to iterate over generally 20 100 generations however a larger number of generations 1000 are observed in four studies selection rates are never reported as these are typically equal to 50 model robustness is tested by applying cross validation and repeated learning with the same or different samples of the data cross validation is generally used 14 of 27 cases to test robustness in this approach the data are partitioned in a number of samples i e folds next the model is identified with n 1 folds and validated with the remaining fold in a number of publications the ea analysis is repeated a number of times with the same data starting from different initial populations in order to test the robustness of the ea see d angelo et al 1995 fukuda 2009 this is because the obtained near optimal solution might not be equal in every ea run since the search behaviour is characteristic by random choices an interesting application of this repeated ea analysis is the multilayer perceptron ensembles a type of artificial neural network for the modelling of the redfin barbel muñoz mas et al 2017 here a derivative ga analysis is repeated a number of times to increase ensemble size by checking convergence of the solutions determined with the ga for an increased ensemble size one can determine an optimal set of solutions with this the authors showed the potential of using multilayer perceptron ensembles and eas for the identification of multiple models reflecting simulation uncertainty i e ensemble forecasting araújo and new 2007 an interesting observation is that ea hyperparameters are reported more consistently in recent years in addition testing the training robustness as a practice has increased the latter is probably due to the availability of growing computational resources in addition species prevalence is increasingly reported suggesting that practioners are more aware of the effect of prevalence bias on model training as such it is observed that more detailed and robust approaches are presented finally most studies rely on an extension of simple genetic algorithms whereas genetic programming has not been employed in recent years 4 strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis to explore the potential of eas in species distribution modelling we performed a strength weaknesses opportunities and threats swot analysis in this review strengths and weaknesses refer to current characteristic of eas that offer respectively advantages or disadvantages compared to other techniques opportunities and threats refer to future dis advantages to perform this analysis the literature of eas in species distribution modelling was scanned and the specific strengths and weaknesses of the use of eas were compiled in addition opportunities and threats were assessed by testing compliance with known challenges in species distribution modelling based on araújo and guisan 2006 austin 2007 araújo and new 2007 guisan and zimmermann 2000 guisan and rahbek 2011 in the past specific advantages of eas and metaheuristics were mainly derived from experiments as the true functioning of the algorithms was poorly understood boussaïd et al 2013 maier et al 2014 that is why the analysis in this section is based on specific examples rather than theoretical studies eas are particularly useful in situations where solutions to complex problems have to be found for which little information is available to characterize the optimal solutions in these situations it is not possible to do a grid search i e check all candidate solutions one by one as it would take an exponential amount of computational time cases characterised by a high degree of non linearity to which little information is available to bound the search such as incorporating interactions in sdms kissling et al 2012 can be classified as complex problems the ability to deal with this complexity is an advantage over other methods eas also have notable weaknesses and pitfalls which are discussed in this section it is important to note that other potentially suitable metaheuristic algorithms exist such as particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization they are also shortly discussed as they share a number of characteristics with eas making them interesting for machine learning in species distribution modelling 4 1 problem encoding and flexibility a clear strength is the flexibility of eas offering the chance to implement any type of machine learning problem by using the encoding model interface specifically the ability of 1 encoding the model in a computation element the chromosome and 2 using mappers to translate chromosomes to models allows separating the process of training with operators from fitness calculation model performance evaluation this flexibility has already been illustrated in garp where different relations e g logistic linear or boolean can be used in the software olden et al 2008 the mentioned flexibility allows to define various ways of model training i e estimating model parameters and or reducing model complexity reducing model complexity in conjunction with learning can present an opportunity for the use of individual and agent based to support species distribution modelling indeed the structure of these individual and agent based models can be complex grimm et al 2010 and model simplification with flexible machine learning algorithms could allow for a further automation of model development to reduce model complexity the most relevant features of a model are selected by encoding embedded or wrapper feature selection saeys et al 2007 wrapper feature selection is concerned with selecting features for other data driven or an already parameterized model as opposed to this embedded feature selection estimates model parameters and selects features simultaneously for wrapper feature selection a binary string encoding the inclusion 1 or exclusion 0 can be used d heygere et al 2006 whereas for embedded feature selection a list of list approach can be used gobeyn 2018 for encoding a binary or continuous string the reader is referred to haupt and haupt 2004 the list of list a first order list is implemented in the genotype to represent a feature in or exclusion if an inclusion for a feature is considered then a second order list is defined holding the value for the model parameters coupled to the input feature i e coefficients of the response curve the list of list approach seems to be promising however additional research is required to verify its performance for parameter estimation a string of continuous values for example values of model parameters describing the species niche see fukuda et al 2011 can be implemented in the genotype of the chromosomes these are then translated to model parameters and after model execution a fitness value a disadvantage of the chromosome encoding and the use of a mapper function is that a certain amount of programming skills is required this might hinder novel users to use eas or other metaheuristics for their machine learning application however since machine learning with eas is specifically applicable to increase transparency of complex models it is expected that the initial investment in programming will be the better option especially in the long run even more open science is challenging ecological informaticians to increase code flexibility modularity and transparency golding et al 2017 leading to a more user friendly experience in programming languages such as r and python in addition a number of initiatives are taken in the field of computer science to help non expert and expert users to deal with feature selection and hyperparameter optimization for example auto weka feurer et al 2015 and auto sklearn kotthoff et al 2016 are initiatives that consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and values for the hyperparameters through bayesian learning as such these tools offer the opportunity to investigate the position of eas in comparison to other machine learning methods for specific problems tackled in species distribution modelling and ecology in general 4 2 population based approach the population based approach of eas is considered the second advantage for species distribution modelling since ecological phenomena characterised by a large amount of noise are too complex to describe by one model fukuda et al 2013 merow et al 2014 muñoz mas et al 2017 vezza et al 2015 using multiple models in the context of ensemble learning is useful to reflect model uncertainties araújo and new 2007 practically the ea would be run a couple of times preferably with other samples of the training data i e cross validation or bootstrapping and track the best models found in each run ensemble learning has shown to be valuable to avoid sdm overfitting especially for modelling rare species breiner et al 2015 the population based approach of eas allows providing an informative ensemble of near optimal solutions rather than just one optimal solution in this perspective eas can be used to generate ensembles comparable muñoz mas et al 2017 and possibly serve as an alternative for the rf method the combination of iterating a number of solutions and the crossover and mutation operators offers the opportunity to explore multiple areas of the search space holland 2000 applied to feature selection it allows tracking interesting combinations of features over several generations this is considered a great strength and a competitive alternative to stepwise selection procedures usually used in species distribution modelling in stepwise selection procedures an alternative model is tested to data by iteratively excluding including a feature zuur et al 2009 these approaches are considered greedy because they make locally optimal decisions with the assumption that a near optimal solution will be found in the vicinity of this local solution although the forward selection approach is computationally efficient this procedure may ignore informative combinations of features which are individually only marginally relevant the search behaviour of eas is totally different they combine and test solutions that are located in various regions of the search space eas and ant colony optimization are population based approaches able to deal with combinatorial optimization problems boussaïd et al 2013 whereas particle swarm optimization was initially designed to solve continuous problems kennedy and eberhart 1997 combinatorial optimization problems are a class of discrete optimization problems in which the input arguments encode permutations combinations or variations scheerlinck et al 2009 the way the candidate solutions are generated is the main difference between eas and ant colony optimization in eas candidate solutions are encoded as strings of bits or real numbers of the chromosomes whereas for ant colony optimization the potential solutions are encoded in the environment of ants that is the ants or agents propagate through the search space and new candidate solutions are constructed from the information in this environment this way the memory of the system is embedded in the environment rather than the objects this property makes ant colony optimization more appealing for modelling dynamically changing systems maier et al 2003 szemis et al 2012 zecchin et al 2006 for now the application of ant colony optimization in species distribution modelling might seem less interesting since data are often not available over multiple time instances as depicted in the introduction near real time data are expected to arrive as technologies in species tracking and remote sensing are continuously improved cord et al 2014 pauwels et al 2014 bastille rousseau et al 2017 as ant colony optimization is able to deal with dynamic constraints without reinitialisation it is expected to be appropriate to deal with these type of dynamic data in these cases the use of ant colony optimization for model identification could be assessed as superior to eas a fairly novel class of population based methods are estimation of distribution algorithms edas these algorithms guide the search for an optimal solution by sampling probabilistic models of candidate solutions and by using selection operators also applied in eas the aim of edas is not only to optimize models but also to provide a series of probabilistic models revealing characteristics of the problem being solved pelikan et al 2015 other examples of newly developed population based methods to obtain this type of information are irace lópez ibá nez et al 2016 and sequential model based optimization hutter et al 2011 they all share the aim of automatic algorithm configuration defined as finding good algorithm settings values for hyperparameters operators for solving unseen problem instances by learning on a set of training problem instances lópez ibá nez et al 2016 applying this type of algorithms to train sdms could be interesting to further learn about the characteristics of the training problem at hand sample prevalence is a typical example of a characteristic of a training data set see also table 2 the mentioned techniques could thus be used to train models on data sets with varying sample prevalence so to provide interesting insights on the effect of sample prevalence on not only the objective measure but also algorithms functioning 4 3 hyperparameters the standard application of an ea requires five hyperparameters to be optimized or tuned population size a stopping criterion selection rate and crossover and mutation rate this can be considered as a disadvantage since the performance of the ea depends on the choice of these hyperparameters grefenstette 1986 feurer et al 2015 guidelines for automated tuning these hyperparameters are found in the literature gibbs et al 2008 2010 lópez ibá nez et al 2016 yet it is important to note that the no free lunch theorem states that there is no global set of hyperparameters effective for every problem wolpert and macready 1997 consequently every class of problems will require hyperparameter testing the results our literature review show that a limited number of studies 8 out of 25 used an iterative approach to obtain hyperparameter values in addition no significant relation between hyperparameters could be identified see supportive information 3 this is in line with the findings of gibbs et al 2008 who empirically determined the degree of interaction between hyperparameters for a list of optimization problems only the population size shows a strong inverse relationship with the mutation rate whereas the interaction between other hyperparameters was found not to be as relevant for the ga performance within our analysis we could not determine a relation between the number of chromosomes and the mutation rate the reason for this observation is that hyperparameters are rarely optimized in the field of species distribution modelling algorithms are used and settings seem to be copied from other publications without explicit reasoning see table 2 boets et al 2013 d heygere et al 2003 2006 and zarkami et al 2012 as such we suspect that hyperparameters values in the studies in table 2 are sub optimal here we advocate the practice of testing and reporting the values for hyperparameters and their effect on the objective function so readers can assess which hyperparameters might be useful for a specific application in species distribution modelling we promote the use of guidelines to have a good estimate of optimal values for the hyperparameters as those in gibbs et al 2008 and gibbs et al 2010 although the number of hyperparameters to be determined may be a weakness of eas many metaheuristic algorithms i e ant colony optimization particle swarm optimization simulated annealing and machine learning algorithms share this shortcoming as noted at the end of section 4 1 a number of tools developed in computer science are being developed to automate the hyperparameter optimization problem feurer et al 2015 4 4 multiobjective machine learning an opportunity of eas in species distribution modelling is their potential use as multiobjective machine learning methods which aim to train a model based on multiple potentially conflicting objectives typically the purpose of species distribution modelling is to train models which estimate species presence and absence well in many cases it is desired for instance in decision management to give a higher weight to one or the other mouton et al 2009 a number of evaluation criteria based on the classification of the occurrence probability e g cohen s kappa or true skill statistics are being used to pool the degree of correct estimation of species presence and absence mouton et al 2010 unfortunately these evaluation measures depend on sample prevalence consequently training models with these data having varying sample prevalence are biased a pragmatic approach to solve this issue is to keep sample prevalence equal over all data samples and or to define a trade off between commission and omission errors in the objective function allouche et al 2006 manel et al 2001 mouton et al 2010 the trade off between omission and commission errors can be viewed as a multiobjective problem eas have proven to be adequate techniques to identify trade offs between objectives penn et al 2013 sweetapple et al 2014 in general eas can be used to determine the entire set of pareto optimal solutions or at least a representative subset a pareto optimal set is a set of solutions that are nondominated when compared with other solutions of the solution space deb et al 2000 for example for species distribution modelling a pareto optimal set could be a set of equally valid solutions to a problem presenting the trade off between commission and omission errors this way decision makers obtain a set of solutions that can be very valuable for different aspects of ecosystem decision management guisan et al 2013 a well known example of a multiobjective optimizer using an ea is the non dominated sorting ga ii of deb et al 2000 in this algorithm a simple ga with uniform crossover and mutation but with specific selection operators is used for the selection operator different nondominant fronts are identified these nondominant fronts are estimates of the pareto front defined by two or more objectives the chromosomes in each non dominant front have the same assigned dummy fitness value ranked according to the strength of the front these dummy fitness values are used to select chromosomes deb et al 2000 this process is repeated until a nondominant front equal or close to the pareto optimal front is found an example of the use of the non dominated sorting ga ii in ecology is presented by côté et al 2007 5 recommendations for application eas and other metaheuristic algorithms are particularly useful to solve problems such as feature selection parametrisation of complex models and optimization of other learning algorithms these algorithms are likely not suited to solve every problem as the development of a specific ea will require high investment costs in terms of programming and algorithm understanding returning little improvement in model insight and predictive performance in these cases the use of machine learning methods such as decision trees glms or maxent would be more appropriate however we recommend to consider eas when the problem at hand has one of the following characteristics the problem and search for a solution is expected to be complex e g includes species interactions or many features and little information is available to a priori reduce complexity see for example kissling et al 2012 many complex boundaries can be formulated for the problem these could for instance be obtained from experts or ecological databases verberk et al 2012 solutions to the problem are required to be transparent and flexible for model re analysis for instance for decision management adriaenssens et al 2004 the input data set has a high number of features and manual feature reduction is no longer possible e g pesticide database of river sediment in flanders counts more than 200 identified pesticides vmm 2018 the model knows many parameters which have to be calibrated van broekhoven et al 2007 a trade off between objective functions is required for decision management applications this can for instance be the trade off between model complexity and performance or between the correct estimation of species presence and absence for a specific problem one can select from a number of ea implementations in table 4 a suggestion for the type of ea are provided for a number of problems two trivial problems are listed parameter estimation and feature selection see row one and two whereas other applications are less obvious and often problem specific implementations for the calibration of parameter rich models 10 parameters a binary or real ga encoded can be used since both are expected to perform equally well van broekhoven et al 2007 the second case involves the reduction of the number of input features with the help of eas typically this applies to data sets for which a large number of potential input variables can explain species occurrence this type of learning could be particularly interesting when remote sensing products are used in order to reduce the amount of input data required to estimate species distributions from spatial input data hampton et al 2013 automated variable selection with eas can be helpful to steer model development but as noted by araújo and guisan 2006 this should not replace a selection based on expert knowledge in the case of feature selection a binary encoded ga is implemented encoding the in or exclusion of input features d heygere et al 2006 this feature selection can be helpful for the optimization of stacked sdms or population based sdms in these sdms models for different species are coupled with each other guisan and rahbek 2011 and are allowed to interact with the number of species considered in these stacked sdms the number of model elements increases exponentially due to one on one interaction binary gas can be used to simplify these models preventing an overly complex model to be fitted to a limited number of species occurrence observations in addition binary gas can be used to optimize artificial neural networks in this case different layers or neurons can be implemented in the binary string and the structure of the ann can be optimized see muñoz mas et al 2017 for simple binary and real coded gas a selection rate of 0 5 a crossover rate above 0 8 mutation rate lower than 0 2 and 100 generations will in general work well when the number of chromosomes is between 30 and 200 independent of the chromosome length gibbs et al 2008 and table 2 for the choice of the selection operator we advise using tournament or roulette wheel selection both are simple to understand and generally give satisfying results when compared to other selection operators goldberg and deb 1991 the use of elitism is advised however it is important to note that the use of elitism can decrease the population diversity and facilitate faster convergence the need for fast convergence motivated by limited available computation resources can be an important boundary condition in choosing the number of model evaluations this number is determined by the number of chromosomes multiplied by a number of generations a limited number of model evaluations 400 and 2500 have been used and have presumably led to satisfying results increasing the number of evaluations can be useful however it is possible that gains in accuracy or precision are marginal as discussed by gibbs et al 2008 the number of evaluations should vary as a function of the available computational resources as a rule of thumb we advise to focus on a cross validation resampling strategy and on repeated execution of the ea cross validation strategy to increase robustness rather than employing a larger number of model evaluations users are advised to consider stratification according to sample prevalence to a design cross validation strategy as discussed above accuracy measures can vary as a function of this prevalence to make results comparable it is of importance that data are stratified according to this prevalence the choice for a number of folds and repetitions will depend on the available computation resources and the size of the data set precision will increase with a higher number of repetitions and folds leading to a longer runtime when data sets are small and models are learned fast a higher number is thus preferred in contrast when learning is slow one can opt to choose fewer folds and repetitions kohavi 1995 as discussed above one can also consider lowering the number of function evaluations when further fine tuning of the hyperparameters is desired we recommend using the guidelines of gibbs et al 2008 as every specific problem can have a unique set of optimal hyperparameters the choice of the objective function which the ga has to optimize depends on the study objectives does one aim to estimate species presence well or rather absence if the former is true than a higher weight should be given to sensitivity in the case of the latter specificity see table 3 in case a trade off between both should be identified one can consider a multi objective ea in these algorithms a specific selection operator is implemented in the ga to weight different objectives see for example the non dominated sort in nsga ii deb et al 2002 three main points need to be taken into account when machine learning or other algorithms are considered to solve a hypothesis first specifying the model and its structural component the subject of model training and the objective of the model and the study see box 3 is important guisan and zimmermann 2000 for example is the aim of the model to understand a specific theoretical assumption about species interaction or is the aim to develop a predictive model for estimating species occurrence in an ecosystem with many interactions in a second step an algorithm to train the model s needs to be selected box 3 second part specifically algorithm operators problem encoding and operators need to be defined here it is important to make a distinction between algorithms which make use of explicit encoding eas ant colony optimization and those which do not decision trees glms it is empirically found that algorithms making use of encoding work well to train models with hypotheses embedded in the model structure maier et al 2014 the initial choice for a type of algorithm and use of encoding will hence determine the choice for hyperparameters and operators finally a platform to implement the approach for the machine learning application is required gui packages can be used however adopting these packages can considerably limit the options which make eas interesting in the first place for that reason we advise to use a high level scripting language such as python or r and search for existing codes implemented in these languages an additional advantage of using high level scripting languages for machine learning applications is their transferability to high performance and cloud computing infrastructure preferably the scripting is done in an open science context allowing for continuous code improvement and validation through modular scripting for a good introduction on modular scripting applied to ecology we refer to golding et al 2017 typically open science is performed on code sharing platforms such as github https github com 6 future perspectives and conclusions recent advances in theoretical ecology leibold et al 2004 and conceptual modelling guisan and rahbek 2011 are challenging scientists to continuously develop new ways to deal with this increasing complexity the field of machine learning has proven to be useful to tackle these questions despite that researchers are struggling to identify the appropriate approach to address increasing complexity kissling et al 2012 maxent is currently the most used technique to model species distributions when considering terrestrial cases for freshwater system case studies innovative methods such as artificial neural networks and eas are increasingly being used to solve less straightforward problems model developers will be required to deal with this increased complexity preferably in an open science context this depicts full transparency in the methodology but also the practical encoding golding et al 2017 phillips et al 2017 in addition it requires the developed algorithms to be easily transferable and adaptable to new problems considering these aspects eas and other metaheuristic algorithms are found to be of particular use since they split the training process from the objective function evaluation model run in addition eas allow dealing with complex cases eiben and smith 2015 making them appropriate candidates to train the next generation of species distribution models dealing with hyperparameters optimization and the requirement of programming and modelling skills are considered disadvantageous hindering the use of eas and other metaheuristic algorithms for the first hyperparameter optimization methods are already available giving satisfying results for multiple problems gibbs et al 2008 gobeyn et al 2017 the second the need for modelling know how will require standardization documentation and refinement of the algorithm development and application process jakeman et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 going hand in hand with the philosophy of open science in this review paper a number of suggestions with respect to the definition of the model algorithm and implementation are given with this we aim to stimulate ecologists to use and further refine the development of eas applied to species distribution modelling hypothesis testing and preferably ecology in general as technological advances in machine learning are reshaping the way scientist develop models and analyse data researches are increasingly aware that one specific algorithm won t offer a tailor made solution to every problem chatfield 1993 with this synthesis an insight is presented on how to use eas as a technique to solve specific problems in ecology rather than using it as a ready to use technology to map species distributions author contribution s g a m m a f c m v and p l m g

25149,scientists and decision makers need tools that can assess which specific pressures lead to ecosystem deterioration and which measures could reduce these pressures and or limit their effects in this context species distribution models are tools that can be used to help asses these pressures evolutionary algorithms represent a collection of promising techniques inspired by concepts observed in natural evolution to support the development of species distribution models they are suited to solve non trivial tasks such as the calibration of parameter rich models the reduction of model complexity by feature selection and or the optimization of hyperparameters of other machine learning algorithms although widely used in other scientific domains the full potential of evolutionary algorithms has yet to be explored for applied ecological research in this synthesis we study the role of evolutionary algorithms as a machine learning technique to develop the next generation of species distribution models to do so we review available methods for species distribution modelling and synthesize literature using evolutionary algorithms in addition we discuss specific advantages and weaknesses of evolutionary algorithms and present a guideline for their application we find that evolutionary algorithms are increasingly used to solve specific and challenging problems their flexibility adaptability and transferability in addition to their capacity to find adequate solutions to complex non linear problems are considered as main strengths especially for species distribution models with a large degree of complexity the need for programming and modelling skills can be considered as a drawback for novice modellers in addition setting values for hyperparameters is a challenge future ecological research should focus on exploring the potential of evolutionary algorithms that combine multiple tasks in one learning cycle in addition studies should focus on the use of novel machine learning schemes e g automated hyperparameter optimization to apply evolutionary algorithms preferably in the context of open science this way ecologists and model developers can achieve an adaptable and flexible framework for developing tools useful for decision management keywords evolutionary algorithms machine learning species distribution modelling model development automated model selection 1 introduction innovations in remote sensing and micro control units used for near real time monitoring of ecosystems are challenging ecologists to deal with a great number of data coming from different sources hampton et al 2013 machine learning plays an increasingly important role to deal with this challenge not only in the field of ecology meyers et al 2017 however ecologists often struggle with the interpretation of models developed with novel machine learning algorithms araújo and guisan 2006 as a consequence scientists are required to search for new approaches to increase reliability transparency and flexibility of the models they are developing elith and leathwick 2009 the models developed for ecological research and management with machine learning are mainly classified under species distribution models sdms these models aim to define the species environment relation and from this estimate the species geographical distribution sdms rely on the concept of an ecological niche described by hutchinson 1957 this theory conceptualizes the relation between a species environment and its occurrence hirzel and le lay 2008 niche theory hutchinson 1957 states that a species can only exist if the local combination of environmental gradients the niche allows a positive population growth rate in the absence of immigration in addition the theory states that a difference in species traits allows them to occupy a different niche and coexist in a given spatial unit to inspect these species traits machine learning algorithms are used to classify a species as present or absent given the environmental conditions often a probabilistic framework is used to express the chance for a species to occur the environmental conditions are quantified in a number of environmental features for instance temperature precipitation soil moisture he et al 2015 the number of input features after preprocessing reach up to 20 while studies using over 30 features are found in literature bennetsen et al 2016 machine learning is used to train a model estimating a response variable species occurrence based on these environmental predictors species distribution model development with machine learning embeds little ecological hypotheses in the training process as the machine learning algorithms primarily aim to uncover patterns in data saeys et al 2007 mount et al 2016 at first instance this development could be considered as black box modelling which is the case in a number of techniques e g artificial neural networks yet there are techniques such as decision trees that present interpretable models in these models the user can interpret why estimations were done in that way for example in decision trees a set of hierarchical rules can be analysed that lead to an estimated species presence in specific applications for instance in freshwater management embedding hypotheses and assumptions is of major importance to preserve ecological interpretability of the developed models adriaenssens et al 2004 also incorporating species dispersal and interactions in the next generation of species distribution models sdms requires a hypothesis driven approach evolutionary algorithms eas a collective of machine learning techniques inspired on the concept of evolution allow embedding these hypotheses by separating model performance evaluation from solution searching rauch and harremoës 1999 in these eas models with parameters and input variables are encoded in so called chromosomes specific algorithm functions called genetic operators are applied to these chromosomes to search for well performing models because eas algorithms offer this transparency and flexibility we evaluate in this synthesis the role of eas as a machine learning method for species distribution modelling we aim to answer the following questions what is the current role of eas in species distribution modelling section 2 how do eas work and what are their specific strengths section 3 what opportunities do these eas have in the field of species distribution modelling section 4 what guidelines can be given to applying an ea or another metaheuristic as a machine learning method to identify transparent and accurate models section 5 it is important to note that this paper focuses on eas having in mind that other metaheuristics such as particle swarm optimization ant colony optimization and simulated annealing also exist for an overview of these other methods we refer to supportive information 1 differences between eas and other metaheuristics are discussed throughout this manuscript for an extensive description of eas and other metaheuristics we refer readers to gendreau and potvin 2010 and kacprzyk and pedrycz 2015 2 machine learning in species distribution modelling many ecological researchers rely on machine learning for the development of sdms the use of machine learning has introduced new concepts important for ecologists to understand in contrast to previous reviews discussing the development of sdms e g guisan and thuiller 2005 araújo and guisan 2006 austin 2007 this review focusses on sdm learning and its technical challenges rather than development through ecological reasoning that is why we focus on the discussion of eas in the context of machine learning machine learning can be defined as the field of research using computer programs or algorithms that have the ability to adapt or change from an experience data given a n performance or objective measure algorithms to facilitate machine learning are widely applied in many scientific fields such as artificial intelligence telecommunication and engineering of electronics web of science accessed on 13 09 2018 machine learning algorithms can be used to train models with data so these models can make as good as possible predictions on new unseen data machine learning algorithms can be categorized based on whether output labels are not used for training i e un supervised learning box 1 to guide the readers box 1 shows a number of definitions used in the field of machine learning also used in this review paper in species distribution modelling supervised learning is typically applied to classify species occurrence in geographical and possibly the temporal dimensions to train sdms binary labelled data species presence or absence together with environmental input data are used by the machine learning algorithm in table 1 an overview of methods used in species distribution modelling are shown together with a short explanation the cumulative number of papers mentioning the method web of science accessed 08 11 2017 and key references in addition in fig 1 the first report of the method in scientific literature is shown the remainder of this section aims to shortly introduce these methods to guide readers to the most used ones acronyms of these methods can also be found in table 1 generalized linear and adaptive models respectively glms and gams and decision trees are the first machine learning techniques used in species distribution modelling fig 1 glms and gams are a collection of semi parametric techniques based on three elements a random component that assumes a probability distribution of a response variable 1 a systematic component specifying linear combination of the explanatory variables with their respective slopes 2 and a link function describing the relation between the random and systematic component 3 nelder and wedderburn 1972 decision trees are classifiers expressed as recursive partitions or trees of the feature space rokach and maimon 2015 these are tree like representations of a rule induction i e a set of if then rules that are followed leading to a probability of species presence or absence different algorithms are available to develop decision trees such as cart breiman et al 1984 and c4 5 quinlan ross 1993 using a gini index and entropy measure respectively a robust approach based on decision trees is a random forest rf breiman 2001 rf uses bootstrap aggregation to generate on a number of decision or regression trees in bootstrap aggregation several bootstrap samples from a training data set objects in the instance space are taken to develop a number of models rf is used often in species distribution modelling and has shown to be an interesting technique to model complex systems including species interactions vezza et al 2015 the genetic algorithm for rule set production garp is an ea inspired method used to produce a rule bank sdm stockwell and noble 1992 a rule bank sdm is a model based on a set of hierarchical rules estimating species presence or absence in this sense the model structures obtained with garp are similar to those obtained with decision trees garp is the first sdm software package using eas knowing a number of successful applications for instance to estimate the effect of global change on species distributions peterson et al 2002 another technique often used in combination with eas are artificial neural networks ding et al 2013 artificial neural networks which are non linear mapping structures inspired by the biological system of the brain have been successfully used for freshwater applications goethals et al 2007 muñoz mas et al 2017 from these two examples it is clear that eas are often used to support the development of the model structure i e search for the most optimal model structure despite their success the popularity of artificial neural networks and also garp is recently declining compared to that of maximum entropy modelling maxent table 1 introduced in 2006 maxent uses the principle of maximum entropy to make predictions from incomplete knowledge phillips et al 2006 the maximum entropy method maxent approach uses the principle of maximum entropy to make predictions from incomplete knowledge the principle of maximum entropy states that the best approximation to an unknown distribution given a number of constraints is the distribution which only satisfies these constraints and no others in other words maxent aims to model everything that is known constraints but assumes nothing about what is unknown maxent is currently the most used package to train sdms 200 papers in 2016 based on abstract search web of science 08 11 2017 its theoretical basis the default use of regularisation i e penalize model complexity flexibility and performance are the main factors explaining maxent s popularity elith et al 2011 model complexity can also be penalized in many other algorithms however maxent was the first approach to include it by default this default inclusion stressed the importance of regularization among users peterson et al 2007 compared the transferability test on unseen data of maxent and garp and showed that both have their specific advantages this is not surprising as the no free lunch theorem wolpert and macready 1997 depicts that no algorithm will work well on all problems a good approach to deal with the no free lunch theorem is to combine and or compare several approaches in one modelling effort thuiller 2003 developed a platform for implementing different techniques his initial aim was to present a framework able to simultaneously fit different models to data it was only six years later that thuiller et al 2009 presented a new version of biomod including the concepts of uncertainty estimation and ensemble forecasting araújo and new 2007 a weakness of the biomod is that the platform is bound by specific implementations of techniques golding et al 2017 deals with this issue by implementing a modular framework for species distribution modelling he argues that algorithm success is partly depicted by method transparency empowered by clear encoding and guidelines of use i e which method and specific settings are suitable to solve the problem at hand it is important to note that besides algorithm guidelines also appropriate data cleansing techniques can considerably improve results an excellent guide for data cleansing of ecological data is given by zuur et al 2010 other techniques are available but are not categorized under machine learning as their origins are rooted in niche theory of hutchinson 1957 these methods specifically growest nix et al 1977 climex sutherst and maywald 1985 and bioclim booth 1985 nix 1986 were used in the early days of mapping a species niche fig 1 they are currently less used because of their simplicity lack of accuracy and inability to account for variable interaction booth et al 2014 table 1 another less used approach is the development of models with fuzzy logic fuzzy logic models allow integrating expert knowledge in their model structure specifically fuzzy models allow reflecting uncertainty present in linguistic information adriaenssens et al 2004 although fuzzy logic model development might not be classified under machine learning it is often used in conjunction with a machine learning algorithm chen et al 2003 the methods discussed above generally only consider the species environment relationship to estimate species occurrence the spatial structure of the relations is implicitly included in the scale spatially explicit models which incorporate the spatial space in their structure allow describing processes such as migration and dispersal in a spatial context deangelis and yurek 2017 dunning et al 1995 up until today these explicit methods are less popular mainly because of their complexity and need for detailed information to parametrize them deangelis and yurek 2017 given these disadvantages spatially explicit models do hold a lot of potential to help uncover species behaviour and distribution as a function of environmental pressures although the role of garp is recently declining a number of specific applications of eas are observed in the literature since 2000 see table 2 these novel techniques are mainly applied in the context of freshwater management and used to estimate a link between river modification and freshwater species occurrence they facilitate feature selection feature selection for definition see box 1 for artificial neural network and decision tree models d heygere et al 2006 or to estimate model parameters of fuzzy logic sdms fukuda et al 2011 the results of our literature review for methodology see supportive information 2 show that these algorithms are often tailor made and characterized by a specific algorithm formulation in the next section we discuss this ea literature with the aim to identify which specific applications and workflows are mainly adopted before we do so we introduce the basic principles of evolutionary algorithms 3 evolutionary algorithms 3 1 introduction to evolutionary algorithms eas aim to solve complex problems by incorporating elements of structured randomness in their search behaviour motivated by principles in evolution such as selection mutation and crossover maier et al 2014 eas distinguish from single point based methods by iterating a population of candidate solutions to an optimum these solutions are quantified in a fitness mimicking the evolutionary concept eas have been successfully applied to solve specific problems in water resources management maier et al 2014 astrophysics bio informatics pal et al 2006 sirbu et al 2010 and software engineering eiben and smith 2015 even more the use of eas in artificial intelligence is pushing advances in evolving digital objects software towards physical embodied artificial evolution i e hardware robots 3d printers numerous examples exist and the number of applications is expected to increase in the coming years eiben and smith 2015 eas have mainly been used as a machine learning method also to train other methods such as artificial neural networks and decision trees their success can be explained by a number of reasons eiben and smith 2015 maier et al 2014 1 eas are assumption free which make them generally applicable and easily transferable to other problems 2 they are flexible and can easily be used in combination with other methods for instance other search methods or fuzzy logic 3 they are capable to solve complex problems without the need for model simplification often required by traditional optimization methods moreover they are able to uncover less obvious or even unexpected patterns 4 the found solutions with eas allow for an in depth analysis since a number of near optimal solutions are generated eas iterate a population of chromosomes over a number of generations with genetic operators i e selection crossover and mutation box 2 and fig 2 panel a this process is inspired by the concept of evolution where genetic information and characteristics in a population are passed on generation by generation the chromosome is the algorithms building block storing the formulation and performance of a candidate solution to a problem i e the genome and fitness the fitness can be defined as a quantification measure of how good a solution to a problem is the formulation of the candidate solution is stored in a specific data type also called genome for genetic algorithms gas binary or real valued strings are coded as data type whereas tree like structures are used for genetic programming gp fig 2 panel b both gas and gp are classified under evolutionary algorithms other types of eas such as evolutionary programming and evolution strategies exist weise 2009 gas differ from other evolutionary algorithms in the way they are designed as problem independent solvers whereas other eas are designed and implemented to solve specific problems we consider gp to be developed for specific problems the conceptual difference between gas and evolutionary programming is that the basic object is considered to be a species rather than a chromosome in evolutionary programming recombination crossover is often not considered evolutionary strategies show resemblance to real valued gas but with a focus on the selection and mutation operator these problem specific techniques are used in species distribution modelling but not often in the next section we explore the use of this problem in dependent eas the initialisation of a population with a number of chromosomes population size ps and their genomes is the first step for binary string gas this consists of creating a random string of bits example lower left panel fig 2 with every bit either having the value zero or one for real valued strings a uniform value within a defined interval is chosen for every bit after initialisation the fitness is evaluated by mapping the genome to a model with a mapper function as an example for feature selection in sdms a 011 string is translated to the exclusion of the first feature and inclusion of the last two in the model d heygere et al 2006 for parameter estimation a binary string is translated to an integer or decimal respectively 011 0 1 1 2 1 4 6 or 1 6 for the value of the model parameters van broekhoven et al 2007 the models are then evaluated with a user defined objective function and training data leading to a fitness value usually a measure of agreement between the model output and training data is calculated after fitness evaluation selection crossover and mutation operators are applied to the population the selection operator selects a number of chromosomes from the population as parents to generate offspring based on their fitness value and a selection procedure e g tournament selection roulette wheel selection in tournament selection tournaments are organised in which two candidate parents are randomly selected and the candidate with the highest fitness is selected as a parent for roulette wheel selection parents are selected with a chance proportional to their relative fitness the crossover operator generates offspring by inheriting a part of the parents genomes for instance in a ga one point crossover operator a position in the genome is randomly chosen as a breakpoint the parents substrings are then combined to form a new string for the offspring fig 2 lower panel a crossover rate determines the probability that crossover between parents occurs the mutation operator changes the values in random positions in the genomes or alleles of the offspring with a rate equal to the mutation rate after the application of the three operators the fitness of the new chromosomes is evaluated next a new generation is produced by applying the before introduced operators this procedure is repeated until a certain stopping criterion is met typically this criterion is a maximum number of generations or a fitness convergence criterion besides the context of use of gas and gp the way of problem encoding and consequently the implementation of the crossover and mutation operator is different mcdermott et al 2015 rowe 2015 for gas an example of a crossover of two binary strings with a one point uniform operator is shown in fig 2 lower left panel here a random number between two one and the length length minus one of the two parents genome is chosen and before after this position a breakpoint is appointed the genome for the first offspring is formed by merging the part before and after the breakpoint of parent one and two respectively similarly for the second offspring the parts before and after the breakpoint are used but now the genomes of parent two and one are used for gp fig 2 lower right panel breakpoints are chosen between nodes of the tree and these are switched between the parents genomes for mutation in a binary string a random position is chosen and the value for the allele at that position is flipped to the other value 0 1 or 1 0 in case of real valued strings a new random value bounded by a predefined interval is chosen at a random position for tree like structures a random terminal or non terminal node is chosen and replaced with a terminal node or random initiated subtree see fig 2 lower right panel mcdermott et al 2015 3 2 application to species distribution modelling in order to obtain an insight into the use of eas in species distribution modelling literature abstracts were scanned in the web of science catalogue the followed methodology to conduct this literature review can be found in supportive information 2 here implementations that differ from garp are discussed as these implementations vary as a function of the context of the problem the results of this literature review are shown in table 2 in this table we make a clear distinction between parameter estimation and hyperparameter optimization parameter estimation refers to the estimation of a unique set of model parameter values box 1 with respect to species distribution and ecological modelling this implies that model parameters that describe the limits of a species environmental range are estimated e g what are the threshold river temperatures in which a fish can survive or what are temperature tipping points at which species reproduction declines as such parameters are an element of the sdm hyperparameter optimization refers to the search for values of algorithm settings which influence an algorithm s performance in other words a hyperparameter can be considered as an algorithms free option available for the user the number of neurons and hidden layers are examples of two hyperparameters that need to be set in order to develop an artificial neural network or for a rf on has to set the maximum depth of a tree and the number of trees as such values for hyperparameters can be considered as choice elements of the algorithm and can thus not be directly estimated with data in the context of table 2 hyperparameter optimization in the column subject of training refers to the action of using an ea to perform hyperparameter optimization of another machine learning approach it is important to differentiate between the column subject of training from the columns hyperparameters and hyperparameter optimization as the latter two refer to the setting of hyperparameters of the ea itself table 2 shows the general characteristics of studies in which eas are applied generally they are applied in freshwater management to estimate model parameters perform feature selection or hyperparameter optimization of other machine learning techniques for 14 of the 27 an ea is used for only feature selection whereas in seven studies for only parameter estimation in five studies an ea is used for parameter estimation and feature selection and in the remaining study an ea is used for feature selection and optimization of hyperparameters of a decision tree in case of feature selection the eas are used as wrapper methods for other methods artificial neural networks e g d heygere et al 2006 and decision trees e g boets et al 2013 in this approach the genomes are translated to features for another machine learning technique fitting the response patterns to environmental conditions in the case of parameter estimation the eas are used to estimate the model parameter values of fuzzy logic models e g fukuda 2009 van broekhoven et al 2007 in other words the model parameters describing suitability range of environmental conditions for a species are estimated a noteworthy observation is that 22 papers presented in table 2 situate within the domain of freshwater science the data used in these case studies are often characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and noise and observation bias i e more less presence instances are available than absence see column prev in table 2 the latter causing a bias in model training mouton et al 2010 is the reason why a number of classification measures are typically used in these studies often used measures are listed in table 3 together with their acronyms in these measures species occurrence estimated by the classifier is tested to observations according to the study objectives and available data a set of measures is selected and analysed each weighting a degree of correct estimation of species presence on the one hand and absence on the other mouton et al 2010 non binary measures such as the root mean of squared error correlation and sum of squared errors are used for regression in these cases the probability of occurrence is not estimated but species numbers d angelo et al 1995 or density fukuda 2009 in addition the root mean square error and linear correlation is used in one case the mean squared error between the non classified preference between 0 and 1 and observed presence absence is computed fukuda et al 2012 in another case models are penalized for their complexity muñoz mas et al 2016a the trade off between omission and commission errors are never explicitly considered in model training although they are considered implicitly by weighting objectives assumed prevalence independent measures like cohen s kappa or the true skill statistic are used to cope with this trade off however there is no agreement whether these are truly prevalence independent mouton et al 2011 in three of the studies reported in table 2 the training data are stratified by sampling an equal number of presence and absence instances in order to deal with this prevalence dependency mouton et al 2009 a number of different implementations of eas have been used in species distribution modelling simple genetic algorithms are generally used and are considered problem independent these algorithms apply a ga with uniform crossover and mutation operators in conjunction with a tournament selection operator e g boets et al 2013 derivative methods have been used in combination with gas allowing to improve the local search performance of the gas muñoz mas et al 2016 muñoz mas et al 2017 in addition gps are used but only limited jeong et al 2011 mckay 2001 whigham 2000 another interesting application is the use of bayesian theory in gas mcclean et al 2005 termansen et al 2006 feature selection is always implemented in binary strings whereas binary and continuous strings are used for parameter estimation crossover rates vary from 0 6 to 0 95 whereas mutation rate are generally lower between 0 1 and 0 3 with the exception of 0 6 muñoz mas et al 2017 and 0 75 muñoz mas et al 2016 a number of 20 200 chromosomes are reported to iterate over generally 20 100 generations however a larger number of generations 1000 are observed in four studies selection rates are never reported as these are typically equal to 50 model robustness is tested by applying cross validation and repeated learning with the same or different samples of the data cross validation is generally used 14 of 27 cases to test robustness in this approach the data are partitioned in a number of samples i e folds next the model is identified with n 1 folds and validated with the remaining fold in a number of publications the ea analysis is repeated a number of times with the same data starting from different initial populations in order to test the robustness of the ea see d angelo et al 1995 fukuda 2009 this is because the obtained near optimal solution might not be equal in every ea run since the search behaviour is characteristic by random choices an interesting application of this repeated ea analysis is the multilayer perceptron ensembles a type of artificial neural network for the modelling of the redfin barbel muñoz mas et al 2017 here a derivative ga analysis is repeated a number of times to increase ensemble size by checking convergence of the solutions determined with the ga for an increased ensemble size one can determine an optimal set of solutions with this the authors showed the potential of using multilayer perceptron ensembles and eas for the identification of multiple models reflecting simulation uncertainty i e ensemble forecasting araújo and new 2007 an interesting observation is that ea hyperparameters are reported more consistently in recent years in addition testing the training robustness as a practice has increased the latter is probably due to the availability of growing computational resources in addition species prevalence is increasingly reported suggesting that practioners are more aware of the effect of prevalence bias on model training as such it is observed that more detailed and robust approaches are presented finally most studies rely on an extension of simple genetic algorithms whereas genetic programming has not been employed in recent years 4 strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis to explore the potential of eas in species distribution modelling we performed a strength weaknesses opportunities and threats swot analysis in this review strengths and weaknesses refer to current characteristic of eas that offer respectively advantages or disadvantages compared to other techniques opportunities and threats refer to future dis advantages to perform this analysis the literature of eas in species distribution modelling was scanned and the specific strengths and weaknesses of the use of eas were compiled in addition opportunities and threats were assessed by testing compliance with known challenges in species distribution modelling based on araújo and guisan 2006 austin 2007 araújo and new 2007 guisan and zimmermann 2000 guisan and rahbek 2011 in the past specific advantages of eas and metaheuristics were mainly derived from experiments as the true functioning of the algorithms was poorly understood boussaïd et al 2013 maier et al 2014 that is why the analysis in this section is based on specific examples rather than theoretical studies eas are particularly useful in situations where solutions to complex problems have to be found for which little information is available to characterize the optimal solutions in these situations it is not possible to do a grid search i e check all candidate solutions one by one as it would take an exponential amount of computational time cases characterised by a high degree of non linearity to which little information is available to bound the search such as incorporating interactions in sdms kissling et al 2012 can be classified as complex problems the ability to deal with this complexity is an advantage over other methods eas also have notable weaknesses and pitfalls which are discussed in this section it is important to note that other potentially suitable metaheuristic algorithms exist such as particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization they are also shortly discussed as they share a number of characteristics with eas making them interesting for machine learning in species distribution modelling 4 1 problem encoding and flexibility a clear strength is the flexibility of eas offering the chance to implement any type of machine learning problem by using the encoding model interface specifically the ability of 1 encoding the model in a computation element the chromosome and 2 using mappers to translate chromosomes to models allows separating the process of training with operators from fitness calculation model performance evaluation this flexibility has already been illustrated in garp where different relations e g logistic linear or boolean can be used in the software olden et al 2008 the mentioned flexibility allows to define various ways of model training i e estimating model parameters and or reducing model complexity reducing model complexity in conjunction with learning can present an opportunity for the use of individual and agent based to support species distribution modelling indeed the structure of these individual and agent based models can be complex grimm et al 2010 and model simplification with flexible machine learning algorithms could allow for a further automation of model development to reduce model complexity the most relevant features of a model are selected by encoding embedded or wrapper feature selection saeys et al 2007 wrapper feature selection is concerned with selecting features for other data driven or an already parameterized model as opposed to this embedded feature selection estimates model parameters and selects features simultaneously for wrapper feature selection a binary string encoding the inclusion 1 or exclusion 0 can be used d heygere et al 2006 whereas for embedded feature selection a list of list approach can be used gobeyn 2018 for encoding a binary or continuous string the reader is referred to haupt and haupt 2004 the list of list a first order list is implemented in the genotype to represent a feature in or exclusion if an inclusion for a feature is considered then a second order list is defined holding the value for the model parameters coupled to the input feature i e coefficients of the response curve the list of list approach seems to be promising however additional research is required to verify its performance for parameter estimation a string of continuous values for example values of model parameters describing the species niche see fukuda et al 2011 can be implemented in the genotype of the chromosomes these are then translated to model parameters and after model execution a fitness value a disadvantage of the chromosome encoding and the use of a mapper function is that a certain amount of programming skills is required this might hinder novel users to use eas or other metaheuristics for their machine learning application however since machine learning with eas is specifically applicable to increase transparency of complex models it is expected that the initial investment in programming will be the better option especially in the long run even more open science is challenging ecological informaticians to increase code flexibility modularity and transparency golding et al 2017 leading to a more user friendly experience in programming languages such as r and python in addition a number of initiatives are taken in the field of computer science to help non expert and expert users to deal with feature selection and hyperparameter optimization for example auto weka feurer et al 2015 and auto sklearn kotthoff et al 2016 are initiatives that consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and values for the hyperparameters through bayesian learning as such these tools offer the opportunity to investigate the position of eas in comparison to other machine learning methods for specific problems tackled in species distribution modelling and ecology in general 4 2 population based approach the population based approach of eas is considered the second advantage for species distribution modelling since ecological phenomena characterised by a large amount of noise are too complex to describe by one model fukuda et al 2013 merow et al 2014 muñoz mas et al 2017 vezza et al 2015 using multiple models in the context of ensemble learning is useful to reflect model uncertainties araújo and new 2007 practically the ea would be run a couple of times preferably with other samples of the training data i e cross validation or bootstrapping and track the best models found in each run ensemble learning has shown to be valuable to avoid sdm overfitting especially for modelling rare species breiner et al 2015 the population based approach of eas allows providing an informative ensemble of near optimal solutions rather than just one optimal solution in this perspective eas can be used to generate ensembles comparable muñoz mas et al 2017 and possibly serve as an alternative for the rf method the combination of iterating a number of solutions and the crossover and mutation operators offers the opportunity to explore multiple areas of the search space holland 2000 applied to feature selection it allows tracking interesting combinations of features over several generations this is considered a great strength and a competitive alternative to stepwise selection procedures usually used in species distribution modelling in stepwise selection procedures an alternative model is tested to data by iteratively excluding including a feature zuur et al 2009 these approaches are considered greedy because they make locally optimal decisions with the assumption that a near optimal solution will be found in the vicinity of this local solution although the forward selection approach is computationally efficient this procedure may ignore informative combinations of features which are individually only marginally relevant the search behaviour of eas is totally different they combine and test solutions that are located in various regions of the search space eas and ant colony optimization are population based approaches able to deal with combinatorial optimization problems boussaïd et al 2013 whereas particle swarm optimization was initially designed to solve continuous problems kennedy and eberhart 1997 combinatorial optimization problems are a class of discrete optimization problems in which the input arguments encode permutations combinations or variations scheerlinck et al 2009 the way the candidate solutions are generated is the main difference between eas and ant colony optimization in eas candidate solutions are encoded as strings of bits or real numbers of the chromosomes whereas for ant colony optimization the potential solutions are encoded in the environment of ants that is the ants or agents propagate through the search space and new candidate solutions are constructed from the information in this environment this way the memory of the system is embedded in the environment rather than the objects this property makes ant colony optimization more appealing for modelling dynamically changing systems maier et al 2003 szemis et al 2012 zecchin et al 2006 for now the application of ant colony optimization in species distribution modelling might seem less interesting since data are often not available over multiple time instances as depicted in the introduction near real time data are expected to arrive as technologies in species tracking and remote sensing are continuously improved cord et al 2014 pauwels et al 2014 bastille rousseau et al 2017 as ant colony optimization is able to deal with dynamic constraints without reinitialisation it is expected to be appropriate to deal with these type of dynamic data in these cases the use of ant colony optimization for model identification could be assessed as superior to eas a fairly novel class of population based methods are estimation of distribution algorithms edas these algorithms guide the search for an optimal solution by sampling probabilistic models of candidate solutions and by using selection operators also applied in eas the aim of edas is not only to optimize models but also to provide a series of probabilistic models revealing characteristics of the problem being solved pelikan et al 2015 other examples of newly developed population based methods to obtain this type of information are irace lópez ibá nez et al 2016 and sequential model based optimization hutter et al 2011 they all share the aim of automatic algorithm configuration defined as finding good algorithm settings values for hyperparameters operators for solving unseen problem instances by learning on a set of training problem instances lópez ibá nez et al 2016 applying this type of algorithms to train sdms could be interesting to further learn about the characteristics of the training problem at hand sample prevalence is a typical example of a characteristic of a training data set see also table 2 the mentioned techniques could thus be used to train models on data sets with varying sample prevalence so to provide interesting insights on the effect of sample prevalence on not only the objective measure but also algorithms functioning 4 3 hyperparameters the standard application of an ea requires five hyperparameters to be optimized or tuned population size a stopping criterion selection rate and crossover and mutation rate this can be considered as a disadvantage since the performance of the ea depends on the choice of these hyperparameters grefenstette 1986 feurer et al 2015 guidelines for automated tuning these hyperparameters are found in the literature gibbs et al 2008 2010 lópez ibá nez et al 2016 yet it is important to note that the no free lunch theorem states that there is no global set of hyperparameters effective for every problem wolpert and macready 1997 consequently every class of problems will require hyperparameter testing the results our literature review show that a limited number of studies 8 out of 25 used an iterative approach to obtain hyperparameter values in addition no significant relation between hyperparameters could be identified see supportive information 3 this is in line with the findings of gibbs et al 2008 who empirically determined the degree of interaction between hyperparameters for a list of optimization problems only the population size shows a strong inverse relationship with the mutation rate whereas the interaction between other hyperparameters was found not to be as relevant for the ga performance within our analysis we could not determine a relation between the number of chromosomes and the mutation rate the reason for this observation is that hyperparameters are rarely optimized in the field of species distribution modelling algorithms are used and settings seem to be copied from other publications without explicit reasoning see table 2 boets et al 2013 d heygere et al 2003 2006 and zarkami et al 2012 as such we suspect that hyperparameters values in the studies in table 2 are sub optimal here we advocate the practice of testing and reporting the values for hyperparameters and their effect on the objective function so readers can assess which hyperparameters might be useful for a specific application in species distribution modelling we promote the use of guidelines to have a good estimate of optimal values for the hyperparameters as those in gibbs et al 2008 and gibbs et al 2010 although the number of hyperparameters to be determined may be a weakness of eas many metaheuristic algorithms i e ant colony optimization particle swarm optimization simulated annealing and machine learning algorithms share this shortcoming as noted at the end of section 4 1 a number of tools developed in computer science are being developed to automate the hyperparameter optimization problem feurer et al 2015 4 4 multiobjective machine learning an opportunity of eas in species distribution modelling is their potential use as multiobjective machine learning methods which aim to train a model based on multiple potentially conflicting objectives typically the purpose of species distribution modelling is to train models which estimate species presence and absence well in many cases it is desired for instance in decision management to give a higher weight to one or the other mouton et al 2009 a number of evaluation criteria based on the classification of the occurrence probability e g cohen s kappa or true skill statistics are being used to pool the degree of correct estimation of species presence and absence mouton et al 2010 unfortunately these evaluation measures depend on sample prevalence consequently training models with these data having varying sample prevalence are biased a pragmatic approach to solve this issue is to keep sample prevalence equal over all data samples and or to define a trade off between commission and omission errors in the objective function allouche et al 2006 manel et al 2001 mouton et al 2010 the trade off between omission and commission errors can be viewed as a multiobjective problem eas have proven to be adequate techniques to identify trade offs between objectives penn et al 2013 sweetapple et al 2014 in general eas can be used to determine the entire set of pareto optimal solutions or at least a representative subset a pareto optimal set is a set of solutions that are nondominated when compared with other solutions of the solution space deb et al 2000 for example for species distribution modelling a pareto optimal set could be a set of equally valid solutions to a problem presenting the trade off between commission and omission errors this way decision makers obtain a set of solutions that can be very valuable for different aspects of ecosystem decision management guisan et al 2013 a well known example of a multiobjective optimizer using an ea is the non dominated sorting ga ii of deb et al 2000 in this algorithm a simple ga with uniform crossover and mutation but with specific selection operators is used for the selection operator different nondominant fronts are identified these nondominant fronts are estimates of the pareto front defined by two or more objectives the chromosomes in each non dominant front have the same assigned dummy fitness value ranked according to the strength of the front these dummy fitness values are used to select chromosomes deb et al 2000 this process is repeated until a nondominant front equal or close to the pareto optimal front is found an example of the use of the non dominated sorting ga ii in ecology is presented by côté et al 2007 5 recommendations for application eas and other metaheuristic algorithms are particularly useful to solve problems such as feature selection parametrisation of complex models and optimization of other learning algorithms these algorithms are likely not suited to solve every problem as the development of a specific ea will require high investment costs in terms of programming and algorithm understanding returning little improvement in model insight and predictive performance in these cases the use of machine learning methods such as decision trees glms or maxent would be more appropriate however we recommend to consider eas when the problem at hand has one of the following characteristics the problem and search for a solution is expected to be complex e g includes species interactions or many features and little information is available to a priori reduce complexity see for example kissling et al 2012 many complex boundaries can be formulated for the problem these could for instance be obtained from experts or ecological databases verberk et al 2012 solutions to the problem are required to be transparent and flexible for model re analysis for instance for decision management adriaenssens et al 2004 the input data set has a high number of features and manual feature reduction is no longer possible e g pesticide database of river sediment in flanders counts more than 200 identified pesticides vmm 2018 the model knows many parameters which have to be calibrated van broekhoven et al 2007 a trade off between objective functions is required for decision management applications this can for instance be the trade off between model complexity and performance or between the correct estimation of species presence and absence for a specific problem one can select from a number of ea implementations in table 4 a suggestion for the type of ea are provided for a number of problems two trivial problems are listed parameter estimation and feature selection see row one and two whereas other applications are less obvious and often problem specific implementations for the calibration of parameter rich models 10 parameters a binary or real ga encoded can be used since both are expected to perform equally well van broekhoven et al 2007 the second case involves the reduction of the number of input features with the help of eas typically this applies to data sets for which a large number of potential input variables can explain species occurrence this type of learning could be particularly interesting when remote sensing products are used in order to reduce the amount of input data required to estimate species distributions from spatial input data hampton et al 2013 automated variable selection with eas can be helpful to steer model development but as noted by araújo and guisan 2006 this should not replace a selection based on expert knowledge in the case of feature selection a binary encoded ga is implemented encoding the in or exclusion of input features d heygere et al 2006 this feature selection can be helpful for the optimization of stacked sdms or population based sdms in these sdms models for different species are coupled with each other guisan and rahbek 2011 and are allowed to interact with the number of species considered in these stacked sdms the number of model elements increases exponentially due to one on one interaction binary gas can be used to simplify these models preventing an overly complex model to be fitted to a limited number of species occurrence observations in addition binary gas can be used to optimize artificial neural networks in this case different layers or neurons can be implemented in the binary string and the structure of the ann can be optimized see muñoz mas et al 2017 for simple binary and real coded gas a selection rate of 0 5 a crossover rate above 0 8 mutation rate lower than 0 2 and 100 generations will in general work well when the number of chromosomes is between 30 and 200 independent of the chromosome length gibbs et al 2008 and table 2 for the choice of the selection operator we advise using tournament or roulette wheel selection both are simple to understand and generally give satisfying results when compared to other selection operators goldberg and deb 1991 the use of elitism is advised however it is important to note that the use of elitism can decrease the population diversity and facilitate faster convergence the need for fast convergence motivated by limited available computation resources can be an important boundary condition in choosing the number of model evaluations this number is determined by the number of chromosomes multiplied by a number of generations a limited number of model evaluations 400 and 2500 have been used and have presumably led to satisfying results increasing the number of evaluations can be useful however it is possible that gains in accuracy or precision are marginal as discussed by gibbs et al 2008 the number of evaluations should vary as a function of the available computational resources as a rule of thumb we advise to focus on a cross validation resampling strategy and on repeated execution of the ea cross validation strategy to increase robustness rather than employing a larger number of model evaluations users are advised to consider stratification according to sample prevalence to a design cross validation strategy as discussed above accuracy measures can vary as a function of this prevalence to make results comparable it is of importance that data are stratified according to this prevalence the choice for a number of folds and repetitions will depend on the available computation resources and the size of the data set precision will increase with a higher number of repetitions and folds leading to a longer runtime when data sets are small and models are learned fast a higher number is thus preferred in contrast when learning is slow one can opt to choose fewer folds and repetitions kohavi 1995 as discussed above one can also consider lowering the number of function evaluations when further fine tuning of the hyperparameters is desired we recommend using the guidelines of gibbs et al 2008 as every specific problem can have a unique set of optimal hyperparameters the choice of the objective function which the ga has to optimize depends on the study objectives does one aim to estimate species presence well or rather absence if the former is true than a higher weight should be given to sensitivity in the case of the latter specificity see table 3 in case a trade off between both should be identified one can consider a multi objective ea in these algorithms a specific selection operator is implemented in the ga to weight different objectives see for example the non dominated sort in nsga ii deb et al 2002 three main points need to be taken into account when machine learning or other algorithms are considered to solve a hypothesis first specifying the model and its structural component the subject of model training and the objective of the model and the study see box 3 is important guisan and zimmermann 2000 for example is the aim of the model to understand a specific theoretical assumption about species interaction or is the aim to develop a predictive model for estimating species occurrence in an ecosystem with many interactions in a second step an algorithm to train the model s needs to be selected box 3 second part specifically algorithm operators problem encoding and operators need to be defined here it is important to make a distinction between algorithms which make use of explicit encoding eas ant colony optimization and those which do not decision trees glms it is empirically found that algorithms making use of encoding work well to train models with hypotheses embedded in the model structure maier et al 2014 the initial choice for a type of algorithm and use of encoding will hence determine the choice for hyperparameters and operators finally a platform to implement the approach for the machine learning application is required gui packages can be used however adopting these packages can considerably limit the options which make eas interesting in the first place for that reason we advise to use a high level scripting language such as python or r and search for existing codes implemented in these languages an additional advantage of using high level scripting languages for machine learning applications is their transferability to high performance and cloud computing infrastructure preferably the scripting is done in an open science context allowing for continuous code improvement and validation through modular scripting for a good introduction on modular scripting applied to ecology we refer to golding et al 2017 typically open science is performed on code sharing platforms such as github https github com 6 future perspectives and conclusions recent advances in theoretical ecology leibold et al 2004 and conceptual modelling guisan and rahbek 2011 are challenging scientists to continuously develop new ways to deal with this increasing complexity the field of machine learning has proven to be useful to tackle these questions despite that researchers are struggling to identify the appropriate approach to address increasing complexity kissling et al 2012 maxent is currently the most used technique to model species distributions when considering terrestrial cases for freshwater system case studies innovative methods such as artificial neural networks and eas are increasingly being used to solve less straightforward problems model developers will be required to deal with this increased complexity preferably in an open science context this depicts full transparency in the methodology but also the practical encoding golding et al 2017 phillips et al 2017 in addition it requires the developed algorithms to be easily transferable and adaptable to new problems considering these aspects eas and other metaheuristic algorithms are found to be of particular use since they split the training process from the objective function evaluation model run in addition eas allow dealing with complex cases eiben and smith 2015 making them appropriate candidates to train the next generation of species distribution models dealing with hyperparameters optimization and the requirement of programming and modelling skills are considered disadvantageous hindering the use of eas and other metaheuristic algorithms for the first hyperparameter optimization methods are already available giving satisfying results for multiple problems gibbs et al 2008 gobeyn et al 2017 the second the need for modelling know how will require standardization documentation and refinement of the algorithm development and application process jakeman et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 going hand in hand with the philosophy of open science in this review paper a number of suggestions with respect to the definition of the model algorithm and implementation are given with this we aim to stimulate ecologists to use and further refine the development of eas applied to species distribution modelling hypothesis testing and preferably ecology in general as technological advances in machine learning are reshaping the way scientist develop models and analyse data researches are increasingly aware that one specific algorithm won t offer a tailor made solution to every problem chatfield 1993 with this synthesis an insight is presented on how to use eas as a technique to solve specific problems in ecology rather than using it as a ready to use technology to map species distributions author contribution s g a m m a f c m v and p l m g
