7785,study region forty one river basins in brazil and neighboring countries in south america study focus in large river basins on countrywide or continental scales it is often difficult to have consistent and accurate long time series of spatially distributed precipitation data available however these are needed to calibrate hydrological models and to run hydrological simulations continuously in real time streamflow forecasting in this study we assess two real time precipitation products based on rain gauges and satellite data trmm merge and cpc noaa for their use in streamflow forecasting in the hydropower sector in brazil to take advantage of each precipitation data source and derive a unique dataset a methodology is proposed to combine extend and validate the datasets we consider the discharges at the river basin outlets as an independent and robust reference for hydrological applications observed discharges are used to quantify precipitation uncertainties and to weight the blending while discharges obtained from hydrological modeling are used to validate the final precipitation product new hydrological insights for the region the proposed blending method which uses the uncertainty of the original datasets to define the weighting factors was efficient in generating a precipitation product that performs better than each dataset separately when used to force a hydrological model the use of the double mass curve correlation to extend the time series of the datasets beyond their common period allowed us to produce long time series of precipitation for south american basins and hydrological applications the study shows that it is possible to rely on river discharge data and hydrological modeling to select and combine different precipitation products in the region and presents a step by step methodology to do so keywords precipitation hydrological model data uncertainty trmm merge cpc noaa data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction time series of quantitative precipitation estimates is crucial for calibrating and running hydrological models to be used in research and operational applications such as water resource management irrigation planning hydropower operations and forecasting of floods and droughts however in large river basins or on countrywide and continental scales it is often difficult to have consistent and accurate time series of spatially distributed precipitation data available over a long period of time precipitation is one of the climate variables most difficult to estimate because of its heterogeneous distribution in space and high variability in time herold et al 2015 it is also susceptible to measurement errors caused by wind evaporation wetting splashing and drifting effects and human errors such as uncalibrated gauge equipment acquisition and data communication problems michelson 2004 therefore it is a major challenge to produce consistent precipitation products in space and time over large areas and long periods especially if such products should be continuously used in real time operations in hydrology golding 2009 kucera et al 2013 pozzi et al 2013 serrat capdevila et al 2013 verkade et al 2013 lettenmaier et al 2015 van osnabrugge et al 2017 the main sources of precipitation data are ground based gauges weather radars and satellite instruments gilewski and nawalany 2018 the first two sources mentioned are more accurate but they are not uniformly available over large areas such as south america satellite data emerge as a potential source of precipitation information in this context given their capacity to cover large areas and provide continuous space time data they are however less accurate and need to be bias corrected cassalho et al 2020 the main sensors used to estimate precipitation are passive microwave calibrated infrared and a combination of them hong et al 2018 with the evolution of sensors active microwave sensors have been added to the satellites over time such as the ku band cloud profiling radar dpr on the trmm satellite simpson et al 1988 the w band cloud profiling radar on the cloudsat y chen et al 2008 m chen et al 2008b and ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar dpr on the gpm satellites huffman et al 2017 several algorithms have been developed to extract precipitation information from this constellation of satellites ranging from the simplest ir based goes precipitation index gpi arkin and meisner 1987 to the most recent and sophisticated nasa gpm global precipitation measurements integrated multi satellite retrievals imerge huffman et al 2017 on a global scale gridded precipitation products have been available since the late 1990 s huffman et al 1997 adler et al 2003 sun et al 2017 beck et al 2017 however only a few are produced in near real time such as the cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation from the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa y chen et al 2008 m chen et al 2008 and the imerg for gpm dataset from the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa huffman et al 2017 which is the successor of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm data products for south america the trmm merge product was developed by the brazilian centre for weather forecast and climatic studies centro de previsão de tempo e estudos climáticos cptec and made available for near real time applications rozante et al 2010 it combines gauging station datasets from the global telecommunications system automatic stations from various agencies in south america and the near real time trmm precipitation product to provide a gridded dataset of daily precipitation at 0 25 of spatial resolution for operational applications when trmm was discontinued the product gpm merge was built with the gpm dataset based on the imerg e algorithm the substitute of tmpa v7 in the trmm mission it maintains the same gauge stations and the algorithm merge rozante et al 2010 although it presents a higher spatial resolution of 0 1 rozante et al 2018 2020 when different precipitation products are available over an area the question arises whether it would be better to select one product or combine different products beck et al 2017 investigated 22 gridded global and tropical precipitation datasets and concluded that the product that merged all information available the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswepv1 0 had better overall performance recently reis et al 2019 carried out a study comparing the cpc noaa and trmm merge real time precipitation datasets over 41 river basins mostly located in brazil the authors found considerable differences in space and time between these two datasets with a tendency to increase differences when moving from south to north and from east to west for the majority of the studied river basins the recent decade of data 2008 2017 presented the biggest differences in terms of areal precipitation over the river basins the authors also highlighted the fact that the differences between the precipitation datasets were propagated and often amplified in simulated streamflow when used to force a hydrological rainfall runoff model hydrological data and models can be useful tools for analyzing precipitation datasets by comparing simulated and observed streamflows the quality of a precipitation dataset used as forcing for the model can be indirectly assessed and the uncertainties evaluated this strategy has been used in numerous previous studies to evaluate the quality of precipitation datasets at regional or global scales e g su et al 2008 collischonn et al 2008 voisin et al 2008 bitew et al 2012 li et al 2013 falck et al 2015 tang et al 2016 beck et al 2017 hong et al 2021 overall the studies indicate that once there are better estimates of observed flow than precipitation the use of hydrological modeling can help in validating the precipitation data direct empirical comparisons between rainfall and streamflow can be useful to evaluate rainfall datasets across multiple scales but also to identify and quantify the magnitude of the uncertainty in the datasets used in hydrological modeling levy et al 2017 based on the water balance equation and assuming that a catchment hydrologically behaves like a reservoir system it is possible to invert the reservoir model equation and express the rainfall as a function of the streamflow and then use this relationship to estimate the uncertainty of the rainfall data kirchner 2009 henn 2015 hydrological models can also be used to define and evaluate the best combination of multiple precipitation data sources the mswep product is an example of a combined product that uses river discharge observations from stations across the globe and hydrological simulations to correct systematic terrestrial precipitation biases beck et al 2017 it is a fully global historic precipitation dataset available since 1979 http www gloh2o org mswep it is based on data from gauge stations satellite remote sensing and atmospheric model reanalysis the hydrological model used to evaluate the performance of the mswep product and compare it with other state of the art gauge adjusted datasets i e wfdei cru gpcp 1dd tmpa 3b42 and cpc unified was the hbv model bergström 1995 flow simulations using mswep showed better performance median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 52 than simulations with the other precipitation datasets nse values of 0 29 0 39 the median correlation obtained when using the mwsep product was the best correlation for 60 of independent precipitation gauges from fluxnet tower stations used for validation for more details see beck et al 2017 recently siqueira et al 2018 applied the mswep v1 1 precipitation product with the distributed mgb hydrological model over south america to simulate streamflows they reported good overall performance of the simulations with nse 0 6 in 55 of the flow stations the performance was better in large rivers and wet regions decreasing in drier climates where timing errors in rivers with floodplain effects had been reported to merge different precipitation products in a unique product wong et al 2021 propose a methodological framework that relies on the streamflow response to precipitation it uses a hydrological model to identify locally at the sub sub basin scale the best product among several gridded precipitation products satellite derived and model reanalysis product the authors use precipitation gauge stations available to first evaluate the quality of each precipitation dataset and to assess the overall performance of the hydrological model in each streamflow station the best product is locally selected according to the performance of the hydrological simulations evaluated at discharge gauging locations the canadian hydrologic land surface model h lsm mesh was used to generate a composite precipitation dataset in the saskatchewan river basin in canada which was then validated by assessing hydrological fluxes and storage at downstream gauge stations in many parts of the world precipitation ground data are not available or networks are too scarce to be used in the validation of gridded precipitation products reliable and consistent long time series of spatially distributed precipitation over large areas are however needed for many applications including climatological assessments and seasonal streamflow forecasting they are used to calibrate the hydrological models warmup the flow forecasting models bias correct numerical weather forecasts and apply the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method which relies on historic precipitation and temperature data as future possible climate scenarios crochemore et al 2016 bennett et al 2017 arnal et al 2017 harrigan et al 2018 in flow forecasting applications these datasets also must be available in real time or near real time to allow operational decision making in brazil gridded large scale precipitation products are of particular importance to the real time operations of the hydropower sector schwanenberg et al 2015 gibertoni et al 2017 the anticipation of hydrological conditions can strongly influence the centralized operation of the electrical system and energy prices ons 2016 given this regional context this paper aims to present a methodology that uses a hydrological model and observed discharge time series to quantify uncertainties from the trmm merge and cpc precipitation datasets combine the datasets and derive a unique precipitation dataset that can be used in near real time applications the novelty of our approach lies on using both observed and simulated discharge data at the outlet of the river basins to take advantage of the information contained in each precipitation product and derive a unique dataset observed discharges are used to quantify precipitation uncertainties and to weight the blending while discharges obtained from hydrological modeling are used to validate the final precipitation product therefore instead of using a reference ground or remote sensed precipitation dataset which might also contain errors in the precipitation estimates we use the discharges at the river basin outlets as an independent and more robust reference for hydrological applications at the catchment scale in addition this paper presents the validation of the methodology over a large set of catchments 41 river basins covering a large area of south america this paper addresses the following questions i how can we use hydrological data and hydrological modeling to blend different observed precipitation datasets and validate the combined product in order to have better precipitation data for hydrological simulation and flow forecasting ii how can we extend the combined precipitation product over a period other than the common period of the different observed precipitation time series to foster its use in near real time applications this paper illustrates how we can use hydrological data and modeling as a tool to quantify the uncertainty of precipitation estimates combine different datasets and validate the combined product with the final goal of obtaining a precipitation product relevant to near real time hydrological applications our methodology is applied to a large set of 41 river basins that are relevant to the hydropower sector in brazil and neighboring countries the trmm merge and cpc precipitation datasets are used to generate a combined precipitation product the dataset obtained is compared with the benchmark mswep and evaluated in terms of how hydrological simulations compare with observed discharges in section 2 the methodology and data used are presented in section 3 the results obtained are provided section 4 is a discussion of the results and the conclusions and planned future studies are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study area comprises 41 river basins distributed in different climatic regions within brazil and neighboring countries fig 1 the river basins vary in size with areas ranging from 9300 to 382 000 km² the study area extends from the north jari river madeira river xingu river tapajos river tocantins river and others to the south of brazil iguaçu river uruguay river and others and includes river basins located in the central part of the country paraná river grande river são francisco river etc the 41 river basins provide inflow to 30 hydropower plants hpps for each river basin daily areal precipitation was obtained from the trmm merge the cpc noaa and the mswep datasets table 1 daily areal precipitation time series were calculated using the shape file of the basins and averaging all grid data points falling inside each river basin considered daily discharge data were obtained from the ons national operator of the electric system downloaded from https sintegre ons org br they correspond to the official hpp natural flow time series and are compiled annually by the national operator in some cases it is the ons that takes into account the regularization effects of the reservoirs and adds their evaporation as well as any water uses to obtain the natural flows of the reservoir in these cases the flows are also validated by the electricity generators involved in the process for more details see ons 2005 data availability depends on each river basin for this study the discharge dataset used covers the period 1979 2018 for all studied river basins 2 2 methodological steps to select a better real time precipitation dataset among the two available independent data sources and a dataset that is a combination of the two and to validate the selection and blending procedure using a hydrological model and observed streamflow an experiment was designed with six basic methodological steps step 1 for each river basin the daily areal precipitation time series average over the area of the river basin is estimated for each precipitation data source the daily observed flow data are extracted for the same period at each basin in addition the total annual precipitation and the annual mean of observed daily flows are calculated to perform the analysis based on the water balance relationship step 2 step 2 the uncertainty of each precipitation data source is identified and quantified by using empirical functions that relate the total annual precipitation amounts and the observed annual mean flows the weights used to build the combined daily precipitation dataset are obtained based on the uncertainty quantified from the annual water balance as detailed in section 2 3 step 3 since the two independent precipitation data sources cover different time periods a procedure is used to extend the combined precipitation dataset over the longest period using the double mass curve as described in section 2 4 step 4 for each daily precipitation dataset the two independent sets and the combined one the hydrological model is calibrated at each river basin by first applying the traditional split sample test which divides the time series october 1998 to september 2017 into two periods for calibration and validation this allows to assess the robustness of the model when simulating streamflows over a period independent of the calibration period we also apply the calibration procedure over the entire data period to evaluate how the parameters of the model change with the length of the time period used for calibration this step is detailed in section 2 5 step 5 for each precipitation dataset and river basin the daily flows simulated by the hydrological model with parameters calibrated over the entire data period are evaluated against the observed flows at the outlet of the basin we use a variety of performance metrics as described in section 2 6 step 6 the extended combined precipitation dataset is evaluated against a benchmark of observed precipitation and simulated discharges using the new dataset are evaluated against observed discharges 2 3 combining two precipitation data sources using the annual water balance the water balance equation is used in hydrology to describe the flow of water in and out of a system the period used to calculate the water balance is usually the hydrological year which is a 12 month period that starts at the end of the dry season for any given year the water balance in a river basin with no external inflows from neighboring catchments can be written as 1 s p i q et where p i is the annual precipitation for the given year total precipitation over the hydrological year of the precipitation data source i q is the annual mean flow et is the annual evapotranspiration and s is the annual variation of storage in the river basin with all variables expressed in millimeters for long term averages here calculated over the hydrological year the change in storage s for an annual time step is marginal and can be considered equal to zero shao et al 2012 beck et al 2020 the et term depends on physical factors such as the vegetation type soil cover and land use as well as on climate factors such as temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed as considered in the penman monteith method used to calculate evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 therefore this term can be considered independent of the precipitation data source that is used in eq 1 in our study we are not trying to evaluate the different components of the hydrological balance but instead we want to capture how the uncertainty varies when we consider different precipitation sources in the same river basin eq 1 can then be simplified and the precipitation can be written as a function of the flow and the error term that will translate the uncertainties 2 p i f q ε i where f q is the empirical function between the annual precipitation in millimeters and the annual flow in millimeters and ε i is the annual error associated with the precipitation source p i the error ε i is evaluated for each given year using the empirical function that relates each annual precipitation p i to the annual flow q the evaluation is based on the standard deviation of the errors of each precipitation source p i and is computed over the time series of annual errors the standard deviation estimates obtained were used to weight the proportion of each precipitation data source to create a combined precipitation dataset the weights were based on the proportion of the standard deviation of the errors of one source with respect to the sum of standard deviations of the errors of both sources the weights were obtained from the following equations 3 w j 1 σ ε j σ ε j σ ε k 4 w k 1 w j where w j is the weight of the precipitation data source p i j w k is the weight of the precipitation data source p i k σ ε j is the standard deviation of the annual errors of p i j and σ ε k is the standard deviation of the annual errors of source p i k at each basin the main idea behind this methodology is not to identify the precipitation data source that displays the best correlation between p i and q the goal is to access the uncertainty of each source to make it possible to give a higher weight to the source with smaller uncertainty when the two sources of precipitation data are combined in one unique dataset once the weights of each precipitation data source are obtained they are applied to the daily precipitation time series to generate the combined daily precipitation dataset at each basin according to eq 5 5 dp wc dp j w j dp k w k where d p wc is the daily precipitation of the weighted combination of the two precipitation data sources dp j and dp k 2 4 double mass curve method to extend the combined precipitation dataset once the combined precipitation method is applied to the two different precipitation data sources a combined precipitation dataset for the same period of the shorter precipitation data source is obtained it is thus necessary to extend in a consistent way this combined precipitation time series to also cover the period of the longer available data source in this study the double mass curve method developed by the us geological survey was used searcy et al 1960 the method is commonly used in data analyses to check the consistency of hydrometeorological data and adjust the data for any inconsistencies it is based on comparing the time series of accumulated values at a single data station or a given data source with those given by data from other stations in a surrounding area or other data sources during the same period the theory of the double mass curve is based on the fact that a graph of the accumulation of one time series against the accumulation of another time series during the same period plots as a straight line as long as the data are proportional the slope of the line represents the constant of proportionality b between them applied to this study it gives eq 6 6 p c p k b where p c represents the precipitation variable of the combined precipitation dataset and p k is the precipitation variable coming from the longer time series of the two sources of precipitation used to produce the combined dataset a break in the slope of eq 6 indicates a change in the constant of proportion and the presence of inconsistencies in this study the double mass curve was applied to annual values of total precipitation as follows for each river basin for the common period of trmm merge and cpc noaa data i e 1998 2017 the graph of accumulated annual values of the combined dataset is plotted against the graph of the cpc noaa dataset which is the longer precipitation dataset the years with a wide discrepancy around the normal tendency are removed with the objective of having the most representative parameter to extend the time series the constant of proportionality obtained with this correlation is used to multiply the past period of the longer data source obtaining thus a complete time series of daily precipitation back until 1979 in order to represent the extension of the combined precipitation dataset to compare the combined precipitation dataset with the benchmark precipitation mswep dataset and to evaluate how the dispersion of the error varies in time the standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors observed precipitation minus the value calculated with the empirical functions of eq 2 were calculated for 1980 2014 full hydrological years of the benchmark data available in a five year moving window to improve the analysis and avoid scale distortions caused by differences in wetter or drier years between mswep and the combined precipitation dataset the standard deviation error was normalized by dividing its value by the average precipitation of each five year window 2 5 hec hms hydrological modeling and flow analyses to validate the combined precipitation dataset obtained a hydrological model was used to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated discharges when this dataset drives the model the hydrological model used in this study is the one proposed in the suite of the hec hms model feldman 2000 it is a flexible and user friendly suite of models that can be used for many hydrological applications such as urban and rural flooding flood warning systems water uses planning etc the models can be applied to simulate a single flow event or to perform continuous hydrological simulations in a semi distributed modeling configuration the modules can be chosen according to the needs of the user the application envisaged and the expected accuracy feldman 2000 najim 2013 users can for instance select specific modules of the loss method the transformation method and the base flow method scharffenberg 2016 in this study the hec hms modeling framework was run for continuous simulations at the daily time step the interception was modeled using the simple canopy bennett 1998 and the simple surface bennett 1998 methods the excess of precipitation arrives on the soil and is captured until the storage capacity of the surface is filled and then runoff starts the water in the surface will then infiltrate into the soil the soil moisture accounting method is the unique module in the framework able to run a continuous simulation it uses three layers to represent the dynamics of the water movement in the soil for a given precipitation and evapotranspiration it computes the basin s surface runoff groundwater flow losses and the deep percolation over the entire basin bennett 1998 the clark unit hydrograph was used to incorporate the translation of runoff through time within the basin and the attenuation of runoff through storage in a linear reservoir its principal parameters are the time of concentration defining the travel time in the sub basin and the storage coefficient kull and feldman 1998 the linear reservoir method kull and feldman 1998 was used to represent the base flow it uses a linear reservoir to model the recession of the base flow after a storm event using the principles of conservation of mass the lateral outflow of the groundwater is connected with the infiltration from the soil moisture accounting loss method for the routing the lag method or the muskingum cunge routing method were used depending on the complexity of the basin and the extension of the river reach the split sample approach klemes 1986 was used to calibrate the hydrological model and test its robustness validation each time series is split into two and both parts are used for calibration and validation the results in terms of model performance are evaluated for the two validation periods and compared with the performance results obtained over the same periods but with the calibration based on the complete period the main objective of these various calibration and validation periods is to verify that the calibration of the total period which is used in the next steps is robust and has equivalent performance to that of the split sample approach fig 2 illustrates the approach used and the different calibration and validation periods of the hec hms hydrological model the model was calibrated using a daily time step and for each source of precipitation separately large basins with different climatic characteristics across space were divided in sub basins to better capture differences in precipitation and produce a better rainfall runoff transformation in total there are 26 parameters to be calibrated in the hec hms model the parameters that have a stronger influence on the model outputs are the time of concentration and the storage coefficient which are linked to the clark unit hydrograph module the maximum infiltration rate the soil total storage the soil tension storage and the maximum soil percolation rate which are linked to the loss module an initial manual calibration was performed to obtain the first parameters set then the automatic calibration procedure available in the hec hms model was applied to obtain the optimal parameters using the univariate gradient search algorithm the objective function used for the clark unit hydrograph parameters was the minimum of peak weighted rms error and for the loss parameters the minimum sum of squared residuals diskin and simon 1977 since the objective functions are more sensitive to the volumes and peaks of the hydrographs it is sometimes necessary to adjust the base flow parameters to have a better fit of the recession of the hydrographs after running the model optimization the calibration process is repeated three times for each calibration period fig 2 for each precipitation data source and for the combined precipitation dataset and for each river basin 2 6 evaluation metrics to analyze the performance of the hydrological models run in this study hec hms model calibrated with the different observed precipitation datasets the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the mean absolute error mae and the r² coefficient of determination were used as performance indicators these metrics are used to compare the daily simulated flows with the daily observed flows they were evaluated for the calibration independent time periods defined in fig 2 october 1998 to september 2008 october 2008 to september 2017 in our evaluation the performance indicators obtained for the validation periods 1 and 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model at each river basin the performance obtained during the total calibration period was used to define the best precipitation data source for each river basin nse measures how good the results of the model are compared with the mean observed discharge values equal to 1 indicate a perfect fit and values smaller than zero indicate that the mean discharge is a better predictor than the hydrological model 7 nse 1 i 1 n y i sim y i obs 2 i 1 n y i obs y obs 2 where y i sim is the simulated value at time step i y i obs is the observed value at time step i y obs is the mean of the observed value and n is the number of time steps kge provides a decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency analysis values close to 1 indicate a more accurate model 8 kge 1 r 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 where in the first part r is the linear

third part a bias term σ sim is the standard deviation of the simulations and σ obs is the standard deviation of the observations mae gives the average deviation between the simulated and the observed

same as in eq 7 3 results 3 1 standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors fig 3 shows the boxplot distribution of the standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors ε i from eq 2 obtained from the two sources of precipitation data and the combined precipitation dataset the standard deviation values were evaluated over all 41 river basins and 19 years of data october 1998 september 2017 and the linear function was the best fit in all basins which makes sense since the annual water balance was represented by a linear function in eq 1 the standard deviation of annual precipitation errors from the benchmark mswep dataset for all river basins and the period from 1998 to 2017 is also shown as reference table 2 shows the results for each river basin as well as the weights applied when combining the two precipitation data sources the dispersion of the annual precipitation errors is reduced when the different precipitation data sources are combined the combined precipitation dataset shows a lower standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors than the original datasets on 15 out of 41 river basins and its boxplot distribution is closer to the reference mswep dataset although the median value of the error standard deviation is close to the trmm merge dataset median value the interquartile range between the 75th and 25th percentiles is smaller in the combined dataset this measure of dispersion of the precipitation errors around the empirical function gives an idea of the uncertainty of each precipitation dataset in the combined dataset more weight is given to the precipitation dataset with lower uncertainty in table 2 we can see that the trmm merge dataset has more weight than the cpc dataset in 30 out of 41 river basins and both have equal weight in 2 river basins 3 2 hydrological model performance the three precipitation datasets trmm merge cpc and combined were used to calibrate and validate the hec hms hydrological model in all 41 river basins fig 4 shows the density functions representing the distribution of the four performance metrics analyzed kge nse mae calculated in terms of specific discharge in l s km² to permit comparison of the values in basins with different sizes and r² the values obtained in calibration validation are in red blue table 3 shows the median values of the metrics when considering all river basins calibration and validation periods as defined in fig 2 and for each precipitation dataset for most of the basins the difference in performance metrics between calibration and validation is less than 10 the calibrated models can be considered to perform well over the large river basin dataset of this study for most of the 41 river basins the nse and kge criteria are higher than 0 60 and the r2 coefficient is higher than 0 55 table 3 shows that median values of nse and kge vary from 0 71 to 0 81 in calibration and from 0 68 to 0 78 in validation median values of r2 coefficient in calibration and validation are also very close these results indicate that the model calibration is sufficiently robust to represent the characteristics of the basins in different periods fig 5 also shows that the combined dataset results in a more consistent calibration and validation performance with sharper curves and fewer outliers of performance the combined dataset is also the one that presents the highest median values of nse kge and r2 and the lowest median values of mae table 3 these results can also be another indicator of the robustness and good performance of the combined precipitation dataset 3 3 selection of the best precipitation dataset after the evaluation and validation of the performance of the hydrological model for each river basin the best performing precipitation dataset was evaluated in terms of simulated discharges the simulations were made using the model with parameters calibrated with each precipitation dataset and over the entire period october 1998 september 2017 fig 5 shows the mae kge nse and r² performance metrics obtained for the 41 river basins and the three sources of precipitation data trmm merge cpc and the combined precipitation dataset in general the simulated discharges using the cpc precipitation dataset clearly performed worse for the four indicators analyzed the simulated discharges using the combined precipitation dataset performs best for almost all basins when the scores are not the best for this dataset in a river basin the differences are less than 10 in the majority of the cases not shown the best performance of the combined dataset is clearly shown with the nse mae and r² criteria in terms of the kge criterion 50 of the river basins present values higher than 0 79 when using the combined and the trmm merge precipitation datasets there are small differences in kge between these two datasets although the use of the combined dataset resulted in fewer outliers in terms of performance and notably less river basins with low values of kge for individual river basins showing the lowest values of kge with the combined dataset the differences regarding the kge with the trmm merge are lower than 8 3 4 extension of the combined precipitation dataset once the evaluation showed that the combined precipitation of the two precipitation data sources achieved the best performance over the common period of data october 1998 september 2017 the next step was to use the double mass procedure section 2 4 to extend the combined dataset the correlation of the double mass curve between the longest dataset cpc and the combined dataset was used to extend the period of the combined dataset until 1979 first year of data available in the longest cpc dataset to validate the extended dataset obtained the hydrological models were run for each river basin with parameters calibrated for the period 1998 2017 the performance of the streamflow simulations of this recent period was compared with the performance of the simulations obtained over the extended validation period of 1979 1997 fig 6 shows the distribution of streamflow performance metrics mae nse and r2 over the 41 river basins of this study in terms of accuracy of the streamflow simulations mae the average error for the extended validation period 1979 1998 is slightly lower than the average error of the recent calibration period 1998 2017 considering the nse criterion the extended period has on average better performance higher nse values than the recent period for the r² correlation the values obtained over the extended period are clearly higher than the values obtained over the recent period these results validate the extension of the combined precipitation dataset in terms of its ability to provide streamflow simulations in the extended earlier period that match the observed streamflows as well as in the more recent period of the combined precipitation dataset 3 5 comparison of the combined precipitation dataset with the benchmark the combined precipitation dataset was evaluated against the benchmark mswep dataset fig 7 shows the evolution in time of the normalized standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors obtained for 1980 2017 in a five year moving window the thickest lines represent the median of the values for all river basins and the shadowed areas show the 25th and 75th percentiles variability among river basins the extended period of the combined precipitation before 1998 tends to have a behavior closer to the benchmark it shows similar standard deviation of annual precipitation errors but higher values median values are closer to 6 versus median values closer to 5 for the benchmark the combined precipitation dataset does not exhibit a visible temporal trend however the standard deviation of the precipitation errors decreases after the year 2000 to increase again just a few years later the standard deviation of the mwsep annual precipitation errors is smaller and more stable over time comparatively to the combined precipitation dataset it also shows less variability among river basins after around 1998 there is a reduction in the mswep error standard deviation probably due to the use of satellite observations to improve the estimates of precipitation after 2008 median values tend to increase again to values similar to those before 1998 although the variability among river basins remain reduced when the entire period 1980 2017 is considered the combined precipitation dataset has a higher median and variability among river basins than the benchmark but the difference can be considered small especially considering that the combined precipitation is a real time dataset subject to errors that might be corrected afterwards and the level of consistency is not comparable to a reanalysis dataset such as mswep in terms of spatial distribution of the errors there is no evidence of a pattern or regions with a clear higher normalized standard deviation of the errors not shown for almost all basins the combined precipitation dataset displays values between 4 and 9 only a few basins have values higher than 11 and they are not concentrated in the same region 3 6 examples of simulated hydrographs using the combined precipitation dataset as showed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the combined precipitation dataset displayed good performance for the period used to build it from the two existing data sources i e 1998 2017 with nse and kge values above 0 75 fig 8 shows three examples of the simulated flows using the combined precipitation dataset for the complete period generated from this study i e from october 1st 1979 to september 30th 2021 three river basins were selected to represent the southern region hpp foz do chapecó at the uruguai river the southeast region hpp emborcação at the paranaíba river and the north region hpp santo antônio at the madeira river in the southern region the weather does not present a clear seasonality and peaks of flow may occur in any month of the year the simulated flows tend to underestimate the highest peaks and overestimate the lowest flows nse 0 78 in the southeast region seasonality is present and the wet season is from november to march the simulated flows tend to overestimate the flow peaks for the period 1983 1993 and underestimate them for 2005 2010 despite these tendencies this river basin also presents a good statistical fit with nse value of 0 76 in the north region the biggest basin of our dataset is shown a clear seasonality is observed with the wet season from december to may the simulated flows display an overall better and more stable performance with a good fit to flow peaks and flow recession periods nse 0 87 4 discussion this study proposes a methodology that allows us to combine extend and validate two precipitation datasets based on precipitation gauges and satellite based products cpc and trmm merge by using observed and simulated discharges at river basin outlets by relying on discharge data and hydrological modeling to process the global gridded precipitation products it provides a framework that can be applied in particular in large areas where ground networks of rain gauges often considered as the most accurate source of precipitation information is not reliable or dense enough for hydrological applications we tested and validated the approach over 41 river basins in brazil and neighboring countries basin sizes ranging from 9300 km² to 382 000 km² this study area has a continental dimension exhibiting diverse patterns of weather and climate governed by large scale climate phenomena garreaud et al 2009 we find climate regimes with a clear precipitation seasonality the drier semi arid weather at the northeast region tinôco et al 2018 the south america monsoon system responsible for high precipitation amounts at the southeast and central western of brazil ferreira and gan 2011 and the intense convective storms from tropical weather at the amazon region garreaud et al 2009 the study area also comprises a weather type with no seasonality the subtropical weather at the south region of the continent which presents wet and dry periods in any month of the year garreaud et al 2009 this large domain of application illustrates the ability of the approach to provide the means to combine precipitation datasets under a variety of hydrological and climatic conditions the approach proposed in this study also allow us to take advantage of the quality control and knowledge already developed in each precipitation source such as the five levels quality control at the cpc dataset chen m et al 2008 observed discharges are used in the computation of the annual water balance in order to quantify the uncertainties of each precipitation source this is done by using the standard deviation of the errors which are then used to define the weights that will generate the blending of the different precipitation datasets at each river basin this first step is an important step before performing any hydrological analysis or using the available datasets in real time flow forecasting levy et al 2017 in our study we found that the uncertainty as measured by the standard deviation of annual precipitation errors had the highest values in the cpc dataset for most of the basins this result agrees with the finds of rozante et al 2010 when comparing the performance of trmm merge product with the gauge based product obs90 showing a superior quality of the merge product over the gauge based cpc product when the precipitation data sources were combined the new dataset displayed remarkably similar annual uncertainty to the one evaluated from the source which had the smallest standard deviation values however the uncertainty variability among the river basins was reduced in the combined dataset and became more similar to the one displayed by the reference dataset we used in this study the non real time mswep precipitation dataset this result is in line with the results obtained by beck at al 2017 where the authors reported the superior quality of their merged product based on satellite rain gauges and reanalysis when the product and the individual sources were evaluated against ground observations of precipitation the data source presenting the lower standard deviation of annual precipitation errors is usually the one with the higher weight when combining the daily precipitation data the proposed method uses the annual uncertainty to define the blending weights but blends the precipitation datasets at a daily time step on the river basin scale therefore the reduction of uncertainty that results from the combination of individual datasets also impacts the quality of the precipitation at shorter time scales at the annual scale large errors of each data source were smoothed during the combination process in several cases 15 out of the 41 basins and the resultant precipitation dataset displayed lower standard deviation of annual precipitation errors at the daily scales where the hydrological models are usually calibrated and validated for hydrological applications such as streamflow forecasting and climate change impact assessment the performance was better for practically all river basins reflecting lower uncertainty from the combination of precipitation data sources also at this shorter time step these results are the first indication that the methodology proposed for the combination of the different sources of data can lead to a precipitation forcing dataset that is more robust and display lower uncertainty at different time scales this is relevant because lower uncertainty can result in better and more robust calibration of the hydrological model with fewer differences in performance of flow simulations when comparing validation and calibration periods robustness in hydrological modeling is crucial for real time flow forecasting when future events that were not experienced in the past and hence were not included in the model calibration process might occur and generate extreme situations of interest for hydrological risk and water resources management parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling see for instance zhang et al 2016 teweldebrhan et al 2018 herrera et al 2021 was not in the scope of this study we assumed that the application of the split sample test and the use of a long time series were satisfactory to achieve robust parameters of the hydrological model when calibrating the hydrological models we generated nine simulations three for each precipitation forcing trmm merge cpc and their combination following the traditional split sample test there were two calibration validation procedures applied each to half of the sample additionally one calibration covered the entire data period of almost twenty years the results were evaluated using performance indicators nse kge mae and r2 and it was shown that for most of the basins the results in terms of performance of simulated flows are similar among the different periods this enabled the use of the hydrological model as a tool for the selection and validation of the precipitation datasets including the combined precipitation dataset this can be an interesting strategy when the focus of a precipitation dataset analysis is its specific use for hydrological applications as for instance in seasonal streamflow forecasting where the traditional method of esp ensemble streamflow prediction for issuing reliable hydrological forecasts requires long series of homogeneous historic precipitation data wong et al 2021 also illustrated the interest of evaluating precipitation products in terms of streamflow simulations they showed that at the scale of a large river basin in canada the best precipitation product evaluated against the precipitation gauge stations did not necessarily display the best streamflow performance across the sub catchments of the river basin the authors also highlighted the benefit of using streamflow as it presents smaller uncertainties when compared to other hydrological information that can be derived from a hydrological model our results are also in agreement with the conclusions drawn by beck et al 2017 2019 which evaluated a large group of observed precipitation data sources and concluded that the combination of data sources into one reanalysis dataset provided better estimates of precipitation the unique mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation dataset of global terrestrial precipitation dataset provides a high resolution 3 hourly temporal and 0 1 spatial resolution reanalysis dataset while it was used in our study as a reference dataset to evaluate and validate the combined dataset built its direct use for real time operations is not possible given the fact that this dataset it is not yet processed to be available in real time combined precipitation datasets are particularly useful when water managers have to operate over large areas from tens to hundred square kilometers and cannot compile different data sets in real time for each river basin under their management the use of a unique and robust precipitation dataset is an asset in operational settings and continental wide applications the fact that our combined dataset performs well compared with the mswep dataset also opens the opportunity for the future use of the mswep dataset when it will become available in real time the performance results of this study can be compared with other large scale model experiments in terms of overall performance for the nse criterion our results show the performance is higher than 0 60 for 97 of the basins and the average nse over the study area is 0 75 the kge criterion is also higher than 0 60 for all basins and the average value is 0 77 the average coefficient of correlation is 0 67 for the study basins siqueira et al 2018 using a distributed hydrological model mgb and the mswep data from beck et al 2017 as precipitation forcing obtained nse values for discharge and water levels higher than 0 60 for 55 of the studied cases and kge values higher than 0 60 in 70 of the studied cases of streamflow simulation according to the authors the global models watergap lisflood and htessel camaflood showed more than 40 of the basins in south america with an nse and a kge lower than zero when comparing the hec hms models calibrated in this study with the other experiments realized in south america we can see that the results and the performance of the hec hms models are robust and sufficient for the next step of the study which is the application of the combined precipitation dataset and the calibrated model for seasonal streamflow forecasting the combined precipitation dataset has a similar evolution of precipitation uncertainty standard deviation of annual areal precipitation errors as the reference mswep dataset notably in the periods before late 1990 s and early 2000 s the median values are however higher generally 1 higher as well as the variability of standard deviation of annual areal precipitation errors among river basins although differences in median values are more important in the period 2005 2010 median values become comparable in the more recent period despite having more information available in the recent period since satellite data is added to the trmm merge dataset the uncertainty of the combined precipitation dataset is not reduced as can be seen in the mswep dataset which presents a decrease in the variability of the standard deviation of the errors among the river basins in the period after 1998 these differences can be explained by the fact that the mswep dataset uses more information and more consistent data than real time datasets errors and inconsistencies are often present in real time datasets such as the ones used to build the combined dataset in this study so it is expected that this impacts the quality of the precipitation data despite these issues an important aspect of the combined precipitation dataset is that it provides a more homogeneous dataset over the region since no regions in the study area displayed specific patterns of errors patterns were identified previously in the cpc and trmm merge precipitation datasets reis et al 2019 with differences between the datasets growing toward the northwest of brazil after the combination of the datasets the uncertainty did not show any clear dependency on the spatial location of the river basins the trmm merge dataset used in this study was discontinued in may 2020 and now cptec provides a merge product called gpm merge based on the gpm satellite product rozante et al 2018 skofronik jackson et al 2018 it uses the new imerge retrieval algorithm which fuses the early precipitation estimates collected during the operation of the trmm satellite 2000 2015 with more recent precipitation estimates collected during the operation of the gpm satellite 2014 present https gpm nasa gov data imerg the new cptec gpm merge dataset maintains the same gage stations used at the trmm merge product and the same merg algorithm rozante et al 2010 which gives preference to the use of the station data over the satellite information rozante et al 2020 in their study comparing the old product tmpa v7 based on the trmm mission with the new products imerge and the gsmap g from jaxa rozante et al 2018 found that the imerg e and tmpa v7 show a similar behavior in terms of critical success index csi adjusted equitable threat score ets probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and bias with a better performance for imerge these characteristics make the new gpm merge the natural substitute of the discontinued trmm merge with similar behavior but with a better performance and higher resolution of 0 1 x 0 1 due the similarity of the products we believe the results obtained in our study with the trmm merge will remain valid with the use of the new gpm merge available after may 2020 the same is valid for the mswep dataset beck et al 2019 the dataset used in this study is the product version v2 2 with daily precipitation data and a 0 1 spatial resolution a comparison of the combined precipitation generated from the methodology proposed in this study with the reference mswep our benchmark dataset showed that the combined dataset has a level of uncertainty comparable with the benchmark the examples of simulated flows showed that the calibrated models can correctly represent the long term flow variations in different regions and climates in the study area the mswep product is however in constant evolution at the time of writing its current version v2 8 mswep v2 8 2021 provides data with daily and 3 hourly time resolutions and with the same 0 1 spatial resolution as mentioned earlier the complete version is still not available in real time due to the latency of some of the products used in its production mswep 2021 however this latency is reducing year after year and we believe that in the next years we will have new real time products the methodology proposed can be easily applied to consider such new products 5 conclusions in this study a sequence of steps was described that can be used to blend different real time precipitation datasets validate the results and obtain a better near real time observed precipitation forcing dataset for river basins in south america brazil and neighboring countries the methodology proposed allowed us to build a long historical period of precipitation estimates at the river basin scale which can be used in future hydrological studies such as streamflow forecasting the main conclusion of this study is that the use of hydrological data and modeling is an asset to combine and validate precipitation datasets from different sources at large river basins in views of providing a blended dataset for hydrological applications in places where rain gauges are scarce or non existing our study showed that a combination of existing precipitation datasets weighted by the annual uncertainty of each original source reduces precipitation uncertainty at the river basin scale the methodology proposed allowed us to adapt for each river basin the proportion of each precipitation source to be considered in the combined dataset taking thus into account the specific hydroclimatic characteristics of each river basin the uncertainty reduction was also observed when we analyzed the results at the daily time step with better results in terms of daily hydrological simulation when using the combined dataset than when using each precipitation source individually a drawback of combining data sources is the fact that datasets are often not available for the same period in this study we show that a possible practical solution is to extend the period of the combined precipitation dataset to cover the longest possible period given the original datasets by using the double mass curve correlation the validation of such extension was also illustrated using a hydrological model the model allows users to evaluate in terms of simulated discharges if the performance of a precipitation dataset in the extended period where not all data sources are available remains similar and consistent to the one in the original period where all data sources were available to build the combined precipitation dataset hydrological modeling proved to be a useful tool to evaluate the performance of different sources of precipitation data as also suggested recently by levy et al 2017 who highlighted the importance of the problem of data selection uncertainty when analyzing nine datasets in brazil ongoing research focuses on the different uses of the combined precipitation dataset generated in this study the main application is to generate ensemble members of the esp method for seasonal streamflow forecasting and to evaluate the performance of the esp method against streamflow forecasts based on dynamical predictions from climate models the combined precipitation dataset will also be used to evaluate the performance of precipitation forecasts issued by meteorological medium range and climate long range models and if biases are detected to apply bias correction methods to improve these forecasts at local scales author s contribution alberto assis dos reis developed the methodology set up the datasets and models conducted theexperiments did

7785,study region forty one river basins in brazil and neighboring countries in south america study focus in large river basins on countrywide or continental scales it is often difficult to have consistent and accurate long time series of spatially distributed precipitation data available however these are needed to calibrate hydrological models and to run hydrological simulations continuously in real time streamflow forecasting in this study we assess two real time precipitation products based on rain gauges and satellite data trmm merge and cpc noaa for their use in streamflow forecasting in the hydropower sector in brazil to take advantage of each precipitation data source and derive a unique dataset a methodology is proposed to combine extend and validate the datasets we consider the discharges at the river basin outlets as an independent and robust reference for hydrological applications observed discharges are used to quantify precipitation uncertainties and to weight the blending while discharges obtained from hydrological modeling are used to validate the final precipitation product new hydrological insights for the region the proposed blending method which uses the uncertainty of the original datasets to define the weighting factors was efficient in generating a precipitation product that performs better than each dataset separately when used to force a hydrological model the use of the double mass curve correlation to extend the time series of the datasets beyond their common period allowed us to produce long time series of precipitation for south american basins and hydrological applications the study shows that it is possible to rely on river discharge data and hydrological modeling to select and combine different precipitation products in the region and presents a step by step methodology to do so keywords precipitation hydrological model data uncertainty trmm merge cpc noaa data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction time series of quantitative precipitation estimates is crucial for calibrating and running hydrological models to be used in research and operational applications such as water resource management irrigation planning hydropower operations and forecasting of floods and droughts however in large river basins or on countrywide and continental scales it is often difficult to have consistent and accurate time series of spatially distributed precipitation data available over a long period of time precipitation is one of the climate variables most difficult to estimate because of its heterogeneous distribution in space and high variability in time herold et al 2015 it is also susceptible to measurement errors caused by wind evaporation wetting splashing and drifting effects and human errors such as uncalibrated gauge equipment acquisition and data communication problems michelson 2004 therefore it is a major challenge to produce consistent precipitation products in space and time over large areas and long periods especially if such products should be continuously used in real time operations in hydrology golding 2009 kucera et al 2013 pozzi et al 2013 serrat capdevila et al 2013 verkade et al 2013 lettenmaier et al 2015 van osnabrugge et al 2017 the main sources of precipitation data are ground based gauges weather radars and satellite instruments gilewski and nawalany 2018 the first two sources mentioned are more accurate but they are not uniformly available over large areas such as south america satellite data emerge as a potential source of precipitation information in this context given their capacity to cover large areas and provide continuous space time data they are however less accurate and need to be bias corrected cassalho et al 2020 the main sensors used to estimate precipitation are passive microwave calibrated infrared and a combination of them hong et al 2018 with the evolution of sensors active microwave sensors have been added to the satellites over time such as the ku band cloud profiling radar dpr on the trmm satellite simpson et al 1988 the w band cloud profiling radar on the cloudsat y chen et al 2008 m chen et al 2008b and ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar dpr on the gpm satellites huffman et al 2017 several algorithms have been developed to extract precipitation information from this constellation of satellites ranging from the simplest ir based goes precipitation index gpi arkin and meisner 1987 to the most recent and sophisticated nasa gpm global precipitation measurements integrated multi satellite retrievals imerge huffman et al 2017 on a global scale gridded precipitation products have been available since the late 1990 s huffman et al 1997 adler et al 2003 sun et al 2017 beck et al 2017 however only a few are produced in near real time such as the cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation from the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa y chen et al 2008 m chen et al 2008 and the imerg for gpm dataset from the u s national aeronautics and space administration nasa huffman et al 2017 which is the successor of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm data products for south america the trmm merge product was developed by the brazilian centre for weather forecast and climatic studies centro de previsão de tempo e estudos climáticos cptec and made available for near real time applications rozante et al 2010 it combines gauging station datasets from the global telecommunications system automatic stations from various agencies in south america and the near real time trmm precipitation product to provide a gridded dataset of daily precipitation at 0 25 of spatial resolution for operational applications when trmm was discontinued the product gpm merge was built with the gpm dataset based on the imerg e algorithm the substitute of tmpa v7 in the trmm mission it maintains the same gauge stations and the algorithm merge rozante et al 2010 although it presents a higher spatial resolution of 0 1 rozante et al 2018 2020 when different precipitation products are available over an area the question arises whether it would be better to select one product or combine different products beck et al 2017 investigated 22 gridded global and tropical precipitation datasets and concluded that the product that merged all information available the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswepv1 0 had better overall performance recently reis et al 2019 carried out a study comparing the cpc noaa and trmm merge real time precipitation datasets over 41 river basins mostly located in brazil the authors found considerable differences in space and time between these two datasets with a tendency to increase differences when moving from south to north and from east to west for the majority of the studied river basins the recent decade of data 2008 2017 presented the biggest differences in terms of areal precipitation over the river basins the authors also highlighted the fact that the differences between the precipitation datasets were propagated and often amplified in simulated streamflow when used to force a hydrological rainfall runoff model hydrological data and models can be useful tools for analyzing precipitation datasets by comparing simulated and observed streamflows the quality of a precipitation dataset used as forcing for the model can be indirectly assessed and the uncertainties evaluated this strategy has been used in numerous previous studies to evaluate the quality of precipitation datasets at regional or global scales e g su et al 2008 collischonn et al 2008 voisin et al 2008 bitew et al 2012 li et al 2013 falck et al 2015 tang et al 2016 beck et al 2017 hong et al 2021 overall the studies indicate that once there are better estimates of observed flow than precipitation the use of hydrological modeling can help in validating the precipitation data direct empirical comparisons between rainfall and streamflow can be useful to evaluate rainfall datasets across multiple scales but also to identify and quantify the magnitude of the uncertainty in the datasets used in hydrological modeling levy et al 2017 based on the water balance equation and assuming that a catchment hydrologically behaves like a reservoir system it is possible to invert the reservoir model equation and express the rainfall as a function of the streamflow and then use this relationship to estimate the uncertainty of the rainfall data kirchner 2009 henn 2015 hydrological models can also be used to define and evaluate the best combination of multiple precipitation data sources the mswep product is an example of a combined product that uses river discharge observations from stations across the globe and hydrological simulations to correct systematic terrestrial precipitation biases beck et al 2017 it is a fully global historic precipitation dataset available since 1979 http www gloh2o org mswep it is based on data from gauge stations satellite remote sensing and atmospheric model reanalysis the hydrological model used to evaluate the performance of the mswep product and compare it with other state of the art gauge adjusted datasets i e wfdei cru gpcp 1dd tmpa 3b42 and cpc unified was the hbv model bergström 1995 flow simulations using mswep showed better performance median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 52 than simulations with the other precipitation datasets nse values of 0 29 0 39 the median correlation obtained when using the mwsep product was the best correlation for 60 of independent precipitation gauges from fluxnet tower stations used for validation for more details see beck et al 2017 recently siqueira et al 2018 applied the mswep v1 1 precipitation product with the distributed mgb hydrological model over south america to simulate streamflows they reported good overall performance of the simulations with nse 0 6 in 55 of the flow stations the performance was better in large rivers and wet regions decreasing in drier climates where timing errors in rivers with floodplain effects had been reported to merge different precipitation products in a unique product wong et al 2021 propose a methodological framework that relies on the streamflow response to precipitation it uses a hydrological model to identify locally at the sub sub basin scale the best product among several gridded precipitation products satellite derived and model reanalysis product the authors use precipitation gauge stations available to first evaluate the quality of each precipitation dataset and to assess the overall performance of the hydrological model in each streamflow station the best product is locally selected according to the performance of the hydrological simulations evaluated at discharge gauging locations the canadian hydrologic land surface model h lsm mesh was used to generate a composite precipitation dataset in the saskatchewan river basin in canada which was then validated by assessing hydrological fluxes and storage at downstream gauge stations in many parts of the world precipitation ground data are not available or networks are too scarce to be used in the validation of gridded precipitation products reliable and consistent long time series of spatially distributed precipitation over large areas are however needed for many applications including climatological assessments and seasonal streamflow forecasting they are used to calibrate the hydrological models warmup the flow forecasting models bias correct numerical weather forecasts and apply the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method which relies on historic precipitation and temperature data as future possible climate scenarios crochemore et al 2016 bennett et al 2017 arnal et al 2017 harrigan et al 2018 in flow forecasting applications these datasets also must be available in real time or near real time to allow operational decision making in brazil gridded large scale precipitation products are of particular importance to the real time operations of the hydropower sector schwanenberg et al 2015 gibertoni et al 2017 the anticipation of hydrological conditions can strongly influence the centralized operation of the electrical system and energy prices ons 2016 given this regional context this paper aims to present a methodology that uses a hydrological model and observed discharge time series to quantify uncertainties from the trmm merge and cpc precipitation datasets combine the datasets and derive a unique precipitation dataset that can be used in near real time applications the novelty of our approach lies on using both observed and simulated discharge data at the outlet of the river basins to take advantage of the information contained in each precipitation product and derive a unique dataset observed discharges are used to quantify precipitation uncertainties and to weight the blending while discharges obtained from hydrological modeling are used to validate the final precipitation product therefore instead of using a reference ground or remote sensed precipitation dataset which might also contain errors in the precipitation estimates we use the discharges at the river basin outlets as an independent and more robust reference for hydrological applications at the catchment scale in addition this paper presents the validation of the methodology over a large set of catchments 41 river basins covering a large area of south america this paper addresses the following questions i how can we use hydrological data and hydrological modeling to blend different observed precipitation datasets and validate the combined product in order to have better precipitation data for hydrological simulation and flow forecasting ii how can we extend the combined precipitation product over a period other than the common period of the different observed precipitation time series to foster its use in near real time applications this paper illustrates how we can use hydrological data and modeling as a tool to quantify the uncertainty of precipitation estimates combine different datasets and validate the combined product with the final goal of obtaining a precipitation product relevant to near real time hydrological applications our methodology is applied to a large set of 41 river basins that are relevant to the hydropower sector in brazil and neighboring countries the trmm merge and cpc precipitation datasets are used to generate a combined precipitation product the dataset obtained is compared with the benchmark mswep and evaluated in terms of how hydrological simulations compare with observed discharges in section 2 the methodology and data used are presented in section 3 the results obtained are provided section 4 is a discussion of the results and the conclusions and planned future studies are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study area comprises 41 river basins distributed in different climatic regions within brazil and neighboring countries fig 1 the river basins vary in size with areas ranging from 9300 to 382 000 km² the study area extends from the north jari river madeira river xingu river tapajos river tocantins river and others to the south of brazil iguaçu river uruguay river and others and includes river basins located in the central part of the country paraná river grande river são francisco river etc the 41 river basins provide inflow to 30 hydropower plants hpps for each river basin daily areal precipitation was obtained from the trmm merge the cpc noaa and the mswep datasets table 1 daily areal precipitation time series were calculated using the shape file of the basins and averaging all grid data points falling inside each river basin considered daily discharge data were obtained from the ons national operator of the electric system downloaded from https sintegre ons org br they correspond to the official hpp natural flow time series and are compiled annually by the national operator in some cases it is the ons that takes into account the regularization effects of the reservoirs and adds their evaporation as well as any water uses to obtain the natural flows of the reservoir in these cases the flows are also validated by the electricity generators involved in the process for more details see ons 2005 data availability depends on each river basin for this study the discharge dataset used covers the period 1979 2018 for all studied river basins 2 2 methodological steps to select a better real time precipitation dataset among the two available independent data sources and a dataset that is a combination of the two and to validate the selection and blending procedure using a hydrological model and observed streamflow an experiment was designed with six basic methodological steps step 1 for each river basin the daily areal precipitation time series average over the area of the river basin is estimated for each precipitation data source the daily observed flow data are extracted for the same period at each basin in addition the total annual precipitation and the annual mean of observed daily flows are calculated to perform the analysis based on the water balance relationship step 2 step 2 the uncertainty of each precipitation data source is identified and quantified by using empirical functions that relate the total annual precipitation amounts and the observed annual mean flows the weights used to build the combined daily precipitation dataset are obtained based on the uncertainty quantified from the annual water balance as detailed in section 2 3 step 3 since the two independent precipitation data sources cover different time periods a procedure is used to extend the combined precipitation dataset over the longest period using the double mass curve as described in section 2 4 step 4 for each daily precipitation dataset the two independent sets and the combined one the hydrological model is calibrated at each river basin by first applying the traditional split sample test which divides the time series october 1998 to september 2017 into two periods for calibration and validation this allows to assess the robustness of the model when simulating streamflows over a period independent of the calibration period we also apply the calibration procedure over the entire data period to evaluate how the parameters of the model change with the length of the time period used for calibration this step is detailed in section 2 5 step 5 for each precipitation dataset and river basin the daily flows simulated by the hydrological model with parameters calibrated over the entire data period are evaluated against the observed flows at the outlet of the basin we use a variety of performance metrics as described in section 2 6 step 6 the extended combined precipitation dataset is evaluated against a benchmark of observed precipitation and simulated discharges using the new dataset are evaluated against observed discharges 2 3 combining two precipitation data sources using the annual water balance the water balance equation is used in hydrology to describe the flow of water in and out of a system the period used to calculate the water balance is usually the hydrological year which is a 12 month period that starts at the end of the dry season for any given year the water balance in a river basin with no external inflows from neighboring catchments can be written as 1 s p i q et where p i is the annual precipitation for the given year total precipitation over the hydrological year of the precipitation data source i q is the annual mean flow et is the annual evapotranspiration and s is the annual variation of storage in the river basin with all variables expressed in millimeters for long term averages here calculated over the hydrological year the change in storage s for an annual time step is marginal and can be considered equal to zero shao et al 2012 beck et al 2020 the et term depends on physical factors such as the vegetation type soil cover and land use as well as on climate factors such as temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed as considered in the penman monteith method used to calculate evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 therefore this term can be considered independent of the precipitation data source that is used in eq 1 in our study we are not trying to evaluate the different components of the hydrological balance but instead we want to capture how the uncertainty varies when we consider different precipitation sources in the same river basin eq 1 can then be simplified and the precipitation can be written as a function of the flow and the error term that will translate the uncertainties 2 p i f q ε i where f q is the empirical function between the annual precipitation in millimeters and the annual flow in millimeters and ε i is the annual error associated with the precipitation source p i the error ε i is evaluated for each given year using the empirical function that relates each annual precipitation p i to the annual flow q the evaluation is based on the standard deviation of the errors of each precipitation source p i and is computed over the time series of annual errors the standard deviation estimates obtained were used to weight the proportion of each precipitation data source to create a combined precipitation dataset the weights were based on the proportion of the standard deviation of the errors of one source with respect to the sum of standard deviations of the errors of both sources the weights were obtained from the following equations 3 w j 1 σ ε j σ ε j σ ε k 4 w k 1 w j where w j is the weight of the precipitation data source p i j w k is the weight of the precipitation data source p i k σ ε j is the standard deviation of the annual errors of p i j and σ ε k is the standard deviation of the annual errors of source p i k at each basin the main idea behind this methodology is not to identify the precipitation data source that displays the best correlation between p i and q the goal is to access the uncertainty of each source to make it possible to give a higher weight to the source with smaller uncertainty when the two sources of precipitation data are combined in one unique dataset once the weights of each precipitation data source are obtained they are applied to the daily precipitation time series to generate the combined daily precipitation dataset at each basin according to eq 5 5 dp wc dp j w j dp k w k where d p wc is the daily precipitation of the weighted combination of the two precipitation data sources dp j and dp k 2 4 double mass curve method to extend the combined precipitation dataset once the combined precipitation method is applied to the two different precipitation data sources a combined precipitation dataset for the same period of the shorter precipitation data source is obtained it is thus necessary to extend in a consistent way this combined precipitation time series to also cover the period of the longer available data source in this study the double mass curve method developed by the us geological survey was used searcy et al 1960 the method is commonly used in data analyses to check the consistency of hydrometeorological data and adjust the data for any inconsistencies it is based on comparing the time series of accumulated values at a single data station or a given data source with those given by data from other stations in a surrounding area or other data sources during the same period the theory of the double mass curve is based on the fact that a graph of the accumulation of one time series against the accumulation of another time series during the same period plots as a straight line as long as the data are proportional the slope of the line represents the constant of proportionality b between them applied to this study it gives eq 6 6 p c p k b where p c represents the precipitation variable of the combined precipitation dataset and p k is the precipitation variable coming from the longer time series of the two sources of precipitation used to produce the combined dataset a break in the slope of eq 6 indicates a change in the constant of proportion and the presence of inconsistencies in this study the double mass curve was applied to annual values of total precipitation as follows for each river basin for the common period of trmm merge and cpc noaa data i e 1998 2017 the graph of accumulated annual values of the combined dataset is plotted against the graph of the cpc noaa dataset which is the longer precipitation dataset the years with a wide discrepancy around the normal tendency are removed with the objective of having the most representative parameter to extend the time series the constant of proportionality obtained with this correlation is used to multiply the past period of the longer data source obtaining thus a complete time series of daily precipitation back until 1979 in order to represent the extension of the combined precipitation dataset to compare the combined precipitation dataset with the benchmark precipitation mswep dataset and to evaluate how the dispersion of the error varies in time the standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors observed precipitation minus the value calculated with the empirical functions of eq 2 were calculated for 1980 2014 full hydrological years of the benchmark data available in a five year moving window to improve the analysis and avoid scale distortions caused by differences in wetter or drier years between mswep and the combined precipitation dataset the standard deviation error was normalized by dividing its value by the average precipitation of each five year window 2 5 hec hms hydrological modeling and flow analyses to validate the combined precipitation dataset obtained a hydrological model was used to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated discharges when this dataset drives the model the hydrological model used in this study is the one proposed in the suite of the hec hms model feldman 2000 it is a flexible and user friendly suite of models that can be used for many hydrological applications such as urban and rural flooding flood warning systems water uses planning etc the models can be applied to simulate a single flow event or to perform continuous hydrological simulations in a semi distributed modeling configuration the modules can be chosen according to the needs of the user the application envisaged and the expected accuracy feldman 2000 najim 2013 users can for instance select specific modules of the loss method the transformation method and the base flow method scharffenberg 2016 in this study the hec hms modeling framework was run for continuous simulations at the daily time step the interception was modeled using the simple canopy bennett 1998 and the simple surface bennett 1998 methods the excess of precipitation arrives on the soil and is captured until the storage capacity of the surface is filled and then runoff starts the water in the surface will then infiltrate into the soil the soil moisture accounting method is the unique module in the framework able to run a continuous simulation it uses three layers to represent the dynamics of the water movement in the soil for a given precipitation and evapotranspiration it computes the basin s surface runoff groundwater flow losses and the deep percolation over the entire basin bennett 1998 the clark unit hydrograph was used to incorporate the translation of runoff through time within the basin and the attenuation of runoff through storage in a linear reservoir its principal parameters are the time of concentration defining the travel time in the sub basin and the storage coefficient kull and feldman 1998 the linear reservoir method kull and feldman 1998 was used to represent the base flow it uses a linear reservoir to model the recession of the base flow after a storm event using the principles of conservation of mass the lateral outflow of the groundwater is connected with the infiltration from the soil moisture accounting loss method for the routing the lag method or the muskingum cunge routing method were used depending on the complexity of the basin and the extension of the river reach the split sample approach klemes 1986 was used to calibrate the hydrological model and test its robustness validation each time series is split into two and both parts are used for calibration and validation the results in terms of model performance are evaluated for the two validation periods and compared with the performance results obtained over the same periods but with the calibration based on the complete period the main objective of these various calibration and validation periods is to verify that the calibration of the total period which is used in the next steps is robust and has equivalent performance to that of the split sample approach fig 2 illustrates the approach used and the different calibration and validation periods of the hec hms hydrological model the model was calibrated using a daily time step and for each source of precipitation separately large basins with different climatic characteristics across space were divided in sub basins to better capture differences in precipitation and produce a better rainfall runoff transformation in total there are 26 parameters to be calibrated in the hec hms model the parameters that have a stronger influence on the model outputs are the time of concentration and the storage coefficient which are linked to the clark unit hydrograph module the maximum infiltration rate the soil total storage the soil tension storage and the maximum soil percolation rate which are linked to the loss module an initial manual calibration was performed to obtain the first parameters set then the automatic calibration procedure available in the hec hms model was applied to obtain the optimal parameters using the univariate gradient search algorithm the objective function used for the clark unit hydrograph parameters was the minimum of peak weighted rms error and for the loss parameters the minimum sum of squared residuals diskin and simon 1977 since the objective functions are more sensitive to the volumes and peaks of the hydrographs it is sometimes necessary to adjust the base flow parameters to have a better fit of the recession of the hydrographs after running the model optimization the calibration process is repeated three times for each calibration period fig 2 for each precipitation data source and for the combined precipitation dataset and for each river basin 2 6 evaluation metrics to analyze the performance of the hydrological models run in this study hec hms model calibrated with the different observed precipitation datasets the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the mean absolute error mae and the r² coefficient of determination were used as performance indicators these metrics are used to compare the daily simulated flows with the daily observed flows they were evaluated for the calibration independent time periods defined in fig 2 october 1998 to september 2008 october 2008 to september 2017 in our evaluation the performance indicators obtained for the validation periods 1 and 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model at each river basin the performance obtained during the total calibration period was used to define the best precipitation data source for each river basin nse measures how good the results of the model are compared with the mean observed discharge values equal to 1 indicate a perfect fit and values smaller than zero indicate that the mean discharge is a better predictor than the hydrological model 7 nse 1 i 1 n y i sim y i obs 2 i 1 n y i obs y obs 2 where y i sim is the simulated value at time step i y i obs is the observed value at time step i y obs is the mean of the observed value and n is the number of time steps kge provides a decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency analysis values close to 1 indicate a more accurate model 8 kge 1 r 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 where in the first part r is the linear

same as in eq 7 3 results 3 1 standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors fig 3 shows the boxplot distribution of the standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors ε i from eq 2 obtained from the two sources of precipitation data and the combined precipitation dataset the standard deviation values were evaluated over all 41 river basins and 19 years of data october 1998 september 2017 and the linear function was the best fit in all basins which makes sense since the annual water balance was represented by a linear function in eq 1 the standard deviation of annual precipitation errors from the benchmark mswep dataset for all river basins and the period from 1998 to 2017 is also shown as reference table 2 shows the results for each river basin as well as the weights applied when combining the two precipitation data sources the dispersion of the annual precipitation errors is reduced when the different precipitation data sources are combined the combined precipitation dataset shows a lower standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors than the original datasets on 15 out of 41 river basins and its boxplot distribution is closer to the reference mswep dataset although the median value of the error standard deviation is close to the trmm merge dataset median value the interquartile range between the 75th and 25th percentiles is smaller in the combined dataset this measure of dispersion of the precipitation errors around the empirical function gives an idea of the uncertainty of each precipitation dataset in the combined dataset more weight is given to the precipitation dataset with lower uncertainty in table 2 we can see that the trmm merge dataset has more weight than the cpc dataset in 30 out of 41 river basins and both have equal weight in 2 river basins 3 2 hydrological model performance the three precipitation datasets trmm merge cpc and combined were used to calibrate and validate the hec hms hydrological model in all 41 river basins fig 4 shows the density functions representing the distribution of the four performance metrics analyzed kge nse mae calculated in terms of specific discharge in l s km² to permit comparison of the values in basins with different sizes and r² the values obtained in calibration validation are in red blue table 3 shows the median values of the metrics when considering all river basins calibration and validation periods as defined in fig 2 and for each precipitation dataset for most of the basins the difference in performance metrics between calibration and validation is less than 10 the calibrated models can be considered to perform well over the large river basin dataset of this study for most of the 41 river basins the nse and kge criteria are higher than 0 60 and the r2 coefficient is higher than 0 55 table 3 shows that median values of nse and kge vary from 0 71 to 0 81 in calibration and from 0 68 to 0 78 in validation median values of r2 coefficient in calibration and validation are also very close these results indicate that the model calibration is sufficiently robust to represent the characteristics of the basins in different periods fig 5 also shows that the combined dataset results in a more consistent calibration and validation performance with sharper curves and fewer outliers of performance the combined dataset is also the one that presents the highest median values of nse kge and r2 and the lowest median values of mae table 3 these results can also be another indicator of the robustness and good performance of the combined precipitation dataset 3 3 selection of the best precipitation dataset after the evaluation and validation of the performance of the hydrological model for each river basin the best performing precipitation dataset was evaluated in terms of simulated discharges the simulations were made using the model with parameters calibrated with each precipitation dataset and over the entire period october 1998 september 2017 fig 5 shows the mae kge nse and r² performance metrics obtained for the 41 river basins and the three sources of precipitation data trmm merge cpc and the combined precipitation dataset in general the simulated discharges using the cpc precipitation dataset clearly performed worse for the four indicators analyzed the simulated discharges using the combined precipitation dataset performs best for almost all basins when the scores are not the best for this dataset in a river basin the differences are less than 10 in the majority of the cases not shown the best performance of the combined dataset is clearly shown with the nse mae and r² criteria in terms of the kge criterion 50 of the river basins present values higher than 0 79 when using the combined and the trmm merge precipitation datasets there are small differences in kge between these two datasets although the use of the combined dataset resulted in fewer outliers in terms of performance and notably less river basins with low values of kge for individual river basins showing the lowest values of kge with the combined dataset the differences regarding the kge with the trmm merge are lower than 8 3 4 extension of the combined precipitation dataset once the evaluation showed that the combined precipitation of the two precipitation data sources achieved the best performance over the common period of data october 1998 september 2017 the next step was to use the double mass procedure section 2 4 to extend the combined dataset the correlation of the double mass curve between the longest dataset cpc and the combined dataset was used to extend the period of the combined dataset until 1979 first year of data available in the longest cpc dataset to validate the extended dataset obtained the hydrological models were run for each river basin with parameters calibrated for the period 1998 2017 the performance of the streamflow simulations of this recent period was compared with the performance of the simulations obtained over the extended validation period of 1979 1997 fig 6 shows the distribution of streamflow performance metrics mae nse and r2 over the 41 river basins of this study in terms of accuracy of the streamflow simulations mae the average error for the extended validation period 1979 1998 is slightly lower than the average error of the recent calibration period 1998 2017 considering the nse criterion the extended period has on average better performance higher nse values than the recent period for the r² correlation the values obtained over the extended period are clearly higher than the values obtained over the recent period these results validate the extension of the combined precipitation dataset in terms of its ability to provide streamflow simulations in the extended earlier period that match the observed streamflows as well as in the more recent period of the combined precipitation dataset 3 5 comparison of the combined precipitation dataset with the benchmark the combined precipitation dataset was evaluated against the benchmark mswep dataset fig 7 shows the evolution in time of the normalized standard deviation of the annual precipitation errors obtained for 1980 2017 in a five year moving window the thickest lines represent the median of the values for all river basins and the shadowed areas show the 25th and 75th percentiles variability among river basins the extended period of the combined precipitation before 1998 tends to have a behavior closer to the benchmark it shows similar standard deviation of annual precipitation errors but higher values median values are closer to 6 versus median values closer to 5 for the benchmark the combined precipitation dataset does not exhibit a visible temporal trend however the standard deviation of the precipitation errors decreases after the year 2000 to increase again just a few years later the standard deviation of the mwsep annual precipitation errors is smaller and more stable over time comparatively to the combined precipitation dataset it also shows less variability among river basins after around 1998 there is a reduction in the mswep error standard deviation probably due to the use of satellite observations to improve the estimates of precipitation after 2008 median values tend to increase again to values similar to those before 1998 although the variability among river basins remain reduced when the entire period 1980 2017 is considered the combined precipitation dataset has a higher median and variability among river basins than the benchmark but the difference can be considered small especially considering that the combined precipitation is a real time dataset subject to errors that might be corrected afterwards and the level of consistency is not comparable to a reanalysis dataset such as mswep in terms of spatial distribution of the errors there is no evidence of a pattern or regions with a clear higher normalized standard deviation of the errors not shown for almost all basins the combined precipitation dataset displays values between 4 and 9 only a few basins have values higher than 11 and they are not concentrated in the same region 3 6 examples of simulated hydrographs using the combined precipitation dataset as showed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the combined precipitation dataset displayed good performance for the period used to build it from the two existing data sources i e 1998 2017 with nse and kge values above 0 75 fig 8 shows three examples of the simulated flows using the combined precipitation dataset for the complete period generated from this study i e from october 1st 1979 to september 30th 2021 three river basins were selected to represent the southern region hpp foz do chapecó at the uruguai river the southeast region hpp emborcação at the paranaíba river and the north region hpp santo antônio at the madeira river in the southern region the weather does not present a clear seasonality and peaks of flow may occur in any month of the year the simulated flows tend to underestimate the highest peaks and overestimate the lowest flows nse 0 78 in the southeast region seasonality is present and the wet season is from november to march the simulated flows tend to overestimate the flow peaks for the period 1983 1993 and underestimate them for 2005 2010 despite these tendencies this river basin also presents a good statistical fit with nse value of 0 76 in the north region the biggest basin of our dataset is shown a clear seasonality is observed with the wet season from december to may the simulated flows display an overall better and more stable performance with a good fit to flow peaks and flow recession periods nse 0 87 4 discussion this study proposes a methodology that allows us to combine extend and validate two precipitation datasets based on precipitation gauges and satellite based products cpc and trmm merge by using observed and simulated discharges at river basin outlets by relying on discharge data and hydrological modeling to process the global gridded precipitation products it provides a framework that can be applied in particular in large areas where ground networks of rain gauges often considered as the most accurate source of precipitation information is not reliable or dense enough for hydrological applications we tested and validated the approach over 41 river basins in brazil and neighboring countries basin sizes ranging from 9300 km² to 382 000 km² this study area has a continental dimension exhibiting diverse patterns of weather and climate governed by large scale climate phenomena garreaud et al 2009 we find climate regimes with a clear precipitation seasonality the drier semi arid weather at the northeast region tinôco et al 2018 the south america monsoon system responsible for high precipitation amounts at the southeast and central western of brazil ferreira and gan 2011 and the intense convective storms from tropical weather at the amazon region garreaud et al 2009 the study area also comprises a weather type with no seasonality the subtropical weather at the south region of the continent which presents wet and dry periods in any month of the year garreaud et al 2009 this large domain of application illustrates the ability of the approach to provide the means to combine precipitation datasets under a variety of hydrological and climatic conditions the approach proposed in this study also allow us to take advantage of the quality control and knowledge already developed in each precipitation source such as the five levels quality control at the cpc dataset chen m et al 2008 observed discharges are used in the computation of the annual water balance in order to quantify the uncertainties of each precipitation source this is done by using the standard deviation of the errors which are then used to define the weights that will generate the blending of the different precipitation datasets at each river basin this first step is an important step before performing any hydrological analysis or using the available datasets in real time flow forecasting levy et al 2017 in our study we found that the uncertainty as measured by the standard deviation of annual precipitation errors had the highest values in the cpc dataset for most of the basins this result agrees with the finds of rozante et al 2010 when comparing the performance of trmm merge product with the gauge based product obs90 showing a superior quality of the merge product over the gauge based cpc product when the precipitation data sources were combined the new dataset displayed remarkably similar annual uncertainty to the one evaluated from the source which had the smallest standard deviation values however the uncertainty variability among the river basins was reduced in the combined dataset and became more similar to the one displayed by the reference dataset we used in this study the non real time mswep precipitation dataset this result is in line with the results obtained by beck at al 2017 where the authors reported the superior quality of their merged product based on satellite rain gauges and reanalysis when the product and the individual sources were evaluated against ground observations of precipitation the data source presenting the lower standard deviation of annual precipitation errors is usually the one with the higher weight when combining the daily precipitation data the proposed method uses the annual uncertainty to define the blending weights but blends the precipitation datasets at a daily time step on the river basin scale therefore the reduction of uncertainty that results from the combination of individual datasets also impacts the quality of the precipitation at shorter time scales at the annual scale large errors of each data source were smoothed during the combination process in several cases 15 out of the 41 basins and the resultant precipitation dataset displayed lower standard deviation of annual precipitation errors at the daily scales where the hydrological models are usually calibrated and validated for hydrological applications such as streamflow forecasting and climate change impact assessment the performance was better for practically all river basins reflecting lower uncertainty from the combination of precipitation data sources also at this shorter time step these results are the first indication that the methodology proposed for the combination of the different sources of data can lead to a precipitation forcing dataset that is more robust and display lower uncertainty at different time scales this is relevant because lower uncertainty can result in better and more robust calibration of the hydrological model with fewer differences in performance of flow simulations when comparing validation and calibration periods robustness in hydrological modeling is crucial for real time flow forecasting when future events that were not experienced in the past and hence were not included in the model calibration process might occur and generate extreme situations of interest for hydrological risk and water resources management parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling see for instance zhang et al 2016 teweldebrhan et al 2018 herrera et al 2021 was not in the scope of this study we assumed that the application of the split sample test and the use of a long time series were satisfactory to achieve robust parameters of the hydrological model when calibrating the hydrological models we generated nine simulations three for each precipitation forcing trmm merge cpc and their combination following the traditional split sample test there were two calibration validation procedures applied each to half of the sample additionally one calibration covered the entire data period of almost twenty years the results were evaluated using performance indicators nse kge mae and r2 and it was shown that for most of the basins the results in terms of performance of simulated flows are similar among the different periods this enabled the use of the hydrological model as a tool for the selection and validation of the precipitation datasets including the combined precipitation dataset this can be an interesting strategy when the focus of a precipitation dataset analysis is its specific use for hydrological applications as for instance in seasonal streamflow forecasting where the traditional method of esp ensemble streamflow prediction for issuing reliable hydrological forecasts requires long series of homogeneous historic precipitation data wong et al 2021 also illustrated the interest of evaluating precipitation products in terms of streamflow simulations they showed that at the scale of a large river basin in canada the best precipitation product evaluated against the precipitation gauge stations did not necessarily display the best streamflow performance across the sub catchments of the river basin the authors also highlighted the benefit of using streamflow as it presents smaller uncertainties when compared to other hydrological information that can be derived from a hydrological model our results are also in agreement with the conclusions drawn by beck et al 2017 2019 which evaluated a large group of observed precipitation data sources and concluded that the combination of data sources into one reanalysis dataset provided better estimates of precipitation the unique mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation dataset of global terrestrial precipitation dataset provides a high resolution 3 hourly temporal and 0 1 spatial resolution reanalysis dataset while it was used in our study as a reference dataset to evaluate and validate the combined dataset built its direct use for real time operations is not possible given the fact that this dataset it is not yet processed to be available in real time combined precipitation datasets are particularly useful when water managers have to operate over large areas from tens to hundred square kilometers and cannot compile different data sets in real time for each river basin under their management the use of a unique and robust precipitation dataset is an asset in operational settings and continental wide applications the fact that our combined dataset performs well compared with the mswep dataset also opens the opportunity for the future use of the mswep dataset when it will become available in real time the performance results of this study can be compared with other large scale model experiments in terms of overall performance for the nse criterion our results show the performance is higher than 0 60 for 97 of the basins and the average nse over the study area is 0 75 the kge criterion is also higher than 0 60 for all basins and the average value is 0 77 the average coefficient of correlation is 0 67 for the study basins siqueira et al 2018 using a distributed hydrological model mgb and the mswep data from beck et al 2017 as precipitation forcing obtained nse values for discharge and water levels higher than 0 60 for 55 of the studied cases and kge values higher than 0 60 in 70 of the studied cases of streamflow simulation according to the authors the global models watergap lisflood and htessel camaflood showed more than 40 of the basins in south america with an nse and a kge lower than zero when comparing the hec hms models calibrated in this study with the other experiments realized in south america we can see that the results and the performance of the hec hms models are robust and sufficient for the next step of the study which is the application of the combined precipitation dataset and the calibrated model for seasonal streamflow forecasting the combined precipitation dataset has a similar evolution of precipitation uncertainty standard deviation of annual areal precipitation errors as the reference mswep dataset notably in the periods before late 1990 s and early 2000 s the median values are however higher generally 1 higher as well as the variability of standard deviation of annual areal precipitation errors among river basins although differences in median values are more important in the period 2005 2010 median values become comparable in the more recent period despite having more information available in the recent period since satellite data is added to the trmm merge dataset the uncertainty of the combined precipitation dataset is not reduced as can be seen in the mswep dataset which presents a decrease in the variability of the standard deviation of the errors among the river basins in the period after 1998 these differences can be explained by the fact that the mswep dataset uses more information and more consistent data than real time datasets errors and inconsistencies are often present in real time datasets such as the ones used to build the combined dataset in this study so it is expected that this impacts the quality of the precipitation data despite these issues an important aspect of the combined precipitation dataset is that it provides a more homogeneous dataset over the region since no regions in the study area displayed specific patterns of errors patterns were identified previously in the cpc and trmm merge precipitation datasets reis et al 2019 with differences between the datasets growing toward the northwest of brazil after the combination of the datasets the uncertainty did not show any clear dependency on the spatial location of the river basins the trmm merge dataset used in this study was discontinued in may 2020 and now cptec provides a merge product called gpm merge based on the gpm satellite product rozante et al 2018 skofronik jackson et al 2018 it uses the new imerge retrieval algorithm which fuses the early precipitation estimates collected during the operation of the trmm satellite 2000 2015 with more recent precipitation estimates collected during the operation of the gpm satellite 2014 present https gpm nasa gov data imerg the new cptec gpm merge dataset maintains the same gage stations used at the trmm merge product and the same merg algorithm rozante et al 2010 which gives preference to the use of the station data over the satellite information rozante et al 2020 in their study comparing the old product tmpa v7 based on the trmm mission with the new products imerge and the gsmap g from jaxa rozante et al 2018 found that the imerg e and tmpa v7 show a similar behavior in terms of critical success index csi adjusted equitable threat score ets probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and bias with a better performance for imerge these characteristics make the new gpm merge the natural substitute of the discontinued trmm merge with similar behavior but with a better performance and higher resolution of 0 1 x 0 1 due the similarity of the products we believe the results obtained in our study with the trmm merge will remain valid with the use of the new gpm merge available after may 2020 the same is valid for the mswep dataset beck et al 2019 the dataset used in this study is the product version v2 2 with daily precipitation data and a 0 1 spatial resolution a comparison of the combined precipitation generated from the methodology proposed in this study with the reference mswep our benchmark dataset showed that the combined dataset has a level of uncertainty comparable with the benchmark the examples of simulated flows showed that the calibrated models can correctly represent the long term flow variations in different regions and climates in the study area the mswep product is however in constant evolution at the time of writing its current version v2 8 mswep v2 8 2021 provides data with daily and 3 hourly time resolutions and with the same 0 1 spatial resolution as mentioned earlier the complete version is still not available in real time due to the latency of some of the products used in its production mswep 2021 however this latency is reducing year after year and we believe that in the next years we will have new real time products the methodology proposed can be easily applied to consider such new products 5 conclusions in this study a sequence of steps was described that can be used to blend different real time precipitation datasets validate the results and obtain a better near real time observed precipitation forcing dataset for river basins in south america brazil and neighboring countries the methodology proposed allowed us to build a long historical period of precipitation estimates at the river basin scale which can be used in future hydrological studies such as streamflow forecasting the main conclusion of this study is that the use of hydrological data and modeling is an asset to combine and validate precipitation datasets from different sources at large river basins in views of providing a blended dataset for hydrological applications in places where rain gauges are scarce or non existing our study showed that a combination of existing precipitation datasets weighted by the annual uncertainty of each original source reduces precipitation uncertainty at the river basin scale the methodology proposed allowed us to adapt for each river basin the proportion of each precipitation source to be considered in the combined dataset taking thus into account the specific hydroclimatic characteristics of each river basin the uncertainty reduction was also observed when we analyzed the results at the daily time step with better results in terms of daily hydrological simulation when using the combined dataset than when using each precipitation source individually a drawback of combining data sources is the fact that datasets are often not available for the same period in this study we show that a possible practical solution is to extend the period of the combined precipitation dataset to cover the longest possible period given the original datasets by using the double mass curve correlation the validation of such extension was also illustrated using a hydrological model the model allows users to evaluate in terms of simulated discharges if the performance of a precipitation dataset in the extended period where not all data sources are available remains similar and consistent to the one in the original period where all data sources were available to build the combined precipitation dataset hydrological modeling proved to be a useful tool to evaluate the performance of different sources of precipitation data as also suggested recently by levy et al 2017 who highlighted the importance of the problem of data selection uncertainty when analyzing nine datasets in brazil ongoing research focuses on the different uses of the combined precipitation dataset generated in this study the main application is to generate ensemble members of the esp method for seasonal streamflow forecasting and to evaluate the performance of the esp method against streamflow forecasts based on dynamical predictions from climate models the combined precipitation dataset will also be used to evaluate the performance of precipitation forecasts issued by meteorological medium range and climate long range models and if biases are detected to apply

7786,study region mabou harbour located in cape breton island nova scotia canada is representative of the many natural harbours throughout the maritime region of canada as the surrounding landscape is overlain by glacial deposits predominantly composed of glacial till study focus understanding the pathways facilitating groundwater flow and associated solute transport to the ocean is key for developing conceptual hydrogeologic models for coastal watersheds and for informing coastal zone management most local scale field and modelling submarine groundwater discharge sgd studies have been conducted in high permeability formations given the likely importance of sgd in these coastal settings this study investigates direct sgd and indirect seaward stream baseflow groundwater discharge from a till dominated coastal aquifer using a combination of field measurements river flow and baseflow separation seepage meter measurements and water temperature analysis and a calibrated 3d numerical groundwater flow model new hydrological insights for the region results show that seaward stream baseflow greatly exceeds direct sgd to the ocean on the scale of the full harbour watershed 96 1 vs 3 9 of total groundwater discharge particle tracking shows that the vast majority of sgd originates in the subcatchment immediately surrounding the harbour with limited intermediate or regional flow the shorter flow paths and residence times for direct sgd results in less opportunity for natural attenuation processes and may have implications for groundwater borne contamination to

groundwater surface water interactions between aquifers and surface water bodies are recognised to be important drivers of water quality and the health of freshwater and marine ecosystems brunke and gonser 1997 conant et al 2019 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 moore 1999 2010 santos et al 2021 within a coastal watershed groundwater and associated solutes are transported from coastal aquifers to the marine environment directly via submarine groundwater discharge sgd burnett and dulaiova 2003 sawyer et al 2016 robinson et al 2018 or indirectly via groundwater derived stream baseflow that discharges to the ocean huang et al 2014 understanding the pathways for seaward groundwater flow and associated solute transport is a critical requirement for developing conceptual hydrologic models for coastal watersheds understanding contaminant pathways in these watersheds and constraining water and or mass budgets e g yu et al 2021 sgd fluid composition may be either fresh and or saline recirculated seawater taniguchi et al 2002 heiss and michael 2014 with fresh sgd being the main transport mechanism for terrestrially derived groundwater borne contaminants in general sgd is driven by hydraulic density or thermal gradients kohout 1967 leroux et al 2021 li et al 1999 santos et al 2012 sawyer et al 2016 taniguchi 2002 taniguchi et al 2019 fresh sgd rates and patterns depend on the coastal aquifer hydraulic conductivity k m d 1 recharge patterns in the watershed sea levels and the groundwater flow system s sawyer et al 2016 groundwater recharge rates and sea levels vary according to storm seasonal and geological time scales and control the hydraulic gradient that in turn drives the fresh sgd flux anderson and emanuel 2008 menning et al 2015 sgd estimates also vary widely due to the spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic nature of sgd processes russoniello et al 2013 researchers have used different methods to estimate the role of sgd in the global water flux such as hydrograph separation zekster and loaiciga 1993 simple calculations with hydrogeological assumptions nace 1970 radioisotopes kwon et al 2014 water balance zekster et al 1973 zhou et al 2019 numerical models luijendijk et al 2020 and literature review church 1996 the sgd contribution to the global water flux to the ocean is generally found to be less than 10 of river flow luijendijk et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2002 on a local regional scale water balance estimates can yield sgd rates that are a greater percentage of total freshwater discharge to the coast for example based on a radium 226 mass balance moore and church 1996 estimated that sgd accounted for 40 of the freshwater flux to the south atlantic bight during the study period most prior local scale field and modelling sgd studies have focused on high permeability environments given the expected importance of sgd in these coastal settings however the geology of the global coastline is highly heterogeneous zamrsky et al 2020 with large portions characterised by lower permeability materials including those at higher latitudes that are covered in glacial till focusing sgd investigations in high permeability settings may bias our understanding of sgd dynamics across spatial scales and overemphasise the influence of physical and chemical hydrogeological and marine processes driven by sgd detailed local studies in lower permeability settings e g deming et al 1992 are important to help constrain global sgd estimates luijendijk et al 2020 the goal of this study is to investigate and quantify direct sgd and indirect seaward stream baseflow groundwater discharge from a low permeability coastal watershed in eastern canada and to improve our understanding of groundwater discharge pathways to the ocean in lower permeability environments to achieve this goal a combination of field measurements seepage meters water temperature river discharge and a calibrated 3d numerical groundwater flow model were used 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site canada boasts the world s longest coastline and this coastline is diverse in terms of its geology and marine forcing lemmen et al 2016 manson et al 2019 however as noted by others e g bobba et al 2012 sgd dynamics are relatively unstudied in canada and direct sgd observations are uncommon e g chaillou et al 2018 our study area the mabou harbour drainage basin is located on cape breton island nova scotia canada fig 1 fig s1 supplement the site is representative of the many natural harbours throughout the maritime region of canada as the surrounding landscape is overlain by glacial deposits predominantly composed of glacial till this study is part of a larger investigation into hydrologic pathways and contaminant transport in the mabou harbour watershed this harbour has experienced episodic elevated bacterial levels in recent years cwrs 2021 resulting in temporary closure of aquaculture operations that are important to the local economy the region experiences a temperate humid continental climate amani et al 2019 kottek et al 2006 with a high annual precipitation estimated to be 1500 mm during the study period 2019 eccc 2021a 2021b the site is characterised by high relief fig 2c with elevations ranging from 335 m above sea level masl in the northern highlands to a bathymetric elevation of 23 masl in the deepest portion of the harbour webster et al 2017 service nova scotia and municipal relations 2003 the total drainage area is 363 1 km2 excluding the harbour the drainage basin is further broken down into three sub catchments for the southwest sw mabou 116 2 km2 northeast ne mabou 25 5 km2 and mabou rivers 175 0 km2 in addition to the harbour subcatchment 46 4 km2 which contains smaller tributaries that discharge directly into the harbour fig 1b the site is predominantly rural with a village flanking the harbour agricultural land including both active and inactive farms covers 8 30 8 km2 of the drainage basin eat 2018 the estimated water extraction from the drainage basin is estimated to be 3860 m3 d 1 based on the approved extraction rate for the municipal wellfield 511 listed residential wells and 251 active farms the estimated extraction rates for individual active farms and residential wells are 12 5 m3 d 1 and 0 64 m3 d 1 respectively most of the groundwater extracted from residential wells is returned to the groundwater system via on site wastewater systems the municipal water supply well is approved for a maximum pumping rate of 396 m3 d 1 the estimated total water extraction from the watershed is relatively small in comparison to the estimated recharge 1 mabou harbour is approximately 6 7 km2 in area including the tidal flats and is connected to the gulf of st lawrence by a narrow mouth that is approximately 55 m wide the harbour experiences a tidal amplitude ranging from approximately 0 1 m to 0 6 m with a mean of 0 3 m based on data collected from june 19 to august 28 2019 using a barometrically compensated solo3 d tidal logger rbr measuring pressure at 4 hz the mean salinity of the harbour is approximately 18 ppt with a max of 27 ppt based on data collected from two salt water conductivity loggers hobo u24 002 c installed at the mouth and interior of the harbour from june 19 to august 28 2019 fig 1c salinity varies depending on freshwater input with lowest salinities occurring after heavy precipitation events mabou harbour has a diverse and complex geology due to its location within an orogenic belt and a variety of depositional environments associated with a history of plate convergence divergence and glaciation baechler et al 2019 furthermore the site lies within the hallow fault system which manifests as a complex system of low angle thrust and high angle strike slip faults baechler 2015 pre cambrian metamorphic basement rock was uplifted forming the mabou highlands in the northern part of the study area along with silurian volcanics of variable compositions fig 2a barr et al 2017 most of the drainage basin is composed of carboniferous siliciclastics carbonates and evaporites barr et al 2017 carbonates are often present as the primary lithology or as intercalations providing ample opportunity for karstification karst landforms have been observed within the domain with most of the area categorised as being at high or medium risk of encountering karst flow systems and landforms drage and mckinnon 2019 the overburden material within the study area is heterogeneous in both composition and thickness thickness varies from tens of metres in the lowlands to thin veneers overlaying outcropping bedrock the majority of the study area is composed of lower permeability materials fig 2b such as silty or stony glacial till or mud rich organic deposits aafc 2002 stea et al 2006 however the overburden of the highlands and fluvial valleys is generally characterised by coarser more permeable materials such as colluvium residuum and alluvium stea et al 2006 coarse grained glaciofluvial and marine deposits are also present in the watershed stea et al 2006 despite the evidence that relatively permeable bedrock i e karst may be present within the watershed the coastal aquifer is generally comprised of till overlain by benthic sediments this geological information informed the development of the simplified geological model used to construct the groundwater flow model section 2 4 2 2 overview of methodology a combination of field methods and numerical modelling were employed to evaluate the partitioning of groundwater discharge between sgd and stream baseflow pathways to the harbour a three dimensional steady state groundwater flow model was used to evaluate spatial distributions of groundwater surface water interactions on a regional scale and groundwater flow paths hydrometric data were used in the development of the conceptual model and calibration of the three dimensional numerical model thermal data and seepage meter data were collected during 2019 and 2020 field campaigns respectively 2 3 field methods 2 3 1 hydrograph analysis stilling wells were installed in the rivers towards their mouths fig 1c pressure transducers hobo u20l 04 and u20 001 004 were installed in the stilling wells to continuously gauge water levels and these pressure data were corrected with local barometric pressure data complete data records were only retrieved from the mabou and ne mabou rivers fig 1b because the sw mabou river stilling well was washed away twice during flash floods stream gauging was completed with a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter using the conventional velocity area method rantz 1982 and power law equations were applied to the hydrometric data to create rating curves for each recording station di baldassarre and claps 2011 domeneghetti et al 2012 petersen øverleir 2004 a recursive signal filtering programme bflow arnold et al 1995 was used to separate baseflow from total stream flow previous studies have concluded that a filter parameter value of 0 925 yields realistic results relative to manual techniques arnold and allen 1999 nathan and mcmahon 1990 and this default for bflow was used in this study six months of flow data were available within the study area and thus for the purpose of model calibration and evaluation seasonal hydrometric data were extrapolated into annual estimates of baseflow based on full year data from surrogate cape breton island rivers with similar topography and geology johnston et al 2022 2 3 2 river thermal regimes stream temperature measurements were recorded every 30 minutes from june 20 october 22 2019 in the three major rivers using tidbit mx2203 loggers hobo affixed to the outside of the stilling wells fig 1c in radiation shields simple linear regression models between water temperature and air temperature were used to qualitatively assess and compare the relative groundwater dominance of the three rivers to supplement model evaluation stream temperature air temperature regressions with a higher intercept and lower slope are indicative of groundwater dominated conditions while those with a lower intercept and higher slope reveal runoff dominance kelleher et al 2012 mayer 2012 air temperature data were acquired from the northeast margaree aut climate station eccc 2021c for comparison daily timescales were used in this analysis and although different time scales will yield different regression specific equations caissie 2006 the relative importance of groundwater dominated conditions would remain valid 2 3 3 seepage meters seepage meters lee 1977 were installed in four different locations in the harbour fig 1c in consideration of the regional scale heterogeneity in geological and hydrogeological conditions however locations were limited to areas with public access suitable for seepage meter deployment collection bags were sampled from october 6 october 8 2020 following each tidal cycle standard approaches for constructing and installing seepage meters in marine settings were applied duque et al 2020 the equipment used in this investigation consisted of the top portion of a 55 gallon 60 cm diameter drum hydraulically connected to a plastic bag at the end of a hose the drum was inserted deep enough into the submarine sediments to form an adequate seal the volume of water within the collection bag was measured following a full tidal cycle using a graduated cylinder to capture tidal ranges during the seepage meter study period a levelogger 5 ltc water conductivity datalogger solinst was installed in the harbour at the seepage meter 2 location fig 1c and was barometrically compensated with a levelogger 5 water level datalogger solinst precipitation events occurred on october 7th and 8th with 10 75 mm and 13 8 mm respectively eccc 2021d 2021e 2 4 numerical modelling a steady state three dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed using a combination of arcmap esri 2016 modflow harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 and modelmuse winston 2019 software variable density models are typically employed in coastal groundwater models to consider density dependent flow and mixing processes e g thompson et al 2006 watson et al 2010 webb and howard 2011 however given that this study investigates the steady state groundwater discharge pathways for terrestrially sourced groundwater only fresh sgd is of concern thus variable density effects were ignored for the sake of model parsimony e g befus et al 2020 given the relatively large scale of the model the governing equation for the simulation of three dimensional steady flow of constant density groundwater in modflow is harbaugh 2005 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w 0 where k x k y k z are hydraulic conductivity k in the x y and z directions m d 1 respectively h is head m and w is the volumetric flux per unit volume of sources sinks d 1 arcmap and modelmuse were used in numerical modelling pre and post processing modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 a newton raphson formulation of modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 was the code selected for this modelling exercise modflow 2005 is an open source finite difference numerical groundwater model harbaugh 2005 that has been widely used for a variety of groundwater related investigations e g brunner et al 2010 langevin and guo 2006 lautz and siegel 2006 prommer et al 2003 the lateral extents of the model domain were based on the drainage basin boundaries this method assumes that the water table resembles a subdued replica of the topography within most of the drainage basin haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 tóth 1963 which is a common approach in groundwater modelling gauthier et al 2009 han et al 2019 hiscock and bense 2014 2 4 1 hydrostratigraphic units and grid discretization the convoluted and heterogeneous geology within the domain was separated into 11 hydrostratigraphic units hsus the bedrock geological mapping compilation for cape breton island barr et al 2017 and the surficial geology map of the province of nova scotia stea et al 2006 were used to create the hsus geologic contacts were simplified into vertical boundaries due to the generally moderate to steeply dipping orientations of the bedrock and the presumed insignificance of deep groundwater flow discussed later bedrock hsus were formed by combining similar lithostratigraphic units fig 2a based on the primary and secondary lithology from barr et al 2017 where available bedrock k approximations derived from the nova scotia well logs database kennedy and fisher 2020 were also considered when combining lithostratigraphic units the overburden hsus were defined by classifying the surficial geology units from stea et al 2006 as either fine or coarse overburden categories based on the grain size of the matrix fig 2b bedrock hsus were further subdivided into three hydrostratigraphic layers to capture the decrease in k with depth that is commonly observed e g louis 1974 manning and ingebritsen 1999 maxwell and kollet 2008 this phenomenon is also evidenced by the estimated bedrock k values derived from specific capacities batu 1998 driscoll 1986 obtained from kennedy and fisher 2020 when well depth into bedrock is plotted against hydraulic conductivity decreasing hydraulic conductivity with depth is evident for each hsu following a grid convergence analysis a 50 50 m cell size was determined to be sufficiently small to simulate the groundwater surface water interactions at the regional scale for the relevant boundary conditions while remaining coarse enough to achieve adequate model efficiency all cells in the grid that lay outside the drainage basin were set to inactive resulting in a total of 1 783 560 active cells across the domain the mesh was vertically discretized into 11 layers the first layer representing the overburden was discretized as a single layer of variable thickness determined by its observed relationship with surface elevation service nova scotia and municipal relations 2003 as a linear regression fig 3 the second hydrostratigraphic layer representing shallow bedrock was discretized into two layers immediately underlying the overburden the shallow bedrock hydrostratigraphic layer is 20 m thick for most hsus to reflect weathered bedrock the third hydrostratigraphic layer representing intermediate bedrock was discretized by four 20 m thick layers immediately underlying the shallow bedrock layer this 80 m thick hydrostratigraphic layer adequately captured the deepest water wells within the model domain that were used in model calibration kennedy and fisher 2020 the intermediate bedrock captured the hydraulic properties of relatively competent less weathered bedrock i e lower k compared to the shallow bedrock hydrostratigraphic layer the fourth and final hydrostratigraphic layer representing deeper bedrock was discretized into five layers of variable thickness extending to a depth of 200 masl very little groundwater movement is expected to occur in these deeper bedrock layers because open fractures and fracture connectivity decrease with depth cook 2003 2 4 2 boundary conditions fig 2d presents an aerial two dimensional view of the surface of the model domain and selected boundary conditions while fig s2 of the supplementary material presents a three dimensional view of the model domain no flow boundary conditions were applied to all lateral boundaries and at the base of the domain where groundwater flow is greatly diminished due to the decrease in k with depth jiang et al 2009 the upper boundary of the domain was prescribed a specified flux boundary condition to represent recharge with the magnitude of the flux depending on the overburden hsu fig 2d this specified flux boundary condition was not applied to cells within the harbour domain a general head boundary package harbaugh et al 2000 was applied to mabou harbour fig 2d given that a steady state model was used for this exercise the tidal fluctuations in the harbour were ignored and only the mean ocean head i e h 0 masl was considered the thickness of the benthic sediments used in the conductance parameter was estimated to be 1 m based on near shore field investigations and the k for this boundary package was set to equal the k of the underlying overburden such that sgd was not impeded there are many watercourses within the mabou harbour drainage basin and these were separated into four main groups the mabou river ne mabou river sw mabou river and harbour streams see rivers in fig 1b these groups were further subdivided into rivers and tributaries using arcmap esri 2016 and the nova scotia topographic database nova scotia department of lands and forestry 2020 water surface elevations were based on cut bank depths observed in the field river bottom elevations were based on stage measurements observed during stream gauging operations at near baseflow conditions the major rivers were assigned the river package harbaugh et al 2000 and the smaller tributaries were assigned the drain package harbaugh et al 2000 fig 2d unlike the river package the drain package only simulates gaining stream conditions and was selected for the smaller watercourses because it was assumed that there would be inadequate baseflow to supply aquifer recharge as these are generally lower order or ephemeral streams 2 4 3 model calibration it is assumed that the groundwater model will adequately represent the natural flow regimes of the drainage basin including the spatial patterns of groundwater surface water interactions based on the calibration of the model to static water levels in wells and baseflow estimates in watercourses each hsu was calibrated for hydraulic conductivity including unique values for each bedrock hydrostratigraphic layer i e shallow bedrock intermediate bedrock and deep bedrock a single anisotropy value was calibrated to all hsus in consideration of parsimony given the number of hsus and geological complexity a combination of automated calibration facilitated by the pest model independent parameter estimation software doherty and hunt 2010 and manual calibration were used in general the model was automatically calibrated to water levels and baseflow observation manual calibration was only employed for insensitive areas of the model domain where no calibration points were available particularly the crystalline highlands in the south of the domain 5 of model area fig 2a static water levels for 88 wells from the nova scotia well logs database kennedy and fisher 2020 in the watershed fig 2d were used to calibrate the hydraulic properties and functioning of the hsus given the large scale and relief of the domain slight inaccuracies and temporal variations in static water level measurements are assumed to have a relatively low impact on model results to quantify the relationship between statistical weight and geospatial precision residuals between observed and simulated water levels were weighted by normalising them to the maximum georeferencing precision the magnitude of georeferencing precision depends on the method for instance the highest precision is associated with gps recorded locations 15 m and was assigned a calibration weight of 11 the lowest precision are based on the centroid of utm grids 1130 m and were given a calibration weight of 1 although the lowest georeferencing precision may result in higher uncertainty of static water levels these values are still reasonable given the watershed area 363 1 km2 calibration to static water levels alone is generally ineffective without prior knowledge of recharge magnitudes and preferably spatial patterns doing so results in equifinality of model parameters as any given combination that follows the same recharge k ratio can yield the same piezometric surface hill and osterby 2003 to eliminate this issue baseflow observations were used to condition the calibration of recharge recharge was calibrated for two zones which correspond to the fine and coarse overburden hydrostratigraphic units fig 2b based on the assumption that the permeability of the overburden is the primary control on recharge rates within the domain in this temperate humid continental climate 3 results and discussion 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 hydrometric analysis hydrometric analysis produces estimates of baseflow or indirect groundwater discharge to the harbour fitting the discharge measurements to stream stage produced rating curve correlation coefficients of 0 996 and 0 971 for the mabou and ne mabou rivers respectively the high correlation coefficients indicate that rating curves are sufficiently accurate for low discharges however due to a lack of observations at high discharges the rating curves were not constrained for high streamflow following heavy precipitation events however the present study focuses on baseflow which is generally constrained within the portion of the stage discharge relationship informed by direct flow measurements based on the hydrograph separation the baseflow index bfi is substantially higher in the ne mabou river watershed in comparison to the mabou river watershed 0 68 vs 0 46 presumably due to coarse grained overburden fig 2b including residuum colluvium and alluvium dominating the surficial geology stea et al 2006 the mabou and ne mabou river bfis agree with hydrometric data from the water survey of canada for nearby surrogate watersheds with similar topography and surficial geology i e river inhabitants and maclennan s cross respectively eccc 2021d 2021e additionally the bfi for ne mabou river agrees with the bfi determined for the nearby april brook watershed 0 65 türker 1969 which shares similar geological and topographical characteristics as noted previously hydrometric analysis in the sw mabou river was precluded due to the stilling well failures during two different extreme flood events 3 1 2 river thermal regimes the river thermal analysis was applied as an independent approach to assess the relative groundwater dominance of the three rivers flowing to mabou harbour fig 1 the simple linear regression models fig 4a explain 81 83 of the variability in stream temperatures as indicated by the coefficients of determination r2 the shallower slope 0 51 for the ne mabou river suggests that it has the greatest groundwater dominance followed by the mabou 0 77 and sw mabou 0 99 rivers the rivers have thermal sensitivities that are within the range of other nova scotia rivers evaluated with univariate linear regression models macmillan et al 2005 the regression intercepts are 5 39 c 4 12 c and 3 27 c for the ne mabou mabou and sw mabou rivers respectively again suggesting the same order of relative groundwater dominance among the three rivers as the regression slopes and bfi analysis kelleher et al 2012 mackey and berrie 1991 mayer 2012 smith 1981 these intercepts are consistent with those observed in past studies of streams with high groundwater components e g mackey and berrie 1991 based on the assumption that groundwater dominated rivers experience smaller diel temperature variations caissie 2006 the diel thermal range results for the three rivers fig 4b also indicate the same hierarchy of groundwater dominance between the three rivers both the simple regression models and the diel variations show that the sw mabou river is strongly correlated with air temperature slope 0 99 indicating that the thermal regime is controlled by atmospheric heat fluxes and not by groundwater inflows it should be noted that other factors besides groundwater inflow such as stream aspect tree cover stream size and fluvial geomorphology can also influence these regression relationships caissie 2006 dugdale et al 2018 macan 1958 mosley 1983 torgersen et al 2001 zwieniecki and newton 1999 however given the proximity and similar geomorphology and landcover among the three watersheds we assume that the differences among the thermal regression relationships for the three rivers is primarily attributable to their respective bfis 3 1 3 seepage meters the measured seepage meter fluxes are presented as darcy fluxes across tidal cycles in table 1 the mean fluxes observed at the different seepage meter stations varied by an order of magnitude the maximum observed flux was 2 2 10 2 m d 1 seepage meter 2 and the minimum was 3 1 10 4 m d 1 seepage meter 3 tidal amplitudes on october 7 8 2020 ranged from 0 26 to 0 30 m tidal data for october 6 2020 were not collected some sites exhibited strong variability between tidal cycles which can be attributed to increased recharge following precipitation events driving a greater seaward flow of fresh groundwater the mean darcy flux and standard deviation for sgd among the four locations was 7 6 10 3 6 9 10 3 m d 1 the large standard deviation 91 of mean flux indicates strong heterogeneity in sgd in agreement with the literature e g taniguchi et al 2006 stieglitz et al 2008 for example even in coastlines with significantly higher sgd fluxes such as waquoit bay massachusetts with fluxes as high as 0 75 m d 1 spatial standard deviations were approximately half of the mean discharge rate michael et al 2003 3 2 numerical modelling 3 2 1 model statistics and calibrated results the calibrated numerical modelling results were first assessed via comparison to monitoring data the mean residual for all head observations fig 5 was 1 91 m indicating an overall equal spread around the identity line with a slight bias for positive residuals particularly at high elevations 130 masl the mean absolute residual is 6 97 m which may be explained partially by georeferencing precision fig 5 the uncertainty associated with the 10 m accuracy and 20 m resolution dem and the interpolation of the dem on a 50 m mesh the root mean squared error rmse is 8 99 m which is relatively low given the range in water level observations fig 6a the normalised rmse rmse water level observation range is 3 6 which is well within the threshold for adequate model performance 10 spitz and moreno 1996 anderson et al 2015 the coefficient of determination 0 985 indicates a strong positive relationship between observed and simulated heads fig 5 fine overburden recharge was the most sensitive parameter fig s3 in general the shallow hydrostratigraphic layer k values are the most sensitive hydraulic conductivity parameters and the deep bedrock k is the least sensitive fig s3 supplement head and baseflow simulations exhibited negligible sensitivities to vertical anisotropy and river conductance the generally low sensitivity of deep bedrock k x parameters which are overall similar in magnitude suggest that the simplification of geological contacts will have little impact on the head distribution in upper layers and on the groundwater surface water interactions the optimised parameter values from the calibration process are presented in table 2 overall the calibrated k values for the overburden and shallow bedrock are closer to the upper end of the expected range however the shallow bedrock hsus agree with pumping tests for municipal wells and k estimates based on well yields estimates kennedy 2020 kennedy and fisher 2020 although relatively high the overburden k values are also consistent with those reported for unconsolidated quaternary sediments and glacial till within the region aafc 2002 rivard et al 2008 rivard et al 2012 the relatively high k values in the shallow bedrock layers of gypsum and anhydrite sandstone and siltstone and limestone hsus suggest areas of karstification that are corroborated by the delineation of these features on the karst risk map of nova scotia drage and mckinnon 2019 the calibration results exhibited a decrease of k with depth that is consistent with the conceptual model and the k depth relationships presented by the historical well yield estimates kennedy and fisher 2020 river conductance corresponds to a riverbed k of 4 8 and 296 m d 1 for cells that reside in the fine and coarse overburden respectively drain conductance corresponds to a streambed k of 37 m d 1 in the fine overburden and 2 2 103 m d 1 in the coarse overburden these values generally agree with those reported for riverbeds and alluvial sand and gravel domenico and schwartz 1990 duwelius 1996 calibrated recharge rates within the fine and coarse overburden were 377 and 852 mm yr 1 respectively with an estimated annual precipitation of 1500 mm eccc 2021a 2021b the recharge coefficients are approximately 25 and 57 for the fine and coarse overburden respectively the calibrated recharge coefficients agree with those reported for watersheds with similar geology and climate conditions knott and olimpio 1986 misstear et al 2009 türker 1969 but are higher than other regional estimates e g kennedy et al 2010 recharge within the bounds of the granitoid bedrock of the southern hills of the domain 5 of model surface area an insensitive area lacking observational data was decreased by 60 in response to the simulated water table exceeding the model surface the resulting recharge rate is comparable to those reported for granitoid bedrock in guysborough county nova scotia slr consulting 2015 recharge was lowered rather than increasing k to unreasonable levels based on the conceptual model the water table is expected to be shallow in the southern hills due to the low hydraulic conductivity which would limit drainage the water table depth was generally less than 15 m below the model surface and often less than 5 m particularly in riparian zones fig 6 b depth to groundwater was greatest in the highland areas dominated by more permeable sandstone lithologies figs 2 and 6 in general model results suggest that the head distribution is a subdued replica of the topography with the lowest head in the vicinity of the harbour and the highest in the highlands to the north and south of the domain fig 6 3 2 2 modelled water balance the modelled water balance is presented in table 3 the recharge boundary condition accounted for most of the inflow to the groundwater system followed by the river boundaries extracted groundwater was negligible 1 compared to the recharge across the catchment negligible inflow occurred from the harbour as transient e g tide induced circulation and variable density conditions were ignored for this exercise drains representing smaller order and ephemeral streams accounted for the largest proportion of outflow followed by rivers and then general head boundary nodes in the harbour i e sgd fresh sgd accounted for only 3 9 of groundwater discharge to the harbour with the remaining 96 1 corresponding to baseflow model results were also used to assess how groundwater discharge is partitioned between direct and indirect pathways on the subcatchment scale rather than the full watershed particle tracking indicated that the vast majority of sgd originates in the harbour subcatchment with little contribution from regional or intermediate groundwater flow fig 7 within this harbour subcatchment fig 1 about 30 of terrestrially sourced groundwater discharge was partitioned into sgd rather than stream baseflow based on the assumption that all sgd is derived from within the subcatchment the fresh sgd estimates on either scale full harbour watershed and harbour subcatchment are comparable to proportions presented in the literature luijendijk et al 2020 polemio and limoni 2006 russoniello et al 2016 for example luijendijk et al 2020 used spatially resolved global models to determine that near coast discharge and sgd account for 0 2 26 of recharge in coastal watersheds furthermore it is expected that groundwater derived baseflow i e from streams would dominate over direct groundwater discharge in the harbour due to the shallow water table depth observed throughout most of the study area fig 6 russoniello et al 2016 the modelled outflows listed in table 3b also supports the relative groundwater dominance of the three tributaries as revealed through the field data sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 based on the model results the ne mabou river contributed 11 7 of the groundwater discharge in the watershed despite making up only 5 8 of the catchment area table 3b in contrast the mabou river received 47 3 of the groundwater discharge 48 2 of area and the sw mabou river received 28 3 of the groundwater discharge 32 0 of area collectively these simulated discharge values normalised to their respective areas support the field results and reveal that the tributaries can be ranked in decreasing order of groundwater dominance as the ne mabou river the mabou river and the sw river modelled fresh sgd on the harbour scale ranged from 0 003 to 0 123 m d 1 with a mean and standard deviation of 2 10 3 6 10 3 m d 1 the highest fluxes were generally on the order of 0 010 m d 1 and occurred where hydraulic gradients were steepest or in areas that correspond with coarse overburden the majority of the simulated fresh sgd occurred within 50 100 m of the shoreline which is consistent with the literature taniguchi et al 2002 sawyer et al 2016 the mean flux and standard deviation for modelled sgd within 50 m of the coastline were 7 6 10 3 9 6 10 3 m d 1 the simulated values are consistent with our seepage meter measurements tables 1 3 however caution is required when comparing the results of the two methods as they capture different time periods furthermore the seepage meter distribution and short sample period may not capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of sgd particularly on the harbour scale the model results yield fresh sgd rates that are lower than what is generally published in the literature however as previously noted we expected our rates to be lower than most previous studies given the bias of past field measurements towards high permeability coastal zones where sgd would be more important other studies in the arctic and baltic seas report sgd estimates less than 0 001 m d 1 deming et al 1992 piekarek jankowska 1996 however the different recharge or permafrost conditions may complicate comparisons it is important to note that although fresh and total sgd rates often differ substantially taniguchi 2002 taniguchi et al 2002 wilson 2005 we expect that fresh and total sgd rates would be comparable in this harbour because the high recharge and relief coupled with a lower permeability coastal aquifer likely impedes forces driving recirculated sgd such as tidal pumping for example water levels in a tidal piezometer only 17 5 m from the high tide mark fig 1c did not exhibit any semi diurnal oscillations despite the 0 58 m tidal range mean in this harbour overburden and shallow bedrock are important aquifers in the drainage basin that account for the majority of groundwater flow table 3 coarse sediments 17 of surface area disproportionately accounted for 44 of the simulated groundwater flow from shallow bedrock into overburden in general there is more bedrock discharge occurring in areas with coarse overburden which is consistent with expectations for the study area the local flow regime dominates the domain s flow system as only 7 6 and 0 6 of groundwater flow occurs in the intermediate and deep bedrock respectively kennedy et al 2010 suggested that groundwater systems are relatively shallow in nova scotia and that the majority of the flow occurs in the upper 150 m this is in agreement with model results which indicated that 99 4 of flow occurs in the upper 100 m of bedrock related ongoing research investigations in the mabou harbour watershed are focused on contaminant transport and these shorter groundwater pathways may have implications for groundwater borne contaminants also many of the major contaminated sites within the province of nova scotia such as boat harbour and the sydney tar ponds king et al 2003 lee and jones lee 2006 are found in coastal watersheds with till dominated landscapes making the groundwater pathway findings from this study relevant for the wider canadian maritime region 4 conclusions both the field methods and numerical modelling indicate that fresh sgd is a minor component of total groundwater input to the harbour from our study area watershed which is characterised by high relief and relatively low permeability coastal aquifers field data and modelling results also indicate the same relative hierarchy in baseflow dominance for the three main tributaries to the harbour darcy flux estimates from seepage meter measurements yielded a mean and standard deviation of 7 6 10 3 m d 1 0 0069 for total sgd within 50 m of the coastline similarly simulation results yielded a mean and standard deviation of 7 6 10 3 m d 1 0 0096 for fresh sgd restricted to the model domain within 50 m of the coastline on the scale of the full watershed the fresh sgd output corresponds to 3 9 of total terrestrially sourced groundwater discharge to the harbour compared to 96 1 from groundwater derived stream baseflow conversely on a subcatchment scale immediately surrounding the harbour which is independent of the catchments for the major tributaries fresh sgd is more significant 30 of total terrestrially sourced groundwater discharge to the harbour the water budgets of the hydrostratigraphic layers represented by the model indicate that local groundwater flow through the overburden and shallow bedrock dominates within the drainage basin 92 of groundwater flow the majority of fresh sgd is expected to originate within the harbour subcatchment with insignificant contributions from the regional flow regime i e intercatchment flow this prevalence of local flow regimes promotes the dominance of groundwater derived stream baseflow in coastal watersheds this results in a lower importance of fresh sgd compared to the total groundwater direct and indirect via sgd and stream baseflow discharge to the marine environment little emphasis has been placed on sgd in lower permeability coastal aquifers such as the till dominated landscape of this study area therefore these results will help broaden the understanding of sgd in glacial sediments and address the general lack of direct sgd measurements in settings other than permeable materials such as marine sand or glacial outwash given that canada contains 243 000 km of coastline lemmen 2016 and that vast lengths of the canadian coastline are dominated by glacial till and derivative sediments this study yields useful insight into how groundwater discharge is partitioned between fresh sgd and groundwater derived stream baseflow in such environments the results also have direct relevance for understanding pathways for groundwater borne contaminants in contaminated

overlain by glacial deposits predominantly composed of glacial till study focus understanding the pathways facilitating groundwater flow and associated solute transport to the ocean is key for developing conceptual hydrogeologic models for coastal watersheds and for informing coastal zone management most local scale field and modelling submarine groundwater discharge sgd studies have been conducted in high permeability formations given the likely importance of sgd in these coastal settings this study investigates direct sgd and indirect seaward stream baseflow groundwater discharge from a till dominated coastal aquifer using a combination of field measurements river flow and baseflow separation seepage meter measurements and water temperature analysis and a calibrated 3d numerical groundwater flow model new hydrological insights for the region results show that seaward stream baseflow greatly exceeds direct sgd to the ocean on the scale of the full harbour watershed 96 1 vs 3 9 of total groundwater discharge particle tracking shows that the vast majority of sgd originates in the subcatchment immediately surrounding the harbour with limited intermediate or regional flow the shorter flow paths and residence times for direct sgd results in less opportunity for natural attenuation processes and may have implications for groundwater borne contamination to

gonser 1997 conant et al 2019 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 moore 1999 2010 santos et al 2021 within a coastal watershed groundwater and associated solutes are transported from coastal aquifers to the

widely due to the spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic nature of sgd processes russoniello et al 2013 researchers have used different methods to estimate the role of sgd in the global water

2019 numerical models luijendijk et al 2020 and literature review church 1996 the sgd contribution to the global water flux to the ocean is generally found to be less than 10 of river flow luijendijk et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2002 on a local regional scale water balance estimates can yield sgd rates that are a greater percentage of total freshwater discharge to the coast for example based on a radium 226 mass balance moore and church 1996 estimated that sgd accounted for 40 of the freshwater flux to the south atlantic bight during the study period most prior local scale field and modelling sgd studies have focused on high permeability environments given the expected importance of sgd in these coastal settings however the geology of the global coastline is highly heterogeneous zamrsky et al 2020 with large portions characterised by lower permeability materials including those at higher latitudes that are covered in glacial till focusing sgd investigations in high permeability settings may bias our understanding of sgd dynamics across spatial scales and overemphasise the influence of physical and chemical hydrogeological and marine processes driven by sgd detailed local studies in lower permeability settings e g deming et al 1992 are important to help constrain global sgd estimates luijendijk et al 2020 the goal of this study is to investigate and quantify direct sgd and indirect seaward stream baseflow groundwater discharge from a low permeability coastal watershed in eastern canada and to improve our understanding of groundwater discharge pathways to the ocean in lower permeability environments to achieve this goal a combination of field measurements seepage meters water temperature river discharge and a calibrated 3d numerical groundwater flow model were used

as noted by others e g bobba et al 2012 sgd dynamics are relatively unstudied in canada and direct sgd observations are uncommon e g chaillou et al 2018 our study area the mabou harbour drainage basin

landscape is overlain by glacial deposits predominantly composed of glacial till this study is part of a larger investigation into hydrologic pathways and contaminant transport in the mabou harbour watershed this harbour has experienced episodic elevated bacterial levels in recent years cwrs 2021 resulting in temporary closure of aquaculture operations that are important to the local economy the region experiences a temperate humid continental climate amani et al 2019 kottek et al 2006 with a high annual precipitation estimated to be 1500 mm during the study period 2019 eccc 2021a 2021b the

harbour webster et al 2017 service nova scotia and municipal relations 2003 the total drainage area is 363 1 km2 excluding the harbour the drainage basin is further broken down into three sub catchments for the southwest sw mabou 116 2 km2 northeast ne mabou 25 5 km2 and mabou rivers 175 0 km2 in addition to the harbour subcatchment 46 4 km2 which contains smaller tributaries that discharge directly into the harbour fig 1b the site is predominantly rural with a village flanking the harbour agricultural land including both active and inactive farms covers 8 30 8 km2 of the drainage basin eat 2018 the estimated water extraction from the drainage basin is estimated to be 3860 m3 d 1 based on the approved extraction rate for the municipal wellfield 511 listed residential wells and 251 active farms the estimated extraction rates for individual active farms and residential wells are 12 5 m3 d 1 and 0 64 m3 d 1 respectively most of the groundwater extracted from residential wells is returned to the groundwater system via on site wastewater systems the municipal water supply well is approved for a maximum pumping rate of 396 m3 d 1 the estimated total water extraction from the watershed is relatively small in comparison to the estimated recharge 1 mabou harbour is approximately 6 7 km2 in area including the tidal flats and is connected to the gulf of st lawrence by a narrow mouth that is approximately 55 m wide the harbour experiences a tidal amplitude ranging from approximately 0 1 m to 0 6 m with a mean of 0 3 m based on data collected from june 19 to august 28 2019 using a barometrically compensated solo3 d tidal logger rbr measuring pressure at 4 hz the mean salinity of the harbour is approximately 18 ppt with a max of 27 ppt based on data collected from two salt water conductivity loggers hobo u24 002 c installed at the mouth and interior of the harbour from june 19 to august 28 2019 fig 1c salinity varies depending on freshwater input with lowest salinities occurring after heavy precipitation events mabou harbour has a diverse and complex geology due to its location within an orogenic belt and a variety of depositional environments associated with a history of plate convergence divergence and glaciation baechler et al 2019 furthermore the site lies within the hallow fault system which manifests as a complex system of low angle thrust and high angle strike slip faults baechler 2015 pre cambrian metamorphic basement rock was uplifted forming the mabou highlands in the northern part of the study area along with silurian volcanics of variable compositions fig 2a barr et al 2017 most of the drainage basin is composed of carboniferous siliciclastics carbonates and evaporites barr et al 2017 carbonates are often present as the primary lithology or as intercalations providing ample opportunity for karstification karst landforms have been observed within the domain with most of the area categorised as being at high or medium risk of encountering karst flow systems and landforms drage and mckinnon 2019 the overburden material within the study area is heterogeneous in both composition and thickness thickness varies from tens of metres in the lowlands to thin veneers overlaying outcropping bedrock the majority of the study area is composed of lower permeability materials fig 2b such as silty or stony glacial till or mud rich organic deposits aafc 2002 stea et al 2006 however the overburden of the highlands and fluvial valleys is generally characterised by coarser more permeable materials such as colluvium residuum and alluvium stea et al 2006 coarse grained glaciofluvial and marine deposits are also present in the watershed stea et al 2006 despite the evidence that relatively permeable bedrock i e karst may be present within the watershed the coastal aquifer is generally comprised of till overlain by benthic sediments this geological information informed the development of the simplified geological model used to construct the groundwater flow model section 2 4 2 2 overview of methodology a combination of field methods and numerical modelling were employed to evaluate the partitioning of groundwater discharge between sgd and stream baseflow pathways to the harbour a three dimensional steady state groundwater flow model was used to evaluate spatial distributions of groundwater surface water interactions on a regional scale and groundwater flow paths hydrometric data were used in the development of the conceptual model and calibration of the three dimensional numerical model thermal data and seepage meter data were collected during 2019 and 2020 field campaigns respectively 2 3 field methods 2 3 1 hydrograph analysis stilling wells were installed in the rivers towards their mouths fig 1c pressure transducers hobo u20l 04 and u20 001 004 were installed in the stilling wells to continuously gauge water levels and these pressure data were corrected with local barometric pressure data complete data records were only retrieved from the mabou and ne mabou rivers fig 1b because the sw mabou river stilling well was washed away twice during flash floods stream gauging was completed with a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter using the conventional velocity area method rantz 1982 and power law equations were applied to the hydrometric data to create rating curves for each recording station di baldassarre and claps 2011 domeneghetti et al 2012 petersen øverleir 2004 a recursive signal filtering programme bflow arnold et al 1995 was used to separate baseflow from total stream flow previous studies have concluded that a filter parameter value of 0 925 yields realistic results relative to manual techniques arnold and allen 1999 nathan and mcmahon 1990 and this default for bflow was used in this study six months of flow data were available within the study area and thus for the purpose of model calibration and evaluation seasonal hydrometric data were extrapolated into annual estimates of baseflow based on full year data from surrogate cape breton island rivers with similar topography and geology johnston et al 2022 2 3 2 river thermal regimes stream temperature measurements were recorded every 30 minutes from june 20 october 22 2019 in the three major rivers using tidbit mx2203 loggers hobo affixed to the outside of the stilling wells fig 1c in radiation shields simple linear regression models between water temperature and air temperature were used to qualitatively assess and compare the relative groundwater dominance of the three rivers to supplement model evaluation stream temperature air temperature regressions with a higher intercept and lower slope are indicative of groundwater dominated conditions while those with a lower intercept and higher slope reveal runoff dominance kelleher et al 2012 mayer 2012 air temperature data were acquired from the northeast margaree aut climate station eccc 2021c for comparison daily timescales were used in this analysis and although different time scales will yield different regression specific equations caissie 2006 the relative importance of groundwater dominated conditions would remain valid 2 3 3 seepage meters seepage meters lee 1977 were installed in four different locations in the harbour fig 1c in consideration of the regional scale heterogeneity in geological and hydrogeological conditions however locations were limited to areas with public access suitable for seepage meter deployment collection bags were sampled from october 6 october 8 2020 following each tidal cycle standard approaches for constructing and installing seepage meters in marine settings were applied duque et al 2020 the equipment used in this investigation consisted of the top portion of a 55 gallon 60 cm diameter drum hydraulically connected to a plastic bag at the end of a hose the drum was inserted deep enough into the submarine sediments to form an adequate seal the volume of water within the collection bag was measured following a full tidal cycle using a graduated cylinder to capture tidal ranges during the seepage meter study period a levelogger 5 ltc water conductivity datalogger solinst was installed in the harbour at the seepage meter 2 location fig 1c and was barometrically compensated with a levelogger 5 water level datalogger solinst precipitation events occurred on october 7th and 8th with 10 75 mm and 13 8 mm respectively eccc 2021d 2021e 2 4 numerical modelling a steady state three dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed using a combination of arcmap esri 2016 modflow harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2011 and modelmuse winston 2019 software variable density models are typically employed in coastal groundwater models to consider density dependent flow and mixing processes e g thompson et al 2006 watson et al 2010 webb and howard 2011 however given that this study investigates the steady state groundwater discharge pathways for terrestrially sourced groundwater only fresh sgd is of concern thus variable density effects were ignored for the sake of model parsimony e g befus et al 2020 given the relatively large scale of the model the governing equation for the simulation of three dimensional steady flow of constant density groundwater in modflow is harbaugh 2005 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w 0 where k x k y k z are hydraulic conductivity k in the x y and z directions m d 1 respectively h is head m and w is the volumetric flux per unit volume of sources sinks d 1 arcmap and modelmuse were used in numerical modelling pre and post processing modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 a newton raphson formulation of modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 was the code selected for this modelling exercise modflow 2005 is an open source finite difference numerical groundwater model harbaugh 2005 that has been widely used for a variety of groundwater related investigations e g brunner et al 2010 langevin and guo 2006 lautz and siegel 2006 prommer et al 2003 the lateral extents of the model domain were based on the drainage basin boundaries this method assumes that the water table resembles a subdued replica of the topography within most of the drainage basin haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 tóth 1963 which is a common approach in groundwater modelling gauthier et al 2009 han et al 2019 hiscock and bense 2014 2 4 1 hydrostratigraphic units and grid discretization the convoluted and heterogeneous geology within the domain was separated into 11 hydrostratigraphic units hsus the bedrock geological mapping compilation for cape breton island barr et al 2017 and the surficial geology map of the province of nova scotia stea et al 2006 were used to create the hsus geologic contacts were simplified into vertical boundaries due to the generally moderate to steeply dipping orientations of the bedrock and the presumed insignificance of deep groundwater flow discussed later bedrock hsus were formed by combining similar lithostratigraphic units fig 2a based on the primary and secondary lithology from barr et al 2017 where available bedrock k approximations derived from the nova scotia well logs database kennedy and fisher 2020 were also considered when combining lithostratigraphic units the overburden hsus were defined by classifying the surficial geology units from stea et al 2006 as either fine or coarse overburden categories based on the grain size of the matrix fig 2b bedrock hsus were further subdivided into three hydrostratigraphic layers to capture the decrease in k with depth that is commonly observed e g louis 1974 manning and ingebritsen 1999 maxwell and kollet 2008 this phenomenon is also evidenced by the estimated bedrock k values derived from specific capacities batu 1998 driscoll 1986 obtained from kennedy and fisher 2020 when well depth into bedrock is plotted against hydraulic conductivity decreasing hydraulic conductivity with depth is evident for each hsu following a grid convergence analysis a 50 50 m cell size was determined to be sufficiently small to simulate the groundwater surface water interactions at the regional scale for the relevant boundary conditions while remaining coarse enough to achieve adequate model efficiency all cells in the grid that lay outside the drainage basin were set to inactive resulting in a total of 1 783 560 active cells across the domain the mesh was vertically discretized into 11 layers the first layer representing the overburden was discretized as a single layer of variable thickness determined by its observed relationship with surface elevation service nova scotia and municipal relations 2003 as a linear regression fig 3 the second hydrostratigraphic layer representing shallow bedrock was discretized into two layers immediately underlying the overburden the shallow bedrock hydrostratigraphic layer is 20 m thick for most hsus to reflect weathered bedrock the third hydrostratigraphic layer representing intermediate bedrock was discretized by four 20 m thick layers immediately underlying the shallow bedrock layer this 80 m thick hydrostratigraphic layer adequately captured the deepest water wells within the model domain that were used in model calibration kennedy and fisher 2020 the intermediate bedrock captured the hydraulic properties of relatively competent less weathered bedrock i e lower k compared to the shallow bedrock hydrostratigraphic layer the fourth and final hydrostratigraphic layer representing deeper bedrock was discretized into five layers of variable thickness extending to a depth of 200 masl very little groundwater movement is expected to occur in these deeper bedrock layers because open fractures and fracture connectivity decrease with depth cook 2003 2 4 2 boundary conditions fig 2d presents an aerial two dimensional view of the surface of the model domain and selected boundary conditions while fig s2 of the supplementary material presents a three dimensional view of the model domain no flow boundary conditions were applied to all lateral boundaries and at the base of the domain where groundwater flow is greatly diminished due to the decrease in k with depth jiang et al 2009 the upper boundary of the domain was prescribed a specified flux boundary condition to represent recharge with the magnitude of the flux depending on the overburden hsu fig 2d this specified flux boundary condition was not applied to cells within the harbour domain a general head boundary package harbaugh et al 2000 was applied to mabou harbour fig 2d given that a steady state model was used for this exercise the tidal fluctuations in the harbour were ignored and only the mean ocean head i e h 0 masl was considered the thickness of the benthic sediments used in the conductance parameter was estimated to be 1 m based on near shore field investigations and the k for this boundary package was set to equal the k of the underlying overburden such that sgd was not impeded there are many watercourses within the mabou harbour drainage basin and these were separated into four main groups the mabou river ne mabou river sw mabou river and harbour streams see rivers in fig 1b these groups were further subdivided into rivers and tributaries using arcmap esri 2016 and the nova scotia topographic database nova scotia department of lands and forestry 2020 water surface elevations were based on cut bank depths observed in the field river bottom elevations were based on stage measurements observed during stream gauging operations at near baseflow conditions the major rivers were assigned the river package harbaugh et al 2000 and the smaller tributaries were assigned the drain package harbaugh et al 2000 fig 2d unlike the river package the drain package only simulates gaining stream conditions and was selected for the smaller watercourses because it was assumed that there would be inadequate baseflow to supply aquifer recharge as these are generally lower order or ephemeral streams 2 4 3 model calibration it is assumed that the groundwater model will adequately represent the natural flow regimes of the drainage basin including the spatial patterns of groundwater surface water interactions based on the calibration of the model to static water levels in wells and baseflow estimates in watercourses each hsu was calibrated for hydraulic conductivity including unique values for each bedrock hydrostratigraphic layer i e shallow bedrock intermediate bedrock and deep bedrock a single anisotropy value was calibrated to all hsus in consideration of parsimony given the number of hsus and geological complexity a combination of automated calibration facilitated by the pest model independent parameter estimation software doherty and hunt 2010 and manual calibration were used in general the model was automatically calibrated to water levels and baseflow observation manual calibration was only employed for insensitive areas of the model domain where no calibration points were available particularly the crystalline highlands in the south of the domain 5 of model area fig 2a static water levels for 88 wells from the nova scotia well logs database kennedy and fisher 2020 in the watershed fig 2d were used to calibrate the hydraulic properties and functioning of the hsus given the large scale and relief of the domain slight inaccuracies and temporal variations in static water level measurements are assumed to have a relatively low impact on model results to quantify the relationship between statistical weight and geospatial precision residuals between observed and simulated water levels were weighted by normalising them to the maximum georeferencing precision the magnitude of georeferencing precision depends on the method for instance the highest precision is associated with gps recorded locations 15 m and was assigned a calibration weight of 11 the lowest precision are based on the centroid of utm grids 1130 m and were given a calibration weight of 1 although the lowest georeferencing precision may result in higher uncertainty of static water levels these values are still reasonable given the watershed area 363 1 km2 calibration to static water levels alone is generally ineffective without prior knowledge of recharge magnitudes and preferably spatial patterns doing so results in equifinality of model parameters as any given combination that follows the same recharge k ratio can yield the same piezometric surface hill and osterby 2003 to eliminate this issue baseflow observations were used to condition the calibration of recharge recharge was calibrated for two zones which correspond to the fine and coarse overburden hydrostratigraphic units fig 2b based on the assumption that the permeability of the overburden is the primary control on recharge rates within the domain in this temperate humid continental climate 3 results and discussion 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 hydrometric analysis hydrometric analysis produces estimates of baseflow or indirect groundwater discharge to the harbour fitting the discharge measurements to stream stage produced rating curve correlation coefficients of 0 996 and 0 971 for the mabou and ne mabou rivers respectively the high correlation coefficients indicate that rating curves are sufficiently accurate for low discharges however due to a lack of observations at high discharges the rating curves were not constrained for high streamflow following heavy precipitation events however the present study focuses on baseflow which is generally constrained within the portion of the stage discharge relationship informed by direct flow measurements based on the hydrograph separation the baseflow index bfi is substantially higher in the ne mabou river watershed in comparison to the mabou river watershed 0 68 vs 0 46 presumably due to coarse grained overburden fig 2b including residuum colluvium and alluvium dominating the surficial geology stea et al 2006 the mabou and ne mabou river bfis agree with hydrometric data from the water survey of canada for nearby surrogate watersheds with similar topography and surficial geology i e river inhabitants and maclennan s cross respectively eccc 2021d 2021e additionally the bfi for ne mabou river agrees with the bfi determined for the nearby april brook watershed 0 65 türker 1969 which shares similar geological and topographical characteristics as noted previously hydrometric analysis in the sw mabou river was precluded due to the stilling well failures during two different extreme flood events 3 1 2 river thermal regimes the river thermal analysis was applied as an independent approach to assess the relative groundwater dominance of the three rivers flowing to mabou harbour fig 1 the simple linear regression models fig 4a explain 81 83 of the variability in stream temperatures as indicated by the coefficients of determination r2 the shallower slope 0 51 for the ne mabou river suggests that it has the greatest groundwater dominance followed by the mabou 0 77 and sw mabou 0 99 rivers the rivers have thermal sensitivities that are within the range of other nova scotia rivers evaluated with univariate linear regression models macmillan et al 2005 the regression intercepts are 5 39 c 4 12 c and 3 27 c for the ne mabou mabou and sw mabou rivers respectively again suggesting the same order of relative groundwater dominance among the three rivers as the regression slopes and bfi analysis kelleher et al 2012 mackey and berrie 1991 mayer 2012 smith 1981 these intercepts are consistent with those observed in past studies of streams with high groundwater components e g mackey and berrie 1991 based on the assumption that groundwater dominated rivers experience smaller diel temperature variations caissie 2006 the diel thermal range results for the three rivers fig 4b also indicate the same hierarchy of groundwater dominance between the three rivers both the simple regression models and the diel variations show that the sw mabou river is strongly correlated with air temperature slope 0 99 indicating that the thermal regime is controlled by atmospheric heat fluxes and not by groundwater inflows it should be noted that other factors besides groundwater inflow such as stream aspect tree cover stream size and fluvial geomorphology can also influence these regression relationships caissie 2006 dugdale et al 2018 macan 1958 mosley 1983 torgersen et al 2001 zwieniecki and newton 1999 however given the proximity and similar geomorphology and landcover among the three watersheds we assume that the differences among the thermal regression relationships for the three rivers is primarily attributable to their respective bfis 3 1 3 seepage meters the measured seepage meter fluxes are presented as darcy fluxes across tidal cycles in table 1 the mean fluxes observed at the different seepage meter stations varied by an order of magnitude the maximum observed flux was 2 2 10 2 m d 1 seepage meter 2 and the minimum was 3 1 10 4 m d 1 seepage meter 3 tidal amplitudes on october 7 8 2020 ranged from 0 26 to 0 30 m tidal data for october 6 2020 were not collected some sites exhibited strong variability between tidal cycles which can be attributed to increased recharge following precipitation events driving a greater seaward flow of fresh groundwater the mean darcy flux and standard deviation for sgd among the four locations was 7 6 10 3 6 9 10 3 m d 1 the large standard deviation 91 of mean flux indicates strong heterogeneity in sgd in agreement with the literature e g taniguchi et al 2006 stieglitz et al 2008 for example even in coastlines with significantly higher sgd fluxes such as waquoit bay massachusetts with fluxes as high as 0 75 m d 1 spatial standard deviations were approximately half of the mean discharge rate michael et al 2003 3 2 numerical modelling 3 2 1 model statistics and calibrated results the calibrated numerical modelling results were first assessed via comparison to monitoring data the mean residual for all head observations fig 5 was 1 91 m indicating an overall equal spread around the identity line with a slight bias for positive residuals particularly at high elevations 130 masl the mean absolute residual is 6 97 m which may be explained partially by georeferencing precision fig 5 the uncertainty associated with the 10 m accuracy and 20 m resolution dem and the interpolation of the dem on a 50 m mesh the root mean squared error rmse is 8 99 m which is relatively low given the range in water level observations fig 6a the normalised rmse rmse water level observation range is 3 6 which is well within the threshold for adequate model performance 10 spitz and moreno 1996 anderson et al 2015 the coefficient of determination 0 985 indicates a strong positive relationship between observed and simulated heads fig 5 fine overburden recharge was the most sensitive parameter fig s3 in general the shallow hydrostratigraphic layer k values are the most sensitive hydraulic conductivity parameters and the deep bedrock k is the least sensitive fig s3 supplement head and baseflow simulations exhibited negligible sensitivities to vertical anisotropy and river conductance the generally low sensitivity of deep bedrock k x parameters which are overall similar in magnitude suggest that the simplification of geological contacts will have little impact on the head distribution in upper layers and on the groundwater surface water interactions the optimised parameter values from the calibration process are presented in table 2 overall the calibrated k values for the overburden and shallow bedrock are closer to the upper end of the expected range however the shallow bedrock hsus agree with pumping tests for municipal wells and k estimates based on well yields estimates kennedy 2020 kennedy and fisher 2020 although relatively high the overburden k values are also consistent with those reported for unconsolidated quaternary sediments and glacial till within the region aafc 2002 rivard et al 2008 rivard et al 2012 the relatively high k values in the shallow bedrock layers of gypsum and anhydrite sandstone and siltstone and limestone hsus suggest areas of karstification that are corroborated by the delineation of these features on the karst risk map of nova scotia drage and mckinnon 2019 the calibration results exhibited a decrease of k with depth that is consistent with the conceptual model and the k depth relationships presented by the historical well yield estimates kennedy and fisher 2020 river conductance corresponds to a riverbed k of 4 8 and 296 m d 1 for cells that reside in the fine and coarse overburden respectively drain conductance corresponds to a streambed k of 37 m d 1 in the fine overburden and 2 2 103 m d 1 in the coarse overburden these values generally agree with those reported for riverbeds and alluvial sand and gravel domenico and schwartz 1990 duwelius 1996 calibrated recharge rates within the fine and coarse overburden were 377 and 852 mm yr 1 respectively with an estimated annual precipitation of 1500 mm eccc 2021a 2021b the recharge coefficients are approximately 25 and 57 for the fine and coarse overburden respectively the calibrated recharge coefficients agree with those reported for watersheds with similar geology and climate conditions knott and olimpio 1986 misstear et al 2009 türker 1969 but are higher than other regional estimates e g kennedy et al 2010 recharge within the bounds of the granitoid bedrock of the southern hills of the domain 5 of model surface area an insensitive area lacking observational data was decreased by 60 in response to the simulated water table exceeding the model surface the resulting recharge rate is comparable to those reported for granitoid bedrock in guysborough county nova scotia slr consulting 2015 recharge was lowered rather than increasing k to unreasonable levels based on the conceptual model the water table is expected to be shallow in the southern hills due to the low hydraulic conductivity which would limit drainage the water table depth was generally less than 15 m below the model surface and often less than 5 m particularly in riparian zones fig 6 b depth to groundwater was greatest in the highland areas dominated by more permeable sandstone lithologies figs 2 and 6 in general model results suggest that the head distribution is a subdued replica of the topography with the lowest head in the vicinity of the harbour and the highest in the highlands to the north and south of the domain fig 6 3 2 2 modelled water balance the modelled water balance is presented in table 3 the recharge boundary condition accounted for most of the inflow to the groundwater system followed by the river boundaries extracted groundwater was negligible 1 compared to the recharge across the catchment negligible inflow occurred from the harbour as transient e g tide induced circulation and variable density conditions were ignored for this exercise drains representing smaller order and ephemeral streams accounted for the largest proportion of outflow followed by rivers and then general head boundary nodes in the harbour i e sgd fresh sgd accounted for only 3 9 of groundwater discharge to the harbour with the remaining 96 1 corresponding to baseflow model results were also used to assess how groundwater discharge is partitioned between direct and indirect pathways on the subcatchment scale rather than the full watershed particle tracking indicated that the vast majority of sgd originates in the harbour subcatchment with little contribution from regional or intermediate groundwater flow fig 7 within this harbour subcatchment fig 1 about 30 of terrestrially sourced groundwater discharge was partitioned into sgd rather than stream baseflow based on the assumption that all sgd is derived from within the subcatchment the fresh sgd estimates on either scale full harbour watershed and harbour subcatchment are comparable to proportions presented in the literature luijendijk et al 2020 polemio and limoni 2006 russoniello et al 2016 for example luijendijk et al 2020 used spatially resolved global models to determine that near coast discharge and sgd account for 0 2 26 of recharge in coastal watersheds furthermore it is expected that groundwater derived baseflow i e from streams would dominate over direct groundwater discharge in the harbour due to the shallow water table depth observed throughout most of the study area fig 6 russoniello et al 2016 the modelled outflows listed in table 3b also supports the relative groundwater dominance of the three tributaries as revealed through the field data sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 based on the model results the ne mabou river contributed 11 7 of the groundwater discharge in the watershed despite making up only 5 8 of the catchment area table 3b in contrast the mabou river received 47 3 of the groundwater discharge 48 2 of area and the sw mabou river received 28 3 of the groundwater discharge 32 0 of area collectively these simulated discharge values normalised to their respective areas support the field results and reveal that the tributaries can be ranked in decreasing order of groundwater dominance as the ne mabou river the mabou river and the sw river modelled fresh sgd on the harbour scale ranged from 0 003 to 0 123 m d 1 with a mean and standard deviation of 2 10 3 6 10 3 m d 1 the highest fluxes were generally on the order of 0 010 m d 1 and occurred where hydraulic gradients were steepest or in areas that correspond with coarse overburden the majority of the simulated fresh sgd occurred within 50 100 m of the shoreline which is consistent with the literature taniguchi et al 2002 sawyer et al 2016 the mean flux and standard deviation for modelled sgd within 50 m of the coastline were 7 6 10 3 9 6 10 3 m d 1 the simulated values are consistent with our seepage meter measurements tables 1 3 however caution is required when comparing the results of the two methods as they capture different time periods furthermore the seepage meter distribution and short sample period may not capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of sgd particularly on the harbour scale the model results yield fresh sgd rates that are lower than what is generally published in the literature however as previously noted we expected our rates to be lower than most previous studies given the bias of past field measurements towards high permeability coastal zones where sgd would be more important other studies in the arctic and baltic seas report sgd estimates less than 0 001 m d 1 deming et al 1992 piekarek jankowska 1996 however the different recharge or permafrost conditions may complicate comparisons it is important to note that although fresh and total sgd rates often differ substantially taniguchi 2002 taniguchi et al 2002 wilson 2005 we expect that fresh and total sgd rates would be comparable in this harbour because the high recharge and relief coupled with a lower permeability coastal aquifer likely impedes forces driving recirculated sgd such as tidal pumping for example water levels in a tidal piezometer only 17 5 m from the high tide mark fig 1c did not exhibit any semi diurnal oscillations despite the 0 58 m tidal range mean in this harbour overburden and shallow bedrock are important aquifers in the drainage basin that account for the majority of groundwater flow table 3 coarse sediments 17 of surface area disproportionately accounted for 44 of the simulated groundwater flow from shallow bedrock into overburden in general there is more bedrock discharge occurring in areas with coarse overburden which is consistent with expectations for the study area the local flow regime dominates the domain s flow system as only 7 6 and 0 6 of groundwater flow occurs in the intermediate and deep bedrock respectively kennedy et al 2010 suggested that groundwater systems are relatively shallow in nova scotia and that the majority of the flow occurs in the upper 150 m this is in agreement with model results which indicated that 99 4 of flow occurs in the upper 100 m of bedrock related ongoing research investigations in the mabou harbour watershed are focused on contaminant transport and these shorter groundwater pathways may have implications for groundwater borne contaminants also many of the major contaminated sites within the province of nova scotia such as boat harbour and the sydney tar ponds king et al 2003 lee and jones lee 2006 are found in coastal watersheds with till dominated landscapes making the groundwater pathway findings from this study relevant for the wider canadian maritime region 4 conclusions both the field methods and numerical modelling indicate that fresh sgd is a minor component of total groundwater input to the harbour from our study area watershed which is characterised by high relief and relatively low permeability coastal aquifers field data and modelling results also indicate the same relative hierarchy in baseflow dominance for the three main tributaries to the harbour darcy flux estimates from seepage meter measurements yielded a mean and standard deviation of 7 6 10 3 m d 1 0 0069 for total sgd within 50 m of the coastline similarly simulation results yielded a mean and standard deviation of 7 6 10 3 m d 1 0 0096 for fresh sgd restricted to the model domain within 50 m of the coastline on the scale of the full watershed the fresh sgd output corresponds to 3 9 of total terrestrially sourced groundwater discharge to the harbour compared to 96 1 from groundwater derived stream baseflow conversely on a subcatchment scale immediately surrounding the harbour which is independent of the catchments for the major tributaries fresh sgd is more significant 30 of total terrestrially sourced groundwater discharge to the harbour the water budgets of the hydrostratigraphic layers represented by the model indicate that local groundwater flow through the overburden and shallow bedrock dominates within the drainage basin 92 of groundwater flow the majority of fresh sgd is expected to originate within the harbour subcatchment with insignificant contributions from the regional flow regime i e intercatchment flow this prevalence of local flow regimes promotes the dominance of groundwater derived stream baseflow in coastal watersheds this results in a lower importance of fresh sgd compared to the total groundwater direct and indirect via sgd and stream baseflow discharge to the marine environment little emphasis has been placed on sgd in lower permeability coastal aquifers such as the till dominated landscape of this study area therefore these results will help broaden the understanding of sgd in glacial sediments and address the general lack of direct sgd measurements in settings other than permeable materials such as marine sand or glacial outwash given that canada contains 243 000 km of coastline lemmen 2016 and that vast lengths of the canadian coastline are dominated by glacial till and derivative sediments this study yields useful insight into how groundwater discharge is partitioned between fresh sgd and groundwater derived stream baseflow in such environments the results also have direct relevance for understanding pathways for groundwater borne contaminants in contaminated lower permeability coastal sites such as the study area and these processes will be investigated in future hydrology and hydrodynamic studies of the watershed and harbour declaration of competing

7787,study region the shihmen reservoir the second largest reservoir in northern taiwan is flooded frequently and featured by short period of flood peak due to uneven distribution of rainfall and mountainous topography study focus we proposed a novel streamflow oriented ensemble recurrent neural networks ernn method to merge three precipitation products namely gauge measurements radar and satellite rainfall products we analyzed 1 the effect of artificial intelligence method for bias correction of precipitation products with reference to streamflow 2 the comparison of two widely used arithmetic average aa and bayesian model averaging bma methods with ernn 3 the performance of merged rainfalls and the original three precipitation products in inflow forecasting during 13 typhoon events new hydrological insights we found that all precipitation products are biased and can be appropriately adjusted with an improvement in inflow forecasting of about 2 5 21 8 and 60 7 for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products in terms of rmse after rainfall merging rmse for radar and satellite are further improved by 14 and 36 at least ernn merging method indicates that the optimal merging weights for gauge radar and satellite are within the range of 0 52 0 56 0 35 0 39 and 0 08 0 09 respectively according to 95 confidence interval the merged rainfall product skillfully predicts the inflow with a lead time of five hours and ernn merging method is superior to traditional aa and bma methods with ns up to 0 85 and crps reduced by near 50 compared to bma additionally ernn is found to capture the peak times and peak flows with the smallest error overall this study provides a potential approach to merge multiple rainfall products and to obtain the effective rainfall by fitting the hydrological responses over mountainous watersheds where observational biases may frequently occur in gauge radar and satellite measurements graphical abstract ga1 keywords artificial neural network bias adjustment data merging remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy rainfalls are the major cause of flood disasters the mechanism of storm clouds development is of great significance for the future change of rainfall intensity and distribution due to the sensitivity of weather system evolution cohuet et al 2011 and the complexity of topography chiao and lin 2003 however it is a challenge to clearly explain the mechanism of rainstorm under the existing researches easterling et al 2000 because the evolution of weather system is a broad matter and the weather changes rapidly under a variety of effects with the development of the rainfall measuring technologies from the traditional ground gauges to a variety of advanced equipment such as radar satellite and numerical calculation the precipitation at watershed scale nowadays can be appropriately estimated with desirable temporal and spatial resolutions different rainfall measurements have their own advantages and disadvantages wang et al 2011 gauge measurement is usually regarded as the best representation of a certain region however rain gauge is usually unevenly distributed and has the difficulty in describing the spatial distribution of rainfall canli et al 2018 besides the measurements recorded by rain gauges may include the observational error especially for those thunderstorms occurring in mountainous areas radar can present some attributions of precipitation and cloud by receiving echo signals reflected from the clouds and raindrop nevertheless radar observations still cannot represent the actual rainfall because not all regions can be observed in the cover of radar due to complex terrains besides there are a lot of uncertainties in the radar products such as ground clutter interference the attenuation effect and variability of raindrop size martens et al 2013 satellite can classify different types of rain cloud systems to invert precipitation information through radiation characteristics of infrared microwave visible and water vapor channel on the one hand the satellite product has a great potential for the analysis about the development of rainfall intensity and distribution aghakouchak et al 2009 bitew and gebremichae 2011 on the other hand satellite product is still inconsistent with actual rainfall due to its inadequate capability to distinguish the characteristics of water vapor radiation accurately based on above description each precipitation product may contain different characteristics of the cloud system and likely has its own observational error therefore how to remove the error from different products and to merge multiple precipitation sources have become a popular research topic in both hydrology and hydrometeorology fields in recent years it should be noticed that the importance of merging multiple precipitation sources is to extract the valuable characteristics from individual product and remove redundant information previous studies indicated that it is appropriate to merge different precipitation sources and the quality of the merged product is better than any single product that is adopted in the merging process shi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 nevertheless most of studies focused on merging same type of sources for example radar derived products in different resolutions wang et al 2011 other studies implemented the calibration and integration procedure for radar and satellite derived precipitation and tried to correct the bias by fitting the gauge measurements golian et al 2015 martens et al 2013 shen et al 2014 woldemeskel et al 2013 li and shao 2010 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 these studies not only provided a new idea to integrate multiple products but also conducted new ways for precipitation estimation at complex terrain region or ungauged watersheds however a fundamental hypothesis of these researches is to assume the gauge measurements are non biased which may not be exactly true during severe weather systems or typhoon periods because the typhoons always accompany with strong advection the rainfall measured by gauges likely contain significant observational errors as mentioned in jiang et al 2012 that the gauge measurement is not exactly true although most studies calibrated the radar or satellite rainfall products based on the gauge measurements gourley et al 2011 proposed the hydrologic evaluation of rainfall estimations from gauge radar satellite and demonstrated that hydrologic model was suitable for bias correction of precipitation products recently wong et al 2021 developed a streamﬂow oriented ranking based methodological framework that combined multiple precipitation datasets and demonstrated that hybrid datasets showed a similar or better model performance as compared to that of the best basin wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually performed better downstream and at the basin outlet in this case it is a promising solution that the measured streamflow can be an alternative reference for rainfall bias correction chiang et al 2009 stisen and sandholt 2010 many methods have been constructed for merging purpose such as linear fusion golian et al 2015 artificial intelligence chiang et al 2007 genetic algorithm chang et al 2014 geographical statistics berndt et al 2014 and bayesian model averaging method jiang et al 2012 recently the artificial neural network ann has been widely applied for rainfall runoff modeling and proven its advantage in flood forecasting chiang et al 2004 guo et al 2013 hung et al 2009 valipour et al 2013 young and liu 2015 nevertheless the anns do have their disadvantages such as sensitivity to the initial conditions and uncertainty of the model structures with numbers of hidden neurons fortunately the ensemble based technology can largely reduce the simulating uncertainty of chaotic system cloke and pappenberger 2009 and therefore is widely applied to the ann model in meteorological and hydrological fields the ensemble recurrent neural networks ernn significantly diminish the model s uncertainty by integrating different effective patterns in a certain probability as compared to a single ann model ourada and shu 2009 araghinejad et al 2011 najafi et al 2012 kasiviswanathan et al 2013 el shafie et al 2014 it is worth to notice that when the streamflow oriented ernn model is used to merge multi source rainfall products the output is the effective rainfall rather than the real total rainfall the effective rainfall means the proportion of precipitation that eventually emerges as streamflow regardless of the runoff transport mechanism jakeman and hornberger 1993 in other words effective rainfall is part of the rainfall that is not lost to depression storage evapotranspiration and interception kokkonen et al 2004 by definition effective rainfall cannot be directly used in traditional hydrological models but it is an important input for some rain runoff models especially for neural networks solomatine and dulal 2003 demonstrated that it was better to input effective rainfall in ann model for flood forecasting than using evaporation and rainfall as separate inputs meanwhile effective rainfall is also vital for some simple rainfall runoff models for example the unit hydrograph uh method and the ihacres rainfall runoff model which remain two of the most practical tools for streamflow modeling in small watershed kokkonen et al 2004 croke et al 2005 based on aforementioned viewpoints a bias correction procedure is firstly applied to all rainfall datasets by individually inputting a single rainfall product to a four layer ann model more specifically a four layer recurrent neural network rnn model which is a variant of ann with good performance for continuous time series data such as streamflow apaydin et al 2020 secondly a novel streamflow oriented ensemble recurrent neural network ernn is proposed to merge three corrected rainfall products to explore the optimal merging weights and to forecast reservoir inflow during typhoon events two widely used merging methods the arithmetic average aa and bayesian model averaging bma methods are also performed as benchmark models finally the issue of effective rainfall is discussed and the individual contribution of gauge measurements merged rainfall and usda soil conservation service scs runoff curve number model to the flood hydrograph is evaluated this study is organized as follows the description of the study area and data preprocessing are presented in section 2 section 3 introduces the methodologies section 4 conducts the performances of precipitation bias adjustment and the comparison of different merging strategies finally the findings of this study are summarized in section 5 2 materials 2 1 study area the shihmen reservoir is the second largest reservoir in northern taiwan fig 1 with a drainage area of approximately 760 km2 the watershed receives an annual rainfall of about 2500 mm and more than 70 of the rainwater comes from typhoons the reservoir operation fulfills multiple objectives including water supply for irrigation industrial and domestic uses hydropower generation and flood control the hydrological features of shihmen reservoir watershed are rapid streamflow and short period of flood peak due to uneven distribution of rainfall and mountainous topography and therefore result in the difficulty in reservoir operations and water resources management thus accurate and reliable typhoon rainfall estimation plays an important role in calculating and or simulating the reservoir inflow in fig 1 the red star represents the reservoir inflow station and the black dots represent the 15 rain gauge locations a total of 13 typhoon events consisted of 577 hourly data occurred in the shihmen reservoir watershed were collected to calibrate the ann based precipitation merging model and identify the contribution of different rainfall products to merged rainfall data used in this study include reservoir inflow m3 s rain gauge measurements mm satellite derived precipitation estimations mm and radar derived precipitation estimations mm the satellite derived rainfall products used in this study can be referred to the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs which was developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs university of california irvine detailed information about the persiann ccs can be found in hong et al 2004 rainfall product produced by the persiann ccs has a spatial resolution of 0 04 and a temporal resolution of 30 min and has been commonly adopted and utilized for weather analysis and hydrological applications over the last decade in this study the boundary of the watershed was first overlapped to the outputs of the persiann ccs and a total of 45 pixels were extracted from the persiann ccs products as compared to ground gauges and radars the most significant advantage of the satellite rainfall estimations is that the satellite is not affected by the topography and is able to provide continuous rainfall information the radar derived rainfall products obtained from the quantitative precipitation estimation and segregation using multiple sensors qpesums system http qpesums cwb gov tw taiwan html2 are utilized in this study qpesums system was jointly developed by the central weather bureau cwb of taiwan and the national severe storms laboratory nssl of the usa the system consisted of four ground radars and its outputs cover the whole taiwan with a spatial resolution of 0 0125 and a temporal resolution of one hour currently the qpesums system operates on line and provides real time rainfall estimations in taiwan detailed information about the qpesums system can be found in chang et al 2014 accordingly the boundary of the watershed was overlapped to the outputs of the qpesums and a total of 434 pixels can be extracted from the qpesums products 2 2 data preprocessing to remove redundant information and integrate valuable characteristics provided by each rainfall product the rainfall merging model is conducted first of all it is necessary to reformat the spatial and temporal resolution of all rainfall products in this study all rainfall products were converted to hourly mean areal rainfall in which the equally weighted average of all pixels was carried out for both qpesums and persiann ccs rainfall products and the thiessen polygon method was used for gauge measurements the control area of each rain gauging station can be inspected in fig 1 regarding the arrangement of data the 13 typhoon events were divided into 7 315 hourly data 3 138 hourly data and 3 123 hourly data events for training validation and testing phases respectively 3 methodology this study focuses on the bias correction and merging of three rainfall products hence the recurrent neural network rnn model is built to adjust the scale error and bias error of gauge radar and satellite rainfall the ensemble rnn is conducted to calibrate the optimal merging weights and to predict inflows the arithmetic average and bayesian model averaging methods serve as the comparison the detail procedures are presented in the following section and a brief introduction of the implemented models is given as follows 3 1 recurrent neural network the rnn is defined as a dynamic neural network due to its feedback link which retains the memory of previous information and forms an additional input in current context coulibaly and baldwin 2005 this characteristic allows rnn better simulating the hydrological time series problems in this study a rnn with internal time delay feedback loops in both hidden layer and output layer is conducted to build the rainfall runoff relation and to adjust the bias of three rainfall products the training algorithm used for optimizing the weights of rnn is the gradient method the purpose of training is to progressively update the network weights such that the total output error will be minimized the weights w are updated according to the following formula through the chain rule with partial derivatives 1 w t 1 w t η e t w t where η denotes the model learning rate and e t represents the objective function 2 e t t 1 t e t 1 2 t 1 t k 1 k y k t y ˆ k t 2 where y k is the target value of neuron k at time t and y ˆ k is the network output of neuron k at time t 3 2 rnn bias correction model the bias correction is carried out priori to rainfall merging and the adjustment is achieved by fitting inflow hydrograph using rnn models the reason of using rnn models for the bias correction is that the rnn model contains the feedback links which is able to deal with dynamic input and output relationships then the time lag between rainfall and runoff in the study area should be identified first according to the analysis performed by chang et al 2014 the time of concentration in this watershed is about five hours therefore three independent rnn models are individually fed with uncorrected gauge measurements and raw qpesums and persiann ccs rainfall products for minimizing the error of training datasets the rnn models used herein consisted of three layers fig 2 namely an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the structure of the three independent rnn models is the same including a single rainfall input gauge p g qpesums p r or persiann ccs p s rainfall products three hidden neurons and a single output the number of hidden neurons is determined by trail and error method in this case the relation between individual rainfall product and inflow can be easily built and facilitates the procedure of bias corrections in this study two types of errors are assumed for the rainfall bias correction that is scale error and bias error thus the coefficients a and b are used in this study for transforming the model outputs the corrected precipitation can be easily calculated after the determination of coefficients a and b according to eqs 3 5 3 q t 5 f p g t f a g p g t b g 4 q t 5 f p r t f a r p r t b r 5 q t 5 f p s t f a s p s t b s where p g t p r t and p s t represent the corrected gauge radar and satellite rainfall products a and b represent the scale error and bias error of uncorrected rainfall products q and f represent the reservoir inflow and nonlinear transfer function respectively 3 3 streamflow oriented ensemble rnn merging method regarding the rainfall merging procedure a four layer ensemble rnn model fig 3 is built to integrate the gauge radar and satellite rainfall products different from the three layer bias correction rnn model a merging layer is added in the network structure the number of artificial neuron assigned in the merging layer is one in order to facilitate the optimization of merging weights θ for each precipitation input as far as the calibration of rnn is concerned the disturbance of initial conditions always affects the optimization of model parameters no matter which training algorithm is used one way to overcome the influence of initial turbulence is to integrate the ensemble skill into rnn model the concept of the ensemble based forecasting model is able to reduce the uncertainty of model outputs over the single model therefore different initial conditions with values varying from 0 to 1 are randomly given to generate 100 ensemble members with a fixed model structure and training algorithm in other words there will be 100 optimizations obtained for the model parameters and outputs in general the weight averaging approach is the most common way to combine the outputs of ensemble members thus the weight averaging is used in this study to obtain an ensemble output through calculating the mean of the outputs of all ensemble members according to the 100 optimal parameter sets the distribution of each merging weights can be individually detected from the statistical viewpoint 3 4 bayesian model averaging the bma method is able to provide a more reliable forecasting output by calculating the weighted average of outputs obtained from different models through a conditional probability ajami et al 2007 herr and krzysztofowicz 2010 firstly the observed data and model outputs should be transformed into normal distribution assuming d is the observed data and f f 1 f 2 f n is the model space composed by n models the probabilistic forecast of simulated value y can be expressed as follow 6 p y d n 1 n f n d p n y f n d where the weight of each model is p f n d presenting the posterior probability of the model n under the condition of known data d p n y f n d is the posterior probability of forecasted value y based on the known d and f n the forecasting formula of bma is given as

will be iterated in turn until the iterative difference of likelihood function reaches the given tolerance raftery et al 2005 3 5 evaluation criteria statistical criteria are selected to evaluate the contribution of the corrected precipitation products and the merged precipitation the agreement between observations and predictions is calculated based on the correlation coefficient cc root mean

and forecasted reservoir inflow respectively for ensemble forecasts from ernn the continuous ranked probability score crps eq 13 is employed as an integrated measure of forecast quality accounting for forecast reliability resolution and sharpness hersbach 2000 crps reduces to mae for deterministic forecasts and thus it is allowed to directly compare deterministic and ensemble forecasts liu et al

and x a are forecast and corresponding observed streamflow respectively n is the number of forecasts 4 results 4 1 bias correction table 1 shows the statistical results of reservoir inflow forecasts obtained from three rnn models with individual rainfall input from gauge radar and satellite respectively as the performance displayed in table 1 it is clear that the model with a single uncorrected rainfall input is not able to provide sufficient information for reservoir inflow forecasting besides the results also present that the model with the gauge product is much better than that of radar and satellite rainfall products indicating that the raw radar and satellite rainfall products may have larger bias thus bias correction is necessary for radar and satellite rainfall product and even for gauge measurements fig 4 shows the results of the optimization of a and b coefficients for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products the bias correction for different rainfall product is conducted by minimizing the objective function of the rnn models in the training and validation phases the red circles displayed in fig 4 represents the optimal solution in the parameter searching domain the legend indicates the total error of the objective function the lighter the color the smaller the error based on the optimization eqs 14 16 show the formula of the bias correction for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products respectively 14 p g 1 1 p g 2 i f p g 0 15 p r 4 p r 0 5 i f p r 0 16 p s 3 5 p s 2 5 i f p s 0 it should be noticed that the bias correction is applied for non zero values only and the value will not be modified if the original value of the rainfall product is zero the red circle plotted in fig 4 indicates where the minimum error is in other words the optimal values of a and b can be determined when the optimal solution is found results displayed in fig 4 indicate that all three rainfall products are biased and the original radar and satellite rainfall products seriously underestimated the rainfall as compared to gauge measurements in terms of larger a the coefficient a is very close to 1 for gauge rainfall product indicating that the scale error occurred in gauge measurements is insignificant nevertheless it also can be found that the bias error exists in gauge measurements through fitting the hydrological response to sum up the gauge rainfall product is able to describe the actual rainfall amount approximately but the information provided by radar and satellite rainfall products is insufficient for hydrological applications during typhoon periods before bias correction fig 5 shows the comparison of the rainfall pattern before and after bias correction it is clear that the accuracy of original gauge measurements is higher than that of radar and satellite estimations regarding the radar and satellite rainfall products the values are greatly increased after bias correction the results show the bias correction procedure are necessary for three types of rainfall products and the correction does work even though the changes made for gauge measurements are insignificant moreover it can be detected from fig 5 that the pattern of each rainfall product is slightly different the results demonstrate that the gauge radar and satellite may separately measure parts of rainfall characteristics which may not be easily detected by other two equipment this phenomenon also implies that the merging of multi source rainfall is applicable and needed in order to obtain more reliable rainfall information table 2 compares the results of reservoir inflow forecasting obtained from three original and corrected rainfall products obviously the performances produced by corrected rainfall products are better than those of uncorrected products the improvement made by gauge radar and satellite is about 2 5 21 8 and 60 7 in terms of rmse and 7 7 9 7 and 60 6 in terms of mae respectively cc and ns for gauge rainfall are improved by about 5 and for radar and satellite rainfalls the metrics are generally promoted from negative values to near zero or greater than zero the improvement made by gauge is not significant indicating that the gauge measurements are able to reflect the hydrological response even though it has slight bias whereas the satellite has a greatly improvement after bias correction which means the satellite rainfall product is likely exist larger bias which may occur during the measurement inappropriate function type and etc even though the performance of inflow forecasting obtained from corrected radar and satellite rainfall gain a significant improvement the accuracy of model outputs is low in terms of larger rmse and mae it is still not applicable for constructing the inflow forecasting model with a single radar or satellite rainfall information to explore the reliability of radar and satellite rainfall products and find out the contribution of the corrected rainfall products to merged rainfall the aa bma and a four layer ernn are built for rainfall merging 4 2 rainfall merging and inflow forecasting fig 6 presents the violin plots of gauged rainfall versus three merged rainfalls in five selected typhoon events in this plot the three lines from bottom to top present the 25 50 and 75 quantiles respectively the results indicate that the three merged rainfalls exhibit similar distributions which are fairly different from the gauged measurements for jangmi and wipha typhoon events the merging methods tend to produce more light to medium rainfall smaller than 5 mm while heavy rainfalls higher than 30 mm have no density on the contrary the merging methods produce more rainfall of higher quantiles for sepat and fonghog typhoon events fig 7 shows further comparison of the gauged and merged rainfall products it is clear that the merged rainfall products are generally smaller than the gauge measurements before peak rainfall and larger than gauge measurements after peak rainfall this phenomenon conforms to the mechanism of streamflow oriented merging methods during the earlier stage of a rainfall event a significant portion of the rainfall is intercepted and infiltrated and limited direct runoff is generated the infiltrated rainwater is stored in soil and it takes time for these stored water to transform into streamflow therefore for the actual hydrological process streamflow during the recession limp is mainly generated by stored water making the merged rainfall greater than gauged rainfall however some differences are detected for wipha event the merged rainfall becomes greater than gauged value fairly late than the rainfall peak which is reasonable when the antecedent soil condition is quite dry and majority of the infiltrated rainwater would be stored rather than generate runoff table 3 displays the performance of inflow forecasting obtained from three merged rainfall products that synthesized by aa bma and ernn methods for inflow forecasting at lead time of five hours the three merged rainfall products provide acceptable results in which the performance obtained from ernn is much better than those of aa and bma in terms of lower rmse and mae and higher cc and ns more specifically cc and ns during testing phase are 0 93 and 0 85 for ernn ensemble mean indicating significant improvements in forecast skills of 17 7 and 54 5 compared to bma and 29 2 and 102 to aa crps of forecasts from ernn is 169 which is only 38 of aa forecasts and 42 of bma forecasts fig 8 shows the comparison of the observations and predictions derived from aa bma and ernn for four typhoon events in which jangmi and sepat are selected from validation phase and fong wong and wipha are selected from testing phase apparently the inflow forecasts conducted by ernn is more close to the observations than those of aa and bma especially for peak flows with relative bias of 0 8 1 4 3 9 and 13 6 respectively for the four flood events in fig 8 however forecasts from aa and bma suffer from considerable errors in both peak time and peak flow inflow forecasts obtained from aa and bma have about 2 h delay in peak times and the errors in peak flows are much greater than ernn especially for bma with relative bias of 11 3 0 1 9 and 20 for four selected events as far as rainfall merging is concerned the ernn produces more suitable and reliable rainfall information for reservoir inflow forecasting according to the results displayed in table 3 and fig 8 therefore the ensemble neural network is suggested for multi source rainfall merging in this study moreover it is also important and interesting to further inspect the optimal merging weights calibrated by the three merging methods table 4 displays the optimal merging weights calculated by aa bma and ernn except for the ernn both aa and bma provide the deterministic values for the merging weights as mentioned above the ernn was performed by 100 calibrations with different initial conditions thus there will be 100 optimal merging weights for each rainfall product based on the statistics the 95 confidence interval calculated for gauge radar and satellite is about 0 52 0 56 0 35 0 39 and 0 08 0 09 respectively results computed by bma are consistent with ernn indicating that the contribution of gauge to rainfall merging is higher than that of radar and satellite products and the contribution of satellite rainfall product to rainfall merging is lower than other two products fig 9 further shows the distribution of the frequency of the optimal merging weighs calibrated by ernn for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products according to table 4 and fig 9 the contribution of gauge measurements to rainfall merging is more than 50 even though the contribution of satellite rainfall product is not very significant less than 10 it does capture some important rainfall characteristics which may not be replaceable by other two rainfall products 5 discussion this study proposes a novel streamflow oriented ernn to merge three types of rainfall products including gauge measurement radar and satellite precipitation it is shown that the merged rainfall is able to predict reservoir inflow with smaller rmse and mae than individual rainfall product the proposed streamflow oriented ernn merging method is more effective than aa and bma with higher ns 0 85 and cc 0 93 in inflow forecasting both bma and ernn merging methods indicate that gauge rainfall is the greatest contributor to merged rainfall with weights ranging from 0 52 to 0 56 obtained from ernn and 0 48 produced by bma radar rainfall contributes 0 26 to bma based rainfall merging and for ernn the weight is higher with values from 0 35 to 0 39 these results are consistent with some previous studies woldemeskel et al 2013 found that the weights for rain gauge were greater than those for trmm 3b42 in southwest and southeast australia where the network of rain gauges is dense besides the effectiveness of bias correction and the contribution of individual rainfall product to rainfall merging another important finding gained in this study is related to the effective rainfall we note that the total accumulative rainfall of a single event will not all convert to river flow because of rainfall losses in other words the amount of merged rainfall by the streamflow oriented merging method effective rainfall is smaller than that of actual total rainfall in general the calculation of effective rainfall is very difficult due to many complex factors and interactions the usda soil conservation service scs runoff curve number model mockus 1972 can estimate direct runoff which may be close to the effective rainfall nevertheless a complete flood hydrograph is consisted of surface runoff direct runoff subsurface runoff and groundwater flow therefore the actual effective rainfall should be less than gauge measurement and more than the amount calculated by scs runoff curve number model fig 10 shows the amount of rainfall from first five large typhoon events obtained from gauge ernn based merged rainfall and scs among these five typhoon events the sinlaku krosa and morako were arranged in the training phase the jangmi was assigned in the validation phase and the wipha was allocated in the testing phase it is clear that the amount of the typhoon rainfall calculated by the merged rainfall is consistently between gauge measurements and scs runoff curve number model for all five events demonstrating that the merged rainfall is more reliable for reflecting the amount of flood hydrograph thus the rainfall merging method proposed in this study may provide a valuable information for further hydrological applications and water resources management and planning 6 conclusion accurate rainfall information is the key input for hydrological modeling and the gauge measurements were usually regarded as real rainfall over the last several decades nowadays there are various types of rainfall products such as radar and satellite rainfall products and each product has its own advantages and drawbacks therefore how to remove the redundant information and efficiently integrate multiple rainfall sources has become a popular research topic in this study the gauge measurements qpesums radar rainfall products and persiann ccs satellite rainfall products are used for rainfall merging and reservoir inflow forecasting a total of thirteen historical typhoon events were collected from 2006 to 2009 in shihmen reservoir watershed north taiwan to improve the forecast skill a recurrent neural network which is suitable for modeling the nonlinear and dynamic system is constructed for bias correction by referring to the hydrological responses a novel streamflow oriented ensemble merging method is proposed to blend multi source rainfall products and compared with the arithmetic average and bayesian model average results obtained in this study indicate that the gauge measurements radar and satellite rainfall products are all biased and can be appropriately adjusted with an improvement of 2 5 21 8 and 60 7 for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products respectively in terms of the accuracy of inflow forecasting moreover the performance of merged rainfall implies that the ensemble based rnn performed much better than aa and bma with cc and ns up to 0 93 and 0 85 and ernn also shown better performance in peak time and peak flow forecasts the contribution of gauge radar and satellite information to the merged rainfall is about 0 52 0 56 0 35 0 39 and 0 08 0 09 respectively according to the 95 confidence interval in this study however the contribution of different rainfall products to the merging process is calibrated by using typhoon events which is great rainfall intensity in a short duration in other words the contribution of gauge radar and satellite to rainfall merging may vary from different weather types further investigation on this issue should be interesting and recommended most of the previous study on rainfall merging tried to find out or fit the real precipitation however the amount of effective rainfall is the crucial factor for hydrological applications and water resources management in this study both bias correction and rainfall merging are calibrated by using the hydrological responses thus the amount of merged rainfall is able to reflect the flood hydrograph and could be regarded as effective rainfall this case study demonstrates that the proposed merged rainfall is more close to the effective rainfall but not the actual rainfall of a single rainfall event therefore it should be noticed if it is appropriate to directly apply the merged data in conceptual and distributed hydrological models overall this study provides an insight into the adjustment of rainfall bias and the merging of multiple rainfall sources evaluates the contribution of each rainfall product and identifies the effective rainfall which is more beneficial than the actual rainfall for hydrological applications nevertheless the correction of rainfall bias performed in this study is not time varying it would be better if the model parameters can be calibrated dynamically besides the effective rainfall is related to the conditions of soil moisture rainfall intensity and etc further investigation on these two research topics would be necessary credit authorship contribution statement yen ming chiang conceptualization methodology software funding acquisition ruo

7787,study region the shihmen reservoir the second largest reservoir in northern taiwan is flooded frequently and featured by short period of flood peak due to uneven distribution of rainfall and mountainous topography study focus we proposed a novel streamflow oriented ensemble recurrent neural networks ernn method to merge three precipitation products namely gauge measurements radar and satellite rainfall products we analyzed 1 the effect of artificial intelligence method for bias correction of precipitation products with reference to streamflow 2 the comparison of two widely used arithmetic average aa and bayesian model averaging bma methods with ernn 3 the performance of merged rainfalls and the original three precipitation products in inflow forecasting during 13 typhoon events new hydrological insights we found that all precipitation products are biased and can be appropriately adjusted with an improvement in inflow forecasting of about 2 5 21 8 and 60 7 for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products in terms of rmse after rainfall merging rmse for radar and satellite are further improved by 14 and 36 at least ernn merging method indicates that the optimal merging weights for gauge radar and satellite are within the range of 0 52 0 56 0 35 0 39 and 0 08 0 09 respectively according to 95 confidence interval the merged rainfall product skillfully predicts the inflow with a lead time of five hours and ernn merging method is superior to traditional aa and bma methods with ns up to 0 85 and crps reduced by near 50 compared to bma additionally ernn is found to capture the peak times and peak flows with the smallest error overall this study provides a potential approach to merge multiple rainfall products and to obtain the effective rainfall by fitting the hydrological responses over mountainous watersheds where observational biases may frequently occur in gauge radar and satellite measurements graphical abstract ga1 keywords artificial neural network bias adjustment data merging remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy rainfalls are the major cause of flood disasters the mechanism of storm clouds development is of great significance for the future change of rainfall intensity and distribution due to the sensitivity of weather system evolution cohuet et al 2011 and the complexity of topography chiao and lin 2003 however it is a challenge to clearly explain the mechanism of rainstorm under the existing researches easterling et al 2000 because the evolution of weather system is a broad matter and the weather changes rapidly under a variety of effects with the development of the rainfall measuring technologies from the traditional ground gauges to a variety of advanced equipment such as radar satellite and numerical calculation the precipitation at watershed scale nowadays can be appropriately estimated with desirable temporal and spatial resolutions different rainfall measurements have their own advantages and disadvantages wang et al 2011 gauge measurement is usually regarded as the best representation of a certain region however rain gauge is usually unevenly distributed and has the difficulty in describing the spatial distribution of rainfall canli et al 2018 besides the measurements recorded by rain gauges may include the observational error especially for those thunderstorms occurring in mountainous areas radar can present some attributions of precipitation and cloud by receiving echo signals reflected from the clouds and raindrop nevertheless radar observations still cannot represent the actual rainfall because not all regions can be observed in the cover of radar due to complex terrains besides there are a lot of uncertainties in the radar products such as ground clutter interference the attenuation effect and variability of raindrop size martens et al 2013 satellite can classify different types of rain cloud systems to invert precipitation information through radiation characteristics of infrared microwave visible and water vapor channel on the one hand the satellite product has a great potential for the analysis about the development of rainfall intensity and distribution aghakouchak et al 2009 bitew and gebremichae 2011 on the other hand satellite product is still inconsistent with actual rainfall due to its inadequate capability to distinguish the characteristics of water vapor radiation accurately based on above description each precipitation product may contain different characteristics of the cloud system and likely has its own observational error therefore how to remove the error from different products and to merge multiple precipitation sources have become a popular research topic in both hydrology and hydrometeorology fields in recent years it should be noticed that the importance of merging multiple precipitation sources is to extract the valuable characteristics from individual product and remove redundant information previous studies indicated that it is appropriate to merge different precipitation sources and the quality of the merged product is better than any single product that is adopted in the merging process shi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 nevertheless most of studies focused on merging same type of sources for example radar derived products in different resolutions wang et al 2011 other studies implemented the calibration and integration procedure for radar and satellite derived precipitation and tried to correct the bias by fitting the gauge measurements golian et al 2015 martens et al 2013 shen et al 2014 woldemeskel et al 2013 li and shao 2010 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 these studies not only provided a new idea to integrate multiple products but also conducted new ways for precipitation estimation at complex terrain region or ungauged watersheds however a fundamental hypothesis of these researches is to assume the gauge measurements are non biased which may not be exactly true during severe weather systems or typhoon periods because the typhoons always accompany with strong advection the rainfall measured by gauges likely contain significant observational errors as mentioned in jiang et al 2012 that the gauge measurement is not exactly true although most studies calibrated the radar or satellite rainfall products based on the gauge measurements gourley et al 2011 proposed the hydrologic evaluation of rainfall estimations from gauge radar satellite and demonstrated that hydrologic model was suitable for bias correction of precipitation products recently wong et al 2021 developed a streamﬂow oriented ranking based methodological framework that combined multiple precipitation datasets and demonstrated that hybrid datasets showed a similar or better model performance as compared to that of the best basin wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually performed better downstream and at the basin outlet in this case it is a promising solution that the measured streamflow can be an alternative reference for rainfall bias correction chiang et al 2009 stisen and sandholt 2010 many methods have been constructed for merging purpose such as linear fusion golian et al 2015 artificial intelligence chiang et al 2007 genetic algorithm chang et al 2014 geographical statistics berndt et al 2014 and bayesian model averaging method jiang et al 2012 recently the artificial neural network ann has been widely applied for rainfall runoff modeling and proven its advantage in flood forecasting chiang et al 2004 guo et al 2013 hung et al 2009 valipour et al 2013 young and liu 2015 nevertheless the anns do have their disadvantages such as sensitivity to the initial conditions and uncertainty of the model structures with numbers of hidden neurons fortunately the ensemble based technology can largely reduce the simulating uncertainty of chaotic system cloke and pappenberger 2009 and therefore is widely applied to the ann model in meteorological and hydrological fields the ensemble recurrent neural networks ernn significantly diminish the model s uncertainty by integrating different effective patterns in a certain probability as compared to a single ann model ourada and shu 2009 araghinejad et al 2011 najafi et al 2012 kasiviswanathan et al 2013 el shafie et al 2014 it is worth to notice that when the streamflow oriented ernn model is used to merge multi source rainfall products the output is the effective rainfall rather than the real total rainfall the effective rainfall means the proportion of precipitation that eventually emerges as streamflow regardless of the runoff transport mechanism jakeman and hornberger 1993 in other words effective rainfall is part of the rainfall that is not lost to depression storage evapotranspiration and interception kokkonen et al 2004 by definition effective rainfall cannot be directly used in traditional hydrological models but it is an important input for some rain runoff models especially for neural networks solomatine and dulal 2003 demonstrated that it was better to input effective rainfall in ann model for flood forecasting than using evaporation and rainfall as separate inputs meanwhile effective rainfall is also vital for some simple rainfall runoff models for example the unit hydrograph uh method and the ihacres rainfall runoff model which remain two of the most practical tools for streamflow modeling in small watershed kokkonen et al 2004 croke et al 2005 based on aforementioned viewpoints a bias correction procedure is firstly applied to all rainfall datasets by individually inputting a single rainfall product to a four layer ann model more specifically a four layer recurrent neural network rnn model which is a variant of ann with good performance for continuous time series data such as streamflow apaydin et al 2020 secondly a novel streamflow oriented ensemble recurrent neural network ernn is proposed to merge three corrected rainfall products to explore the optimal merging weights and to forecast reservoir inflow during typhoon events two widely used merging methods the arithmetic average aa and bayesian model averaging bma methods are also performed as benchmark models finally the issue of effective rainfall is discussed and the individual contribution of gauge measurements merged rainfall and usda soil conservation service scs runoff curve number model to the flood hydrograph is evaluated this study is organized as follows the description of the study area and data preprocessing are presented in section 2 section 3 introduces the methodologies section 4 conducts the performances of precipitation bias adjustment and the comparison of different merging strategies finally the findings of this study are summarized in section 5 2 materials 2 1 study area the shihmen reservoir is the second largest reservoir in northern taiwan fig 1 with a drainage area of approximately 760 km2 the watershed receives an annual rainfall of about 2500 mm and more than 70 of the rainwater comes from typhoons the reservoir operation fulfills multiple objectives including water supply for irrigation industrial and domestic uses hydropower generation and flood control the hydrological features of shihmen reservoir watershed are rapid streamflow and short period of flood peak due to uneven distribution of rainfall and mountainous topography and therefore result in the difficulty in reservoir operations and water resources management thus accurate and reliable typhoon rainfall estimation plays an important role in calculating and or simulating the reservoir inflow in fig 1 the red star represents the reservoir inflow station and the black dots represent the 15 rain gauge locations a total of 13 typhoon events consisted of 577 hourly data occurred in the shihmen reservoir watershed were collected to calibrate the ann based precipitation merging model and identify the contribution of different rainfall products to merged rainfall data used in this study include reservoir inflow m3 s rain gauge measurements mm satellite derived precipitation estimations mm and radar derived precipitation estimations mm the satellite derived rainfall products used in this study can be referred to the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs which was developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs university of california irvine detailed information about the persiann ccs can be found in hong et al 2004 rainfall product produced by the persiann ccs has a spatial resolution of 0 04 and a temporal resolution of 30 min and has been commonly adopted and utilized for weather analysis and hydrological applications over the last decade in this study the boundary of the watershed was first overlapped to the outputs of the persiann ccs and a total of 45 pixels were extracted from the persiann ccs products as compared to ground gauges and radars the most significant advantage of the satellite rainfall estimations is that the satellite is not affected by the topography and is able to provide continuous rainfall information the radar derived rainfall products obtained from the quantitative precipitation estimation and segregation using multiple sensors qpesums system http qpesums cwb gov tw taiwan html2 are utilized in this study qpesums system was jointly developed by the central weather bureau cwb of taiwan and the national severe storms laboratory nssl of the usa the system consisted of four ground radars and its outputs cover the whole taiwan with a spatial resolution of 0 0125 and a temporal resolution of one hour currently the qpesums system operates on line and provides real time rainfall estimations in taiwan detailed information about the qpesums system can be found in chang et al 2014 accordingly the boundary of the watershed was overlapped to the outputs of the qpesums and a total of 434 pixels can be extracted from the qpesums products 2 2 data preprocessing to remove redundant information and integrate valuable characteristics provided by each rainfall product the rainfall merging model is conducted first of all it is necessary to reformat the spatial and temporal resolution of all rainfall products in this study all rainfall products were converted to hourly mean areal rainfall in which the equally weighted average of all pixels was carried out for both qpesums and persiann ccs rainfall products and the thiessen polygon method was used for gauge measurements the control area of each rain gauging station can be inspected in fig 1 regarding the arrangement of data the 13 typhoon events were divided into 7 315 hourly data 3 138 hourly data and 3 123 hourly data events for training validation and testing phases respectively 3 methodology this study focuses on the bias correction and merging of three rainfall products hence the recurrent neural network rnn model is built to adjust the scale error and bias error of gauge radar and satellite rainfall the ensemble rnn is conducted to calibrate the optimal merging weights and to predict inflows the arithmetic average and bayesian model averaging methods serve as the comparison the detail procedures are presented in the following section and a brief introduction of the implemented models is given as follows 3 1 recurrent neural network the rnn is defined as a dynamic neural network due to its feedback link which retains the memory of previous information and forms an additional input in current context coulibaly and baldwin 2005 this characteristic allows rnn better simulating the hydrological time series problems in this study a rnn with internal time delay feedback loops in both hidden layer and output layer is conducted to build the rainfall runoff relation and to adjust the bias of three rainfall products the training algorithm used for optimizing the weights of rnn is the gradient method the purpose of training is to progressively update the network weights such that the total output error will be minimized the weights w are updated according to the following formula through the chain rule with partial derivatives 1 w t 1 w t η e t w t where η denotes the model learning rate and e t represents the objective function 2 e t t 1 t e t 1 2 t 1 t k 1 k y k t y ˆ k t 2 where y k is the target value of neuron k at time t and y ˆ k is the network output of neuron k at time t 3 2 rnn bias correction model the bias correction is carried out priori to rainfall merging and the adjustment is achieved by fitting inflow hydrograph using rnn models the reason of using rnn models for the bias correction is that the rnn model contains the feedback links which is able to deal with dynamic input and output relationships then the time lag between rainfall and runoff in the study area should be identified first according to the analysis performed by chang et al 2014 the time of concentration in this watershed is about five hours therefore three independent rnn models are individually fed with uncorrected gauge measurements and raw qpesums and persiann ccs rainfall products for minimizing the error of training datasets the rnn models used herein consisted of three layers fig 2 namely an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the structure of the three independent rnn models is the same including a single rainfall input gauge p g qpesums p r or persiann ccs p s rainfall products three hidden neurons and a single output the number of hidden neurons is determined by trail and error method in this case the relation between individual rainfall product and inflow can be easily built and facilitates the procedure of bias corrections in this study two types of errors are assumed for the rainfall bias correction that is scale error and bias error thus the coefficients a and b are used in this study for transforming the model outputs the corrected precipitation can be easily calculated after the determination of coefficients a and b according to eqs 3 5 3 q t 5 f p g t f a g p g t b g 4 q t 5 f p r t f a r p r t b r 5 q t 5 f p s t f a s p s t b s where p g t p r t and p s t represent the corrected gauge radar and satellite rainfall products a and b represent the scale error and bias error of uncorrected rainfall products q and f represent the reservoir inflow and nonlinear transfer function respectively 3 3 streamflow oriented ensemble rnn merging method regarding the rainfall merging procedure a four layer ensemble rnn model fig 3 is built to integrate the gauge radar and satellite rainfall products different from the three layer bias correction rnn model a merging layer is added in the network structure the number of artificial neuron assigned in the merging layer is one in order to facilitate the optimization of merging weights θ for each precipitation input as far as the calibration of rnn is concerned the disturbance of initial conditions always affects the optimization of model parameters no matter which training algorithm is used one way to overcome the influence of initial turbulence is to integrate the ensemble skill into rnn model the concept of the ensemble based forecasting model is able to reduce the uncertainty of model outputs over the single model therefore different initial conditions with values varying from 0 to 1 are randomly given to generate 100 ensemble members with a fixed model structure and training algorithm in other words there will be 100 optimizations obtained for the model parameters and outputs in general the weight averaging approach is the most common way to combine the outputs of ensemble members thus the weight averaging is used in this study to obtain an ensemble output through calculating the mean of the outputs of all ensemble members according to the 100 optimal parameter sets the distribution of each merging weights can be individually detected from the statistical viewpoint 3 4 bayesian model averaging the bma method is able to provide a more reliable forecasting output by calculating the weighted average of outputs obtained from different models through a conditional probability ajami et al 2007 herr and krzysztofowicz 2010 firstly the observed data and model outputs should be transformed into normal distribution assuming d is the observed data and f f 1 f 2 f n is the model space composed by n models the probabilistic forecast of simulated value y can be expressed as follow 6 p y d n 1 n f n d p n y f n d where the weight of each model is p f n d presenting the posterior

will be iterated in turn until the iterative difference of likelihood function reaches the given tolerance raftery et al 2005 3 5 evaluation criteria statistical criteria are selected to evaluate the contribution of the corrected precipitation products and the merged precipitation the agreement between observations and predictions is calculated based on the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe ns efficiency coefficient these criteria are defined as follows 9 c c i 1 n q i q q ˆ i q ˆ i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n q ˆ i q ˆ 2 10 r m s e i 1

and forecasted reservoir inflow respectively for ensemble forecasts from ernn the continuous ranked probability score crps eq 13 is employed as an integrated measure of forecast quality accounting for forecast reliability resolution and sharpness hersbach 2000 crps reduces to mae for deterministic forecasts and thus it is allowed to directly compare deterministic and ensemble forecasts liu et al 2022 crps is defined as 13 crps 1 n i 1 n f x h x x a 2 d x where f x is the cumulative distribution function cdf of forecast ensemble heaviside function h x x a is 1 when x x a 0 and 0 otherwise x and x a are forecast and corresponding observed streamflow respectively n is the number of forecasts 4 results 4 1 bias correction table 1 shows the statistical results of reservoir inflow forecasts obtained from three rnn models with individual rainfall input from gauge radar and satellite respectively as the performance displayed in table 1 it is clear that the model with a single uncorrected rainfall input is not able to provide sufficient information for reservoir inflow forecasting besides the results also present that the model with the gauge product is much better than that of radar and satellite rainfall products indicating that the raw radar and satellite rainfall products may have larger bias thus bias correction is necessary for radar and satellite rainfall product and even for gauge measurements fig 4 shows the results of the optimization of a and b coefficients for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products the bias correction for different rainfall product is conducted by minimizing the objective function of the rnn models in the training and validation phases the red circles displayed in fig 4 represents the optimal solution in the parameter searching domain the legend indicates the total error of the objective function the lighter the color the smaller the error based on the optimization eqs 14 16 show the formula of the bias correction for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products respectively 14 p g 1 1 p g 2 i f p g 0 15 p r 4 p r 0 5 i f p r 0 16 p s 3 5 p s 2 5 i f p s 0 it should be noticed that the bias correction is applied for non zero values only and the value will not be modified if the original value of the rainfall product is zero the red circle plotted in fig 4 indicates where the minimum error is in other words the optimal values of a and b can be determined when the optimal solution is found results displayed in fig 4 indicate that all three rainfall products are biased and the original radar and satellite rainfall products seriously underestimated the rainfall as compared to gauge measurements in terms of larger a the coefficient a is very close to 1 for gauge rainfall product indicating that the scale error occurred in gauge measurements is insignificant nevertheless it also can be found that the bias error exists in gauge measurements through fitting the hydrological response to sum up the gauge rainfall product is able to describe the actual rainfall amount approximately but the information provided by radar and satellite rainfall products is insufficient for hydrological applications during typhoon periods before bias correction fig 5 shows the comparison of the rainfall pattern before and after bias correction it is clear that the accuracy of original gauge measurements is higher than that of radar and satellite estimations regarding the radar and satellite rainfall products the values are greatly increased after bias correction the results show the bias correction procedure are necessary for three types of rainfall products and the correction does work even though the changes made for gauge measurements are insignificant moreover it can be detected from fig 5 that the pattern of each rainfall product is slightly different the results demonstrate that the gauge radar and satellite may separately measure parts of rainfall characteristics which may not be easily detected by other two equipment this phenomenon also implies that the merging of multi source rainfall is applicable and needed in order to obtain more reliable rainfall information table 2 compares the results of reservoir inflow forecasting obtained from three original and corrected rainfall products obviously the performances produced by corrected rainfall products are better than those of uncorrected products the improvement made by gauge radar and satellite is about 2 5 21 8 and 60 7 in terms of rmse and 7 7 9 7 and 60 6 in terms of mae respectively cc and ns for gauge rainfall are improved by about 5 and for radar and satellite rainfalls the metrics are generally promoted from negative values to near zero or greater than zero the improvement made by gauge is not significant indicating that the gauge measurements are able to reflect the hydrological response even though it has slight bias whereas the satellite has a greatly improvement after bias correction which means the satellite rainfall product is likely exist larger bias which may occur during the measurement inappropriate function type and etc even though the performance of inflow forecasting obtained from corrected radar and satellite rainfall gain a significant improvement the accuracy of model outputs is low in terms of larger rmse and mae it is still not applicable for constructing the inflow forecasting model with a single radar or satellite rainfall information to explore the reliability of radar and satellite rainfall products and find out the contribution of the corrected rainfall products to merged rainfall the aa bma and a four layer ernn are built for rainfall merging 4 2 rainfall merging and inflow forecasting fig 6 presents the violin plots of gauged rainfall versus three merged rainfalls in five selected typhoon events in this plot the three lines from bottom to top present the 25 50 and 75 quantiles respectively the results indicate that the three merged rainfalls exhibit similar distributions which are fairly different from the gauged measurements for jangmi and wipha typhoon events the merging methods tend to produce more light to medium rainfall smaller than 5 mm while heavy rainfalls higher than 30 mm have no density on the contrary the merging methods produce more rainfall of higher quantiles for sepat and fonghog typhoon events fig 7 shows further comparison of the gauged and merged rainfall products it is clear that the merged rainfall products are generally smaller than the gauge measurements before peak rainfall and larger than gauge measurements after peak rainfall this phenomenon conforms to the mechanism of streamflow oriented merging methods during the earlier stage of a rainfall event a significant portion of the rainfall is intercepted and infiltrated and limited direct runoff is generated the infiltrated rainwater is stored in soil and it takes time for these stored water to transform into streamflow therefore for the actual hydrological process streamflow during the recession limp is mainly generated by stored water making the merged rainfall greater than gauged rainfall however some differences are detected for wipha event the merged rainfall becomes greater than gauged value fairly late than the rainfall peak which is reasonable when the antecedent soil condition is quite dry and majority of the infiltrated rainwater would be stored rather than generate runoff table 3 displays the performance of inflow forecasting obtained from three merged rainfall products that synthesized by aa bma and ernn methods for inflow forecasting at lead time of five hours the three merged rainfall products provide acceptable results in which the performance obtained from ernn is much better than those of aa and bma in terms of lower rmse and mae and higher cc and ns more specifically cc and ns during testing phase are 0 93 and 0 85 for ernn ensemble mean indicating significant improvements in forecast skills of 17 7 and 54 5 compared to bma and 29 2 and 102 to aa crps of forecasts from ernn is 169 which is only 38 of aa forecasts and 42 of bma forecasts fig 8 shows the comparison of the observations and predictions derived from aa bma and ernn for four typhoon events in which jangmi and sepat are selected from validation phase and fong wong and wipha are selected from testing phase apparently the inflow forecasts conducted by ernn is more close to the observations than those of aa and bma especially for peak flows with relative bias of 0 8 1 4 3 9 and 13 6 respectively for the four flood events in fig 8 however forecasts from aa and bma suffer from considerable errors in both peak time and peak flow inflow forecasts obtained from aa and bma have about 2 h delay in peak times and the errors in peak flows are much greater than ernn especially for bma with relative bias of 11 3 0 1 9 and 20 for four selected events as far as rainfall merging is concerned the ernn produces more suitable and reliable rainfall information for reservoir inflow forecasting according to the results displayed in table 3 and fig 8 therefore the ensemble neural network is suggested for multi source rainfall merging in this study moreover it is also important and interesting to further inspect the optimal merging weights calibrated by the three merging methods table 4 displays the optimal merging weights calculated by aa bma and ernn except for the ernn both aa and bma provide the deterministic values for the merging weights as mentioned above the ernn was performed by 100 calibrations with different initial conditions thus there will be 100 optimal merging weights for each rainfall product based on the statistics the 95 confidence interval calculated for gauge radar and satellite is about 0 52 0 56 0 35 0 39 and 0 08 0 09 respectively results computed by bma are consistent with ernn indicating that the contribution of gauge to rainfall merging is higher than that of radar and satellite products and the contribution of satellite rainfall product to rainfall merging is lower than other two products fig 9 further shows the distribution of the frequency of the optimal merging weighs calibrated by ernn for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products according to table 4 and fig 9 the contribution of gauge measurements to rainfall merging is more than 50 even though the contribution of satellite rainfall product is not very significant less than 10 it does capture some important rainfall characteristics which may not be replaceable by other two rainfall products 5 discussion this study proposes a novel streamflow oriented ernn to merge three types of rainfall products including gauge measurement radar and satellite precipitation it is shown that the merged rainfall is able to predict reservoir inflow with smaller rmse and mae than individual rainfall product the proposed streamflow oriented ernn merging method is more effective than aa and bma with higher ns 0 85 and cc 0 93 in inflow forecasting both bma and ernn merging methods indicate that gauge rainfall is the greatest contributor to merged rainfall with weights ranging from 0 52 to 0 56 obtained from ernn and 0 48 produced by bma radar rainfall contributes 0 26 to bma based rainfall merging and for ernn the weight is higher with values from 0 35 to 0 39 these results are consistent with some previous studies woldemeskel et al 2013 found that the weights for rain gauge were greater than those for trmm 3b42 in southwest and southeast australia where the network of rain gauges is dense besides the effectiveness of bias correction and the contribution of individual rainfall product to rainfall merging another important finding gained in this study is related to the effective rainfall we note that the total accumulative rainfall of a single event will not all convert to river flow because of rainfall losses in other words the amount of merged rainfall by the streamflow oriented merging method effective rainfall is smaller than that of actual total rainfall in general the calculation of effective rainfall is very difficult due to many complex factors and interactions the usda soil conservation service scs runoff curve number model mockus 1972 can estimate direct runoff which may be close to the effective rainfall nevertheless a complete flood hydrograph is consisted of surface runoff direct runoff subsurface runoff and groundwater flow therefore the actual effective rainfall should be less than gauge measurement and more than the amount calculated by scs runoff curve number model fig 10 shows the amount of rainfall from first five large typhoon events obtained from gauge ernn based merged rainfall and scs among these five typhoon events the sinlaku krosa and morako were arranged in the training phase the jangmi was assigned in the validation phase and the wipha was allocated in the testing phase it is clear that the amount of the typhoon rainfall calculated by the merged rainfall is consistently between gauge measurements and scs runoff curve number model for all five events demonstrating that the merged rainfall is more reliable for reflecting the amount of flood hydrograph thus the rainfall merging method proposed in this study may provide a valuable information for further hydrological applications and water resources management and planning 6 conclusion accurate rainfall information is the key input for hydrological modeling and the gauge measurements were usually regarded as real rainfall over the last several decades nowadays there are various types of rainfall products such as radar and satellite rainfall products and each product has its own advantages and drawbacks therefore how to remove the redundant information and efficiently integrate multiple rainfall sources has become a popular research topic in this study the gauge measurements qpesums radar rainfall products and persiann ccs satellite rainfall products are used for rainfall merging and reservoir inflow forecasting a total of thirteen historical typhoon events were collected from 2006 to 2009 in shihmen reservoir watershed north taiwan to improve the forecast skill a recurrent neural network which is suitable for modeling the nonlinear and dynamic system is constructed for bias correction by referring to the hydrological responses a novel streamflow oriented ensemble merging method is proposed to blend multi source rainfall products and compared with the arithmetic average and bayesian model average results obtained in this study indicate that the gauge measurements radar and satellite rainfall products are all biased and can be appropriately adjusted with an improvement of 2 5 21 8 and 60 7 for gauge radar and satellite rainfall products respectively in terms of the accuracy of inflow forecasting moreover the performance of merged rainfall implies that the ensemble based rnn performed much better than aa and bma with cc and ns up to 0 93 and 0 85 and ernn also shown better performance in peak time and peak flow forecasts the contribution of gauge radar and satellite information to the merged rainfall is about 0 52 0 56 0 35 0 39 and 0 08 0 09 respectively according to the 95 confidence interval in this study however the contribution of different rainfall products to the merging process is calibrated by using typhoon events which is great rainfall intensity in a short duration in other words the contribution of gauge radar and satellite to rainfall merging may vary from different weather types further investigation on this issue should be interesting and recommended most of the previous study on rainfall merging tried to find out or fit the real precipitation however the amount of effective rainfall is the crucial factor for hydrological applications and water resources management in this study both bias correction and rainfall merging are calibrated by using the hydrological responses thus the amount of merged rainfall is able to reflect the flood hydrograph and could be regarded as effective rainfall this case study demonstrates that the proposed merged rainfall is more close to the effective rainfall but not the actual rainfall of a single rainfall event therefore it should be noticed if it is appropriate to directly apply the merged data in conceptual and distributed hydrological models overall this study provides an insight into the adjustment of rainfall bias and the merging of multiple rainfall sources evaluates the contribution of each rainfall product and identifies the effective rainfall which is more beneficial than the actual rainfall for hydrological applications nevertheless the correction of rainfall bias performed in this study is not time varying it would be better if the model parameters can be calibrated dynamically besides the effective rainfall is related to the conditions of soil moisture rainfall intensity

7788,study region watersheds of the atlantic coast of the united states acus spanning a latitudinal range of 30 8 n 46 5 n study focus this study assessed climate induced changes cmip5 rcp 8 5 in projected streamflow and water temperature estimates from individual swat watershed models across the acus territory by mid and end of the century seasonal and spatial trends as well as relationships between hydroclimatologic variables were analyzed to identify opportunities for regional implementation of water management strategies new hydrological insights for the region changes in hydroclimatologic variables suggest spatial trends clearly differentiated by seasons northern and central watersheds are projected to experience the most dramatic changes in winter summer and spring streamflows 67 25 and 24 respectively and summer water temperature 6 2 c while southern watersheds presented the largest streamflow increase in fall 35 and water temperature changes greater than 3 c for all seasons these similarities and contrasts between acus watersheds hydrologic responses provide an opportunity for regional management of climate induced impacts on water resources mitigation strategies such as regional conservation of forests and wetlands can alleviate water scarcity and extreme flow events occurring across the acus under the assumed emissions scenario results suggest that changes in seasonal air temperature and water temperature may be linearly related in watersheds at lower elevations with no snow influence while streamflow precipitation and air temperature changes have complex non linear relationships graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change atlantic coast of the united states water temperature changes streamflow changes regional management nature based solutions 1 introduction water resources are fundamentally important to economic social and ecological systems freshwater availability influences domestic supply irrigation practices hydropower generation and agro industrial activities while water temperatures and seasonal thermal regimes serve critical roles in water quality whitehead et al 2009 as well as ecosystem structure and function knouft and ficklin 2017 management of water resources has relied on the assumption that climate and hydrologic cycles while variable in the short term are characterized by stationarity over longer time periods however the impacts of ongoing directional changes in climate on watershed hydrology and riverine water temperature have rendered this assumption invalid with milly et al 2008 noting that stationarity is dead and no longer serves as a useful framework for water resource management while this assertion has been verified in numerous studies mohseni et al 1998 gooseff et al 2005 wilby and dessai 2010 green et al 2011 isaak et al 2012 van dijk et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 razavi et al 2015 hornbach et al 2016 the rates of directional changes in hydrologic responses characterizing non stationarity are not consistent ficklin et al 2018 both within and among basins moreover ongoing increases in air temperature which vary with latitude and elevation coupled with basin specific responses have created a geographic mosaic of water temperature increases within and among basins isaak et al 2012 dugdale et al 2018 fullerton et al 2018 and like changes in local hydrologic regimes suggest the need for place based management of riverine thermal characteristics in the coming decades such as riparian restoration dam removal reduction of withdrawals or beaver dams steel et al 2017 this lack of consistency can result in challenges to developing general management approaches and climate adaptation strategies to projected changes in water resources moreover this spatial variability in non stationary responses to changes in climate occurs across political intra and intergovernmental and social e g urban to rural boundaries where resource interests may vary while stationarity is dead spatial variation in basin hydrology political and social interests are alive and well and likely critical to the management of water resources in the coming decades gleick 2018 noted that use of freshwater resources is dictated by the hydrologic cycle human demands population size social economic cultural and technological applications to water management the management of these resources has been suggested to be a wicked problem largely because of the social needs driving management decisions rittel and webber 1973 the problem is also wicked because of the variety of stakeholders and issues that need to be addressed and because there is rarely a single outcome that will appease the needs of all participants rittel and webber 1973 crowley and head 2017 these challenges become even more complicated in a non stationary climate where there is limited opportunity to learn through trial and error as well as a lack of information regarding future projections of the unique responses of individual basins to changes in climate levin et al 2012 addressing these challenges will almost certainly rely on accurate projections of future environmental conditions however to be effective these projections also need to be developed at a scale relevant to management of human demands of these resources as well as the application of technologies that allow adaptation to climate change the cooperation and interaction between stakeholders and policy actors from multiple institutional territories acting in a functional regulatory space is needed to tackle the problems linked to climate change varone et al 2013 the use of hydrologic and water temperature models has become a common approach to projecting changes in streamflow water temperature and water quality gleick 1986 miller and russell 1992 kirshen and fennessey 1995 stefan et al 1996 hidalgo et al 2009 botero acosta et al 2019 giri et al 2019 pandey et al 2020 henriksen et al 2021 most of these studies focus on a single watershed and its response to climate change within its boundaries thus limiting the analysis to relatively homogeneous geographic conditions climate vegetation topography and without the opportunity to compare the effect of climate change on an array of geographically heterogenous hydrologic systems alternatively other studies have analyzed climate change effects using streamflow and water temperature models from a global perspective based on outputs from a conglomeration of watersheds arnell 2003 milly et al 2005 van vliet et al 2013 which can overlook the spatially variable importance of basin specific responses while the single watershed approach provides a focused assessment of parameters and the global approach provides a perspective on spatial variation in hydrologic responses the strengths of both approaches enable the analysis of spatial variability in unique hydrologic responses across large geographic regions a regional analysis of climate change impacts on water resources based on the ensemble of responses from unique hydrologic systems can provide meaningful information for regional water management programs indicating why regional studies applying hydrological spectral and statistical analysis to evaluate the response of streamflow to climate change have gained relevance in the research community huziy et al 2013 demaria et al 2016 gu et al 2018 naz et al 2018 tamaddun et al 2019 miller et al 2021 sharma et al 2021 the atlantic coast of the united states acus has experienced spatially varied changes in air temperature and precipitation during the past century resulting in differential hydrologic responses across the latitudinal range of the region yang et al 2015 increases in water temperature in the eastern u s have also been projected to be among the largest in the world in the coming decades in addition to dramatic decreases in river flows in the southeastern u s van vliet et al 2013 the mentioned changes in water bodies affect acus residents in a diversity of ways landowners are experiencing flooding events farmers have had to shift planting times eastern shore land conservancy 2016 and fisheries stocks are shifting due to water temperature increases halvorson 2007 local governments state agencies academic institutions and nonprofit organizations in the acus have joined efforts to share knowledge increase collective awareness of climate change and cap co2 emissions ambrette 2017 c2es n d rggi n d ongoing local projects across the acus jointly coordinated by the c2e2 center for climate and energy solutions are focused on the adaptation of local economic and infrastructure development to climate change in the cities of ithaca ny baltimore md norfolk va and north charleston sc brush 2022 the chesapeake bay program is a larger scale initiative that includes a strategic management effort to restore the bay based on watershed airshed and estuary models the focus of this program with regards to future climate change is to quantify and reduce its impact on nutrient and sediment transport to the bay area hood et al 2021 other regional studies of climate change impacts on the acus have mainly been focused on frequency of coastal hurricane floods sea level rise and alteration of marsh vegetation fitzgerald and hughes 2019 marsooli et al 2019 and have not addressed the implications of changes in precipitation and air temperature on freshwater systems at the regional level regarding water resources management larger cities in the acus such as new york and boston have developed programs to identify upcoming impacts due to climate change on urban structure and services the new york city department of environmental protection developed a climate risk management framework to include sea level rise temperature increases and frequency and intensity of droughts and floods to the new york city water system planning rosenzweig et al 2007 the considered adaptation strategies included management infrastructure and policies considering potential effects of climate change on new york city water supply sewer and wastewater systems similarly the climate s long term impacts on metro boston project explored climate change effects on water availability and quality of city s supply systems which include local and outside basins ruth et al 2006 although these studies highlight regional efforts as necessary since most climate change impacts span several jurisdictions the hydrologic analysis of the adaptation and mitigation programs were done at the city watershed level recent studies have investigated trends of climate change impacts on water resources in acus watersheds with several focusing on the impact of historic climate change on water cycle components such as streamflow snow coverage evapotranspiration yang et al 2015 schulte et al 2016 thakur et al 2020 ford et al 2021 however as mentioned previously stationarity is no longer a useful framework for understanding lotic systems and upcoming water management measures require the consideration of future climate projections johnson et al 2015 simulated the impact of future climate on water quantity and quality for three watersheds located in the acus while pourmokhtarian et al 2017 investigated the impacts of projected climate on the ecohydrology of seven small watersheds in the northern acus a more regional approach carried out by demaria et al 2016 studied the changes in the annual cycle for the northern acus region for the end of the century finding that significant changes may occur during winter due to increases in precipitation and reductions in snow coverage demaria et al 2016 is the most comprehensive regional study of climate change effects on water resources developed in the acus despite the numerous studies and management programs related to climate change to the acus region there is limited research published on the opportunities for regional water management programs based on the seasonality of projected climate induced changes on water resources across acus watersheds seasonality is a key component of water management jung et al 2013 kelly et al 2018 serrano et al 2020 and should be considered when analyzing current and future water related issues identifying upcoming seasonal challenges in water availability and riverine temperature at a regional level improves our ability to understand how reliably watershed management practices can be generalized among watersheds in the coming decades this comes along with the need to strengthen management decisions to support future regional water supply especially considering that streamflow drivers are region dependent and mechanisms regulating streamflow depend on biogeographic regions trancoso et al 2017 regional collaborative efforts from communities sharing risks and challenges can have a greater effect reduce costs ambrette 2017 and have a broader impact on global water cycle global vegetation and global climate sheil 2018 this paper addresses a gap in the published literature by quantifying the watershed specific seasonal needs possibly brought by future climate across the acus and identifying regional water management strategies suitable for the projected range of responses found across the region furthermore we extend previous work on the relationships between climate and hydrologic variables and identify how latitude and seasonal variations across the acus may condition these relationships the objective of this study was to identify potential regional climate change management actions for the acus based on shared water related challenges deficit and excess among watersheds for this we analyzed the spatial variability of projected changes rcp 8 5 in seasonal streamflow and seasonal water temperature for the middle 2040 2069 and end 2070 2099 of the 21st century with respect to a baseline 1970 1999 as well as the relationships between changes in seasonal hydrological and climatic variables across the latitudinal gradient of the acus streamflow and water temperature data simulated with coupled watershed swat and water temperature models for major acus watersheds and 20 gcms rcp 8 5 were used to compute the seasonal changes that were analyzed to identify whether certain climate adaptation management strategies may be broadly generalizable across watersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the acus has 23 4 of the total population in the u s 17 of 20 of the most densely populated counties acs 2018 yet only 12 0 of the land area the watersheds encompassing the acus span a wide latitudinal range 30 8 n 46 5 n with variable environmental social and economic characteristics the region also contains a variable array of ecoregions including coastal plains in the south piedmont areas in the mid atlantic region and highland regions in the northern acus epa 2013 air temperature and precipitation patterns vary with latitude and elevation across the acus along with the form of precipitation and contributions of snowmelt to riverine systems which explain significant aspects of streamflow variability within the region feng et al 2016 the study area comprises the major watersheds of the acus partially covering the states of georgia south carolina north carolina virginia maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york vermont new hampshire massachusetts connecticut rhode island and maine along with washington d c fig 1 the region has a total area of 656 903 km2 and drains to the atlantic ocean the predominant land cover types are forest 48 6 grassland 12 6 wetlands 11 1 and developed areas 10 5 cropland 7 5 has been gradually abandoned since 1901 due to human migration to urban areas yang et al 2015 increasing the population density in the northern region from washington d c to boston groundwater systems across the acus include the northern atlantic coastal plain composed of ten regional aquifers providing water supply for domestic public industrial and agricultural activities for nearly 21 million residents masterson et al 2016 part of the southeastern coastal plain aquifer composed of six aquifers providing water for municipal industrial and irrigation activities aucott 1996 and the recently discovered freshwater aquifer off the coast of new england and new jersey morton 2019 the range of latitudes covered by the acus 30 50 46 20 encompasses a variety of ecosystems and climates northern vegetation is mainly composed of evergreen and deciduous needle leaf forests while central ecosystem types include needle and broad leaf deciduous forests and southern areas are mainly comprised of needle leaf evergreen forests and some wetlands located in coastal areas of georgia and south carolina yang et al 2015 additionally the northern region of the acus has a more topographically variable landscape increasing surface run off processes considering this spatial variability and the relatively unique physical characteristics of particular regions the study area was divided into eight watersheds to simulate the hydrologic responses across the acus maine bay massachusetts bay hudson delaware chesapeake bay albemarle pamlico the carolinas and satilla altamaha table s1 fig 1 2 2 hydrologic model the hydrologic models for each of the watersheds of the acus were developed using the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 similar to methods in neupane et al 2019 described hereafter swat is a semi distributed watershed model that incorporates land use soil topography and climate data to simulate watershed processes runoff infiltration snow melt and groundwater and river flow the swat model has been widely applied in hydro climatic modeling of watersheds around the world zhang et al 2007 ficklin et al 2009 githui et al 2009 wu et al 2012 narsimlu et al 2013 tamm et al 2018 bhatta et al 2019 chen et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 aawar and khare 2020 each acus watershed was partitioned into subbasins containing hydrologic response units hrus which are based on unique combinations of landuse soil and slope the watershed processes are estimated using a water balance equation within each hru and then summed up to the subbasin level this process includes information on canopy interception of rain infiltration and surface run off computed through the curve number method evapotranspiration leaf area index and soil water availability water that infiltrates into the vadose zone can either be removed from the soil by plant uptake or evaporation move laterally to streams lateral flow or percolate below the root zone where it is partitioned between shallow and deep aquifers neitsch et al 2011 the potential evapotranspiration et is computed with the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 solved for alfalfa at a 40 cm height as reference crop the actual et is obtained from the accumulation of the evaporation from the canopy the plant transpiration and the soil evaporation neitsch et al 2011 the evaporation from the canopy is computed as a function of the rainfall interception estimated as the initial abstractions in the curve number runoff method if the potential et is less than the amount of water intercepted by the canopy then the actual et is set to be equal to the evaporation from the canopy and equivalent to the potential et otherwise the remaining evaporative demand is partitioned between vegetation and soil snow the vegetation transpiration is computed by adjusting the penman monteith equation with a coefficient proportional to the plant s leaf area index lai the lai varies during growing season and is computed by swat as a function of the maximum potential lai and the fraction of the plant s growing season for a simulated time step finally if evaporation demand from the soil exists 50 of this demand is extracted from the top 10 mm of the soil profile and the remainder from the top 10 cm the soil water content at each time step is estimated based on the previous time step water balance as a function of the precipitation runoff evapotranspiration percolation and return flow the occurrence of snow is determined by precipitation data air temperature data and a threshold temperature value the snow melt process is controlled by air temperature melting rate and areal coverage of snow when water reaches a stream segment through overland flow lateral flow or baseflow the water is routed along the main channel of each subbasin through the variable storage routing method williams 1969 based in the continuity equation which computes the change in volume stored per time step and stream segment topography used for watershed delineation was input as a 90 m digital elevation model dem jarvis et al 2008 while the land use was extracted from the national landcover database nlcd usgs 2016 and input as a 30 m grid the nlcd is a monitoring program updating land use information for the u s at 5 year intervals the nlcd maps have been reported to have overall accuracies of 72 standard error of 0 9 wickham et al 2021 the soil map was created from the statsgo database and input as a 1 km grid usgs 2018 daily air temperature and precipitation data were derived from grid based 1 8 degree network observed meteorological data for the period 1950 1999 maurer et al 2007 other climate variables including solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were computed using the weather generator tool in swat based on observations of at least 20 years arnold et al 2012 2 3 water temperature model water temperature within each subbasin was estimated using the combined effects of air temperature and hydrologic conditions streamflow snowmelt groundwater runoff and lateral flow using a water temperature model coupled to each calibrated and validated swat hydrologic model ficklin et al 2012 mustafa et al 2018 the ficklin et al 2012 water temperature model considers contributions from 1 water temperature from within the subbasin 2 water temperature from upstream of the subbasin and 3 heat exchange between stream water and air contributions from within the subbasin are computed using three dimensionless calibration coefficients α β and γ which relate the contribution of snowmelt groundwater surface run off and lateral flow to local stream water temperature contributions from upstream are considered by adding the water temperature of streams entering the subbasin modified by a factor that depends on the water yield and the streamflow at the outlet of the subbasin finally the effect of air temperature is computed using the bulk coefficient heat transfer k 1 h the travel time of water through the subbasin lag h and an air temperature addition coefficient eta c for cases when air temperature is below zero the water temperature model does not require additional input data beyond what is supplied for the swat hydrologic model the outputs from the calibrated hydrologic model surface runoff streamflow snowmelt and groundwater streamflow into stream are used as inputs for the water temperature model calibration 2 4 calibration and validation of the models each swat watershed model was calibrated and validated independently using the multi site genetically adaptive calibration algorithm amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 this method applies multiple optimization algorithms including non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 particle swarm optimization eberhart et al 2001 metropolis hastings algorithm haario et al 2001 and differential evolution storn and price 1997 records of monthly streamflow from 1950 to 1999 from a total of 438 usgs stream gauges table s3 with an average of 429 records per site were split for calibration first 65 of data and validation last 35 of data table s3 fig s1 the nash sutcliffe ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 the refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the general agreement between simulated and observed streamflow evaluate the error between observed and simulated data and compare the variation of the observed and simulated values respectively a ns value of 1 indicates an optimal model performance though ns values above 0 5 are considered satisfactory for monthly streamflow data moriasi et al 2007 the dr values are bounded by 1 and 1 being values closer to 1 indicators of smaller differences between predicted and observed willmott et al 2012 the r2 values range from 0 to 1 being larger values indicators of less error variance in general r2 values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 parameters related to overland groundwater and river flows were calibrated for each watershed additionally parameters related to snowfall were considered for the watersheds where significant snowfall may occur the ranges of calibration for all the conceptual parameters related to snow processes were set in accordance with the suggested values in the swat documentation arnold et al 2012 as a semi distributed hydrologic model swat has a large number of parameters to conceptualize small scale physical processes whittaker et al 2010 similarly the parameters of the water temperature model α β γ k lag and eta see ficklin et al 2012 were calibrated using amalgam for each watershed monthly water temperature data at 59 gauges table s3 from 1950 to 1999 with a mean number of records per station of 116 were split between calibration first 65 and validation last 35 periods the water temperature model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error mae to estimate the average error between observed and simulated ns to evaluate the general agreement of observed and simulated data and r2 to compare observed and simulated water temperature values the mae indicates the error between observed and simulated in the units of the variable c being mae values of 0 indicators of a perfect fit 2 5 simulation of climate induced changes the calibrated hydrologic and water temperature models for each watershed were used to simulate future streamflow and water temperature for the 20 general circulation models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 under rcp 8 5 projected streamflow and water temperature data used in this study is publicly available at the hydroclim project website www hydroclim org changes in seasonal air temperature and seasonal cumulative precipitation were computed across the acus region and watershed means were plotted to identify seasonal and spatial trends in climate variables rcp 8 5 assumes high population growth with a slow income growth that will increase energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of climate change policies riahi et al 2011 this rcp that has been wrongly called the baseline or the business as usual scenario for being the only rcp that does not include any mitigation actions riahi et al 2011 hausfather 2019 has been criticized due to its low probability of occurrence ho et al 2019 however it is important to clarify that all rcps span over the whole range of possible estimated radiative forcing values to be found by 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 and that rcp 8 5 can still be considered as a high end forcing scenario for research purposes with a probability of exceedance higher than 35 christensen et al 2018 moreover the recently released united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change report ipcc 2022 provided no favorable assessment in regards to meeting the paris agreement goals that would limit global warming to 1 5 c by the end of the century total global emissions from 2010 to 2019 were larger than any previous decade using the most critical scenario acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of predicting future emission concentrations daily precipitation and air temperature time series data downscaled to a spatial resolution of 1 8 approximately 12 km and bias corrected using the method of bias correction construction analogues bcca maurer et al 2010 were implemented after the simulation of the studied periods the changes in water temperature and streamflow by the mid 2040 2069 and end of 2070 2099 century with respect to the baseline 1970 1999 were computed per each of the gcms which were then averaged to obtain one value per stream section the use of a single gcm would not have provided the necessary information to predict the impact of future climate over streamflow and water temperature while the ensemble average decreases the uncertainty of future projections and provides more robust results cubasch et al 2001 gleckler et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 relative changes in seasonal streamflow and absolute changes in seasonal water temperature were calculated for all subbasins or stream sections within each focal watershed in the acus based on baseline mid and end of century estimates to better characterize and analyze the single stream seasonal streamflow and seasonal water temperature changes simulated over the acus region watershed mean values were estimated and plotted the uncertainty of watershed mean changes in seasonal water temperature and streamflow introduced by the spread across the gcm s ensemble was estimated for each watershed single watershed probability density functions pdfs were also created to identify the spatial variability of seasonal response within each hydrologic system spearman correlation matrices were generated to identify relationships between the changes in hydroclimatologic variables these correlations indicate the strength of the monotonic relationship between changes in precipitation air temperature streamflow and water temperature by the end of the century two sets of data were used to compute spearman correlations each providing different information of interest the first statistic ρs is the spearman correlation in geographic space computed with the seasonal watershed means for the entire studied period while the second statistic ρt is the spearman correlation in time computed with the multiyear seasonal time series for each watershed the former details the correlation between the studied variables from a spatial perspective whereas the latter indicates the correlation from a temporal perspective 3 results 3 1 projected changes in climate all acus watersheds are expected to experience seasonal air temperature increases with respect to the baseline during both future time periods fig 2 moreover projected differences between current and future air temperatures tend to increase among watersheds from south to north for all seasons in both time periods with the lowest 3 3 c and the highest 6 1 c watershed mean increases occurring during winter by the end of the century fig 4 seasonal cumulative precipitation is projected to increase in most of the acus area for both time periods except for the southern watershed of satilla altamaha fig 3 which will experience small reductions in precipitation watershed mean latitudinal trends suggest relatively larger increases of precipitation in northern watersheds in winter and spring whereas southern watersheds tend to have relatively greater precipitation increases in summer and fall fig 4 a particularity observed on the watershed mean precipitation changes was the contrast of winter and spring spatial trends with fall spatial trends winter and spring changes increased from south 0 94 to north 22 8 while fall changes increased from north 5 1 to south 14 6 3 2 calibration of hydrologic and water temperature models the hydrologic models showed a good performance fig s1 with global mean ns values for calibration and validation periods of 0 71 standard deviation sd 0 1 and 0 72 sd 0 09 respectively mean r2 coefficient of 0 76 sd 0 07 and 0 77 sd 0 07 for calibration and validation respectively and mean dr of 0 75 sd 0 04 and 0 74 sd 0 04 for calibration and validation respectively the water temperature models fig s2 had global mean mae for calibration of 1 65 c sd 0 6 c and 1 62 c sd 0 6 c for validation mean ns of 0 90 for both calibration sd 0 09 and validation sd 0 08 periods and r2 of 0 96 sd 0 04 and 0 97 sd 0 01 for calibration and validation periods respectively watershed specific metrics are presented in table s3 the model evaluation statistics suggest that the models produce accurate streamflow and water temperature results and can therefore be used for a climate change impacts assessment the calibration parameters that derived the most satisfactory results for the concurrent multi site calibration processes were summarized in table s2 3 3 gcm ensemble uncertainty the uncertainty introduced by the spread across the gcm ensemble to watershed mean changes in seasonal water temperature and streamflow was estimated for each watershed the standard deviation was used to describe the scatter of the gcm ensemble values around the mean the standard deviation has been widely used as a measure of uncertainty in varied fields macdonald and strachan 2001 meyer 2007 strobel 2015 including gcm ensemble projections pinto et al 2007 pindyck 2012 carvajal et al 2017 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 seasonal changes in streamflow and water temperature for individual gcms within the cmip5 ensemble were used to compute the uncertainty contained in watershed mean changes table s4 uncertainty values for the relative changes in seasonal streamflow increased from mid to the end of the century with ranges of 6 2 28 45 for midcentury to 8 07 38 47 for the end of the century spring was the season with the smallest sd values for streamflow changes in all the watersheds as opposed to fall with the largest sd values regarding the spatial trends northern watersheds had smaller uncertainties than southern ones uncertainty values for the absolute changes in water temperature also increased from mid to the end of the century with ranges of 0 14 0 91 c for midcentury to 0 36 1 29 c for the end of the century winter was the season with the smallest uncertainty while summer had the largest one 3 4 seasonal relationships between hydrologic and climate variables 3 4 1 changes in streamflow watershed mean changes in streamflow by the end of the century suggest both decreases and increases in streamflow will likely occur in all seasons at different locations across the acus figs 5 and 7 in the winter northern maine massachusetts and hudson and central delaware and chesapeake bay watersheds are projected to experience the greatest streamflow increases up to 68 by the end of the century all watersheds had summer watershed mean reductions except for albemarle pamlico which showed an increase of 22 fig 4 the largest projected watershed mean reductions up to 25 fig 7 were observed during spring and summer at northern and central watersheds in the fall southern watersheds albemarle pamlico the carolinas and satilla altamaha presented larger streamflow volumes up to 35 compared to central and northern watersheds which had streamflow increases as well as reductions up to 14 the single watershed pdfs fig s3 indicated that simulated seasonal streamflow changes within northern and central watershed stream sections were widely varied while southern watersheds presented less variable pdfs fig s3 nonetheless the most frequent changes occurring in all seasons agreed with the watershed mean analyses winter results indicate a prevalence of streamflow increases in northern and central watersheds while results from spring and summer predominantly indicated decreases in streamflow for all acus watersheds except for albemarle pamlico with changes from 31 9 in spring and from 39 21 in summer the most frequent changes during fall varied from 16 38 including decreases in streamflow for northern and central watersheds and increases for southern watersheds fig s3 3 4 2 changes in water temperature increases in water temperature are projected across the acus during both future time periods watershed mean water temperature changes figs 6 and 7 indicate that summer and fall will experience the largest water temperature increases for all acus watersheds during both studied periods followed by spring and winter acus watershed mean water temperature changes of up to 6 2 c 5 3 c 4 4 c and 3 6 c were projected for summer fall spring and winter respectively for the end of the century summer and fall had a similar pattern of water temperature increases across the acus declining from northern to southern watersheds as opposed to winter while spring increases did not have a clear spatial tendency across the acus fig 7 the single watershed pdfs for simulated seasonal water temperature changes in acus stream sections suggest intensified seasonal differentiation in northern and central watersheds for which winter pdfs are located on the lower range of values most frequent values of 0 2 2 6 c while summer and fall pdfs are located towards the upper range 2 6 5 2 c fig s3 similar to streamflow changes water temperature changes for all seasons appeared to be more spatially homogeneous in southern watersheds than in northern and central watersheds having relatively high frequencies concentrated over a small range of values the most frequent seasonal water temperature changes over the entire acus by the end of the century were between 0 3 and 4 c for winter 1 7 and 4 6 c for spring 2 6 and 5 5 c for summer and 2 2 and 5 4 c for fall fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 projected changes in climate the seasonal spatial trends observed in 2040 2069 for precipitation and air temperature changes were maintained and accentuated in 2070 2099 these projected changes in air temperature and precipitation suggest the latitudinal and seasonal patterns driving the hydrologic cycle are variable among watersheds in the acus with unique combinations of changes in air temperature and precipitation among watersheds and seasons while this type of variability is not necessarily unexpected the implications to the regulation of watershed process among basins are not generally understood and trends in climate may not translate to similar trends in hydrologic processes 4 2 calibration of hydrologic and water temperature models the calibration ranges for all parameters were set within recommended values of occurrence suggested in the swat model documentation though some calibrated parameters were found to have values with a varied range across acus watersheds this was the case of the initial residue cover rsdin and the maximum canopy storage canmx little or no initial residue cover observed for northern maine bay massachusetts bay and hudson watersheds was accompanied by large values of maximum canopy storage up to 99 mm while central and southern watersheds presented large values of initial residue cover 250 kg ha accompanied in most of the cases by zero canopy storage both of these parameters are used in the overland flow computation more specifically in the estimation of the initial abstractions of rainfall occurring at the canopy and the soil surface prior to runoff as explained by the principle of equifinality a specific value of initial abstractions can be obtained by different combinations of canopy storage and residue cover hence the combinations of large and almost null values for these two parameters the complex structure of the swat model the number of parameters that require calibration from observed data and the relationships between some parameters makes it prone to experience equifinality due to the uncertainty in the parameter values ficklin and barnhart 2014 wu et al 2022 however swat parameters uncertainty although important has a relatively small contribution to simulation uncertainty compared to model structure and data quality contributions li et al 2010 4 3 seasonal relationships between hydrologic and climate variables 4 3 1 changes in streamflow watershed mean changes in streamflow are linked to the watershed location with respect to the latitude at which winter snow occurs northern and central watersheds are located north of latitude 37 n table s1 the observed outcome for winter streamflows is the result of the combined effects of changes in air temperature precipitation and location fig 2 and fig 3 winter had the highest ρs values positive or negative fig 8 among all seasons for all variable pairs watersheds with larger winter precipitation increases are also projected to experience greater air temperature changes ρs 0 98 which in combination with the snow to rainfall transition and melting of snow in the northern region of the acus will result in greater winter streamflows additionally winter air temperature in the northern part of the acus will still be low enough that increases in evapotranspiration will not result in significant streamflow losses limiting conditions regarding water availability are likely to occur during spring and summer by the end of the century with projected watershed mean reductions close to 25 in maine and delaware fig 7 the spatial correlation analyses of spring data resulted in high ρs positive or negative between air temperature precipitation and streamflow changes fig 8 positive ρs between air temperature and precipitation changes ρs 0 98 was accompanied by a negative relationship between these two variables and streamflow changes ρs 0 86 and 0 89 respectively during the spring season northern and central watersheds with the largest increases in air temperature and precipitation will not likely undergo snow to rainfall transitions which was shifted to the winter season but rather an increase in evapotranspiration leading to a reduction in the amount of water in the soil and draining to streams these results agree with campbell et al 2011 who reported that future flows in new england northern acus watersheds would shift to higher values in winter and lower values in spring due to more rain less snow and thinner snowpack similarly davies and vavrus 1991 found spring streamflow to decrease in the northern region of the acus due to reductions in snowmelt by the end of the century summer watershed mean reductions were encountered in all watersheds but albemarle pamlico which is projected to have the largest increase in summer precipitation fig 4 and one of the lowest increases in summer air temperature albemarle pamlico may experience summer floods with watershed mean streamflow increases of 22 fall exhibited a strong negative relationship between projected air temperature and precipitation changes ρs 0 83 fig 8 separating northern and central watersheds from southern watersheds with the latter having smaller increases air temperature and larger increases in precipitation this pattern was accompanied by a slight positive correlation between streamflow and precipitation ρs 0 55 and a negative correlation between streamflow and air temperature ρs 0 64 in the fall southern watersheds with larger precipitation changes and lower air temperature increases will have lower evapotranspiration rates implying larger streamflow volumes up to 35 compared to central and northern watersheds that have small precipitation increases and large air temperature increases leading to smaller streamflow increases as well as reductions up to 14 fig 7 4 3 2 changes in water temperature spatial patterns in water temperature changes did not exhibit trends similar to those of air temperature fig 8 furthermore winter water temperature changes exhibited the opposite spatial trends compared to those observed for air temperature changes which suggests the importance of thermal contributions from water sources other than the direct effects of air temperature for this season figs 4 and 7 winter watershed mean water temperature changes were negatively correlated across space with precipitation changes ρs 0 74 air temperature changes ρs 0 76 and streamflow changes ρs 0 67 fig 8 watersheds with larger and colder overland flows on the northern acus will experience a dampening effect on the impact of air temperature on water temperature this effect could also be caused by increased groundwater flows constantz 1998 but given that only winter exhibited this behavior and the relatively high increases in air temperature and precipitation it is likely that the cooling effect was produced by increased pulses of snowmelt snowmelt would keep overland flow water close to 0 c even while air temperature rises mohseni et al 1998 it is important to note that this does not contradict the understanding that water temperature is positively correlated to air temperature erickson and stefan 2000 gardner et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 both air temperature and water temperature increased in all watersheds indicating a monotonic relationship between these two variables table s5 but the amount of water temperature increase appears to be affected by cold flows stemming from snowmelt at higher latitudes during warmer winters impacting the spatial relationship of the changes in these two variables the bivariate plots of the multiyear seasonal time series fig 9 and the temporal correlations ρt fig 8 table s5 suggest the temporal relationship between air temperature and water temperature changes for each one of the acus watersheds the ρt for these two variables ranged from 0 94 to 1 00 for all seasons and watersheds except for the chesapeake bay table s5 suggesting a strong positive monotonic temporal relationship it is important to recall that the spearman correlation captures the monotonic relationship between two sets of ranked data which may or may not be linear proportional change between both variables having this in mind a spearman correlation of 1 00 is an indicator of a positive monotonic temporal relationship not a perfectly linear relationship however the plots of the multiyear time series of air temperature change and water temperature change for southern watersheds suggest that the relationship between the changes in these two variables over time could be proportional and in some cases even approximate to a 1 1 line fig 9 this was also observed in central and northern watersheds for summer and fall to further analyze this apparent linear relationship the pearson correlation ρp between air and water temperature changes was computed table s6 values of ρp for all basins and seasons ranged from 0 67 to 0 99 with the largest values found in southern watersheds during summer and fall this suggests that increases in air temperature in time will be directly transferred to water temperature under warmer conditions where an increase of 1 c in seasonal air temperature will lead to an increase of 1 c in seasonal water temperature while colder conditions although positively correlated will require a greater increase in air temperature to achieve a water temperature increase of 1 c temporal data aggregation has been reported to impact the correlation between air temperature and water temperature morrill et al 2005 found that few streams had a 1 1 linear relationship between daily air temperature and water temperature data however a greater tendency towards the linear relationship was found as daily data were averaged over longer periods of time this influence of time aggregation could be explained by the concept of thermal inertia as water temperature does not react instantaneously to air temperature changes increasing the time aggregation of the analysis will allow for this lag in response to be sidestepped letcher et al 2016 the range of temperatures has also been reported to impact the relationship between air and water temperatures the inclusion of low temperature records e g below freezing air temperatures improved the accuracy of nonlinear regressions over linear regressions morrill et al 2005 mohseni and stefan 1999 reported that the air temperature and water temperature linear relationship would be valid for air temperatures between 5 c and 25 c above this range evaporative cooling would level off water temperature letcher et al 2016 reported that water temperature from streams was synchronized with air temperature roughly from spring to fall other authors have limited the linear analysis to the ice free period erickson and stefan 2000 hilderbrand et al 2014 this suggests that for the seasonal analysis conducted in our study in which temperature ranges are discretized by seasons a stronger linear temporal relationship in regions and seasons with warmer temperatures is expected the chesapeake bay watershed is projected to experience the smallest increases in water temperature for all seasons this negative peak in water temperature change fig 7 breaks the spatial trend followed for the rest of acus basins being the largest basin table s1 the chesapeake bay watershed also has a high prevalence of forested area 92 000 km2 fig s4 and high altitudes fig s5 relative to the other acus watersheds the chesapeake bay watershed also had the largest area in the highland zone of the acus fig s5 which might affect the temperature of runoff and groundwater as well as the heat transfer process from air to water in rivers due to lower pressure conditions morrill et al 2005 reported that streams at high elevations presented the lowest relationship between changes in air temperature and water temperatures while streams located at elevations below 463 m a s l had relationships from 1 to 0 7 outliers tend to decrease correlation values blurring the general behavior of the data the observed general behavior without the influence of chesapeake bay watershed values suggests that fall water temperature changes are positively correlated in space with air temperature changes and negatively correlated with precipitation and streamflow 4 4 potential regional management approaches for the acus seasonal changes in streamflow and water temperature across acus watersheds were analyzed to identify opportunities for regional management of water resources under the assumed future climate scenarios establishing water management regions for future climate based on projected climate change responses is expected to provide more cost efficient measures and have a broader impact than local disconnected actions ambrette 2017 moreover water resource management is considered a powerful promoter of regional integration and growth rahaman and varis 2009 and must be at the core of adaptation strategies the seasonality found in projected changes in hydroclimatologic variables across the latitudinal gradient of the acus suggest that a regional management strategy approach may be suitable under the simulated greenhouse gasses emission scenario rcp 8 5 to alleviate the pressure on water resources these strategies may allow acus economic activities to continue operating through seasonal water shortages and extreme events as well as secure a water supply for densely populated areas in the case that the critical emissions scenario considered for this study occurs northern and central watersheds may be required to prioritize management strategies for spring and summer droughts and flood control measures for winter events for southern watersheds fall will be the critical season with floods likely taking place northern and central acus watersheds maine bay massachusetts bay hudson delaware and chesapeake bay encompass a total area of 368 055 km2 across 14 states table s1 of which more than 50 is forested land followed by developed areas 11 and grassland 10 given the characteristics of these watersheds and the projected climate change related challenges an ecosystem based mitigation strategy represents a powerful regional climate change management measure for short and long terms this type of management practice is part of the a nature based solutions nbs approach wickenberg et al 2021 nbs uses nature to provide vital ecosystem services while remedying global challenges hanson et al 2020 and have been reported to be as effective or more than alternative options to climate change management chausson et al 2020 oecd 2020 any action geared to protect sustainably manage or restore ecosystems to address societal challenges and provide human well being can be considered a nbs cohen shacham et al 2016 nbss are not sustainable when applied on isolated sites as the service provided by the associated ecosystem likely depend on processes occurring at large scale oecd 2020 a regional program geared to restore and protect the forested areas in northern and central acus watersheds will have a regional and global impact forested areas provide ecosystem services including as freshwater retention seidl et al 2016 extreme event buffering zurbriggen et al 2014 spyrou et al 2021 and global climate regulation kurz et al 2008 forests are already crucial in northern and central acus watersheds e g more than 10 million people living in new york city rely on the water supply from two basins that are 90 forested furniss et al 2010 however despite the importance of this ecosystem and the relatively extensive area that it currently holds the large number of water consumers and private forested areas not adequately preserved and have created high pressure on primary drinking water sources furniss et al 2010 pressure that is expected to increase as development of private forests occur large scale disturbances in forested areas cause substantial impacts on hydrological processes wei and zhang 2010 a regional program that protects healthy native forest and restores impaired systems will provide ecosystem services that can directly reduce the projected climate change impacts forests improve infiltration and aquifer recharge providing clean and reliable water yield and reduces flood occurrence anderson et al 1976 bredemeier et al 2011 forest canopy also regulates solar radiation st hilaire et al 2000 ohira et al 2021 healthy evergreen and deciduous forests in northern and central acus watersheds can also moderate early snowmelt reducing winter streamflow increases the reduction in runoff rates will foster infiltration and aquifer recharge throughout the year improving underground storages that maintains baseflow during dry months stoelzle et al 2014 spyrou et al 2021 with cool water flows boosting streamflow and water temperature regulation during drier summer and fall periods at a global scale evapotranspiration from forests and vegetation represents the most important input for terrestrial precipitation sheil 2018 deforestation and changes in vegetation alter the global water cycle modifying precipitation drivers elsewhere and increasing the frequency of extreme event occurrence across the globe millan 2014 recovery and protection of forested areas over a regional extent can regulate water flows and intensify water cooling ellison et al 2017 a regional initiative focused on the restoration of the large forested area present in northern and central acus watersheds could have significant impacts on projected streamflow changes as well as ease water temperature regulation the southern albemarle pamlico carolinas and satilla altamaha watersheds have a total area of 288 848 km2 from which more than 30 corresponds to forested land followed by wetlands 17 and grassland 15 a primary projected water resource issue under the assumed climate scenario for the southern watersheds is increased summer and fall discharge a potential nbs suitable to reduce flood impacts is the protection and development of wetlands wetlands are one of the predominant ecosystems in the southern acus table s1 nearly half of the nation s wetlands are located in the southeastern u s hefner et al 1994 these ecosystems including coastal swamps salt marshes floodplains riverine wetlands and freshwater marshes epa n d provide diverse ecological and environmental services coastal wetlands for example can protect communities and properties from storm surges and are a natural flood attenuation system gulf coast ecosystem recovery task force 2011 while floodplains and riverine wetlands protect communities from floods by retaining water and simultaneously provide recreational areas and also sustain native biodiversity oecd 2020 moreover despite being only 5 8 of the global landscape wetlands sequester 830 tg year of carbon mitsch et al 2013 the efficiency of these ecosystems services rely on wetland continuity and vegetation barbier et al 2013 features that are being jeopardized by population growth and land transformations the nation s wetlands loss rate has been reported to be 25 faster between 2004 and 2009 than in 1998 2004 krikstan 2013 in the states corresponding to southern acus watersheds over a million acres of wetlands were lost from 1970 to 1980 hefner et al 1994 a collaborative effort among southern acus watersheds to protect and restore the continuity and vegetation of southeastern wetlands would provide a mitigation strategy to attenuate the impacts of projected increases on streamflow increase carbon sequestration and prevent carbon emissions produced by wetland alteration 4 5 limitations we acknowledge that results from this study hold uncertainties inherent to future climate projections hydrologic model structure and parameters gcm structure initial conditions downscaling and emissions scenarios are a large source of uncertainty in the projection of changes in streamflow and water temperature chen et al 2011 wu et al 2015 naz et al 2018 the gcm ensemble average used in this study indicated that model uncertainty will increase from mid to end of the century spring and fall hold the smallest and largest uncertainty values for streamflow changes respectively while winter and summer had the smallest and largest uncertainty values for water temperature changes respectively table s4 removing the uncertainties inherent to using ensemble of climate models is not possible until the understanding of climatological processes and accurate predictions of future greenhouse gases emissions are possible nevertheless using a multi model average with its uncertainty results in a more robust approach than solely relying on the results from one gcm pierce et al 2009 model related limitations can be broken down in model structure and calibrated parameters the swat model discretization methods based on hrus can affect the impact of landuse slope and soil the model creates unique combinations of predominant categories of these variables losing some information from the input data the application of the curve number method to estimate runoff amount based on the cumulative precipitation occurring in a day as opposed to by rainfall event can also impact the estimated amount of water flowing overland infiltrating and evaporating guo et al 2019 equifinality of model parameters also added uncertainty on the projected streamflow and water temperature values ficklin and barnhart 2014 however model related uncertainty has been measured to be less than the uncertainty introduced by the gcm ensemble thompson et al 2013 her et al 2019 other factors influencing projected streamflow and water temperature are land use changes and human activities given the assumed emissions scenario rcp 8 5 large population growth is expected by the end of the century likely causing urban center expansion tewari et al 2017 and paved land increase in rural areas renkow and hoover 2000 this will be exacerbated by the fact that urban areas are becoming less compact seto et al 2011 with increases of urban land exceeding those of urban population growth watersheds currently holding the largest urban areas delaware and massachusetts bay table s1 will likely experience the largest expansion of their urban cores while low density residential areas across all acus watersheds will likely increase low density residential increase is already the most important threat to forested areas theobald and romme 2007 these landuse modifications will likely increase projected overland flows and reduce infiltrating and percolating flows which would translate to more dramatic increases in wet seasons accompanied by less groundwater reserves for baseflow maintenance during dry seasons further studies should be conducted to include the impact of land use changes in the acus hydrologic responses to climate change finally the analysis was mainly driven by watershed mean values which did not include intra watershed spatial variations of changes in streamflow and water temperature but facilitated a regional scale analysis while summarizing the information from all watershed subbasins 5 conclusions the spatial and temporal relationships characterized in this project confirmed the complex non linear relationship between precipitation streamflow and air temperature fu et al 2007 specifically due to the role that air temperature plays in evapotranspiration and snowmelt processes the positive and linear temporal relationships between air temperature and water temperature observed in southern watersheds for all seasons and in central and northern watersheds for summer and fall excepting the chesapeake bay suggest that changes in seasonal air temperature can be directly transferred to seasonal water temperature if the following conditions are satisfied 1 stream elevation is close to sea level and 2 the season has no snowmelt effects likewise our results also highlighted the importance of considering hydrologic factors in water temperature modeling to accomplish a more comprehensive modeling framework watersheds at high elevations or with snow presence showed a non proportional relationship between air and water temperature changes projected seasonal air temperature and cumulative precipitation across the acus in the coming century are projected to be predominantly higher than recent conditions changes in climate variables suggest spatial trends clearly differentiated by seasons with winter experiencing the most dramatic increases in precipitation and the overall greatest increases in air temperature occurring in northern watersheds the overall seasonal and spatial trends observed in 2040 2069 for precipitation and air temperature changes were maintained in 2070 2099 however seasonal differentiation was accentuated by the end of the century projected changes in climate were found to trigger a wide range of responses within watersheds depending on latitude season and elevation similar seasonal trends were encountered for northern and central watersheds these presented streamflow decreases in spring and summer and the overall largest increases in winter with winter exhibiting the smallest water temperature changes on the other hand southern watersheds exhibited the largest streamflow increases in fall and significant water temperature changes were estimated for all seasons these similarities between watersheds can be leveraged through the implementation of collaborative regional management strategies in accordance with the characteristics of each subregion regional collaboration to create and apply mitigation and adaptation strategies based on shared future challenges could be a pathway to achieve a more efficient use of resources two clear groups of watersheds were recognized to share similar water related challenges northern and central watersheds were identified to experience similar seasonal responses under future climate conditions with the largest watershed mean streamflow increases in winter and the greatest streamflow reductions occurring in spring and summer and the latter accompanied by the highest increases in water temperature on the other hand southern watersheds were found to have the greatest streamflow increases occurring in fall with the greatest water temperature increases occurring also in fall and in summer the dominant economic activities and land cover at acus watersheds make nbs potential and effective regional managerial strategies for climate change northern and central watershed nbs practices should be geared to restore and protect forested areas to reduce winter runoff flows increase groundwater recharge and regulate water temperature through groundwater inputs to streams groundwater recharge should be considered in water management strategies for climate change adaptation as they are underground storage compartments that have an impact on both streamflow and water temperature on the other hand southern watersheds can implement nbs that protect and improve wetlands creating a continuous flood control system that would decrease the impacts of projected streamflow increases despite the discussed limitations the results of this research contribute to the assessment of the future challenges that can occur across the acus under the most extreme emissions scenario an extension of this work would involve the simulation of the regional management opportunities identified in this study and their impacts on water temperature and streamflow under future climate conditions however the implementation of nbs strategies across large regions would likely not be part of a future emissions scenario corresponding to the assumed rcp 8 5 a simulation of the proposed managerial practices across the acus will also imply a lower impact emission scenario that accounts for the effects of nbs on climate forcings credit

7788,study region watersheds of the atlantic coast of the united states acus spanning a latitudinal range of 30 8 n 46 5 n study focus this study assessed climate induced changes cmip5 rcp 8 5 in projected streamflow and water temperature estimates from individual swat watershed models across the acus territory by mid and end of the century seasonal and spatial trends as well as relationships between hydroclimatologic variables were analyzed to identify opportunities for regional implementation of water management strategies new hydrological insights for the region changes in hydroclimatologic variables suggest spatial trends clearly differentiated by seasons northern and central watersheds are projected to experience the most dramatic changes in winter summer and spring streamflows 67 25 and 24 respectively and summer water temperature 6 2 c while southern watersheds presented the largest streamflow increase in fall 35 and water temperature changes greater than 3 c for all seasons these similarities and contrasts between acus watersheds hydrologic responses provide an opportunity for regional management of climate induced impacts on water resources mitigation strategies such as regional conservation of forests and wetlands can alleviate water scarcity and extreme flow events occurring across the acus under the assumed emissions scenario results suggest that changes in seasonal air temperature and water temperature may be linearly related in watersheds at lower elevations with no snow influence while streamflow precipitation and air temperature changes have complex non linear relationships graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change atlantic coast of the united states water temperature changes streamflow changes regional management nature based solutions 1 introduction water resources are fundamentally important to economic social and ecological systems freshwater availability influences domestic supply irrigation practices hydropower generation and agro industrial activities while water temperatures and seasonal thermal regimes serve critical roles in water quality whitehead et al 2009 as well as ecosystem structure and function knouft and ficklin 2017 management of water resources has relied on the assumption that climate and hydrologic cycles while variable in the short term are characterized by stationarity over longer time periods however the impacts of ongoing directional changes in climate on watershed hydrology and riverine water temperature have rendered this assumption invalid with milly et al 2008 noting that stationarity is dead and no longer serves as a useful framework for water resource management while this assertion has been verified in numerous studies mohseni et al 1998 gooseff et al 2005 wilby and dessai 2010 green et al 2011 isaak et al 2012 van dijk et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 razavi et al 2015 hornbach et al 2016 the rates of directional changes in hydrologic responses characterizing non stationarity are not consistent ficklin et al 2018 both within and among basins moreover ongoing increases in air temperature which vary with latitude and elevation coupled with basin specific responses have created a geographic mosaic of water temperature increases within and among basins isaak et al 2012 dugdale et al 2018 fullerton et al 2018 and like changes in local hydrologic regimes suggest the need for place based management of riverine thermal characteristics in the coming decades such as riparian restoration dam removal reduction of withdrawals or beaver dams steel et al 2017 this lack of consistency can result in challenges to developing general management approaches and climate adaptation strategies to projected changes in water resources moreover this spatial variability in non stationary responses to changes in climate occurs across political intra and intergovernmental and social e g urban to rural boundaries where resource interests may vary while stationarity is dead spatial variation in basin hydrology political and social interests are alive and well and likely critical to the management of water resources in the coming decades gleick 2018 noted that use of freshwater resources is dictated by the hydrologic cycle human demands population size social economic cultural and technological applications to water management the management of these resources has been suggested to be a wicked problem largely because of the social needs driving management decisions rittel and webber 1973 the problem is also wicked because of the variety of stakeholders and issues that need to be addressed and because there is rarely a single outcome that will appease the needs of all participants rittel and webber 1973 crowley and head 2017 these challenges become even more complicated in a non stationary climate where there is limited opportunity to learn through trial and error as well as a lack of information regarding future projections of the unique responses of individual basins to changes in climate levin et al 2012 addressing these challenges will almost certainly rely on accurate projections of future environmental conditions however to be effective these projections also need to be developed at a scale relevant to management of human demands of these resources as well as the application of technologies that allow adaptation to climate change the cooperation and interaction between stakeholders and policy actors from multiple institutional territories acting in a functional regulatory space is needed to tackle the problems linked to climate change varone et al 2013 the use of hydrologic and water temperature models has become a common approach to projecting changes in streamflow water temperature and water quality gleick 1986 miller and russell 1992 kirshen and fennessey 1995 stefan et al 1996 hidalgo et al 2009 botero acosta et al 2019 giri et al 2019 pandey et al 2020 henriksen et al 2021 most of these studies focus on a single watershed and its response to climate change within its boundaries thus limiting the analysis to relatively homogeneous geographic conditions climate vegetation topography and without the opportunity to compare the effect of climate change on an array of geographically heterogenous hydrologic systems alternatively other studies have analyzed climate change effects using streamflow and water temperature models from a global perspective based on outputs from a conglomeration of watersheds arnell 2003 milly et al 2005 van vliet et al 2013 which can overlook the spatially variable importance of basin specific responses while the single watershed approach provides a focused assessment of parameters and the global approach provides a perspective on spatial variation in hydrologic responses the strengths of both approaches enable the analysis of spatial variability in unique hydrologic responses across large geographic regions a regional analysis of climate change impacts on water resources based on the ensemble of responses from unique hydrologic systems can provide meaningful information for regional water management programs indicating why regional studies applying hydrological spectral and statistical analysis to evaluate the response of streamflow to climate change have gained relevance in the research community huziy et al 2013 demaria et al 2016 gu et al 2018 naz et al 2018 tamaddun et al 2019 miller et al 2021 sharma et al 2021 the atlantic coast of the united states acus has experienced spatially varied changes in air temperature and precipitation during the past century resulting in differential hydrologic responses across the latitudinal range of the region yang et al 2015 increases in water temperature in the eastern u s have also been projected to be among the largest in the world in the coming decades in addition to dramatic decreases in river flows in the southeastern u s van vliet et al 2013 the mentioned changes in water bodies affect acus residents in a diversity of ways landowners are experiencing flooding events farmers have had to shift planting times eastern shore land conservancy 2016 and fisheries stocks are shifting due to water temperature increases halvorson 2007 local governments state agencies academic institutions and nonprofit organizations in the acus have joined efforts to share knowledge increase collective awareness of climate change and cap co2 emissions ambrette 2017 c2es n d rggi n d ongoing local projects across the acus jointly coordinated by the c2e2 center for climate and energy solutions are focused on the adaptation of local economic and infrastructure development to climate change in the cities of ithaca ny baltimore md norfolk va and north charleston sc brush 2022 the chesapeake bay program is a larger scale initiative that includes a strategic management effort to restore the bay based on watershed airshed and estuary models the focus of this program with regards to future climate change is to quantify and reduce its impact on nutrient and sediment transport to the bay area hood et al 2021 other regional studies of climate change impacts on the acus have mainly been focused on frequency of coastal hurricane floods sea level rise and alteration of marsh vegetation fitzgerald and hughes 2019 marsooli et al 2019 and have not addressed the implications of changes in precipitation and air temperature on freshwater systems at the regional level regarding water resources management larger cities in the acus such as new york and boston have developed programs to identify upcoming impacts due to climate change on urban structure and services the new york city department of environmental protection developed a climate risk management framework to include sea level rise temperature increases and frequency and intensity of droughts and floods to the new york city water system planning rosenzweig et al 2007 the considered adaptation strategies included management infrastructure and policies considering potential effects of climate change on new york city water supply sewer and wastewater systems similarly the climate s long term impacts on metro boston project explored climate change effects on water availability and quality of city s supply systems which include local and outside basins ruth et al 2006 although these studies highlight regional efforts as necessary since most climate change impacts span several jurisdictions the hydrologic analysis of the adaptation and mitigation programs were done at the city watershed level recent studies have investigated trends of climate change impacts on water resources in acus watersheds with several focusing on the impact of historic climate change on water cycle components such as streamflow snow coverage evapotranspiration yang et al 2015 schulte et al 2016 thakur et al 2020 ford et al 2021 however as mentioned previously stationarity is no longer a useful framework for understanding lotic systems and upcoming water management measures require the consideration of future climate projections johnson et al 2015 simulated the impact of future climate on water quantity and quality for three watersheds located in the acus while pourmokhtarian et al 2017 investigated the impacts of projected climate on the ecohydrology of seven small watersheds in the northern acus a more regional approach carried out by demaria et al 2016 studied the changes in the annual cycle for the northern acus region for the end of the century finding that significant changes may occur during winter due to increases in precipitation and reductions in snow coverage demaria et al 2016 is the most comprehensive regional study of climate change effects on water resources developed in the acus despite the numerous studies and management programs related to climate change to the acus region there is limited research published on the opportunities for regional water management programs based on the seasonality of projected climate induced changes on water resources across acus watersheds seasonality is a key component of water management jung et al 2013 kelly et al 2018 serrano et al 2020 and should be considered when analyzing current and future water related issues identifying upcoming seasonal challenges in water availability and riverine temperature at a regional level improves our ability to understand how reliably watershed management practices can be generalized among watersheds in the coming decades this comes along with the need to strengthen management decisions to support future regional water supply especially considering that streamflow drivers are region dependent and mechanisms regulating streamflow depend on biogeographic regions trancoso et al 2017 regional collaborative efforts from communities sharing risks and challenges can have a greater effect reduce costs ambrette 2017 and have a broader impact on global water cycle global vegetation and global climate sheil 2018 this paper addresses a gap in the published literature by quantifying the watershed specific seasonal needs possibly brought by future climate across the acus and identifying regional water management strategies suitable for the projected range of responses found across the region furthermore we extend previous work on the relationships between climate and hydrologic variables and identify how latitude and seasonal variations across the acus may condition these relationships the objective of this study was to identify potential regional climate change management actions for the acus based on shared water related challenges deficit and excess among watersheds for this we analyzed the spatial variability of projected changes rcp 8 5 in seasonal streamflow and seasonal water temperature for the middle 2040 2069 and end 2070 2099 of the 21st century with respect to a baseline 1970 1999 as well as the relationships between changes in seasonal hydrological and climatic variables across the latitudinal gradient of the acus streamflow and water temperature data simulated with coupled watershed swat and water temperature models for major acus watersheds and 20 gcms rcp 8 5 were used to compute the seasonal changes that were analyzed to identify whether certain climate adaptation management strategies may be broadly generalizable across watersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the acus has 23 4 of the total population in the u s 17 of 20 of the most densely populated counties acs 2018 yet only 12 0 of the land area the watersheds encompassing the acus span a wide latitudinal range 30 8 n 46 5 n with variable environmental social and economic characteristics the region also contains a variable array of ecoregions including coastal plains in the south piedmont areas in the mid atlantic region and highland regions in the northern acus epa 2013 air temperature and precipitation patterns vary with latitude and elevation across the acus along with the form of precipitation and contributions of snowmelt to riverine systems which explain significant aspects of streamflow variability within the region feng et al 2016 the study area comprises the major watersheds of the acus partially covering the states of georgia south carolina north carolina virginia maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york vermont new hampshire massachusetts connecticut rhode island and maine along with washington d c fig 1 the region has a total area of 656 903 km2 and drains to the atlantic ocean the predominant land cover types are forest 48 6 grassland 12 6 wetlands 11 1 and developed areas 10 5 cropland 7 5 has been gradually abandoned since 1901 due to human migration to urban areas yang et al 2015 increasing the population density in the northern region from washington d c to boston groundwater systems across the acus include the northern atlantic coastal plain composed of ten regional aquifers providing water supply for domestic public industrial and agricultural activities for nearly 21 million residents masterson et al 2016 part of the southeastern coastal plain aquifer composed of six aquifers providing water for municipal industrial and irrigation activities aucott 1996 and the recently discovered freshwater aquifer off the coast of new england and new jersey morton 2019 the range of latitudes covered by the acus 30 50 46 20 encompasses a variety of ecosystems and climates northern vegetation is mainly composed of evergreen and deciduous needle leaf forests while central ecosystem types include needle and broad leaf deciduous forests and southern areas are mainly comprised of needle leaf evergreen forests and some wetlands located in coastal areas of georgia and south carolina yang et al 2015 additionally the northern region of the acus has a more topographically variable landscape increasing surface run off processes considering this spatial variability and the relatively unique physical characteristics of particular regions the study area was divided into eight watersheds to simulate the hydrologic responses across the acus maine bay massachusetts bay hudson delaware chesapeake bay albemarle pamlico the carolinas and satilla altamaha table s1 fig 1 2 2 hydrologic model the hydrologic models for each of the watersheds of the acus were developed using the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 similar to methods in neupane et al 2019 described hereafter swat is a semi distributed watershed model that incorporates land use soil topography and climate data to simulate watershed processes runoff infiltration snow melt and groundwater and river flow the swat model has been widely applied in hydro climatic modeling of watersheds around the world zhang et al 2007 ficklin et al 2009 githui et al 2009 wu et al 2012 narsimlu et al 2013 tamm et al 2018 bhatta et al 2019 chen et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 aawar and khare 2020 each acus watershed was partitioned into subbasins containing hydrologic response units hrus which are based on unique combinations of landuse soil and slope the watershed processes are estimated using a water balance equation within each hru and then summed up to the subbasin level this process includes information on canopy interception of rain infiltration and surface run off computed through the curve number method evapotranspiration leaf area index and soil water availability water that infiltrates into the vadose zone can either be removed from the soil by plant uptake or evaporation move laterally to streams lateral flow or percolate below the root zone where it is partitioned between shallow and deep aquifers neitsch et al 2011 the potential evapotranspiration et is computed with the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 solved for alfalfa at a 40 cm height as reference crop the actual et is obtained from the accumulation of the evaporation from the canopy the plant transpiration and the soil evaporation neitsch et al 2011 the evaporation from the canopy is computed as a function of the rainfall interception estimated as the initial abstractions in the curve number runoff method if the potential et is less than the amount of water intercepted by the canopy then the actual et is set to be equal to the evaporation from the canopy and equivalent to the potential et otherwise the remaining evaporative demand is partitioned between vegetation and soil snow the vegetation transpiration is computed by adjusting the penman monteith equation with a coefficient proportional to the plant s leaf area index lai the lai varies during growing season and is computed by swat as a function of the maximum potential lai and the fraction of the plant s growing season for a simulated time step finally if evaporation demand from the soil exists 50 of this demand is extracted from the top 10 mm of the soil profile and the remainder from the top 10 cm the soil water content at each time step is estimated based on the previous time step water balance as a function of the precipitation runoff evapotranspiration percolation and return flow the occurrence of snow is determined by precipitation data air temperature data and a threshold temperature value the snow melt process is controlled by air temperature melting rate and areal coverage of snow when water reaches a stream segment through overland flow lateral flow or baseflow the water is routed along the main channel of each subbasin through the variable storage routing method williams 1969 based in the continuity equation which computes the change in volume stored per time step and stream segment topography used for watershed delineation was input as a 90 m digital elevation model dem jarvis et al 2008 while the land use was extracted from the national landcover database nlcd usgs 2016 and input as a 30 m grid the nlcd is a monitoring program updating land use information for the u s at 5 year intervals the nlcd maps have been reported to have overall accuracies of 72 standard error of 0 9 wickham et al 2021 the soil map was created from the statsgo database and input as a 1 km grid usgs 2018 daily air temperature and precipitation data were derived from grid based 1 8 degree network observed meteorological data for the period 1950 1999 maurer et al 2007 other climate variables including solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were computed using the weather generator tool in swat based on observations of at least 20 years arnold et al 2012 2 3 water temperature model water temperature within each subbasin was estimated using the combined effects of air temperature and hydrologic conditions streamflow snowmelt groundwater runoff and lateral flow using a water temperature model coupled to each calibrated and validated swat hydrologic model ficklin et al 2012 mustafa et al 2018 the ficklin et al 2012 water temperature model considers contributions from 1 water temperature from within the subbasin 2 water temperature from upstream of the subbasin and 3 heat exchange between stream water and air contributions from within the subbasin are computed using three dimensionless calibration coefficients α β and γ which relate the contribution of snowmelt groundwater surface run off and lateral flow to local stream water temperature contributions from upstream are considered by adding the water temperature of streams entering the subbasin modified by a factor that depends on the water yield and the streamflow at the outlet of the subbasin finally the effect of air temperature is computed using the bulk coefficient heat transfer k 1 h the travel time of water through the subbasin lag h and an air temperature addition coefficient eta c for cases when air temperature is below zero the water temperature model does not require additional input data beyond what is supplied for the swat hydrologic model the outputs from the calibrated hydrologic model surface runoff streamflow snowmelt and groundwater streamflow into stream are used as inputs for the water temperature model calibration 2 4 calibration and validation of the models each swat watershed model was calibrated and validated independently using the multi site genetically adaptive calibration algorithm amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 this method applies multiple optimization algorithms including non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 particle swarm optimization eberhart et al 2001 metropolis hastings algorithm haario et al 2001 and differential evolution storn and price 1997 records of monthly streamflow from 1950 to 1999 from a total of 438 usgs stream gauges table s3 with an average of 429 records per site were split for calibration first 65 of data and validation last 35 of data table s3 fig s1 the nash sutcliffe ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 the refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the general agreement between simulated and observed streamflow evaluate the error between observed and simulated data and compare the variation of the observed and simulated values respectively a ns value of 1 indicates an optimal model performance though ns values above 0 5 are considered satisfactory for monthly streamflow data moriasi et al 2007 the dr values are bounded by 1 and 1 being values closer to 1 indicators of smaller differences between predicted and observed willmott et al 2012 the r2 values range from 0 to 1 being larger values indicators of less error variance in general r2 values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 parameters related to overland groundwater and river flows were calibrated for each watershed additionally parameters related to snowfall were considered for the watersheds where significant snowfall may occur the ranges of calibration for all the conceptual parameters related to snow processes were set in accordance with the suggested values in the swat documentation arnold et al 2012 as a semi distributed hydrologic model swat has a large number of parameters to conceptualize small scale physical processes whittaker et al 2010 similarly the parameters of the water temperature model α β γ k lag and eta see ficklin et al 2012 were calibrated using amalgam for each watershed monthly water temperature data at 59 gauges table s3 from 1950 to 1999 with a mean number of records per station of 116 were split between calibration first 65 and validation last 35 periods the water temperature model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error mae to estimate the average error between observed and simulated ns to evaluate the general agreement of observed and simulated data and r2 to compare observed and simulated water temperature values the mae indicates the error between observed and simulated in the units of the variable c being mae values of 0 indicators of a perfect fit 2 5 simulation of climate induced changes the calibrated hydrologic and water temperature models for each watershed were used to simulate future streamflow and water temperature for the 20 general circulation models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 under rcp 8 5 projected streamflow and water temperature data used in this study is publicly available at the hydroclim project website www hydroclim org changes in seasonal air temperature and seasonal cumulative precipitation were computed across the acus region and watershed means were plotted to identify seasonal and spatial trends in climate variables rcp 8 5 assumes high population growth with a slow income growth that will increase energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of climate change policies riahi et al 2011 this rcp that has been wrongly called the baseline or the business as usual scenario for being the only rcp that does not include any mitigation actions riahi et al 2011 hausfather 2019 has been criticized due to its low probability of occurrence ho et al 2019 however it is important to clarify that all rcps span over the whole range of possible estimated radiative forcing values to be found by 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 and that rcp 8 5 can still be considered as a high end forcing scenario for research purposes with a probability of exceedance higher than 35 christensen et al 2018 moreover the recently released united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change report ipcc 2022 provided no favorable assessment in regards to meeting the paris agreement goals that would limit global warming to 1 5 c by the end of the century total global emissions from 2010 to 2019 were larger than any previous decade using the most critical scenario acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of predicting future emission concentrations daily precipitation and air temperature time series data downscaled to a spatial resolution of 1 8 approximately 12 km and bias corrected using the method of bias correction construction analogues bcca maurer et al 2010 were implemented after the simulation of the studied periods the changes in water temperature and streamflow by the mid 2040 2069 and end of 2070 2099 century with respect to the baseline 1970 1999 were computed per each of the gcms which were then averaged to obtain one value per stream section the use of a single gcm would not have provided the necessary information to predict the impact of future climate over streamflow and water temperature while the ensemble average decreases the uncertainty of future projections and provides more robust results cubasch et al 2001 gleckler et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 relative changes in seasonal streamflow and absolute changes in seasonal water temperature were calculated for all subbasins or stream sections within each focal watershed in the acus based on baseline mid and end of century estimates to better characterize and analyze the single stream seasonal streamflow and seasonal water temperature changes simulated over the acus region watershed mean values were estimated and plotted the uncertainty of watershed mean changes in seasonal water temperature and streamflow introduced by the spread across the gcm s ensemble was estimated for each watershed single watershed probability density functions pdfs were also created to identify the spatial variability of seasonal response within each hydrologic system spearman correlation matrices were generated to identify relationships between the changes in hydroclimatologic variables these correlations indicate the strength of the monotonic relationship between changes in precipitation air temperature streamflow and water temperature by the end of the century two sets of data were used to compute spearman correlations each providing different information of interest the first statistic ρs is the spearman correlation in geographic space computed with the seasonal watershed means for the entire studied period while the second statistic ρt is the spearman correlation in time computed with the multiyear seasonal time series for each watershed the former details the correlation between the studied variables from a spatial perspective whereas the latter indicates the correlation from a temporal perspective 3 results 3 1 projected changes in climate all acus watersheds are expected to experience seasonal air temperature increases with respect to the baseline during both future time periods fig 2 moreover projected differences between current and future air temperatures tend to increase among watersheds from south to north for all seasons in both time periods with the lowest 3 3 c and the highest 6 1 c watershed mean increases occurring during winter by the end of the century fig 4 seasonal cumulative precipitation is projected to increase in most of the acus area for both time periods except for the southern watershed of satilla altamaha fig 3 which will experience small reductions in precipitation watershed mean latitudinal trends suggest relatively larger increases of precipitation in northern watersheds in winter and spring whereas southern watersheds tend to have relatively greater precipitation increases in summer and fall fig 4 a particularity observed on the watershed mean precipitation changes was the contrast of winter and spring spatial trends with fall spatial trends winter and spring changes increased from south 0 94 to north 22 8 while fall changes increased from north 5 1 to south 14 6 3 2 calibration of hydrologic and water temperature models the hydrologic models showed a good performance fig s1 with global mean ns values for calibration and validation periods of 0 71 standard deviation sd 0 1 and 0 72 sd 0 09 respectively mean r2 coefficient of 0 76 sd 0 07 and 0 77 sd 0 07 for calibration and validation respectively and mean dr of 0 75 sd 0 04 and 0 74 sd 0 04 for calibration and validation respectively the water temperature models fig s2 had global mean mae for calibration of 1 65 c sd 0 6 c and 1 62 c sd 0 6 c for validation mean ns of 0 90 for both calibration sd 0 09 and validation sd 0 08 periods and r2 of 0 96 sd 0 04 and 0 97 sd 0 01 for calibration and validation periods respectively watershed specific metrics are presented in table s3 the model evaluation statistics suggest that the models produce accurate streamflow and water temperature results and can therefore be used for a climate change impacts assessment the calibration parameters that derived the most satisfactory results for the concurrent multi site calibration processes were summarized in table s2 3 3 gcm ensemble uncertainty the uncertainty introduced by the spread across the gcm ensemble to watershed mean changes in seasonal water temperature and streamflow was estimated for each watershed the standard deviation was used to describe the scatter of the gcm ensemble values around the mean the standard deviation has been widely used as a measure of uncertainty in varied fields macdonald and strachan 2001 meyer 2007 strobel 2015 including gcm ensemble projections pinto et al 2007 pindyck 2012 carvajal et al 2017 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 seasonal changes in streamflow and water temperature for individual gcms within the cmip5 ensemble were used to compute the uncertainty contained in watershed mean changes table s4 uncertainty values for the relative changes in seasonal streamflow increased from mid to the end of the century with ranges of 6 2 28 45 for midcentury to 8 07 38 47 for the end of the century spring was the season with the smallest sd values for streamflow changes in all the watersheds as opposed to fall with the largest sd values regarding the spatial trends northern watersheds had smaller uncertainties than southern ones uncertainty values for the absolute changes in water temperature also increased from mid to the end of the century with ranges of 0 14 0 91 c for midcentury to 0 36 1 29 c for the end of the century winter was the season with the smallest uncertainty while summer had the largest one 3 4 seasonal relationships between hydrologic and climate variables 3 4 1 changes in streamflow watershed mean changes in streamflow by the end of the century suggest both decreases and increases in streamflow will likely occur in all seasons at different locations across the acus figs 5 and 7 in the winter northern maine massachusetts and hudson and central delaware and chesapeake bay watersheds are projected to experience the greatest streamflow increases up to 68 by the end of the century all watersheds had summer watershed mean reductions except for albemarle pamlico which showed an increase of 22 fig 4 the largest projected watershed mean reductions up to 25 fig 7 were observed during spring and summer at northern and central watersheds in the fall southern watersheds albemarle pamlico the carolinas and satilla altamaha presented larger streamflow volumes up to 35 compared to central and northern watersheds which had streamflow increases as well as reductions up to 14 the single watershed pdfs fig s3 indicated that simulated seasonal streamflow changes within northern and central watershed stream sections were widely varied while southern watersheds presented less variable pdfs fig s3 nonetheless the most frequent changes occurring in all seasons agreed with the watershed mean analyses winter results indicate a prevalence of streamflow increases in northern and central watersheds while results from spring and summer predominantly indicated decreases in streamflow for all acus watersheds except for albemarle pamlico with changes from 31 9 in spring and from 39 21 in summer the most frequent changes during fall varied from 16 38 including decreases in streamflow for northern and central watersheds and increases for southern watersheds fig s3 3 4 2 changes in water temperature increases in water temperature are projected across the acus during both future time periods watershed mean water temperature changes figs 6 and 7 indicate that summer and fall will experience the largest water temperature increases for all acus watersheds during both studied periods followed by spring and winter acus watershed mean water temperature changes of up to 6 2 c 5 3 c 4 4 c and 3 6 c were projected for summer fall spring and winter respectively for the end of the century summer and fall had a similar pattern of water temperature increases across the acus declining from northern to southern watersheds as opposed to winter while spring increases did not have a clear spatial tendency across the acus fig 7 the single watershed pdfs for simulated seasonal water temperature changes in acus stream sections suggest intensified seasonal differentiation in northern and central watersheds for which winter pdfs are located on the lower range of values most frequent values of 0 2 2 6 c while summer and fall pdfs are located towards the upper range 2 6 5 2 c fig s3 similar to streamflow changes water temperature changes for all seasons appeared to be more spatially homogeneous in southern watersheds than in northern and central watersheds having relatively high frequencies concentrated over a small range of values the most frequent seasonal water temperature changes over the entire acus by the end of the century were between 0 3 and 4 c for winter 1 7 and 4 6 c for spring 2 6 and 5 5 c for summer and 2 2 and 5 4 c for fall fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 projected changes in climate the seasonal spatial trends observed in 2040 2069 for precipitation and air temperature changes were maintained and accentuated in 2070 2099 these projected changes in air temperature and precipitation suggest the latitudinal and seasonal patterns driving the hydrologic cycle are variable among watersheds in the acus with unique combinations of changes in air temperature and precipitation among watersheds and seasons while this type of variability is not necessarily unexpected the implications to the regulation of watershed process among basins are not generally understood and trends in climate may not translate to similar trends in hydrologic processes 4 2 calibration of hydrologic and water temperature models the calibration ranges for all parameters were set within recommended values of occurrence suggested in the swat model documentation though some calibrated parameters were found to have values with a varied range across acus watersheds this was the case of the initial residue cover rsdin and the maximum canopy storage canmx little or no initial residue cover observed for northern maine bay massachusetts bay and hudson watersheds was accompanied by large values of maximum canopy storage up to 99 mm while central and southern watersheds presented large values of initial residue cover 250 kg ha accompanied in most of the cases by zero canopy storage both of these parameters are used in the overland flow computation more specifically in the estimation of the initial abstractions of rainfall occurring at the canopy and the soil surface prior to runoff as explained by the principle of equifinality a specific value of initial abstractions can be obtained by different combinations of canopy storage and residue cover hence the combinations of large and almost null values for these two parameters the complex structure of the swat model the number of parameters that require calibration from observed data and the relationships between some parameters makes it prone to experience equifinality due to the uncertainty in the parameter values ficklin and barnhart 2014 wu et al 2022 however swat parameters uncertainty although important has a relatively small contribution to simulation uncertainty compared to model structure and data quality contributions li et al 2010 4 3 seasonal relationships between hydrologic and climate variables 4 3 1 changes in streamflow watershed mean changes in streamflow are linked to the watershed location with respect to the latitude at which winter snow occurs northern and central watersheds are located north of latitude 37 n table s1 the observed outcome for winter streamflows is the result of the combined effects of changes in air temperature precipitation and location fig 2 and fig 3 winter had the highest ρs values positive or negative fig 8 among all seasons for all variable pairs watersheds with larger winter precipitation increases are also projected to experience greater air temperature changes ρs 0 98 which in combination with the snow to rainfall transition and melting of snow in the northern region of the acus will result in greater winter streamflows additionally winter air temperature in the northern part of the acus will still be low enough that increases in evapotranspiration will not result in significant streamflow losses limiting conditions regarding water availability are likely to occur during spring and summer by the end of the century with projected watershed mean reductions close to 25 in maine and delaware fig 7 the spatial correlation analyses of spring data resulted in high ρs positive or negative between air temperature precipitation and streamflow changes fig 8 positive ρs between air temperature and precipitation changes ρs 0 98 was accompanied by a negative relationship between these two variables and streamflow changes ρs 0 86 and 0 89 respectively during the spring season northern and central watersheds with the largest increases in air temperature and precipitation will not likely undergo snow to rainfall transitions which was shifted to the winter season but rather an increase in evapotranspiration leading to a reduction in the amount of water in the soil and draining to streams these results agree with campbell et al 2011 who reported that future flows in new england northern acus watersheds would shift to higher values in winter and lower values in spring due to more rain less snow and thinner snowpack similarly davies and vavrus 1991 found spring streamflow to decrease in the northern region of the acus due to reductions in snowmelt by the end of the century summer watershed mean reductions were encountered in all watersheds but albemarle pamlico which is projected to have the largest increase in summer precipitation fig 4 and one of the lowest increases in summer air temperature albemarle pamlico may experience summer floods with watershed mean streamflow increases of 22 fall exhibited a strong negative relationship between projected air temperature and precipitation changes ρs 0 83 fig 8 separating northern and central watersheds from southern watersheds with the latter having smaller increases air temperature and larger increases in precipitation this pattern was accompanied by a slight positive correlation between streamflow and precipitation ρs 0 55 and a negative correlation between streamflow and air temperature ρs 0 64 in the fall southern watersheds with larger precipitation changes and lower air temperature increases will have lower evapotranspiration rates implying larger streamflow volumes up to 35 compared to central and northern watersheds that have small precipitation increases and large air temperature increases leading to smaller streamflow increases as well as reductions up to 14 fig 7 4 3 2 changes in water temperature spatial patterns in water temperature changes did not exhibit trends similar to those of air temperature fig 8 furthermore winter water temperature changes exhibited the opposite spatial trends compared to those observed for air temperature changes which suggests the importance of thermal contributions from water sources other than the direct effects of air temperature for this season figs 4 and 7 winter watershed mean water temperature changes were negatively correlated across space with precipitation changes ρs 0 74 air temperature changes ρs 0 76 and streamflow changes ρs 0 67 fig 8 watersheds with larger and colder overland flows on the northern acus will experience a dampening effect on the impact of air temperature on water temperature this effect could also be caused by increased groundwater flows constantz 1998 but given that only winter exhibited this behavior and the relatively high increases in air temperature and precipitation it is likely that the cooling effect was produced by increased pulses of snowmelt snowmelt would keep overland flow water close to 0 c even while air temperature rises mohseni et al 1998 it is important to note that this does not contradict the understanding that water temperature is positively correlated to air temperature erickson and stefan 2000 gardner et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 both air temperature and water temperature increased in all watersheds indicating a monotonic relationship between these two variables table s5 but the amount of water temperature increase appears to be affected by cold flows stemming from snowmelt at higher latitudes during warmer winters impacting the spatial relationship of the changes in these two variables the bivariate plots of the multiyear seasonal time series fig 9 and the temporal correlations ρt fig 8 table s5 suggest the temporal relationship between air temperature and water temperature changes for each one of the acus watersheds the ρt for these two variables ranged from 0 94 to 1 00 for all seasons and watersheds except for the chesapeake bay table s5 suggesting a strong positive monotonic temporal relationship it is important to recall that the spearman correlation captures the monotonic relationship between two sets of ranked data which may or may not be linear proportional change between both variables having this in mind a spearman correlation of 1 00 is an indicator of a positive monotonic temporal relationship not a perfectly linear relationship however the plots of the multiyear time series of air temperature change and water temperature change for southern watersheds suggest that the relationship between the changes in these two variables over time could be proportional and in some cases even approximate to a 1 1 line fig 9 this was also observed in central and northern watersheds for summer and fall to further analyze this apparent linear relationship the pearson correlation ρp between air and water temperature changes was computed table s6 values of ρp for all basins and seasons ranged from 0 67 to 0 99 with the largest values found in southern watersheds during summer and fall this suggests that increases in air temperature in time will be directly transferred to water temperature under warmer conditions where an increase of 1 c in seasonal air temperature will lead to an increase of 1 c in seasonal water temperature while colder conditions although positively correlated will require a greater increase in air temperature to achieve a water temperature increase of 1 c temporal data aggregation has been reported to impact the correlation between air temperature and water temperature morrill et al 2005 found that few streams had a 1 1 linear relationship between daily air temperature and water temperature data however a greater tendency towards the linear relationship was found as daily data were averaged over longer periods of time this influence of time aggregation could be explained by the concept of thermal inertia as water temperature does not react instantaneously to air temperature changes increasing the time aggregation of the analysis will allow for this lag in response to be sidestepped letcher et al 2016 the range of temperatures has also been reported to impact the relationship between air and water temperatures the inclusion of low temperature records e g below freezing air temperatures improved the accuracy of nonlinear regressions over linear regressions morrill et al 2005 mohseni and stefan 1999 reported that the air temperature and water temperature linear relationship would be valid for air temperatures between 5 c and 25 c above this range evaporative cooling would level off water temperature letcher et al 2016 reported that water temperature from streams was synchronized with air temperature roughly from spring to fall other authors have limited the linear analysis to the ice free period erickson and stefan 2000 hilderbrand et al 2014 this suggests that for the seasonal analysis conducted in our study in which temperature ranges are discretized by seasons a stronger linear temporal relationship in regions and seasons with warmer temperatures is expected the chesapeake bay watershed is projected to experience the smallest increases in water temperature for all seasons this negative peak in water temperature change fig 7 breaks the spatial trend followed for the rest of acus basins being the largest basin table s1 the chesapeake bay watershed also has a high prevalence of forested area 92 000 km2 fig s4 and high altitudes fig s5 relative to the other acus watersheds the chesapeake bay watershed also had the largest area in the highland zone of the acus fig s5 which might affect the temperature of runoff and groundwater as well as the heat transfer process from air to water in rivers due to lower pressure conditions morrill et al 2005 reported that streams at high elevations presented the lowest relationship between changes in air temperature and water temperatures while streams located at elevations below 463 m a s l had relationships from 1 to 0 7 outliers tend to decrease correlation values blurring the general behavior of the data the observed general behavior without the influence of chesapeake bay watershed values suggests that fall water temperature changes are positively correlated in space with air temperature changes and negatively correlated with precipitation and streamflow 4 4 potential regional management approaches for the acus seasonal changes in streamflow and water temperature across acus watersheds were analyzed to identify opportunities for regional management of water resources under the assumed future climate scenarios establishing water management regions for future climate based on projected climate change responses is expected to provide more cost efficient measures and have a broader impact than local disconnected actions ambrette 2017 moreover water resource management is considered a powerful promoter of regional integration and growth rahaman and varis 2009 and must be at the core of adaptation strategies the seasonality found in projected changes in hydroclimatologic variables across the latitudinal gradient of the acus suggest that a regional management strategy approach may be suitable under the simulated greenhouse gasses emission scenario rcp 8 5 to alleviate the pressure on water resources these strategies may allow acus economic activities to continue operating through seasonal water shortages and extreme events as well as secure a water supply for densely populated areas in the case that the critical emissions scenario considered for this study occurs northern and central watersheds may be required to prioritize management strategies for spring and summer droughts and flood control measures for winter events for southern watersheds fall will be the critical season with floods likely taking place northern and central acus watersheds maine bay massachusetts bay hudson delaware and chesapeake bay encompass a total area of 368 055 km2 across 14 states table s1 of which more than 50 is forested land followed by developed areas 11 and grassland 10 given the characteristics of these watersheds and the projected climate change related challenges an ecosystem based mitigation strategy represents a powerful regional climate change management measure for short and long terms this type of management practice is part of the a nature based solutions nbs approach wickenberg et al 2021 nbs uses nature to provide vital ecosystem services while remedying global challenges hanson et al 2020 and have been reported to be as effective or more than alternative options to climate change management chausson et al 2020 oecd 2020 any action geared to protect sustainably manage or restore ecosystems to address societal challenges and provide human well being can be considered a nbs cohen shacham et al 2016 nbss are not sustainable when applied on isolated sites as the service provided by the associated ecosystem likely depend on processes occurring at large scale oecd 2020 a regional program geared to restore and protect the forested areas in northern and central acus watersheds will have a regional and global impact forested areas provide ecosystem services including as freshwater retention seidl et al 2016 extreme event buffering zurbriggen et al 2014 spyrou et al 2021 and global climate regulation kurz et al 2008 forests are already crucial in northern and central acus watersheds e g more than 10 million people living in new york city rely on the water supply from two basins that are 90 forested furniss et al 2010 however despite the importance of this ecosystem and the relatively extensive area that it currently holds the large number of water consumers and private forested areas not adequately preserved and have created high pressure on primary drinking water sources furniss et al 2010 pressure that is expected to increase as development of private forests occur large scale disturbances in forested areas cause substantial impacts on hydrological processes wei and zhang 2010 a regional program that protects healthy native forest and restores impaired systems will provide ecosystem services that can directly reduce the projected climate change impacts forests improve infiltration and aquifer recharge providing clean and reliable water yield and reduces flood occurrence anderson et al 1976 bredemeier et al 2011 forest canopy also regulates solar radiation st hilaire et al 2000 ohira et al 2021 healthy evergreen and deciduous forests in northern and central acus watersheds can also moderate early snowmelt reducing winter streamflow increases the reduction in runoff rates will foster infiltration and aquifer recharge throughout the year improving underground storages that maintains baseflow during dry months stoelzle et al 2014 spyrou et al 2021 with cool water flows boosting streamflow and water temperature regulation during drier summer and fall periods at a global scale evapotranspiration from forests and vegetation represents the most important input for terrestrial precipitation sheil 2018 deforestation and changes in vegetation alter the global water cycle modifying precipitation drivers elsewhere and increasing the frequency of extreme event occurrence across the globe millan 2014 recovery and protection of forested areas over a regional extent can regulate water flows and intensify water cooling ellison et al 2017 a regional initiative focused on the restoration of the large forested area present in northern and central acus watersheds could have significant impacts on projected streamflow changes as well as ease water temperature regulation the southern albemarle pamlico carolinas and satilla altamaha watersheds have a total area of 288 848 km2 from which more than 30 corresponds to forested land followed by wetlands 17 and grassland 15 a primary projected water resource issue under the assumed climate scenario for the southern watersheds is increased summer and fall discharge a potential nbs suitable to reduce flood impacts is the protection and development of wetlands wetlands are one of the predominant ecosystems in the southern acus table s1 nearly half of the nation s wetlands are located in the southeastern u s hefner et al 1994 these ecosystems including coastal swamps salt marshes floodplains riverine wetlands and freshwater marshes epa n d provide diverse ecological and environmental services coastal wetlands for example can protect communities and properties from storm surges and are a natural flood attenuation system gulf coast ecosystem recovery task force 2011 while floodplains and riverine wetlands protect communities from floods by retaining water and simultaneously provide recreational areas and also sustain native biodiversity oecd 2020 moreover despite being only 5 8 of the global landscape wetlands sequester 830 tg year of carbon mitsch et al 2013 the efficiency of these ecosystems services rely on wetland continuity and vegetation barbier et al 2013 features that are being jeopardized by population growth and land transformations the nation s wetlands loss rate has been reported to be 25 faster between 2004 and 2009 than in 1998 2004 krikstan 2013 in the states corresponding to southern acus watersheds over a million acres of wetlands were lost from 1970 to 1980 hefner et al 1994 a collaborative effort among southern acus watersheds to protect and restore the continuity and vegetation of southeastern wetlands would provide a mitigation strategy to attenuate the impacts of projected increases on streamflow increase carbon sequestration and prevent carbon emissions produced by wetland alteration 4 5 limitations we acknowledge that results from this study hold uncertainties inherent to future climate projections hydrologic model structure and parameters gcm structure initial conditions downscaling and emissions scenarios are a large source of uncertainty in the projection of changes in streamflow and water temperature chen et al 2011 wu et al 2015 naz et al 2018 the gcm ensemble average used in this study indicated that model uncertainty will increase from mid to end of the century spring and fall hold the smallest and largest uncertainty values for streamflow changes respectively while winter and summer had the smallest and largest uncertainty values for water temperature changes respectively table s4 removing the uncertainties inherent to using ensemble of climate models is not possible until the understanding of climatological processes and accurate predictions of future greenhouse gases emissions are possible nevertheless using a multi model average with its uncertainty results in a more robust approach than solely relying on the results from one gcm pierce et al 2009 model related limitations can be broken down in model structure and calibrated parameters the swat model discretization methods based on hrus can affect the impact of landuse slope and soil the model creates unique combinations of predominant categories of these variables losing some information from the input data the application of the curve number method to estimate runoff amount based on the cumulative precipitation occurring in a day as opposed to by rainfall event can also impact the estimated amount of water flowing overland infiltrating and evaporating guo et al 2019 equifinality of model parameters also added uncertainty on the projected streamflow and water temperature values ficklin and barnhart 2014 however model related uncertainty has been measured to be less than the uncertainty introduced by the gcm ensemble thompson et al 2013 her et al 2019 other factors influencing projected streamflow and water temperature are land use changes and human activities given the assumed emissions scenario rcp 8 5 large population growth is expected by the end of the century likely causing urban center expansion tewari et al 2017 and paved land increase in rural areas renkow and hoover 2000 this will be exacerbated by the fact that urban areas are becoming less compact seto et al 2011 with increases of urban land exceeding those of urban population growth watersheds currently holding the largest urban areas delaware and massachusetts bay table s1 will likely experience the largest expansion of their urban cores while low density residential areas across all acus watersheds will likely increase low density residential increase is already the most important threat to forested areas theobald and romme 2007 these landuse modifications will likely increase projected overland flows and reduce infiltrating and percolating flows which would translate to more dramatic increases in wet seasons accompanied by less groundwater reserves for baseflow maintenance during dry seasons further studies should be conducted to include the impact of land use changes in the acus hydrologic responses to climate change finally the analysis was mainly driven by watershed mean values which did not include intra watershed spatial variations of changes in streamflow and water temperature but facilitated a regional scale analysis while summarizing the information from all watershed subbasins 5 conclusions the spatial and temporal relationships characterized in this project confirmed the complex non linear relationship between precipitation streamflow and air temperature fu et al 2007 specifically due to the role that air temperature plays in evapotranspiration and snowmelt processes the positive and linear temporal relationships between air temperature and water temperature observed in southern watersheds for all seasons and in central and northern watersheds for summer and fall excepting the chesapeake bay suggest that changes in seasonal air temperature can be directly transferred to seasonal water temperature if the following conditions are satisfied 1 stream elevation is close to sea level and 2 the season has no snowmelt effects likewise our results also highlighted the importance of considering hydrologic factors in water temperature modeling to accomplish a more comprehensive modeling framework watersheds at high elevations or with snow presence showed a non proportional relationship between air and water temperature changes projected seasonal air temperature and cumulative precipitation across the acus in the coming century are projected to be predominantly higher than recent conditions changes in climate variables suggest spatial trends clearly differentiated by seasons with winter experiencing the most dramatic increases in precipitation and the overall greatest increases in air temperature occurring in northern watersheds the overall seasonal and spatial trends observed in 2040 2069 for precipitation and air temperature changes were maintained in 2070 2099 however seasonal differentiation was accentuated by the end of the century projected changes in climate were found to trigger a wide range of responses within watersheds depending on latitude season and elevation similar seasonal trends were encountered for northern and central watersheds these presented streamflow decreases in spring and summer and the overall largest increases in winter with winter exhibiting the smallest water temperature changes on the other hand southern watersheds exhibited the largest streamflow increases in fall and significant water temperature changes were estimated for all seasons these similarities between watersheds can be leveraged through the implementation of collaborative regional management strategies in accordance with the characteristics of each subregion regional collaboration to create and apply mitigation and adaptation strategies based on shared future challenges could be a pathway to achieve a more efficient use of resources two clear groups of watersheds were recognized to share similar water related challenges northern and central watersheds were identified to experience similar seasonal responses under future climate conditions with the largest watershed mean streamflow increases in winter and the greatest streamflow reductions occurring in spring and summer and the latter accompanied by the highest increases in water temperature on the other hand southern watersheds were found to have the greatest streamflow increases occurring in fall with the greatest water temperature increases occurring also in fall and in summer the dominant economic activities and land cover at acus watersheds make nbs potential and effective regional managerial strategies for climate change northern and central watershed nbs practices should be geared to restore and protect forested areas to reduce winter runoff flows increase groundwater recharge and regulate water temperature through groundwater inputs to streams groundwater recharge should be considered in water management strategies for climate change adaptation as they are underground storage compartments that have an impact on both streamflow and water temperature on the other hand southern watersheds can implement nbs that protect and improve wetlands creating a continuous flood control system that would decrease the impacts of projected streamflow increases despite the discussed limitations the results of this research contribute to the assessment of the future challenges that can occur across the acus under the most extreme emissions scenario an extension of this work would involve the simulation of the regional management opportunities identified in this study and their impacts on water temperature and streamflow under future climate conditions however the implementation of nbs strategies across large regions would likely not be part of a future emissions scenario corresponding to the assumed rcp 8 5 a simulation of the proposed managerial practices across the acus will also imply a lower impact emission scenario that accounts for the effects of nbs on climate forcings credit

7789,study region loess plateau lp china study focus this study aimed to research whether and to what degree afforestation contributes to the variations in moist heat stress in the study area here wet bulb temperature tw was used to quantify the moist heat stress subsequently the weather research and forecasting model wrf is applied to simulate the modulation of climate change related to afforestation during 2001 2015 based on the analysis of energy fluxes we identified the biogeophysical mechanism of afforestation impact on moist heat stress new hydrological insights for the region since the operation of the grain to green program lp has experienced widespread afforestation which perturbs energy and water fluxes affecting regional climate regimes the forest expansion increases relative humidity but cools the regional temperature as a significant combined climate factor the average moist heat stress decreases with the magnitude of 0 1 0 3 c in central lp while the decrease rate of tw is slower than near surface temperature it is worth noting that an increased signal occurs in the maximum tw almost 0 2 c in eastern and northeastern lp which might expose humans to the risk of moist heat stress by the mechanistic analysis the research shows that the near surface temperature and sensible heat flux are dominant driving factors for the change of tw furthermore the subsidence of the planetary boundary layer enhances moist heat stress overall afforestation s effects on land surface atmosphere interaction are non negligible and the moist heat stress should be accounted for in climate change adaptation strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords afforestation moist heat stress climate change heat fluxes loess plateau data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction global warming is an undeniable reality kerr 2007 xu et al 2018 and most research on heat stress extremes under continued warming tends to focus on independent climate indicators such as temperature precipitation etc cao et al 2019 zhang and liang 2018 however some researches investigate that heat stress extremes were more frequently associated with surface humidity variation than surface temperature variation raymond et al 2017 sherwood 2018 kang and eltahir 2018 so it is not convinced to research heat stress using a single indicator that is to say the heat stress is moderated by moisture mishra et al 2020 as one of the most severe heat hazards moist heat stress greatly challenges economic activities agricultural resources and ecosystems significantly affecting human health it is well established that due to extreme heat stress events there is a substantial reduction in work productivity zander et al 2015 kjellstrom et al 2016 rao et al 2020 moreover moist heat stress will decrease the body s evaporation rate and exacerbate physiological heat stress increasing morbidity and mortality raymond et al 2017 freychet et al 2020 in china some areas have already witnessed moist heat stress conditions during summer from 1971 to 2014 luo and lau 2021 freychet et al 2020 meaning that more people will be exposed to heat stroke however most of the research ignored the interaction between landcover and the atmosphere leading to more uncertainty in researching the impact of moist heat stress there is still no clear consensus about how moist heat stress related risks emerge from the interplay between natural heat acclimatization and human activity nowadays studying the mechanism of human activity in the land atmosphere process is attracting increasing attention intensive anthropogenic activities e g urbanization land cover change irrigation etc modifies land atmosphere processes through the alteration of the regional water cycle and energy transfer cherubini et al 2018 which in turn affects the region s micro climate many researchers have investigated the impact of irrigation and urbanization on moisture content mishra et al 2020 yang et al 2021 however as one of the essential human mediated activities afforestation has a visible effect on the regional moisture heat stress the revegetation influences the climate not only by the biogeochemical process carbon sequestration forzieri et al 2017 but also by biogeophysical processes davin and noblet ducoudré 2010 the greening trend changes biogeophysical characteristics affecting energy and water fluxes keenan et al 2016 on the one hand open terrain has a higher albedo than forest betts 2000 betts 2011 jach et al 2020 so more radiation is absorbed after forest expansion which leads to an increase in available energy hence to warming gibbard et al 2005 bonan et al 2008 lansu et al 2020 on the other hand afforestation creates a deeper root system and greater transpiring leaf area which will promote latent heat flux and cool the surface peng et al 2014 bright et al 2015 as a result the balance of radiation and heat flux impacts determines which mechanism has the greater influence on regional climate scholars have made numerous attempts to demonstrate that afforestation modifies the occurrence of climate factors including precipitation evapotranspiration patterns hoek van dijke et al 2022 odoulami et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 hu et al 2019 abiodun et al 2013 teuling et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 many of these are studies on temperature due to the different in biogeophysical processes the impact of afforestation on temperature will vary from region to region in tropical region the dominant factor affecting the temperature is nonradiative forcing caused by the high rates of evapotranspiration in tropical forests the temperature will decrease after afforestation betts 2000 li et al 2015 as for boreal forests afforestation lower albedo than before warming the climate baldocchi et al 2004 while there is still no clear consensus about whether the climate response of the temperate forest will be cooling or warming bonan et al 2008 moreover the effect of afforestation on moisture heat stress is still unclear hence modeling the impact of afforestation on temperature humidity and moist heat stress with greater spatial temporal details from energy balance is needed to explore how the change affects the local climate sylla et al 2016 china is one of the countries with the highest amounts of afforestation as remote sensing image shows an extensive trend of revegetation has been observed in china zhai et al 2015 feng et al 2013 with a greening area of 212 million ha in 2008 feng et al 2016 cfs 2019 especially in the loess plateau lp in 1999 the chinese government established the grain to green gtg program cao et al 2018 han et al 2021 up to 2012 the extension of forest area in the central lp ningxia shanxi and shaanxi accounted for 11 2 of the land area of the three provinces xiao 2014 to quantify the afforestation influence on climate previous studies have demonstrated the change of single climate factors related to afforestation such as temperature precipitation etc cao et al 2019 however the cumulative effects of afforestation continue to directly impact ecosystem functions due to other factors such as moist heat stress which are crucial yet uncertain in lp with the dual influence of global warming and afforestation exposure to the risk of high moist heat stress will cause a severe impact on the local economy human living comfort and agricultural production koteswara et al 2020 meanwhile given that lp has a population of more than 0 1 billion people data from the outline of comprehensive management planning for the loess plateau 2010 2030 clearing how climate change and large scale afforestation affect local moist heat stress is a critical scientific topic with practical implications therefore it is essential to detect whether and to what degree afforestation contributes to the moisture heat condition huang et al 2020 after implementing the gtg program in the lp afforestation and its climatic implications on a regional scale have been investigated with the ultimate goal of statistically defining the climate response particularly the moist heat response to land surface change in general the methodologies can be divided into empirical studies based on observed data such as in situ observation and satellite observations zhang et al 2014 zhang and liang 2018 and land atmosphere interactions model simulations lansu et al 2020 jach et al 2020 li et al 2016 alkama and cescatti 2016 van heerwaarden and teuling 2014 in most cases the latter effectively isolates land cover change s radiative and nonradiative processes thus modeling tools are pretty helpful in determining how vital vegetation greening can be in moderating climate changes worldwide ge et al 2019 to study the impact of afforestation on the land surface atmosphere interaction we used the weather research and forecasting model wrf and generated control and vegetation greening scenarios we investigated the association between moist heat stress and the elements that contribute to it our goal was to 1 assess the magnitudes of vegetation change in lp during the summer june july and august from 2001 to 2015 2 analyze the climate response to different greening scenarios and 3 investigate the impact of afforestation on energy flux to determine the biogeophysical mechanisms of afforestation s climatic effect 2 study area the loess plateau one of the most extensive plateaus in china is located between 104 54 e 114 33 e and 33 43 n 41 16 n covering an area of about 620 000 km2 the altitude is approximately 800 3000 m influenced by the east asian and south asian summer monsoon activity liu et al 2016 shi et al 2020 the climate of lp is characterized by wet and warm in summer and dry and cold in winter lp is an arid and semi arid area kong et al 2020 with the average annual precipitation and temperature varying from 110 mm to 860 mm

conditions the chinese government launched the grain to green program in 1999 cao et al 2019 in lp natural vegetation types vary from broad leaved deciduous forest to steppe and then to arid desert in the direction from southeast to northwest wu et al 2019 after gtg program many areas of crops converted to forest land and grassland hu et al 2021 as statistic data shows that afforestation areas in the lp account for approximately 40 of afforest areas in china office of the national greening committee 2019 from 2001 2016 the area of forest net gain was 48 786 km2 and the percentage of the forested area increased from 8 19 to 15 82 approximate wang et al 2018 the ndvi followed a significant upward trend with annual change rates of 0 15 during 1985 2015 qu et al 2020 3 material and methods 3 1 materials the leaf area index lai vegetation fraction fvc albedo and land cover data are updated to characterize the change in vegetation cover the lai and albedo are obtained from the global land surface satellite glass dataset http gre geodata cn thematicview glass html liang et al 2013 the lai and albedo are developed from an 8 day average data at 0 05 0 05 resolution on a grid from 1982 to 2018 the albedo provides both black sky albedo and white sky albedo and the overall surface albedo is derived from the average black sky albedo and white sky albedo su et al 2007 according to beer s law norman et al 1995 the fvc is associated with lai to match the input data pattern of wrf the 8 day average data of lai fvc and albedo are averaged into monthly data between 2001 and 2015 the land cover is satellite observation derived from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis according to the principle of international geosphere biosphere program igbp classification scheme the land cover data are separated into 17 vegetation types at a resolution of 0 05 0 05 including 11 categories of natural vegetation three classes of mosaic types and three classes of nonvegetative lands friedl et al 2002 many reanalysis products can be utilized to force wrf however reanalysis datasets have different deficiencies on various temporal spatial scales as previous researches suggested that the era interim shows a better agreement with chinese separate stations zhu et al 2017 for precipitation temperature and soil moisture decker et al 2012 deng et al 2020 therefore the initial and lateral boundary conditions for wrf are obtained from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf through era interim reanalysis data https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era interim dee et al 2011 it is the data with a 6 hr temporal resolution and a 0 5 spatial resolution since 1979 benefiting from the developments of the ecmwf integrated forecasting system the era interim dataset improved lots of parameterizations in the land surface scheme compared to the original data balsamo et al 2015 the dataset has been widely used due to a variational bias correction technique and directly assimilated into early satellite radiance data therefore it is an excellent dataset for climate studies jiang et al 2011 liu et al 2018 to evaluate the performance of the wrf model we obtain observed data from the national surface weather data day value dataset v3 0 produced by china meteorological data service center http data cma cn

dataset was proved reliable and used widely wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2018 11 uniform distributed station data were chosen for this topic in lp fig 1 3 2 wrf simulation many studies have used wrf to simulate the climate e g precipitation knist et al 2020 cardoso et al 2013 srinivas et al 2013 and temperature chotamonsak et al 2011 meanwhile it is feasible to research the impact of land cover change on the climate through wrf chen et al 2017 yu et al 2020a and provides multi physics to adapt the research area stegehuis et al 2015 in this study the effects of land cover change on regional climate were simulated using wrf arw v4 2 0 in a one way nested model with a horizontal domain of 20 km 20 km 74 58 horizontal cells and 37 vertical sigma layers the center was located at 37 50 n 107 5 e the relevant physics parameterizations of the simulation are included in table 1 wsm 3 class simple ice scheme was chosen as a microphysics option the rrtmg scheme was turned on to be more suitable for long and shortwave radiation options in order to improve the accuracy of the simulation the multi scale kain fritsch scheme was chosen as the cumulus option ysu scheme was selected as the boundary layer option and the revised mm5 monin obukhov scheme was chosen as the surface layer option the noah land surface model noah lsm coupled with wrf was utilized to simulate the energy variation or water cycle process between land and atmosphere cao et al 2019 in the noah lsm the default physical parameters of lai fvc and albedo are the functions of the land use category they can be calculated through their maximum and minimum provided by the vegparm tbl in wrf the physical parameters cannot represent the natural land surface condition to assess the feedback of different land cover on climate we modified the default land use type into two simulation scenarios in section 3 2 based on modis data which accurately described the different land cover types and their changes the default vegetation parameters lai fvc and albedo were replaced with glass dataset to ensure that the simulation results were closer to the actual situation 3 3 simulation scenario to explore the process of land atmosphere feedback in lp we performed two sets of simulations one considered vegetation greening scenario vgs in which the land cover classifications lai fvc and albedo in 2015 were used to approximate the current surface biogeophysical status one was a control scenario ctl which considered a no vegetation greening scenario with 2001 vegetation characteristics wrf model simulated both scenarios with the same initial atmosphere conditions but different land cover biogeophysical parameters from 2000 to 2015 the year 2000 was used to spin up the model the simulations were in june july and august and the choice was rooted in the perception that vegetation flourished in summer hence a more vital interaction with the land atmosphere since both experiments initial atmosphere and lateral boundary conditions do not vary the climate differences between vgs and ctl will be attributed to land cover change 3 4 wet bulb temperature with the higher ambient air the thermoregulation of the human body can be achieved by evaporation however the ability to keep temperature balance is limited by the humidity therefore robust predictions of moist heat stress should consider humidity alongside temperature given that tw stands out for its easy calculation and is more sensitive to humidity than other heat stress metrics sherwood 2018 it was introduced in this research tw is a nonlinear relationship of near surface temperature and air humidity ning et al 2022 safieddine et al 2022 and a combined metric to measure mugginess davis et al 2016 raymond et al 2017 freychet et al 2020 which was defined as a temperature that the air parcel would attain if cooled at constant pressure by evaporating water within it until saturation pal and eltahir 2016 yao 2022 the higher values of tw the hotter and wetter conditions we will live and vice versa yao et al 2022 heat episodes with high wet bulb temperature can be dangerous to a human s health and lower the productivity of outdoor laborers therefore it is preferable to quantify tw affected by afforestation it can be calculated from t p and humidity davies jones 2008 dunne et al 2013 1 e s 0 6108 exp 17 27 t 273 15 t 2

pressure mbar used to describe the saturation mixing ratio ws g kg rh is the surface relative humidity w is the mixing ratio g kg t l is the lifting condensation temperature k and θ e is the equivalent potential temperature k 3 5 model evaluation to better compare the simulation with the observed climate the output data of wrf were interpolated to the sites then the statistical indicators including bias and correlation coefficient r were applied to evaluate the model performances across 11 stations in 2001 zheng et al 2020 due to the errors in input data and intrinsic limitations of the model some inevitable biases occur in the simulation table 2 shows that the temperature and absolute percent simulation bias was 0 96 1 43 c and 4 9 12 0 respectively the relative humidity and absolute percent simulation bias was 17 86 11 42 and 0 4 17 8 respectively the simulations were generally highly correlated in a daily resolution with the observation with the average r 0 98 p 0 01 f test and r 0 64 p 0 01 f test for surface temperature and relative humidity respectively thus it is acceptable to use the model to simulate climate behaviors 4 result 4 1 changes in vegetation cover according to the land use classification from the modis datasets fig 2 reveals that the lp is predominated by grasslands accounting for 67 in 2001 and 62 3 in 2015 most of the forest and croplands are in the southern lp the forest areas accounted for 7 43 of the total area in 2001 and 9 68 in 2015 it is considerable that 2 8 of grasslands were removed from lp and replaced by forest lands in southeastern lp where about 0 73 of croplands transferred into forest lands from 2001 to 2015 in addition 3 48 of grasslands are replaced by croplands in the eastern lp contrarily 0 34 of croplands were converted to grasslands the water areas are scattered and their changes can be negligible the barren lands are mainly distributed in the northern lp compared to 2001 0 67 of barren lands were converted into grasslands in 2015 in general the land cover changes in lp are notable and such conversions indicate that the evolution of surface biophysical parameters will occur in the lp fig 3 presents the spatial change in the summer lai fvc and albedo from 2001 to 2015 generally the spatial pattern of the change in fvc coincides with lai the fvc and lai increase but albedo decreases over most regions in lp in summer the rising region of lai and fvc accounts for 82 of lp on average they increase by 0 18 m2 m2 decades and 5 decades 1 with significant change at f test p 0 05 fig 3d respectively in the central lp a significant greening trend was observed with the magnitude of lai 0 8 1 4 m2 m2 decades and fvc 25 29 decades 1 however lai and fvc in the northwestern and southeastern lp showed decreasing trends with a value of 1 2 0 4 m2 m2 decades and 20 10 decades 1 fig 3a b while considering that the albedo of the forest is darker than open land such as crops grass bare soil etc the albedo is different between 2001 and 2015 the data showed that 95 of albedo decreases in the lp the summer albedo decreases by 0 016 decades 1 p 0 05 across the entire region the lowest region of albedo distributes in the center and north lp with the albedo decreasing by 0 07 0 03 decades 1 however a patchy exception to the trend can be found in the eastern lp where the albedo increased more than 0 02 decades 1 fig 3c in general the implication of the gtg program in lp will modify biogeophysical parameters including lai fvc and albedo which will provide a reference for different scenarios for the noah modules of the wrf 4 2 change in temperature the different vegetation simulations adequately captured summer climate change in the lp fig 4 shows the spatial pattern of the mean near surface air temperature variability the difference between vgs and ctl at the pixel level across lp caused by implementation of the gtg project from 2001 to 2015 overall the average change in temperature response to afforestation showed a cooling effect 0 16 c in summer fig 4a moreover the impacts of land cover change on average temperature had significant spatial features at the grids affected a higher cooling effect occurred in the central and southern lp with a magnitude of 0 6 0 8 c in contrast dispersed warming signals are simulated in the eastern lp where deforestation was evident it s noteworthy that a remarkable warming effect occurred in the northern lp because the land use classification there was barren but in 2015 some barren lands were converted to grasslands which had a lower albedo than barren lands hence the land cover change contributed to warming through increased solar heating of land when focusing on afforestation effects on the average daily maximum t max and minimum t min surface temperature we noticed a consistent signal decrease fig 4b c during summer t min reduction was found with a magnitude of 0 22 c cooling than that of t max with a magnitude of 0 14 c the spatial feature of minimum temperature variations showed widespread cooling in most areas across lp the most substantial cooling effect was observed in the lp s center up to 0 8 c while the maximum temperature decrease during summer was less noticeable compared to t min with the most cooling signal of 0 4 0 6 c in the southwestern lp furthermore a slightly warming t max sign was found across the eastern lp a clear temporal pattern emerged from the result the impact of land cover change on temperature was assessed in different months fig 4d and the simulations illustrated the evident summer cooling effect it is temporally heterogeneous with an average temperature cooling up to 0 72 0 34 c and 0 71 0 33 c in june and august and larger than in july the average t max variability response to vegetation greening in august 0 79 to 0 50 c was slightly greater than in june and july the magnitude of the cooling effect on average t min in june 0 80 to 0 24 was greater than that in july and august 4 3 change in relative humidity intensive and widespread afforestation in the lp has been confirmed to affect land surface heating meanwhile it will modulate near surface evaporation ratio altering humidity regionally relative humidity rh changes are uncertain byrne and o gorman 2016 the expanded forest areas generally experience a wetting signal increased relative humidity rh fig 5a indicates an annual average rh variability of 0 67 region with more than 62 6 of the lp showed an increasing rh after afforestation results illustrated rh wetting effect with the average rh of 3 4 over the dispersed central and southern lp in response to the vegetation greening what s more a moderate wetting in summer daily average rh was found within central lp with rh increase by 2 3 however a slight drying signal was observed in the eastern lp although there was a barren transfer to grasslands in the northern lp the roots of the grassland cannot access deeper reservoirs of soil water jackson et al 1996 which will limit the evapotranspiration leading to a decrease in relative humidity baldocchi et al 2004 santanello et al 2009 the increase in averaged daily minimum relative humidity rh min was higher than the average daily maximum relative humidity rh max fig 5b c averaged at all lp levels the analysis of the rh max increased by 0 36 in summer and 57 of the grids showed a wetting effect the largest value of 2 or more was observed in the central and southern lp while a contrasting effect can be observed in northern and eastern lp and the rh max decrease was up to 2 in the north lp compared to rh max there was a clear wetting expansion in rh min with the mean magnitude of 0 94 especially in eastern lp we note that the predominantly wetting effect in rh min during summer reached about 3 4 in the central lp the summer rh increased in different months and the most apparent wetting occurred in august between 2 19 3 88 fig 5d similarly the rh max in august was slightly greater than in other periods with a magnitude of 2 30 3 53 however the most significant rise of rh min was in june with the variability between 2 53 3 36 simulation of the change in surface temperature and humidity further revealed that the afforestation has a cooling and wetting effect on the land surface in lp 4 4 change in moist heat condition there is an uncontroversial result that afforestation can affect surface temperature and humidity in addition it also has an impact on the local moist heat thereby having far reaching consequences as a combined indicator the wet bulb temperature was used to describe the moist heat condition we determined the difference in tw response to vgs and ctl scenarios across lp in fig 6 the general pattern of annual average wet bulb temperature tw mean and annual average minimum wet bulb temperature tw min showed a lower moist heat after afforestation over lp the decrease of tw min was more intense than tw mean fig 6a c the reduction of tw mean and tw min with the magnitude of 0 1 0 3 c and 0 4 0 6 c respectively in the central lp are slightly higher than in the remaining part in addition the simulation result illustrates that afforestation caused a significant change in the annual average maximum wet bulb temperature tw max and influenced the moist heat environment in the lp decreasing tw max effects consistently spread in the western and northwestern parts of the lp however it was more surprising that increasing moist heat with a magnitude restricted to 0 2 c was revealed in eastern and northeastern lp fig 6b furthermore we analyzed tw variability signals through a probability function fig 6d the probability distribution of the change in tw mean and tw min peak at around 0 2 0 1 c and 0 05 0 04 c respectively while when focused on tw max the distribution was translated into higher tw with the peaks around 0 04 0 05 c to investigate the wet bulb temperature change response to relative humidity and near surface air temperature change we further discussed the relationship between them and disaggregated the driving factors of δtw fig 7 the δtw relative to afforestation was broadly consistent with δt and had a significant positive correlation with δt with r2 0 99 p 0 01 f test fig 7a fig 7b shows that an increase in surface temperature corresponds to lower relative humidity since in the water limited region the increase rate of local vapor pressure is slower than saturated vapor pressure leading to the shrink of relative humidity moreover the change of tw roughly coincides with t that is to say the cooling effect is the most predominant factor affecting the local tw the change of tw roughly coincides with t indicating that the cooling effect is the most predominant factor affecting the local tw in the first quadrant of fig 7b although there was a significant wet bulb temperature decrease in the region with lower surface temperature and higher relative humidity the decreased rate in tw was slower than the surface temperature because of the enhancement of relative humidity offsets the cooling effect moreover the increase of tw concentrates in the fourth quadrant where the rise in surface temperature will enhance the tw signal leading to moist heat stress therefore neglecting the role of relative humidity might expose humans to the risk of moist heat stress 4 5 change in the energy budget to give insights into the dominant physical mechanisms of climate response from afforestation effects we detected the difference in energy budget including net radiation flux latent heat flux sensible heat flux and ground heat flux between vgs and ctl scenarios fig 8a1 shows that afforestation decreased the albedo across most areas of the lp therefore the mean net radiation rn mean showed an increase with the magnitude of 2 15 w m 2 the maximum of net radiation rn max was increased by 3 57 w m 2 and the central lp of rn max even increased by 10 40 w m 2 fig 8a2 at the same time the minimum of net radiation rn min changes are not remarkable 0 89 w m 2 fig 8a3 what s more vegetation expansion could intensify mean latent heat flux lh mean and maximum latent heat flux lh max which were researched by 3 54 w m 2 and 10 90 w m 2 respectively fig 8b1 b3 the increase in lh max 25 40 w m 2 was much more substantial than lh mean 5 15 w m 2 in the region with obviously extensive vegetation fig 8b2 however a negative change in the minimum latent heat flux lh min decreased by 1 36 w m 2 the higher lh was accompanied by a lower temperature in the atmosphere weakening the turbulent heat exchange between land surface and atmosphere therefore a negative change in sensible heat flux will appear in lp the average sensible heat flux was weakened by 1 10 w m 2 and the effect was evident in the central lp 5 10 w m 2 fig 8c1 the magnitude of decrease in the maximum sensible heat flux sh max was 3 15 w m 2 10 20 w m 2 in central lp fig 8c2 which was larger than that of the minimum sensible heat flux sh min 0 62 w m 2 for average sh within 10 w m 2 in most regions fig 8c3 according to fig 9 the latent heat flux had a negative effect on wet bulb temperature and they don t show a strong correlation with each other due to the influence of other factors such as albedo wind speed etc on the contrary the sensible heat flux positively affects wet bulb temperature generally the high level change of sensible heat flux was consistent with a notable shift in wet bulb temperature therefore sensible heat flux might be the primary factor affecting the wet bulb temperature in addition the ground heat flux was essential for estimating the temperature liang et al 1999 our research showed that the increase in mean ground heat flux grd was not significant 0 15 w m 2 fig 8d1 and the magnitude in maximum ground heat flux grd max decreased by 1 28 w m 2 across lp fig 8d2 minimum ground heat flux grd min was 0 65 w m 2 fig 8d3 which means less energy was released from the soil in the nighttime affected by vegetation greening and it was in favor of the cooling effect zheng et al 2020 given that the boundary layer thickness was directly influenced by land surface and thermal change including land cover transfer the variation of temperature and radiation etc a massive reduction in the height of pbl was found during summer in the afforestation case fig 10a it was well established that the decrease of pbl planetary boundary layer allowed an increase of low level moist enthalpy when no deep convection occurred deep convection refers to the thermally driven turbulent mixing that moves air parcels from the lower to the upper atmosphere fig 10b shows that afforestation developed the anticyclonic circulation in the lp that is to say the subsidence of pbl enhances moist enthalpy which will increase the tw in lp in summary afforestation alters the pbl through the local climate factors such as temperature and humidity and energy budget which will mediate the moist heat stress in lp 5 discussion vegetation has undergone conspicuous changes throughout the lp wang et al 2020 this extensive vegetation greening has been instrumental in modulating surface energy partitioning ultimately affecting the strength of land atmosphere coupling and redistributing of heat and moisture cao et al 2015 the greening dynamics and energy budget coupling in arid and semi arid areas are stronger than in others amplifying the relationship between climate and vegetation in arid regions rather than in other climate zones mallick et al 2016 hoek van dijke et al 2020 however with the background of climate change it is hard to isolate the contribution of vegetation restoration to the climate metrics variation in this work we quantified the response of climate change to the application of the gtg program in lp and discussed their relationship with the energy budget through wrf which helped us to understand the possible physical mechanisms for such vegetation expansions the surface temperature change depends on the integrated effect between net radiation and heat flux betts 2011 in the lp satellite observation showed a broad vegetation restoration given the lower albedo of forests bonan 2008 the available energy of forests was larger than grasslands and crops which led to a boost in rn hence the warming effect was amplified while the relationship between greening and surface temperature is complex the cooling effect might suppress the warming signal in response to surface energy change between latent and sensible heat fluxes compared to grasslands forests differ in the partitioning of net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes in particular in arid environments the forests lead to a stronger plant mediated than grasslands or croplands therefore vegetation temperature feedback in the lp is reflected by the intensified latent heat fluxes which increase the evapotranspiration and decrease the near surface temperature baidya et al 2003 in contrast sensible heat flux an alternative way to release energy exhibited an opposite pattern with latent heat fluxes and thus a negative sensible heat flux change appeared in the lp ultimately during the transition from grasslands croplands ctl to forests vgs bowen ratio is used to relate the water balance to the energy balance specifically the vary in evaporation will lead to obvious change in energy component dow and dewalle 2000 bowen ratio is defined as the ration of sensible to latent heat fluxes comunian et al 2018 which reflects the dry and wet condition of the ecosystem if the bowen ratio 1 more turbulent energy flux is released into the atmosphere as sensible heat flux indicating a dry climate on the contrary if the bowen ratio 1 indicating a humid environment irmak et al 2014 in this research the bowen ratio decreases from 0 53 to 0 49 indicating that more latent heat flux return to the atmosphere after afforestation which will enhance the decrease of temperature hu et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 finally the cooling effect causes climate mitigation to counterbalance the radiation related warming we considered the lp s maximum and minimum energy distribution to evaluate further the role of vegetation greening in extreme conditions consistent with previous research the minimum daily cooling was more widespread and pronounced than the daily maximum yu et al 2020b cao et al 2019 the change in surface temperature and humidity influenced the region s moist heat the increase in moist heat associated with high temperature and high humidity had a negative impact on human health coffel et al 2019 the mortality and morbidity especially for people with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are significantly associated with a high moist heat environment pal et al 2016 mishra et al 2020 emerging studies have raised attention to the change in moist heat stress chen et al 2020 long lasting more intense and frequent moist heat conditions occurred on the 21st and the most significant increase in moist heat stress was witnessed in the tropical region coffel et al 2018 furthermore the anthropogenic influence substantially enhances a hotter and wetter environment such as irrigation cook et al 2015 and urbanization luo and lau 2021 with the expansion of the lp forest the near surface air temperature relative humidity and moist heat stress have changed based on wet bulb temperature we demonstrate the response of moist heat conditions to afforestation and reveal the spatiotemporal characteristic and physical mechanisms of moist heat the results illustrated that the surface temperature and relative humidity showed an opposing interaction with wet bulb temperature compared to the dry bulb temperature the variability of relative humidity dampens tw and the wetting effect may partly offset the impact of amplified cooling on tw consequently the increases in wet bulb temperature and dry bulb temperature do not occur simultaneously although vegetation expansion dampens the rise in surface temperature in most areas of lp the wet bulb temperature on daily maximum did not decrease in part of lp reflecting the combined effect of increasing humidity and decreasing temperature here some researchers showed that the increasing wet bulb temperature would exceed the threshold value and human tolerance over the specific region in the future coffel et al 2018 pal and eltahir 2016 which will make widespread exposure to humans to moist heat stress condition thus prevention and management of the humid heat risks are essential for human health our study has detected how afforestation influences climate and to what degree they affect climatic elements through the modification of biophysical processes while the biogeochemical process has been ignored the vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide influencing the terrestrial climate through climate radiative and vegetation physiological forcing therefore the climate response to vegetation greening should link the potential carbon sequestration to the terrestrial energy balance huang et al 2018 afforestation is presented as an effective solution to mitigate climate change however with the expansion of vegetation there might be a complex change in the regional climate factors feng et al 2016 ge et al 2020 cao et al 2019 in the water limited region widespread overplanting proved more evaporation leading to soil drying zhang and liang 2018 and decreasing regional water availability sterling et al 2013 which exacerbates the water shortage lv et al 2019 while in the water rich region the large scale of revegetation may increase moist heat stress therefore it is worth further exploring what the reasonable vegetation scope is 6 conclusion applying the gtg program enables the greening condition of the lp changes in land cover alter local land surface biophysical processes and disturb energy fluxes thereby affecting regional climate conditions to identify the different land cover we performed two sets of simulations one considered vegetation greening scenario vgs one was a control scenario ctl and then simulated the regional climate responses to afforestation using the regional land atmosphere interaction model wrf moreover the wet bulb temperature tw was discussed to underscore the moist heat and we assessed the moist heat effect from the perspective of water and energy balance the result reveals that after the afforestation the temperature decreased in most areas across lp a higher cooling effect could be observed in the central and southern lp with a magnitude of 0 6 0 8 c the region with more than 62 6 of the lp showed an increasing rh with the average rh variability of 0 67 furthermore after the calculation of tw this research illustrates that the tw and tw min showed a lower moist heat stress after afforestation with the magnitude of 0 1 0 3 c and 0 4 0 6 c respectively however its ratio was slower than surface temperature caused by relative humidity an increasing signal occurred in tw max especially in the eastern lp restricted to 0 2 c which might expose human health to an awful environment moreover to investigate the dominant physical mechanisms of the climate response from afforestation we detect the difference in energy budget the result shows that the afforestation decreased the albedo therefore the mean net radiation increased after afforestation as a significant part of energy balance the sensible heat flux was weekend by 1 10 w m 2 and its change was highly consistent with tw which might be the primary factor affecting the moist heat stress in general afforestation might have a negative impact on moist heat stress however current climate policy deploying frameworks ignore the surface biophysical effect on climate leading to high risk for agriculture and society this research identified the lower atmosphere consequences of afforestation which will supply scientific evidence for policy making processes and refine climate adaptation strategies credit authorship contribution statement zhang shulin conceptualization

7789,study region loess plateau lp china study focus this study aimed to research whether and to what degree afforestation contributes to the variations in moist heat stress in the study area here wet bulb temperature tw was used to quantify the moist heat stress subsequently the weather research and forecasting model wrf is applied to simulate the modulation of climate change related to afforestation during 2001 2015 based on the analysis of energy fluxes we identified the biogeophysical mechanism of afforestation impact on moist heat stress new hydrological insights for the region since the operation of the grain to green program lp has experienced widespread afforestation which perturbs energy and water fluxes affecting regional climate regimes the forest expansion increases relative humidity but cools the regional temperature as a significant combined climate factor the average moist heat stress decreases with the magnitude of 0 1 0 3 c in central lp while the decrease rate of tw is slower than near surface temperature it is worth noting that an increased signal occurs in the maximum tw almost 0 2 c in eastern and northeastern lp which might expose humans to the risk of moist heat stress by the mechanistic analysis the research shows that the near surface temperature and sensible heat flux are dominant driving factors for the change of tw furthermore the subsidence of the planetary boundary layer enhances moist heat stress overall afforestation s effects on land surface atmosphere interaction are non negligible and the moist heat stress should be accounted for in climate change adaptation strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords afforestation moist heat stress climate change heat fluxes loess plateau data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction global warming is an undeniable reality kerr 2007 xu et al 2018 and most research on heat stress extremes under continued warming tends to focus on independent climate indicators such as temperature precipitation etc cao et al 2019 zhang and liang 2018 however some researches investigate that heat stress extremes were more frequently associated with surface humidity variation than surface temperature variation raymond et al 2017 sherwood 2018 kang and eltahir 2018 so it is not convinced to research heat stress using a single indicator that is to say the heat stress is moderated by moisture mishra et al 2020 as one of the most severe heat hazards moist heat stress greatly challenges economic activities agricultural resources and ecosystems significantly affecting human health it is well established that due to extreme heat stress events there is a substantial reduction in work productivity zander et al 2015 kjellstrom et al 2016 rao et al 2020 moreover moist heat stress will decrease the body s evaporation rate and exacerbate physiological heat stress increasing morbidity and mortality raymond et al 2017 freychet et al 2020 in china some areas have already witnessed moist heat stress conditions during summer from 1971 to 2014 luo and lau 2021 freychet et al 2020 meaning that more people will be exposed to heat stroke however most of the research ignored the interaction between landcover and the atmosphere leading to more uncertainty in researching the impact of moist heat stress there is still no clear consensus about how moist heat stress related risks emerge from the interplay between natural heat acclimatization and human activity nowadays studying the mechanism of human activity in the land atmosphere process is attracting increasing attention intensive anthropogenic activities e g urbanization land cover change irrigation etc modifies land atmosphere processes through the alteration of the regional water cycle and energy transfer cherubini et al 2018 which in turn affects the region s micro climate many researchers have investigated the impact of irrigation and urbanization on moisture content mishra et al 2020 yang et al 2021 however as one of the essential human mediated activities afforestation has a visible effect on the regional moisture heat stress the revegetation influences the climate not only by the biogeochemical process carbon sequestration forzieri et al 2017 but also by biogeophysical processes davin and noblet ducoudré 2010 the greening trend changes biogeophysical characteristics affecting energy and water fluxes keenan et al 2016 on the one hand open terrain has a higher albedo than forest betts 2000 betts 2011 jach et al 2020 so more radiation is absorbed after forest expansion which leads to an increase in available energy hence to warming gibbard et al 2005 bonan et al 2008 lansu et al 2020 on the other hand afforestation creates a deeper root system and greater transpiring leaf area which will promote latent heat flux and cool the surface peng et al 2014 bright et al 2015 as a result the balance of radiation and heat flux impacts determines which mechanism has the greater influence on regional climate scholars have made numerous attempts to demonstrate that afforestation modifies the occurrence of climate factors including precipitation evapotranspiration patterns hoek van dijke et al 2022 odoulami et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 hu et al 2019 abiodun et al 2013 teuling et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 many of these are studies on temperature due to the different in biogeophysical processes the impact of afforestation on temperature will vary from region to region in tropical region the dominant factor affecting the temperature is nonradiative forcing caused by the high rates of evapotranspiration in tropical forests the temperature will decrease after afforestation betts 2000 li et al 2015 as for boreal forests afforestation lower albedo than before warming the climate baldocchi et al 2004 while there is still no clear consensus about whether the climate response of the temperate forest will be cooling or warming bonan et al 2008 moreover the effect of afforestation on moisture heat stress is still unclear hence modeling the impact of afforestation on temperature humidity and moist heat stress with greater spatial temporal details from energy balance is needed to explore how the change affects the local climate sylla et al 2016 china is one of the countries with the highest amounts of afforestation as remote sensing image shows an extensive trend of revegetation has been observed in china zhai et al 2015 feng et al 2013 with a greening area of 212 million ha in 2008 feng et al 2016 cfs 2019 especially in the loess plateau lp in 1999 the chinese government established the grain to green gtg program cao et al 2018 han et al 2021 up to 2012 the extension of forest area in the central lp ningxia shanxi and shaanxi accounted for 11 2 of the land area of the three provinces xiao 2014 to quantify the afforestation influence on climate previous studies have demonstrated the change of single climate factors related to afforestation such as temperature precipitation etc cao et al 2019 however the cumulative effects of afforestation continue to directly impact ecosystem functions due to other factors such as moist heat stress which are crucial yet uncertain in lp with the dual influence of global warming and afforestation exposure to the risk of high moist heat stress will cause a severe impact on the local economy human living comfort and agricultural production koteswara et al 2020 meanwhile given that lp has a population of more than 0 1 billion people data from the outline of comprehensive management planning for the loess plateau 2010 2030 clearing how climate change and large scale afforestation affect local moist heat stress is a critical scientific topic with practical implications therefore it is essential to detect whether and to what degree afforestation contributes to the moisture heat condition huang et al 2020 after implementing the gtg program in the lp afforestation and its climatic implications on a regional scale have been investigated with the ultimate goal of statistically defining the climate response particularly the moist heat response to land surface change in general the methodologies can be divided into empirical studies based on observed data such as in situ observation and satellite observations zhang et al 2014 zhang and liang 2018 and land atmosphere interactions model simulations lansu et al 2020 jach et al 2020 li et al 2016 alkama and cescatti 2016 van heerwaarden and teuling 2014 in most cases the latter effectively isolates land cover change s radiative and nonradiative processes thus modeling tools are pretty helpful in determining how vital vegetation greening can be in moderating climate changes worldwide ge et al 2019 to study the impact of afforestation on the land surface atmosphere interaction we used the weather research and forecasting model wrf and generated control and vegetation greening scenarios we investigated the association between moist heat stress and the elements that contribute to it our goal was to 1 assess the magnitudes of vegetation change in lp during the summer june july and august from 2001 to 2015 2 analyze the climate response to different greening scenarios and 3 investigate the impact of afforestation on energy flux to determine the biogeophysical mechanisms of afforestation s climatic effect 2 study area the loess plateau one of the most extensive plateaus in china is located between 104 54 e 114 33 e and 33 43 n 41 16 n covering an area of about 620 000 km2 the altitude is approximately 800 3000 m influenced by the east asian and south asian summer monsoon activity liu et al 2016 shi et al 2020 the climate of lp is characterized by wet and warm in summer and dry and cold in winter lp is an arid and semi arid area kong et al 2020 with the average annual precipitation and temperature varying from 110 mm to 860 mm and 4 14 c respectively the lp is mainly covered with highly erodible loess layers with surface thickness ranging from 50 to 80 m as one of the world s most severe soil erosion areas chen et al 2007 soil erosion in lp is 4 54 million km2 accounting for 71 5 of the total area the erosion modulus is approximately 4000 t km2 the ecological environment in lp has been seriously damaged due to water resource shortage desertification soil erosion and overgrazing with the goal of ecosystem restoration ensuring the safety of the ecological environment and achieving more sustainable environmental conditions the chinese government launched the grain to green program in 1999 cao et al 2019 in lp natural vegetation types vary from broad leaved deciduous forest to steppe and then to arid desert in the direction from southeast to northwest wu et al 2019 after gtg program many areas of crops converted to forest land and grassland hu et al 2021 as statistic data shows that afforestation areas in the lp account for approximately 40 of afforest areas in china office of the national greening committee 2019 from 2001 2016 the area of forest net gain was 48 786 km2 and the percentage of the forested area increased from 8 19 to 15 82 approximate wang et al 2018 the ndvi followed a significant upward trend with annual change rates of 0 15 during 1985 2015 qu et al 2020 3 material and methods 3 1 materials the leaf area index lai vegetation fraction fvc albedo and land cover data are updated to characterize the change in vegetation cover the lai and albedo are obtained from the global land surface satellite glass dataset http gre geodata cn thematicview glass html liang et al 2013 the lai and albedo are developed from an 8 day average data at 0 05 0 05 resolution on a grid from 1982 to 2018 the albedo provides both black sky albedo and white sky albedo and the overall surface albedo is derived from the average black sky albedo and white sky albedo su et al 2007 according to beer s law norman et al 1995 the fvc is associated with lai to match the input data pattern of wrf the 8 day average data of lai fvc and albedo are averaged into monthly data between 2001 and 2015 the land cover is satellite observation derived from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis according to the principle of international geosphere biosphere program igbp classification scheme the land cover data are separated into 17 vegetation types at a resolution of 0 05 0 05 including 11 categories of natural vegetation three classes of mosaic types and three classes of nonvegetative lands friedl et al 2002 many reanalysis products can be utilized to force wrf however reanalysis datasets have different deficiencies on various temporal spatial scales as previous researches suggested that the era interim shows a better agreement with chinese separate stations zhu et al 2017 for precipitation temperature and soil moisture decker et al 2012 deng et al 2020 therefore the initial and lateral boundary conditions for wrf are obtained from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf through era interim reanalysis data https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era interim dee et al 2011 it is the data with a 6 hr temporal resolution and a 0 5 spatial resolution since 1979 benefiting from the developments of the ecmwf integrated forecasting system the era interim dataset improved lots of parameterizations in the land surface scheme compared to the original data balsamo et al 2015 the dataset has been widely used due to a variational bias correction technique and directly assimilated into early satellite radiance data therefore it is an excellent dataset for climate studies jiang et al 2011 liu et al 2018 to evaluate the performance of the wrf model we obtain observed data from the national surface weather data day value dataset v3 0 produced by china meteorological data service center http data cma cn

dataset was proved reliable and used widely wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2018 11 uniform distributed station data were chosen for this topic in lp fig 1 3 2 wrf simulation many studies have used wrf to simulate the climate e g precipitation knist et al 2020 cardoso et al 2013 srinivas et al 2013 and temperature chotamonsak et al 2011 meanwhile it is feasible to research the impact of land cover change on the climate through wrf chen et al 2017 yu et al 2020a and provides multi physics to adapt the research area stegehuis et al 2015 in this study the effects of land cover change on regional climate were simulated using wrf arw v4 2 0 in a one way nested model with a horizontal domain of 20 km 20 km 74 58 horizontal cells and 37 vertical sigma layers the center was located at 37 50 n 107 5 e the relevant physics parameterizations of the simulation are included in table 1 wsm 3 class simple ice scheme was chosen as a microphysics option the rrtmg scheme was turned on to be more suitable for long and shortwave radiation options in order to improve the accuracy of the simulation the multi scale kain fritsch scheme was chosen as the cumulus option ysu scheme was selected as the boundary layer option and the revised mm5 monin obukhov scheme was chosen as the surface layer option the noah land surface model noah lsm coupled with wrf was utilized to simulate the energy variation or water cycle process between land and atmosphere cao et al 2019 in the noah lsm the default physical parameters of lai fvc and albedo are the functions of the land use category they can be calculated through their maximum and minimum provided by the vegparm tbl in wrf the physical parameters cannot represent the natural land surface condition to assess the feedback of different land cover on climate we modified the default land use type into two simulation scenarios in section 3 2 based on modis data which accurately described the different land cover types and their changes the default vegetation parameters lai fvc and albedo were replaced with glass dataset to ensure that the simulation results were closer to the actual situation 3 3 simulation scenario to explore the process of land atmosphere feedback in lp we performed two sets of simulations one considered vegetation greening scenario vgs in which the land cover classifications lai fvc and albedo in 2015 were used to approximate the current surface biogeophysical status one was a control scenario ctl which considered a no vegetation greening scenario with 2001 vegetation characteristics wrf model simulated both scenarios with the same initial atmosphere conditions but different land cover biogeophysical parameters from 2000 to 2015 the year 2000 was used to spin up the model the simulations were in june july and august and the choice was rooted in the perception that vegetation flourished in summer hence a more vital interaction with the land atmosphere since both experiments initial atmosphere and lateral boundary conditions do not vary the climate differences between vgs and ctl will be attributed to land cover change 3 4 wet bulb temperature with the higher ambient air the thermoregulation of the human body can be achieved by evaporation however the ability to keep temperature balance is limited by the humidity therefore robust predictions of moist heat stress should consider humidity alongside temperature given that tw stands out for its easy calculation and is more sensitive to humidity than other heat stress metrics sherwood 2018 it was introduced in this research tw is a nonlinear relationship of near surface temperature and air humidity ning et al 2022 safieddine et al 2022 and a combined metric to measure mugginess davis et al 2016 raymond et al 2017 freychet et al 2020 which was defined as a temperature that the air parcel would attain if cooled at constant pressure by evaporating water within it until saturation pal and eltahir 2016 yao 2022 the higher values of tw the hotter and wetter conditions we will live and vice versa yao et al 2022 heat episodes with high wet bulb temperature can be dangerous to a human s health and lower the productivity of outdoor laborers therefore it is preferable to quantify tw affected by afforestation it can be calculated from t p and humidity davies jones 2008 dunne et al 2013 1 e s 0 6108 exp 17 27 t 273 15 t 2

pressure mbar used to describe the saturation mixing ratio ws g kg rh is the surface relative humidity w is the mixing ratio g kg t l is the lifting condensation temperature k and θ e is the equivalent potential temperature k 3 5 model evaluation to better compare the simulation with the observed climate the output data of wrf were interpolated to the sites then the statistical indicators including bias and correlation coefficient r were applied to evaluate the model performances across 11 stations in 2001 zheng et al 2020 due to the errors in input data and intrinsic limitations of the model some inevitable biases occur in the simulation table 2 shows that the temperature and absolute percent simulation bias was 0 96 1 43 c and 4 9 12 0 respectively the relative humidity and absolute percent simulation bias was 17 86 11 42 and 0 4 17 8 respectively the simulations were generally highly correlated in a daily resolution with the observation with the average r 0 98 p 0 01 f test and r 0 64 p 0 01 f test for surface temperature and relative humidity respectively thus it is acceptable to use the model to simulate climate behaviors 4 result 4 1 changes in vegetation cover according to the land use classification from the modis datasets fig 2 reveals that the lp is predominated by grasslands accounting for 67 in 2001 and 62 3 in 2015 most of the forest and croplands are in the southern lp the forest areas accounted for 7 43 of the total area in 2001 and 9 68 in 2015 it is considerable that 2 8 of grasslands were removed from lp and replaced by forest lands in southeastern lp where about 0 73 of croplands transferred into forest lands from 2001 to 2015 in addition 3 48 of grasslands are replaced by croplands in the eastern lp contrarily 0 34 of croplands were converted to grasslands the water areas are scattered and their changes can be negligible the barren lands are mainly distributed in the northern lp compared to 2001 0 67 of barren lands were converted into grasslands in 2015 in general the land cover changes in lp are notable and such conversions indicate that the evolution of surface biophysical parameters will occur in the lp fig 3 presents the spatial change in the summer lai fvc and albedo from 2001 to 2015 generally the spatial pattern of the change in fvc coincides with lai the fvc and lai increase but albedo decreases over most regions in lp in summer the rising region of lai and fvc accounts for 82 of lp on average they increase by 0 18 m2 m2 decades and 5 decades 1 with significant change at f test p 0 05 fig 3d respectively in the central lp a significant greening trend was observed with the magnitude of lai 0 8 1 4 m2 m2 decades and fvc 25 29 decades 1 however lai and fvc in the northwestern and southeastern lp showed decreasing trends with a value of 1 2 0 4 m2 m2 decades and 20 10 decades 1 fig 3a b while considering that the albedo of the forest is darker than open land such as crops grass bare soil etc the albedo is different between 2001 and 2015 the data showed that 95 of albedo decreases in the lp the summer albedo decreases by 0 016 decades 1 p 0 05 across the entire region the lowest region of albedo distributes in the center and north lp with the albedo decreasing by 0 07 0 03 decades 1 however a patchy exception to the trend can be found in the eastern lp where the albedo increased more than 0 02 decades 1 fig 3c in general the implication of the gtg program in lp will modify biogeophysical parameters including lai fvc and albedo which will provide a reference for different scenarios for the noah modules of the wrf 4 2 change in temperature the different vegetation simulations adequately captured summer climate change in the lp fig 4 shows the spatial pattern of the mean near surface air temperature variability the difference between vgs and ctl at the pixel level across lp caused by implementation of the gtg project from 2001 to 2015 overall the average change in temperature response to afforestation showed a cooling effect 0 16 c in summer fig 4a moreover the impacts of land cover change on average temperature had significant spatial features at the grids affected a higher cooling effect occurred in the central and southern lp with a magnitude of 0 6 0 8 c in contrast dispersed warming signals are simulated in the eastern lp where deforestation was evident it s noteworthy that a remarkable warming effect occurred in the northern lp because the land use classification there was barren but in 2015 some barren lands were converted to grasslands which had a lower albedo than barren lands hence the land cover change contributed to warming through increased solar heating of land when focusing on afforestation effects on the average daily maximum t max and minimum t min surface temperature we noticed a consistent signal decrease fig 4b c during summer t min reduction was found with a magnitude of 0 22 c cooling than that of t max with a magnitude of 0 14 c the spatial feature of minimum temperature variations showed widespread cooling in most areas across lp the most substantial cooling effect was observed in the lp s center up to 0 8 c while the maximum temperature decrease during summer was less noticeable compared to t min with the most cooling signal of 0 4 0 6 c in the southwestern lp furthermore a slightly warming t max sign was found across the eastern lp a clear temporal pattern emerged from the result the impact of land cover change on temperature was assessed in different months fig 4d and the simulations illustrated the evident summer cooling effect it is temporally heterogeneous with an average temperature cooling up to 0 72 0 34 c and 0 71 0 33 c in june and august and larger than in july the average t max variability response to vegetation greening in august 0 79 to 0 50 c was slightly greater than in june and july the magnitude of the cooling effect on average t min in june 0 80 to 0 24 was greater than that in july and august 4 3 change in relative humidity intensive and widespread afforestation in the lp has been confirmed to affect land surface heating meanwhile it will modulate near surface evaporation ratio altering humidity regionally relative humidity rh changes are uncertain byrne and o gorman 2016 the expanded forest areas generally experience a wetting signal increased relative humidity rh fig 5a indicates an annual average rh variability of 0 67 region with more than 62 6 of the lp showed an increasing rh after afforestation results illustrated rh wetting effect with the average rh of 3 4 over the dispersed central and southern lp in response to the vegetation greening what s more a moderate wetting in summer daily average rh was found within central lp with rh increase by 2 3 however a slight drying signal was observed in the eastern lp although there was a barren transfer to grasslands in the northern lp the roots of the grassland cannot access deeper reservoirs of soil water jackson et al 1996 which will limit the evapotranspiration leading to a decrease in relative humidity baldocchi et al 2004 santanello et al 2009 the increase in averaged daily minimum relative humidity rh min was higher than the average daily maximum relative humidity rh max fig 5b c averaged at all lp levels the analysis of the rh max increased by 0 36 in summer and 57 of the grids showed a wetting effect the largest value of 2 or more was observed in the central and southern lp while a contrasting effect can be observed in northern and eastern lp and the rh max decrease was up to 2 in the north lp compared to rh max there was a clear wetting expansion in rh min with the mean magnitude of 0 94 especially in eastern lp we note that the predominantly wetting effect in rh min during summer reached about 3 4 in the central lp the summer rh increased in different months and the most apparent wetting occurred in august between 2 19 3 88 fig 5d similarly the rh max in august was slightly greater than in other periods with a magnitude of 2 30 3 53 however the most significant rise of rh min was in june with the variability between 2 53 3 36 simulation of the change in surface temperature and humidity further revealed that the afforestation has a cooling and wetting effect on the land surface in lp 4 4 change in moist heat condition there is an uncontroversial result that afforestation can affect surface temperature and humidity in addition it also has an impact on the local moist heat thereby having far reaching consequences as a combined indicator the wet bulb temperature was used to describe the moist heat condition we determined the difference in tw response to vgs and ctl scenarios across lp in fig 6 the general pattern of annual average wet bulb temperature tw mean and annual average minimum wet bulb temperature tw min showed a lower moist heat after afforestation over lp the decrease of tw min was more intense than tw mean fig 6a c the reduction of tw mean and tw min with the magnitude of 0 1 0 3 c and 0 4 0 6 c respectively in the central lp are slightly higher than in the remaining part in addition the simulation result illustrates that afforestation caused a significant change in the annual average maximum wet bulb temperature tw max and influenced the moist heat environment in the lp decreasing tw max effects consistently spread in the western and northwestern parts of the lp however it was more surprising that increasing moist heat with a magnitude restricted to 0 2 c was revealed in eastern and northeastern lp fig 6b furthermore we analyzed tw variability signals through a probability function fig 6d the probability distribution of the change in tw mean and tw min peak at around 0 2 0 1 c and 0 05 0 04 c respectively while when focused on tw max the distribution was translated into higher tw with the peaks around 0 04 0 05 c to investigate the wet bulb temperature change response to relative humidity and near surface air temperature change we further discussed the relationship between them and disaggregated the driving factors of δtw fig 7 the δtw relative to afforestation was broadly consistent with δt and had a significant positive correlation with δt with r2 0 99 p 0 01 f test fig 7a fig 7b shows that an increase in surface temperature corresponds to lower relative humidity since in the water limited region the increase rate of local vapor pressure is slower than saturated vapor pressure leading to the shrink of relative humidity moreover the change of tw roughly coincides with t that is to say the cooling effect is the most predominant factor affecting the local tw the change of tw roughly coincides with t indicating that the cooling effect is the most predominant factor affecting the local tw in the first quadrant of fig 7b although there was a significant wet bulb temperature decrease in the region with lower surface temperature and higher relative humidity the decreased rate in tw was slower than the surface temperature because of the enhancement of relative humidity offsets the cooling effect moreover the increase of tw concentrates in the fourth quadrant where the rise in surface temperature will enhance the tw signal leading to moist heat stress therefore neglecting the role of relative humidity might expose humans to the risk of moist heat stress 4 5 change in the energy budget to give insights into the dominant physical mechanisms of climate response from afforestation effects we detected the difference in energy budget including net radiation flux latent heat flux sensible heat flux and ground heat flux between vgs and ctl scenarios fig 8a1 shows that afforestation decreased the albedo across most areas of the lp therefore the mean net radiation rn mean showed an increase with the magnitude of 2 15 w m 2 the maximum of net radiation rn max was increased by 3 57 w m 2 and the central lp of rn max even increased by 10 40 w m 2 fig 8a2 at the same time the minimum of net radiation rn min changes are not remarkable 0 89 w m 2 fig 8a3 what s more vegetation expansion could intensify mean latent heat flux lh mean and maximum latent heat flux lh max which were researched by 3 54 w m 2 and 10 90 w m 2 respectively fig 8b1 b3 the increase in lh max 25 40 w m 2 was much more substantial than lh mean 5 15 w m 2 in the region with obviously extensive vegetation fig 8b2 however a negative change in the minimum latent heat flux lh min decreased by 1 36 w m 2 the higher lh was accompanied by a lower temperature in the atmosphere weakening the turbulent heat exchange between land surface and atmosphere therefore a negative change in sensible heat flux will appear in lp the average sensible heat flux was weakened by 1 10 w m 2 and the effect was evident in the central lp 5 10 w m 2 fig 8c1 the magnitude of decrease in the maximum sensible heat flux sh max was 3 15 w m 2 10 20 w m 2 in central lp fig 8c2 which was larger than that of the minimum sensible heat flux sh min 0 62 w m 2 for average sh within 10 w m 2 in most regions fig 8c3 according to fig 9 the latent heat flux had a negative effect on wet bulb temperature and they don t show a strong correlation with each other due to the influence of other factors such as albedo wind speed etc on the contrary the sensible heat flux positively affects wet bulb temperature generally the high level change of sensible heat flux was consistent with a notable shift in wet bulb temperature therefore sensible heat flux might be the primary factor affecting the wet bulb temperature in addition the ground heat flux was essential for estimating the temperature liang et al 1999 our research showed that the increase in mean ground heat flux grd was not significant 0 15 w m 2 fig 8d1 and the magnitude in maximum ground heat flux grd max decreased by 1 28 w m 2 across lp fig 8d2 minimum ground heat flux grd min was 0 65 w m 2 fig 8d3 which means less energy was released from the soil in the nighttime affected by vegetation greening and it was in favor of the cooling effect zheng et al 2020 given that the boundary layer thickness was directly influenced by land surface and thermal change including land cover transfer the variation of temperature and radiation etc a massive reduction in the height of pbl was found during summer in the afforestation case fig 10a it was well established that the decrease of pbl planetary boundary layer allowed an increase of low level moist enthalpy when no deep convection occurred deep convection refers to the thermally driven turbulent mixing that moves air parcels from the lower to the upper atmosphere fig 10b shows that afforestation developed the anticyclonic circulation in the lp that is to say the subsidence of pbl enhances moist enthalpy which will increase the tw in lp in summary afforestation alters the pbl through the local climate factors such as temperature and humidity and energy budget which will mediate the moist heat stress in lp 5 discussion vegetation has undergone conspicuous changes throughout the lp wang et al 2020 this extensive vegetation greening has been instrumental in modulating surface energy partitioning ultimately affecting the strength of land atmosphere coupling and redistributing of heat and moisture cao et al 2015 the greening dynamics and energy budget coupling in arid and semi arid areas are stronger than in others amplifying the relationship between climate and vegetation in arid regions rather than in other climate zones mallick et al 2016 hoek van dijke et al 2020 however with the background of climate change it is hard to isolate the contribution of vegetation restoration to the climate metrics variation in this work we quantified the response of climate change to the application of the gtg program in lp and discussed their relationship with the energy budget through wrf which helped us to understand the possible physical mechanisms for such vegetation expansions the surface temperature change depends on the integrated effect between net radiation and heat flux betts 2011 in the lp satellite observation showed a broad vegetation restoration given the lower albedo of forests bonan 2008 the available energy of forests was larger than grasslands and crops which led to a boost in rn hence the warming effect was amplified while the relationship between greening and surface temperature is complex the cooling effect might suppress the warming signal in response to surface energy change between latent and sensible heat fluxes compared to grasslands forests differ in the partitioning of net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes in particular in arid environments the forests lead to a stronger plant mediated than grasslands or croplands therefore vegetation temperature feedback in the lp is reflected by the intensified latent heat fluxes which increase the evapotranspiration and decrease the near surface temperature baidya et al 2003 in contrast sensible heat flux an alternative way to release energy exhibited an opposite pattern with latent heat fluxes and thus a negative sensible heat flux change appeared in the lp ultimately during the transition from grasslands croplands ctl to forests vgs bowen ratio is used to relate the water balance to the energy balance specifically the vary in evaporation will lead to obvious change in energy component dow and dewalle 2000 bowen ratio is defined as the ration of sensible to latent heat fluxes comunian et al 2018 which reflects the dry and wet condition of the ecosystem if the bowen ratio 1 more turbulent energy flux is released into the atmosphere as sensible heat flux indicating a dry climate on the contrary if the bowen ratio 1 indicating a humid environment irmak et al 2014 in this research the bowen ratio decreases from 0 53 to 0 49 indicating that more latent heat flux return to the atmosphere after afforestation which will enhance the decrease of temperature hu et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 finally the cooling effect causes climate mitigation to counterbalance the radiation related warming we considered the lp s maximum and minimum energy distribution to evaluate further the role of vegetation greening in extreme conditions consistent with previous research the minimum daily cooling was more widespread and pronounced than the daily maximum yu et al 2020b cao et al 2019 the change in surface temperature and humidity influenced the region s moist heat the increase in moist heat associated with high temperature and high humidity had a negative impact on human health coffel et al 2019 the mortality and morbidity especially for people with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are significantly associated with a high moist heat environment pal et al 2016 mishra et al 2020 emerging studies have raised attention to the change in moist heat stress chen et al 2020 long lasting more intense and frequent moist heat conditions occurred on the 21st and the most significant increase in moist heat stress was witnessed in the tropical region coffel et al 2018 furthermore the anthropogenic influence substantially enhances a hotter and wetter environment such as irrigation cook et al 2015 and urbanization luo and lau 2021 with the expansion of the lp forest the near surface air temperature relative humidity and moist heat stress have changed based on wet bulb temperature we demonstrate the response of moist heat conditions to afforestation and reveal the spatiotemporal characteristic and physical mechanisms of moist heat the results illustrated that the surface temperature and relative humidity showed an opposing interaction with wet bulb temperature compared to the dry bulb temperature the variability of relative humidity dampens tw and the wetting effect may partly offset the impact of amplified cooling on tw consequently the increases in wet bulb temperature and dry bulb temperature do not occur simultaneously although vegetation expansion dampens the rise in surface temperature in most areas of lp the wet bulb temperature on daily maximum did not decrease in part of lp reflecting the combined effect of increasing humidity and decreasing temperature here some researchers showed that the increasing wet bulb temperature would exceed the threshold value and human tolerance over the specific region in the future coffel et al 2018 pal and eltahir 2016 which will make widespread exposure to humans to moist heat stress condition thus prevention and management of the humid heat risks are essential for human health our study has detected how afforestation influences climate and to what degree they affect climatic elements through the modification of biophysical processes while the biogeochemical process has been ignored the vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide influencing the terrestrial climate through climate radiative and vegetation physiological forcing therefore the climate response to vegetation greening should link the potential carbon sequestration to the terrestrial energy balance huang et al 2018 afforestation is presented as an effective solution to mitigate climate change however with the expansion of vegetation there might be a complex change in the regional climate factors feng et al 2016 ge et al 2020 cao et al 2019 in the water limited region widespread overplanting proved more evaporation leading to soil drying zhang and liang 2018 and decreasing regional water availability sterling et al 2013 which exacerbates the water shortage lv et al 2019 while in the water rich region the large scale of revegetation may increase moist heat stress therefore it is worth further exploring what the reasonable vegetation scope is 6 conclusion applying the gtg program enables the greening condition of the lp changes in land cover alter local land surface biophysical processes and disturb energy fluxes thereby affecting regional climate conditions to identify the different land cover we performed two sets of simulations one considered vegetation greening scenario vgs one was a control scenario ctl and then simulated the regional climate responses to afforestation using the regional land atmosphere interaction model wrf moreover the wet bulb temperature tw was discussed to underscore the moist heat and we assessed the moist heat effect from the perspective of water and energy balance the result reveals that after the afforestation the temperature decreased in most areas across lp a higher cooling effect could be observed in the central and southern lp with a magnitude of 0 6 0 8 c the region with more than 62 6 of the lp showed an increasing rh with the average rh variability of 0 67 furthermore after the calculation of tw this research illustrates that the tw and tw min showed a lower moist heat stress after afforestation with the magnitude of 0 1 0 3 c and 0 4 0 6 c respectively however its ratio was slower than surface temperature caused by relative humidity an increasing signal occurred in tw max especially in the eastern lp restricted to 0 2 c which might expose human health to an awful environment moreover to investigate the dominant physical mechanisms of the climate response from afforestation we detect the difference in energy budget the result shows that the afforestation decreased the albedo therefore the mean net radiation increased after afforestation as a significant part of energy balance the sensible heat flux was weekend by 1 10 w m 2 and its change was highly consistent with tw which might be the primary factor affecting the moist heat stress in general afforestation might have a negative impact on moist heat stress however current climate policy deploying frameworks ignore the surface biophysical effect on climate leading to high risk for agriculture and society this research identified the lower atmosphere consequences of afforestation which will supply scientific evidence for policy making processes and refine climate adaptation strategies credit authorship contribution statement zhang shulin conceptualization
