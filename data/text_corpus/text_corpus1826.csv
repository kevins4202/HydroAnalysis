9130,the agricultural activities contribute to the largest share of water consumption in the arid and semi arid basins in this study we demonstrate the application of water accounting plus wa for estimation of the green water consumption etgreen and blue water consumption etblue for assessing the water productivity wp and land productivity lp to identify the bright spots and hot spots at the district administrative unit level for effectively managing the scarce water resources and sustaining food security in a highly non resilient semi arid basin of india the wa framework uses satellite remote sensing datasets from different sources for this purpose and we used the data from 2003 to 2020 the long term average of etgreen and etblue in the mahi basin is found to be 15 8 km3 year and 12 32 km3 year respectively the blue water index bwi and green water index gwi in the basin vary from 0 282 to 0 598 and 0 40 0 72 we found that the bwi is highest for the districts of gujarat whereas the gwi is highest for the districts of madhya pradesh the long term average of the lp and wp for both the irrigated and rainfed cereals in the basin is found as 2287 71 kg ha 1713 62 kg ha and 0 721 kg m³ 0 483 kg m³ respectively from 2003 to 2020 the wp rainfed of all the districts of the gujarat is comparatively lower varying from 0 34 kg m³ to 0 5 kg m³ than the districts of the madhya pradesh varying from 0 59 kg m3 to 0 70 kg m³ and the rajasthan varying from 0 48 kg m³ to 0 73 kg m³ based on the results we found that the ratlam district of the madhya pradesh has both highest lp and wp irrigated as 2573 96 kg ha and 2 14 kg m3 respectively among all the districts of the mahi basin and hence it is classified as the bright spot district the anand district is found to have the lowest wp and lp as 0 44 kg m3 and 2467 51 kg ha respectively and hence it is classified as the hot spot district for rainfed cereals we found that the neemuch district of madhya pradesh has the highest wp and lp as 0 59 kg m3 and 1948 13 kg ha respectively and the anand district with the lowest wp as 0 34 kg m3 and lp of 1572 21 kg ha respectively therefore we classified the neemach district as the bright spot district and the anand district as the hot spot district for rainfed cereals these findings will help develop sustainable and actionable agricultural water management plans by the policymakers and stakeholders in the basin keywords evapotranspiration green water blue water land productivity transpiration water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing water productivity wp and land productivities lp for sustaining food security and freshwater availability is a significant challenge to the current and future generations safi et al 2022 the water availability for agricultural production will decrease due to increased competition from industrial and domestic sectors zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 and this will eventually put excess pressure on the farmers this is the reason that there is a growing emphasis on increasing wp in agriculture kang et al 2017 marston et al 2020 molden 2007 bastiaanssen et al 2003 wp is represented as the ratio of the crop yield to the green and blue water consumption i e etgreen and etblue where etgreen and etblue represent the actual evapotranspiration et due to green water and blue water respectively falkenmark and rockström 2006 velpuri and senay 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 chukalla et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 msigwa et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wp measures the capability of a system to convert water consumed into goods and services molden 1997 wp also helps establish a linkage between agricultural water management with water security food security and economic development bastiaanssen et al 2003 improving wp will help to reduce the need for additional resources in both irrigated blue water and rainfed green water systems molden et al 2010 and its benchmarking will help identify the productivity levels for improving the sustainability of the water use in agriculture marston et al 2020 worth mentioning josé graziano da silva former director general food and agriculture organization fao and as quoted in kang et al 2017 that there is no food security without water security to the fact that agriculture consumes about 70 of the total water use worldwide and therefore improving agricultural water productivity is an important measure for ensuring global water safety and food security kang et al 2017 the government of india economic survey 2018 19 also emphasized shifting from lp to blue wp i e irrigation wp however at the same time improvements in the green wp i e rainfed wp are also very much helpful in the management of green water especially for arid areas rockström and barron 2007 an increase in wp will help to generate net water savings which can be used further for bringing more area under irrigation diverting it for other purposes domestic industrial and environmental and reducing pressure in regions with higher water stress or scarcity singh et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 fader et al 2011 the improvements in wp can improve production and profitability clothier et al 2020 therefore it necessitates exploring the advanced tools and techniques for quantifying wp and lp in agriculture for solving future water and food challenges however the major challenge in quantifying wp and lp spatially and temporally is the availability of accurate and extensive data on yield and agricultural water use kelley and olson 2022 however this challenge is being addressed to the largest extent by making use of the freely available most of remote sensing and earth observation datasets by many agencies such as national aeronautics and space administration nasa european space agency esa and other space agencies and academic institutions worldwide these earth observation datasets are available in the near real time at varying spatial and temporal resolutions al bakri et al 2022 chawla et al 2020 foster et al 2020 karimi et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 long back international water management institute iwmi developed water accounting wa procedure molden 1997 to identify water consumption patterns wp lp flows and fluxes delavar et al 2020 however one of the major limitations of the wa procedure was the availability of the observed datasets to derive the required outputs at the desired resolutions karimi et al 2013a b to rectify this limitation wa procedure was later improved by imwi ihe delft fao by making use of satellite remote sensing datasets and open access datasets and the procedure was re named as the water accounting plus wa framework therefore keeping in view of the aforementioned discussion in this study wa framework has been applied to the mahi river basin a semi arid basin in the western part of india with the following objectives as i to study the land use impact over the water consumption patterns based on water management classes ii to partition et fluxes into evaporation e transpiration t and interception i fluxes iii to estimate etgreen etblue and their spatial variability in the basin and finally iv to assess the lp and wp of the major crop mainly cereals and their spatial and temporal variability in the basin the organizational structure of the paper is as follows section 1 highlights the importance of wp and lp to address the issues of food security and freshwater availability this section also highlights the usefulness of the remote sensing earth observation datasets in the estimation of spatial and temporal variability of the wp and lp in the basin section 2 deals with the study area section 3 gives a detailed description of the wa framework describing all the worksheets their input data requirements and outputs section 4 deals with the methodology used in this study this section gives the basic equations used for calculating the water consumption pathways i e e t i and lp and wp in the basin and different performance indicators this section also deals with the estimation of the etgreen and etblue using budyko hypothesis section 5 describes various database and inputs used in the study section 6 discusses the important results obtained from this study and their implications in agricultural water management and enhancing wp and lp for sustaining water resources and ensuring food security in the basin section 7 highlights the important conclusions drawn from the study and put forward relevant suggestions finally section 8 deals with the limitations and the potential for future research 2 study area the mahi basin situated in the western part of india falls under the semi arid region fig 1 this basin is an inter state basin of which 42 and 40 of the area falls in the states of gujarat and rajasthan respectively and 18 area in the state of madhya pradesh the mahi basin has a catchment area of 33 839 22 km² and lies between 72 21 e to 75 19 e and 21 46 n to 24 30 n the upper half of the basin in madhya pradesh state comprises undulating land with ridges and valleys whereas the lower half is a plain area a major part of the basin area lies in the elevation zones of 100 500 m the annual average rainfall et in the basin varies from 800 to 1300 mm and 700 900 mm respectively table 1 shows the district wise average rainfall from 2003 to 2020 et is about 65 80 of the total rainfall a major part of the basin receives rainfall during july to september the mean annual temperature of the basin varies from 26 c to 27 c the mahi basin is agriculture dominated with land use land cover lulc of the basin comprises of 65 of agricultural land 11 forest cover about 2 9 water bodies major crops of the basin include cereals rice maize wheat the leaf area index lai ranges from 0 33 to 1 5 m² m² which is an indicator of the low canopy cover in the basin the mahi basin falls under the non resilient ecosystem sharma et al 2017 and because of this it faces seasonal droughts regularly and some of the areas come under barren land and undulating areas hence there is a need for thorough investigations on water uses in agriculture and quantification of wp and lp for irrigated and rainfed agriculture both and basin performance indicators that can help the basin authorities and other stakeholders to develop actionable plans for ensuring food security and agricultural water management 3 water accounting plus wa framework wa framework is developed by ihe in collaboration with iwmi fao world water assessment programme wwap karimi et al 2013 wa framework is useful for the systematic assessment of water consumption patterns wp lp flows and fluxes delavar et al 2020 and shares the structural recently the wa framework has emerged as a key tool for understanding the water food nexus and identifying the gaps and inefficiencies in water uses wa framework is based on the fundamental concept of water depletions as that of iwmi wa rather than withdrawals and segregates these depletions into etgreen and etblue using the popular budyko 1974 hypothesis notably the water depletions in agriculture can be represented by the measurable et process through satellite remote sensing karimi et al 2013a b wa establishes a linkage between the landuse classes and water depletions and distinguishes between irrigated and rainfed agriculture using the blue and green water concept due to its ability to employ satellite driven information wa is especially appropriate and helpful for applications at large scales and in data scarce regions delavar et al 2020 wa framework provides seven key fact sheets delavar et al 2020 salvadore et al 2020 as i resources base ii evapotranspiration iii agricultural services or productivity iv withdrawals v surface water vi groundwater and vii ecosystem services the resource base sheet gives us the overall water resources scenario of the basin in terms of the unmanageable manageable exploitable reserved utilized and utilizable flows this sheet uses precipitation et pet change in storage outflows and net withdrawals and many other datasets as given in table a1 the evapotranspiration is the dominant eco hydrologic process in any basin the evapotranspiration sheet provides information on the water consumption patterns in the basin as per the four major land and water uses classes sometimes also referred as water management classes wmcs i e protected landuse plu utilized landuse ulu modified landuse mlu and managed water use mwu a brief description of these four major landuse classes also known as water management clusters will be given at the end of this section this sheet also gives which fraction of et is manageable i e et from ulu managed i e et from mlu and mwu and non manageable i e et from plu s the partitioning of et into beneficial transpiration t and non beneficial consumption soil and water evaporation e and canopy interception i is the unique feature of this sheet the et partitioning into the soil and water evaporation e canopy interception evaporation i and transpiration t yield both comprehensive insight into hydrological processes and better water management nguyen et al 2021 the agricultural services or productivity sheet provides information on the spatial and temporal variability of wp and lp and help identify the hot spots and bright spots which will help manage improved water management action plans engineering agronomical and societal for sustaining water resources and food security in the basin this sheet also gives the spatial and temporal estimates of wp and lp individually from rainfed and irrigated agriculture hence providing scope for devising plans individually as well as jointly for agricultural water management the lp and wp are calculated based on the representative crop as cereals although different crops are also cultivated in this region rice and wheat are considered as the major crop the withdrawals sheet also known as the utilized flow sheet summarizes all the man made withdrawals surface and groundwater consumed and non consumed water and recoverable and non recoverable water the surface water sheet provides information on the surface water availability natural at the basin and sub basin levels as per the four wmcs i e plu ulu mlu and mwu the groundwater sheet summarizes the groundwater flows and storage within the basin and facts on the vertical recharge and groundwater withdrawals the ecosystem services sheet provides information on ecosystem services produced within a basin by consuming water resources however this fact sheet is still in the developmental phase at ihe delft the inputs and outputs of all the above key fact sheets are given in table a1 appendix a also summarizes the definitions of the different terms used in the wa framework as discussed above the wa framework has four major land and water uses classes wmcs as i plu represents areas such as national parks wildlife sanctuaries that allows minimal disturbances by human ii ulu represents areas such as natural pastures forests which allows little interference by humans and provides services such as food fodder and fire woods iii mlu in this class the hydrological processes are significantly modified by human activity and the rainfed cropping system is the typical examples of this group and finally iv mwu in this class the natural water cycle is changed thoroughly by the irrigation systems and water infrastructural activities irrigated agriculture is the major landuse class of this class all these four major classes are further divided into 80 lulc classes the details on these 80 lulc classes can be taken from karimi et al 2013a michailovsky et al 2020 and mul et al 2020 4 materials and methodology in this study we are focusing on two key fact sheets i e the evapotranspiration sheet and the agricultural services or productivity sheet the evapotranspiration sheet is used for estimating water consumption patterns and partitioning of et into e t and i flux the budyko hypothesis and the agricultural services sheet are used for the estimation of etgreen and etblue for assessing the spatial and temporal variability of wp and lp and identification of gaps for sustaining water resources and food security in the mahi basin this analysis will help identify the wp gaps and associated lp gaps in the basin and show up to what extent the water in the agricultural sector is used productively this section discusses the datasets and the methodology used to address the objectives of this study as mentioned in the beginning of this section fig 5 shows the flowchart of the wa framework used in this study 4 1 datasets used the following datasets are used in this study from 2003 to 2020 as i precipitation p from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps ii actual evapotranspiration et simplified surface energy balance ssebop from usgs fews iii potential evapotranspiration pet extracted from global data assimilation system gdas analysis fields from noaa iii leaf area index lai from modis mod15 iv net primary production npp and gross primary production gpp from modis mod17 all the input datasets used in this study are in raster geotiff format wa land use utilizes different land use products

description and sources in detail 4 2 p et lai dry matter ndm and mean water yield variability worth mentioning precipitation is the key input in the wa as the other hydrological processes are dependent on it in this study we used chirps precipitation datasets from 2003 to 2020 before using the chirps datasets we evaluated it s applicability with india meteorological department imd gridded

number of observations fig 2 shows chirps dataset has higher values of nse and r² and lower values of mae and rmse with the imd dataset prakash 2019 and gupta et al 2019 also reported a similar performance of the chirps dataset for india recently bhattacharyya et al 2022 also found that the chirps dataset represents better annual and seasonal rainfall characteristics across india than the other satellite and re analysis precipitation datasets with respect to the imd dataset therefore we used chirps datasets for wa applications in this study the spatial variability of the p et lai and net dry matter ndm is shown in fig 3 a d the ndm net dry matter is calculated using npp and gpp datasets the average annual rainfall in the basin is about 1060 mm year the northern part of the basin the rajasthan state receives low rainfall as compared to the western gujarat and eastern madhya pradesh parts of the basin this spatial variability of rainfall is also affecting the biophysical parameters in the basin such as et lai and ndm as shown in fig 3 b d the average et of the basin is 857 mm year which is about 80 of the average annual rainfall the south western gujarat part of the basin shows the highest et followed by the parts of rajasthan as compared to the eastern parts of the basin madhya pradesh annual variability of p et and water yield p et for the mahi basin is also shown in fig 4 for the years when p is lower than et the water yield is negative in the mahi basin 4 3 methodological steps this section details the general steps followed to address the objectives of this study the flow chart of these steps is also given in fig 5 4 3 1 preprocessing of open source satellite datasets all the satellite and open access datasets were downloaded and processed to the same resolution of 250 m x 250 m for further application in the study 4 3 2 estimation of ndm the ndm kg ha on monthly scale is derived using npp kgc m² a modis product available on annual scale and gpp kgc m² a modis product available on 8 daily product is converted on monthly scale npp describes the net amount of carbon c that is absorbed by vegetation through assimilation and respiration a detailed description on this can be found in peiser and bastiaanssen 2015 4 3 3 generation of wa land use land cover map as discussed in section 3 wa framework has four main land and water uses classes also known as wmcs as plu ulu mlu and mwu based on the degree of the human disturbances altering the natural hydrological cycle and associated processes the coupling between the landuse and land cover with the water consumption patterns is an essential information particularly for the arid regions evaluation of water management strategies and policy making peiser and bastiaanssen 2015 wa lulc induces space for different management options for different lulc classes further it segregates the rainfed green water and irrigated agriculture green water blue water which makes it unique as joint management of green water and blue water may decrease the blue water dependency thus redefining the integrated water resources management iwrm falkenmark and rockström 2006 the developed wa based lulc walu map for the mahi basin is shown in fig 6 the plu which consists of 3 subclasses protected forests protected shrublands and protected waterbodies accounts for just 0 06 of total land use whereas the ulu which consists of 7 subclasses accounts for 33 68 of total land use on the basin the forest cover amounts to 10 50 of the total the mlu which is mostly comprised of rainfed crops is about 34 70 of the basin the principal rainfed crop recognized in the basin are cereals as determined by the mirca crop map the mwu class includes only 3 classes which are mostly irrigated crops and irrigated built up areas accounting for 31 56 of the basin table 2 also shows the four landuse and water use classes and major crop acreage in the basin 4 3 4 partitioning of et into e t i an accurate et partitioning is highly desirable for research related to agriculture climate and land use change hydrology and water resource availability talsma et al 2018 et partitioning is also a crucial factor in global climate models lawrence et al 2007 et partitioning can be used to separate the productive and un productive or beneficial or non beneficial fluxes delavar et al 2020 sutanto et al 2012 this partitioning is also very essential to improve wp in agriculture especially in case of water scarcity knowledge about water fluxes in the vadose zone is essential kool et al 2014 reviewed 52 et partitioning publications and stated that et partitioning is important to assess biomass production and the allocation of increasingly scarce water resources wa enables us to identify the water consumption patterns and provides better insights for water resource management based on the wa based lulc classification the evapotranspiration sheet depicts water depletion and specifies components of water utilization that can be managed manageable and non manageable it divides et into e t and i and then distinguishes between beneficial and non beneficial water consumption for instance e is taken as non beneficial component of et whereas t is taken as the beneficial component of et contributing to food production and the economy the estimation of i depends on the lai p and the number of rainy days and is estimated by the relationship given by von hoyningen hüne 1983 and braden 1985 as 5 im 1 1 1 pm nm 1 e 0 5 laim 1 laim laim nm where im represents monthly interception mm pm nm denotes the mean monthly precipitation mm the number of rainy days in a month respectively and laim stands for the mean monthly leaf area index m² m² 4 3 5 calculation of etgreen and etblue the spatial and temporal availability and uses of green and blue water vary from region to region and even within a basin and have different uses liu and yang 2010 both the blue and green waters contribute mutually to agriculture and hence assessment of their consumption etgreen and etblue is essential for improved management of water resources in agriculture and food security in the basin etblue is also known as incremental et or secondary et hoogeveen et al 2015 simons et al 2020 van dijk et al 2018 and etgreen as the et occurred due to the fraction of water infiltrates to soil and available for the plant growth jensen and allen 2016 note that such information is not commonly available and the ability of wa to provide it by following a scientific procedure is a useful strength etgreen and etblue fractions are mainly used to distinguish between the consumption of precipitation versus groundwater and surface water or stored water viz rivers lakes ponds etc simons et al 2020 singh et al 2021 the budyko curve represents the empirical relationship between the et pet p sposito 2017 by representing the ratio of et and p as evaporative index ei and pet and p as dryness index di the budyko curve is highly altered i e the points ei and di due to extensive human interventions particularly due to irrigation where the p is not the only source to meet consumptive demands chen et al 2020 simons et al 2020 generally et p should not exceed unity until and unless additional water is added to the basin the water balance approach and energy balance approaches are incorporated into the budyko hypothesis a separate water balance calculation is done for each of the green and blue pixels which identifies the rainfed and irrigated areas water limited catchments ϕ 1 and energy limited catchments ϕ 1 are separated by this notion singh et al 2022 fig 7 when the et needs are met via rainfall the pixels lying underneath the dotted curve are nothing but the green pixels singh et al 2021 and the resulting et is the etgreen if the et is appreciably higher than the rainfall obtained when a pixel falls above the dotted curve then it is argued that there is a further supply of water withdrawal from groundwater or surface water in that particular pixel and the resulting et is the etblue and the incremental yield is due to the incremental irrigation water the budyko equation is expressed creed et al 2014 singh et al 2022 as 6 f ϕ ϕ tanh 1 ϕ 1 e ϕ 7 et green min f ϕ xp et 8 ϕ pet p the relationship between etgreen and etblue is expressed as simons et al 2020 9 et etgreen etblue in this study the budyko hypothesis bh budyko 174 is used in wa framework to compute etgreen and etblue for irrigated and rainfed areas for the mahi basin 4 3 6 estimation of land productivity and water productivity as discussed above we used remote sensing satellite products such as npp gpp and estimates of etgreen and etblue to assess the spatial and temporal variability of lp and wp here we define the wp as the ratio of harvested crop yield above ground biomass dry matter eq 14 per unit of the total water consumed et etgreen etblue individually for both rainfed and irrigated agriculture similarly lp is defined as the ratio of harvested crop yield dry matter per unit of the crop acreage eqs 10 11 12 here we use crop specific coefficients harvesting index and moisture content to convert total dry matter production to crop yield peiser and bastiaanssen 2015 salvadore et al 2020 10 yield lp hi ndm 1 θ 11 f et blue et blue et green 12 lp irr lp f 13 lp rain lp lp irr 14 wp lp et blue et green 15 wp rain lp rain et blue et green 16 wp irri lp irri et blue et green where hi represents the harvest index f is the blue water fraction and ɵ denotes the moisture content yield or lp in kg ha and wp in kg m³ wpirri and wprain are the wps of the irrigated rainfed crop in kg m3 respectively yieldirr and yieldrain are irrigated and rainfed yields of crops in kg ha respectively these estimates will help diagnose the causes of low performance and identify interventions for improving wp and lp worth mentioning safi et al 2022 that observing the variability of wp and lp alone will not contribute to improvements and these findings must be translated to actionable information by identifying the causes for the variability by the stakeholders and policymakers a representative crop or crops are to be chosen to compute the fresh crop yield for each of the agricultural crop classes here we choose the representative crop cereals which mainly include rice and wheat as the major crop class in the basin for each type of crop harvest indices and water content are calculated to translate dry matter output into crop yield aiding growing season influence singh et al 2021 according to the indian crop calendar rabi and kharif seasons are considered as the growing seasons of irrigated and rainfed cereals 4 3 7 performance indicators wa includes several standard indicators each sheet has its own set of indicators that are derived from the data in the sheets as given in table 6 section 4 2 7 to comprehend the water consumption patterns in the basin and devise various management strategies 5 results and discussion this section presents the results obtained from this study and critically discusses these results and their implication in the field applications for improving agricultural water management and enhancing wp and lp for managing water resources and food security in the basin 5 1 et partitioning and land use interaction the knowledge of the water fluxes et and its components e t and i within the soil vegetation system to maximize the productive water loss t and minimize the non productive water losses e and i is crucial sutanto et al 2012 the et partitioning is also a crucial factor for global climate models as the partitioning of et has proven to be a significant source of uncertainty for future climate projections lawrence et al 2007 however the quantification of the relative contribution of e and t from et zhang et al 2010 is difficult in this work the wa framework is used for the partitioning of et considering the interaction of distinct land and water use categories i e plu ulu mlu and mwu the et partitioning as per four major landuse classes will further enrich its usefulness in agriculture et partitioning as per the four land and water use classes was done using the wa framework as discussed in section 3 7 and the results are given in table 2 the results show that the long term average annual et in the mahi basin is 27 48 km³ year with partitioning into e t and i for all four land and water use classes for the period of 2003 2020 this specific partitioning with respect to land and water use classes is extremely useful for managing agricultural waters and ecosystems the ulu consists of closed deciduous and green forest moorland and shrubs which is the case with the mahi basin contributes maximum to et i e 35 30 9 36 km³ year surprisingly similar is the case with the mwu class irrigated crops mainly i e it contributes 32 63 9 23 km³ year the mlu class rainfed agriculture mainly contributes 31 32 9 01 km³ year of the total et agriculture contributes about 64 62 of the total et in the mahi basin the et partitioning shows that the t for mwu is lower as compared to the mlu class which indicates that there exists a scope for agricultural water management maybe by using improved crop varieties or by improved irrigation practices or both in this basin to increase beneficial water consumptions the e component from soil and water both in mwu classis higher as compared to the mlu class table 2 also shows that though the area under mwu is less as compared to the mlu class but the e component non beneficial is higher fig 8a also shows the variability of et components e t and i for the period of 2003 2020 this shows that the e component is always higher than the t and has an increasing pattern for most of the years except for a few years fig 8b represents the seasonal variation of transpiration fig 9 shows the variation of et components as per the landuse classes a close look at fig 9 shows that the irrigated crops have a higher e component than the rainfed crops followed by the ulu class the et partitioning also shows that the average annual t of the basin is 11 33 km³ year which is about 40 16 of the average annual et whereas the e component from soil and water is about 15 93 km³ year 56 44 and accounts for 0 96 km³ year 3 40 of the et the t component is referred to as the beneficial et because it is responsible for food and fiber production and contributes to the economy the t component is highest in the mlu followed by the mwu and ulu which implies that rainfed agriculture contributes significantly to the food security of the basin similar results were also reported by singh et al 2022 while estimating evaporative demand using the budyko hypothesis for the mahi basin overall these findings imply that there is an enormous possibility to put into effective water management practices in the basin which will reduce non beneficial consumption e and i along with an increase in beneficial consumption via advanced irrigation practices the water thus saved may be used for irrigating larger areas or for other purposes than agriculture fig 10 a b also shows the et partitioning sheet developed by wa framework for the mahi basin respectively for wet and dry years these sheets can assist in formulating actionable plans agronomical engineering and societal managerial for reducing e and i and increasing t from irrigated crops in particular and rainfed in general 5 2 estimation of etgreen and etblue we know that green water is the sole water source for rainfed agriculture and an important part of the water source for irrigated croplands li et al 2022 agriculture is the only sector where green and blue water both contribute mutually liu et al 2022 and that crop irrigation consumes the largest proportion of blue water mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 mao et al 2020 state that even though green water is the dominant water resource blue water is also critical which is back into the soil through physical and human induced processes to meet the water demand of the ecosystem in this study etblue and etgreen are quantified using the budyko hypothesis the results show that the long term average annual etgreen in the basin is 15 8 km³ year which is 1 28 times higher than the etblue 12 32 km³ year the district wise estimates of the long term monthly average of etgreen and etblue are shown in fig 11 and the spatial variability is shown in fig 12 a b in general the results show that the districts falling in the gujarat state have more etblue followed by the districts in rajasthan and madhya pradesh within the gujarat state the bharuch 73 2 mm month and anand 58 1 mm month districts have the largest etblue followed by the mahisagar district 51 9 mm month than the others fig 12 a b also shows that the districts falling in the states of madhya pradesh and rajasthan in the mahi basin have higher etgreen than etblue the district wise estimates of etgreen and etblue are also given in table 3 both etgreen and etblue are lowest in ratlam 34 56 mm month 13 63 mm month district and highest in the bharuch 49 28 mm month 73 20 mm month table 3 district of the mahi basin we also calculated the blue water index bwi etblue etblue etgreen and green water index gwi etgreen etblue etgreen and the results are given in table 3 an index value of 1 shows that the crop yield is from irrigation only whereas an index of 0 indicates that precipitation is sufficient to achieve maximum crop yields johansson et al 2016 the bwi and gwi are found to vary from 0 282 to 0 598 and 0 40 0 72 the bwi is highest in the district of gujarat and the gwi is highest in the districts of madhya pradesh the higher value of bwi is an indication of the intensively irrigated agriculture in the basin districts the districts like bharuch anand kheda mahisagar panchmahal and vadodara are more dependent on the irrigation for their agricultural production than the other districts this the quantification of etblue and etgreen both spatial and temporal and will help identify the bwi hotspots districts for managing water in agriculture by adopting advanced irrigation technologies or by using less water requiring crops in those districts 5 3 spatial and temporal variability of lp and wp it is crucial to quantify the crop yields water consumption and wp for an efficient agricultural water management and sustaining food security in a basin the spatial and temporal quantification of these indicators helps identify the bright spots and hot spots to devise actionable goals the bright spots well performing crop fields are the regions or spots with the highest wp and lp and the hot spots poor performing crop fields are the regions or spots with the lowest wp and lp due to the complex land use land cover and hydrological processes involved the quantification and assessment of wp and lp are usually difficult especially at the regional scale ren et al 2021 these assessments require an understanding of the relationship between the hydrological variables such as e t i and other bio physical variables karimi et al 2013 safi et al 2022 such as lai npp and gpp secondly at the same time the field experiments and the regional observations are also scanty and are usually time consuming to collect the required data as discussed in the previous sections these limitations can be sorted out by using the newly developed wa framework which translates open source earth observation datasets to lp and wp for rainfed and irrigated agriculture individually using the budyko hypothesis and establishes the linkage between the hydrological and biophysical variables following this the wa framework is used for quantifying the wp and lp for the mahi basin at the district administrative scale the mathematical expressions for the estimation of lp and wp from irrigated and rainfed agriculture are discussed in section 4 2 6 wa reports these results in agricultural services or productivity sheet the spatial maps of the wp and lp are also developed in the wa framework which is very useful for identifying the bright spots and hot spots in the basin in the mahi basin the cereals are the major crop of the basin and are grown in both the seasons of rabi and kharif as mentioned in section 4 2 6 we took the representative crop as cereals to compute the lp and wp and other indicators the results show that the long term average lp of the irrigated and rainfed cereals is 2287 71 kg ha 1713 62 kg ha respectively from 2003 to 2020 table 4 similarly the long term average of wp of the irrigated and rainfed cereals is 0 721 kg m³ 0 483 kg m³ respectively from 2003 to 2020 fig 13 a b agricultural services sheets show the estimates of lp and wp for the year 2008 09 and 2016 17 individually as well as average for both therainfed and irrigated agriculture a close look at the agricultural services sheets fig 13a b shows that in case of the irrigated agriculture the estimation of the lp and wp is due to both rainfall and incremental irrigation whereas in case of the rainfed agriculture the estimates of lp and wp are due to rainfall only fig 14 a d shows the spatial variability district wise of wp and lp for rainfed and irrigated cereals in the mahi basin fig 15 shows the comparison of the wp and lp irrigated and rainfed both for all the districts of the mahi basin the district wise long term average of the lp and wp is also given in table 5 it can be inferred from fig 15 and table 5 that the districts such as anand bharuch vadodara dhar neemach jhabua and ratlam have higher lp irrigated more than 2300 kg ha with the highest value for ratlam 2573 96 kg ha than the other districts of the basin the lp irrigated is lowest for the aravali district of rajasthan than the other districts the districts falling in the state of madhya pradesh i e neemach jhabua alirajpur and the districts falling in the state of rajasthan i e udaipur chhataurgarh pratapgarh and others have higher lp rainfed than all the districts of gujarat the neemach district of madhya pradesh is found to have the highest lp rainfed 1948 13 kg ha followed by udaipur 1898 93 kg ha with the lowest value of lp for the kheda district 1526 79 kg ha of gujarat based on the lp estimates it is concluded that the ratlam and neemach districts of madhya pradesh have the highest lp for both irrigated and rainfed cereals fig 14c d fig 15 and also show the estimates of wp of the cereals irrigated and rainfed both for all the districts of the mahi basin the wp rainfed of all the districts of gujarat is comparatively lower varying from 0 34 kg m3 to 0 5 kg m3 than the districts of madhya pradesh varying from 0 59 kg m3 to 0 70 kg m3 and the rajasthan varying from 0 48 kg m3 to 0 73 kg m3 the pratapgarh district of rajasthan has the highest rainfed wp 0 73 kg m3 followed by ratlam 0 70 kg m3 of madhya pradesh the wp irrigated for all the districts of the mahi basin is also given in fig 14c d fig 15 and table 5 the wp irrigated of all five districts of madhya pradesh is found to vary from 1 46 kg m3 to 2 26 kg m3 followed by the districts of rajasthan varying from 0 79 kg m3 to 1 57 kg m3 and gujarat 0 44 kg m3 to 0 89 kg m3 these estimates of wp and lp irrigated and rainfed both can be further used for the classification of the districts of the mahi basin in bright spots district and hot spot district using the criteria given by safi et al 2022 for irrigated cereals the districts falling in the state of madhya pradesh have the highest lp and wp than the states of rajasthan and gujarat the ratlam and dhar districts report the highest wp irrigated and lp irrigated among all the districts and ratlam with the highest values of both wp and lp i e 2 14 kg m³ and 2573 96 kg ha respectively hence ratlam district is classified as the bright spot district similarly the anand district is found to have the lowest wp irrigated and is classified as the hot spot district as for as rainfed agriculture is concerned the districts falling in the state of madhya pradesh have the highest wp and lp followed by rajasthan and gujarat the neemuch district of madhya pradesh is classified as the bright spot district with wp and lp as 0 59 kg m3 and 1948 13 kg ha respectively and anand as the hot spot district with the lowest wp and lp as 0 34 kg m3 1572 21 kg ha respectively overall at the state level region level it can be stated the state of madhya pradesh is the bright spot state and gujarat as the hot spot state in irrigated and rainfed agriculture both 5 4 performance indicators the basin performance indicators such as transpiration fraction t et cao et al 2022 tong et al 2019 beneficial et fraction agricultural et fraction irrigated et fraction and food irrigation dependency karimi et al 2013a b plays an important role in assessing how do the water is being used in producing services such as in agriculture and sustaining ecosystem services along with this these indicators also indicate the coupling characteristics of the ecological and hydrological systems in a basin tong et al 2019 worth mentioning cao et al 2022 that the transpiration ratio t et also plays an important role in understanding the water cycle and land atmosphere interactions kool et al 2014 the ratio t et has great scientific and practical importance in sustainable development in the future tong et al 2019 these works show the importance of basin indicators for sustaining water resources and food security in a basin the estimated values of these indicators are given in table 6 the ratio t et also gives the fraction of et vaporized via plant leaves the managed et fraction represents gives the fraction of et through human interventions i e through mlu and mwu classes and help may help in saving water in agriculture the agricultural et reflects how intensively the water is being used in agriculture and irrigated et fraction reflects the contribution of irrigated agriculture to the et finally the food irrigation dependency reflects the dependency of the basin on irrigated agriculture for food production the long term average for the period of 2003 2020 of all indicators is shown in table 6 the higher the t et fraction better is the performance of the basin and for the mahi basin it is 40 and this indicates that there is a significantly lower amount of vegetation water consumption which in turn indicates that most of the water in the basin is depleted due to soil moisture evaporation and this is remarkable but unfavorable this necessitates for application of conservation practices and advanced irrigation technologies for reducing e from the basin the managed et fraction is 0 66 implying that human activities are controlling the water depletions largely in the basin the agricultural et fraction in the basin is 61 showing that agricultural activities consume the largest amount of water the reason for this is the basin s extremely large dependence on agricultural activities as the lulc map shows section 3 6 that there is 63 of agricultural land the irrigated et fraction for the basin is 55 representing that blue water incremental et consumption is contributing 55 to agriculture food irrigation dependency is about 90 which shows that food security is significantly influenced by the irrigation activities in the basin fig 16a shows the yearly variation of the performance indicators for the mahi basin out of these five indicators as mentioned herein and taken from karimi et al 2013 only the transpiration ratio t et has been a topic of much attention among researchers cao et al 2022 reported the values of t et varying between 0 52 and 0 61 across the world and found that lai vegetation water consumption is the most important factor controlling it in a basin coenders gerrits et al 2014 reported t et range of 0 35 0 80 tong et al 2019 quantified the t et ratio for different ecosystems and reported that the average t et is highest for the cropland ecosystem 0 80 followed by the alpine meadow ecosystem 0 79 the desert riparian forest 0 67 the desert riparian shrub ecosystem 0 67 0 06 and meadow 0 55 0 23 the lai was found to be the first order controlling factor on the t et ratio the t et ratio was also found to be different for different ecosystems in this study irrigated agriculture is found to have a lower value of t et ratio 0 40 as compared to the rainfed crops 0 45 as shown in fig 16b this reflects there is a need to either enhance the ecosystem productivity or apply controls on et process through reduced water supplies in terms of incremental irrigation the average transpiration fraction t et of different land uses is shown in fig 16b the t et is found to be highest for the grassland ecosystem 0 62 followed by shrublands 0 50 forest cover 0 45 and rainfed crops 0 45 irrigated crops 0 40 and least for the waterbodies 0 18 and built up 0 099 0 05 areas respectively the t et ratio is higher for rainfed agriculture 0 45 than the irrigated agriculture 0 40 however still it has a larger scope for improvements in both the cases i e for both rainfed and irrigated agriculture these indicators highlight the basin s performance in terms of ecosystem productivity and water services in the basin and possible improvements for efficient agricultural water management and sustaining food security in the basin 6 conclusions in this study we applied the newly developed wa framework for estimating the water consumption patterns in terms of etgreen and etblue for assessing the lp and wp in a semi arid mahi basin in india to formulate the actionable management plans for the stakeholders and policymakers we also partitioned et flux into e t and i flux as per the four major landuse and water classes and quantified the basin performance indicators for this purpose in this study we used freely available open source remote sensing datasets by assessing the spatial and temporal variability of both lp and lp at the administrative units districts in this case scale we classified these administrative units as bright spots and hot spots to help identify the causes behind what is affecting their performance in the basin the following conclusions are drawn from this study as the long term etgreen and etblue in the mahi basin are found to be 15 8 km3 year and 12 32 km3 year respectively in general the districts falling in the state of gujarat have the highest values of long term average annual etblue than the administrative units falling in the state of rajasthan and madhya pradesh the districts of gujarat such as bharuch anand and mahisagar have the highest values of long term average annual etblue i e 73 2 mm month 58 1 mm month and 51 9 mm month respectively than the districts of the rajasthan and madhya pradesh in the mahi basin the bwi and gwi in the mahi basin vary from 0 28 to 0 59and 0 40 0 71 the bwi is highest in the district of gujarat and the gwi is highest in the districts of madhya pradesh the higher value of bwi is an indication of the more dependency on irrigation for agricultural production and vice versa the long term average of lp and wp of the irrigated and rainfed cereals is found to be 2287 71 kg ha 1713 62 kg ha and 0 721 kg m³ 0 483 kg m³ respectively for the period of 2003 2020 the districts such as anand bharuch vadodara dhar neemach jhabua and ratlam have higher lp irrigated more than 2300 kg ha with the highest value for ratlam 2573 96 kg ha than the other districts of the basin the lp irrigated is lowest for the aravali district of rajasthan than the other districts the neemach district of madhya pradesh has the highest lp rainfed 1948 13 kg ha followed by udaipur 1898 93 kg ha with the lowest value of lp for the kheda district 1526 79 kg ha of gujarat the wp irrigated of all five districts of madhya pradesh is higher and vary from 1 46 kg m³ to 2 26 kg m³ than the districts of rajasthan varying from 0 79 kg m³ to 1 57 kg m³ and gujarat 0 44 kg m³to 0 89 kg m³ the wp rainfed of all the districts of gujarat is comparatively lower varying from 0 34 kg m³ to 0 50 kg m³ than the districts of madhya pradesh varying from 0 59 kg m³ to 0 70 kg m³ and the rajasthan varying from 0 48 kg m³ to 0 73 kg m³ as per the criteria are given by safi et al 2022 for classification of the districts as the bright spots district and hot spot district for irrigated cereals the ratlam district is found to have both high lp and wp as 2573 96 kg ha and 2 14 kg m3 respectively among all the districts of the mahi basin and hence the ratlam district is classified as the bright spot district similarly the anand district is found to have the lowest wp 0 44 kg m3 and the lp as 2467 51 kg ha and hence it is classified as the hot spot district as per the criteria are given by safi et al 2022 for classification of the districts as the bright spots district and hot spot district for rainfed cereals the neemuch district of madhya pradesh is classified as the bright spot district with wp and lp as 0 59 kg m3 and 1948 13 kg ha respectively and anand as the hot spot district with the lowest wp as 0 34 kg m3 and lp as 1572 21 kg ha respectively overall at the state level region level the results show that the state of madhya pradesh is the bright spot state and gujarat as the hot spot state for irrigated and rainfed agriculture both 7 limitations of wa technique despite wa s strong performance one of the major limitations of wa technique is its reliance on satellite based remote sensing datasets due to the unavailability of the observed datasets such as et npp gpp irrigated and rainfed crop maps and others in many parts of the developing world e g india the satellite data are prone to inaccuracy because they are used to estimate hydrological processes indirectly hence attention should be taken to enriching the satellite datasets through validation and ensemble processes e g et ensemble products by using satellite and observed et datasets during applications wa estimates of wp and lp are highly dependent on the irrigated and rainfed crop map of the basin this necessitates for field surveys of cropping patterns for enhanced performance finally the wa based lulc map walu needs to be customized for local conditions say region specific as the many classes out of 80 classes are not applicable to all the regions of the world we took the cereals as the major crop class in the basin as without segregating them into wheat and paddy due to the absence of a detailed and accurate crop map area of the mahi basin this aspect also needs a major refinement to estimate crop wise lp and wp in the basin salvadore et al 2020 also emphasized and accurate and detailed crop map of the basin to estimate the crop wise yield productivity heavy dependence of the wa technique on the satellite datasets limits this technique s applicability to future assessments incorporating climate change scenarios the wa technique does not have the snow glacier component and this limits its applicability to the glacier basins 8 future scope of research in arid and semi arid regions agricultural activities have the largest proportion of the water consumption and therefore this study was formulated to estimate the green and blue water consumption etblue and etgreen and assess the spatial and temporal variability of the wp and lp to identify the bright spots and hot spots at the district administrative unit level for effectively managing the scarce water resources and sustaining food security in highly non resilient basin of india the findings will ultimately help formulate the actionable management plans to the stakeholders and policymakers of the mahi basin however to address the limitations of the wa technique as discussed above this technique should be coupled with a hydrological model say soil and water assessment tool swat and spatial processes in hydrology sphy model to address the current and future status of the water availability demand and supply scenarios this ensemble modelling framework wa coupled with the swat and sphy may also include the socio economic aspects in the devising of actionable water management plans 9 recommendations suggestions as the wp both irrigated and rainfed of the districts of gujarat such as anand vadodara kheda and bharuch is lower than that of the districts of madhya pradesh and rajasthan in the mahi basin and hence advanced irrigation techniques coupled with the crop diversification adopting the technological and agronomical interventions of the bright spot districts such as ratlam and neemach to increase the wp without effecting the lp of these hot spot districts the higher values of bwi are an indication of the more dependency on irrigation for agricultural production and hence efforts should be made to incentivize the farmers for crop diversification and shifting from more water intensive crops to less water intensive crops these findings can be taken as baseline for developing actionable agricultural water management plans by the stakeholders and policymakers of the basin states declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9130,the agricultural activities contribute to the largest share of water consumption in the arid and semi arid basins in this study we demonstrate the application of water accounting plus wa for estimation of the green water consumption etgreen and blue water consumption etblue for assessing the water productivity wp and land productivity lp to identify the bright spots and hot spots at the district administrative unit level for effectively managing the scarce water resources and sustaining food security in a highly non resilient semi arid basin of india the wa framework uses satellite remote sensing datasets from different sources for this purpose and we used the data from 2003 to 2020 the long term average of etgreen and etblue in the mahi basin is found to be 15 8 km3 year and 12 32 km3 year respectively the blue water index bwi and green water index gwi in the basin vary from 0 282 to 0 598 and 0 40 0 72 we found that the bwi is highest for the districts of gujarat whereas the gwi is highest for the districts of madhya pradesh the long term average of the lp and wp for both the irrigated and rainfed cereals in the basin is found as 2287 71 kg ha 1713 62 kg ha and 0 721 kg m³ 0 483 kg m³ respectively from 2003 to 2020 the wp rainfed of all the districts of the gujarat is comparatively lower varying from 0 34 kg m³ to 0 5 kg m³ than the districts of the madhya pradesh varying from 0 59 kg m3 to 0 70 kg m³ and the rajasthan varying from 0 48 kg m³ to 0 73 kg m³ based on the results we found that the ratlam district of the madhya pradesh has both highest lp and wp irrigated as 2573 96 kg ha and 2 14 kg m3 respectively among all the districts of the mahi basin and hence it is classified as the bright spot district the anand district is found to have the lowest wp and lp as 0 44 kg m3 and 2467 51 kg ha respectively and hence it is classified as the hot spot district for rainfed cereals we found that the neemuch district of madhya pradesh has the highest wp and lp as 0 59 kg m3 and 1948 13 kg ha respectively and the anand district with the lowest wp as 0 34 kg m3 and lp of 1572 21 kg ha respectively therefore we classified the neemach district as the bright spot district and the anand district as the hot spot district for rainfed cereals these findings will help develop sustainable and actionable agricultural water management plans by the policymakers and stakeholders in the basin keywords evapotranspiration green water blue water land productivity transpiration water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing water productivity wp and land productivities lp for sustaining food security and freshwater availability is a significant challenge to the current and future generations safi et al 2022 the water availability for agricultural production will decrease due to increased competition from industrial and domestic sectors zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 and this will eventually put excess pressure on the farmers this is the reason that there is a growing emphasis on increasing wp in agriculture kang et al 2017 marston et al 2020 molden 2007 bastiaanssen et al 2003 wp is represented as the ratio of the crop yield to the green and blue water consumption i e etgreen and etblue where etgreen and etblue represent the actual evapotranspiration et due to green water and blue water respectively falkenmark and rockström 2006 velpuri and senay 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 chukalla et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 msigwa et al 2021 singh et al 2021 wp measures the capability of a system to convert water consumed into goods and services molden 1997 wp also helps establish a linkage between agricultural water management with water security food security and economic development bastiaanssen et al 2003 improving wp will help to reduce the need for additional resources in both irrigated blue water and rainfed green water systems molden et al 2010 and its benchmarking will help identify the productivity levels for improving the sustainability of the water use in agriculture marston et al 2020 worth mentioning josé graziano da silva former director general food and agriculture organization fao and as quoted in kang et al 2017 that there is no food security without water security to the fact that agriculture consumes about 70 of the total water use worldwide and therefore improving agricultural water productivity is an important measure for ensuring global water safety and food security kang et al 2017 the government of india economic survey 2018 19 also emphasized shifting from lp to blue wp i e irrigation wp however at the same time improvements in the green wp i e rainfed wp are also very much helpful in the management of green water especially for arid areas rockström and barron 2007 an increase in wp will help to generate net water savings which can be used further for bringing more area under irrigation diverting it for other purposes domestic industrial and environmental and reducing pressure in regions with higher water stress or scarcity singh et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 fader et al 2011 the improvements in wp can improve production and profitability clothier et al 2020 therefore it necessitates exploring the advanced tools and techniques for quantifying wp and lp in agriculture for solving future water and food challenges however the major challenge in quantifying wp and lp spatially and temporally is the availability of accurate and extensive data on yield and agricultural water use kelley and olson 2022 however this challenge is being addressed to the largest extent by making use of the freely available most of remote sensing and earth observation datasets by many agencies such as national aeronautics and space administration nasa european space agency esa and other space agencies and academic institutions worldwide these earth observation datasets are available in the near real time at varying spatial and temporal resolutions al bakri et al 2022 chawla et al 2020 foster et al 2020 karimi et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 long back international water management institute iwmi developed water accounting wa procedure molden 1997 to identify water consumption patterns wp lp flows and fluxes delavar et al 2020 however one of the major limitations of the wa procedure was the availability of the observed datasets to derive the required outputs at the desired resolutions karimi et al 2013a b to rectify this limitation wa procedure was later improved by imwi ihe delft fao by making use of satellite remote sensing datasets and open access datasets and the procedure was re named as the water accounting plus wa framework therefore keeping in view of the aforementioned discussion in this study wa framework has been applied to the mahi river basin a semi arid basin in the western part of india with the following objectives as i to study the land use impact over the water consumption patterns based on water management classes ii to partition et fluxes into evaporation e transpiration t and interception i fluxes iii to estimate etgreen etblue and their spatial variability in the basin and finally iv to assess the lp and wp of the major crop mainly cereals and their spatial and temporal variability in the basin the organizational structure of the paper is as follows section 1 highlights the importance of wp and lp to address the issues of food security and freshwater availability this section also highlights the usefulness of the remote sensing earth observation datasets in the estimation of spatial and temporal variability of the wp and lp in the basin section 2 deals with the study area section 3 gives a detailed description of the wa framework describing all the worksheets their input data requirements and outputs section 4 deals with the methodology used in this study this section gives the basic equations used for calculating the water consumption pathways i e e t i and lp and wp in the basin and different performance indicators this section also deals with the estimation of the etgreen and etblue using budyko hypothesis section 5 describes various database and inputs used in the study section 6 discusses the important results obtained from this study and their implications in agricultural water management and enhancing wp and lp for sustaining water resources and ensuring food security in the basin section 7 highlights the important conclusions drawn from the study and put forward relevant suggestions finally section 8 deals with the limitations and the potential for future research 2 study area the mahi basin situated in the western part of india falls under the semi arid region fig 1 this basin is an inter state basin of which 42 and 40 of the area falls in the states of gujarat and rajasthan respectively and 18 area in the state of madhya pradesh the mahi basin has a catchment area of 33 839 22 km² and lies between 72 21 e to 75 19 e and 21 46 n to 24 30 n the upper half of the basin in madhya pradesh state comprises undulating land with ridges and valleys whereas the lower half is a plain area a major part of the basin area lies in the elevation zones of 100 500 m the annual average rainfall et in the basin varies from 800 to 1300 mm and 700 900 mm respectively table 1 shows the district wise average rainfall from 2003 to 2020 et is about 65 80 of the total rainfall a major part of the basin receives rainfall during july to september the mean annual temperature of the basin varies from 26 c to 27 c the mahi basin is agriculture dominated with land use land cover lulc of the basin comprises of 65 of agricultural land 11 forest cover about 2 9 water bodies major crops of the basin include cereals rice maize wheat the leaf area index lai ranges from 0 33 to 1 5 m² m² which is an indicator of the low canopy cover in the basin the mahi basin falls under the non resilient ecosystem sharma et al 2017 and because of this it faces seasonal droughts regularly and some of the areas come under barren land and undulating areas hence there is a need for thorough investigations on water uses in agriculture and quantification of wp and lp for irrigated and rainfed agriculture both and basin performance indicators that can help the basin authorities and other stakeholders to develop actionable plans for ensuring food security and agricultural water management 3 water accounting plus wa framework wa framework is developed by ihe in collaboration with iwmi fao world water assessment programme wwap karimi et al 2013 wa framework is useful for the systematic assessment of water consumption patterns wp lp flows and fluxes delavar et al 2020 and shares the structural recently the wa framework has emerged as a key tool for understanding the water food nexus and identifying the gaps and inefficiencies in water uses wa framework is based on the fundamental concept of water depletions as that of iwmi wa rather than withdrawals and segregates these depletions into etgreen and etblue using the popular budyko 1974 hypothesis notably the water depletions in agriculture can be represented by the measurable et process through satellite remote sensing karimi et al 2013a b wa establishes a linkage between the landuse classes and water depletions and distinguishes between irrigated and rainfed agriculture using the blue and green water concept due to its ability to employ satellite driven information wa is especially appropriate and helpful for applications at large scales and in data scarce regions delavar et al 2020 wa framework provides seven key fact sheets delavar et al 2020 salvadore et al 2020 as i resources base ii evapotranspiration iii agricultural services or productivity iv withdrawals v surface water vi groundwater and vii ecosystem services the resource base sheet gives us the overall water resources scenario of the basin in terms of the unmanageable manageable exploitable reserved utilized and utilizable flows this sheet uses precipitation et pet change in storage outflows and net withdrawals and many other datasets as given in table a1 the evapotranspiration is the dominant eco hydrologic process in any basin the evapotranspiration sheet provides information on the water consumption patterns in the basin as per the four major land and water uses classes sometimes also referred as water management classes wmcs i e protected landuse plu utilized landuse ulu modified landuse mlu and managed water use mwu a brief description of these four major landuse classes also known as water management clusters will be given at the end of this section this sheet also gives which fraction of et is manageable i e et from ulu managed i e et from mlu and mwu and non manageable i e et from plu s the partitioning of et into beneficial transpiration t and non beneficial consumption soil and water evaporation e and canopy interception i is the unique feature of this sheet the et partitioning into the soil and water evaporation e canopy interception evaporation i and transpiration t yield both comprehensive insight into hydrological processes and better water management nguyen et al 2021 the agricultural services or productivity sheet provides information on the spatial and temporal variability of wp and lp and help identify the hot spots and bright spots which will help manage improved water management action plans engineering agronomical and societal for sustaining water resources and food security in the basin this sheet also gives the spatial and temporal estimates of wp and lp individually from rainfed and irrigated agriculture hence providing scope for devising plans individually as well as jointly for agricultural water management the lp and wp are calculated based on the representative crop as cereals although different crops are also cultivated in this region rice and wheat are considered as the major crop the withdrawals sheet also known as the utilized flow sheet summarizes all the man made withdrawals surface and groundwater consumed and non consumed water and recoverable and non recoverable water the surface water sheet provides information on the surface water availability natural at the basin and sub basin levels as per the four wmcs i e plu ulu mlu and mwu the groundwater sheet summarizes the groundwater flows and storage within the basin and facts on the vertical recharge and groundwater withdrawals the ecosystem services sheet provides information on ecosystem services produced within a basin by consuming water resources however this fact sheet is still in the developmental phase at ihe delft the inputs and outputs of all the above key fact sheets are given in table a1 appendix a also summarizes the definitions of the different terms used in the wa framework as discussed above the wa framework has four major land and water uses classes wmcs as i plu represents areas such as national parks wildlife sanctuaries that allows minimal disturbances by human ii ulu represents areas such as natural pastures forests which allows little interference by humans and provides services such as food fodder and fire woods iii mlu in this class the hydrological processes are significantly modified by human activity and the rainfed cropping system is the typical examples of this group and finally iv mwu in this class the natural water cycle is changed thoroughly by the irrigation systems and water infrastructural activities irrigated agriculture is the major landuse class of this class all these four major classes are further divided into 80 lulc classes the details on these 80 lulc classes can be taken from karimi et al 2013a michailovsky et al 2020 and mul et al 2020 4 materials and methodology in this study we are focusing on two key fact sheets i e the evapotranspiration sheet and the agricultural services or productivity sheet the evapotranspiration sheet is used for estimating water consumption patterns and partitioning of et into e t and i flux the budyko hypothesis and the agricultural services sheet are used for the estimation of etgreen and etblue for assessing the spatial and temporal variability of wp and lp and identification of gaps for sustaining water resources and food security in the mahi basin this analysis will help identify the wp gaps and associated lp gaps in the basin and show up to what extent the water in the agricultural sector is used productively this section discusses the datasets and the methodology used to address the objectives of this study as mentioned in the beginning of this section fig 5 shows the flowchart of the wa framework used in this study 4 1 datasets used the following datasets are used in this study from 2003 to 2020 as i precipitation p from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps ii actual evapotranspiration et simplified

description and sources in detail 4 2 p et lai dry matter ndm and mean water yield variability worth mentioning precipitation is the key input in the wa as the other hydrological processes are dependent on it in this study we used chirps precipitation datasets from 2003 to 2020 before using the chirps datasets we evaluated it s applicability with india meteorological department imd gridded

number of observations fig 2 shows chirps dataset has higher values of nse and r² and lower values of mae and rmse with the imd dataset prakash 2019 and gupta et al 2019 also reported a similar performance of the chirps dataset for india recently bhattacharyya et al 2022 also found that the chirps dataset represents better annual and seasonal rainfall characteristics across india than the other satellite and re analysis precipitation datasets with respect to the imd dataset therefore we used chirps datasets for wa applications in this study the spatial variability of the p et lai and net dry matter ndm is shown in fig 3 a d the ndm net dry matter is calculated using npp and gpp datasets the average annual rainfall in the basin is about 1060 mm year the northern part of the basin the rajasthan state receives low rainfall as compared to the western gujarat and eastern madhya pradesh parts of the basin this spatial variability of rainfall is also affecting the biophysical parameters in the basin such as et lai and ndm as shown in fig 3 b d the average et of the basin is 857 mm year which is about 80 of the average annual rainfall the south western gujarat part of the basin shows the highest et followed by the parts of rajasthan as compared to the eastern parts of the basin madhya pradesh annual variability of p et and water yield p et for the mahi basin is also shown in fig 4 for the years when p is lower than et the water yield is negative in the mahi basin 4 3 methodological steps this section details the general steps followed to address the objectives of this study the flow chart of these steps is also given in fig 5 4 3 1 preprocessing of open source satellite datasets all the satellite and open access datasets were downloaded and processed to the same resolution of 250 m x 250 m for further application in the study 4 3 2 estimation of ndm the ndm kg ha on monthly scale is derived using npp kgc m² a modis product available on annual scale and gpp kgc m² a modis product available on 8 daily product is converted on monthly scale npp describes the net amount of carbon c that is absorbed by vegetation through assimilation and respiration a detailed description on this can be found in peiser and bastiaanssen 2015 4 3 3 generation of wa land use land cover map as discussed in section 3 wa framework has four main land and water uses classes also known as wmcs as plu ulu mlu and mwu based on the degree of the human disturbances altering the natural hydrological cycle and associated processes the coupling between the landuse and land cover with the water consumption patterns is an essential information particularly for the arid regions evaluation of water management strategies and policy making peiser and bastiaanssen 2015 wa lulc induces space for different management options for different lulc classes further it segregates the rainfed green water and irrigated agriculture green water blue water which makes it unique as joint management of green water and blue water may decrease the blue water dependency thus redefining the integrated water resources management iwrm falkenmark and rockström 2006 the developed wa based lulc walu map for the mahi basin is shown in fig 6 the plu which consists of 3 subclasses protected forests protected shrublands and protected waterbodies accounts for just 0 06 of total land use whereas the ulu which consists of 7 subclasses accounts for 33 68 of total land use on the basin the forest cover amounts to 10 50 of the total the mlu which is mostly comprised of rainfed crops is about 34 70 of the basin the principal rainfed crop recognized in the basin are cereals as determined by the mirca crop map the mwu class includes only 3 classes which are mostly irrigated crops and irrigated built up areas accounting for 31 56 of the basin table 2 also shows the four landuse and water use classes and major crop acreage in the basin 4 3 4 partitioning of et into e t i an accurate et partitioning is highly desirable for research related to agriculture climate and land use change hydrology and water resource availability talsma et al 2018 et partitioning is also a crucial factor in global climate models lawrence et al 2007 et partitioning can be used to separate the productive and un productive or beneficial or non beneficial fluxes delavar et al 2020 sutanto et al 2012 this partitioning is also very essential to improve wp in agriculture especially in case of water scarcity knowledge about water fluxes in the vadose zone is essential kool et al 2014 reviewed 52 et partitioning publications and stated that et partitioning is important to assess biomass production and the allocation of increasingly scarce water resources wa enables us to identify the water consumption patterns and provides better insights for water resource management based on the wa based lulc classification the evapotranspiration sheet depicts water depletion and specifies components of water utilization that can be managed manageable and non manageable it divides et into e t and i and then distinguishes between beneficial and non beneficial water consumption for instance e is taken as non beneficial component of et whereas t is taken as the beneficial component of et contributing to food production and the economy the estimation of i depends on the lai p and the number of rainy days and is estimated by the relationship given by von hoyningen hüne 1983 and braden 1985 as 5 im 1 1 1 pm nm 1 e 0 5 laim 1 laim laim nm where im represents monthly interception mm pm nm denotes the mean monthly precipitation mm the number of rainy days in a month respectively and laim stands for the mean monthly leaf area index m² m² 4 3 5 calculation of etgreen and etblue the spatial and temporal availability and uses of green and blue water vary from region to region and even within a basin and have different uses liu and yang 2010 both the blue and green waters contribute mutually to agriculture and hence assessment of their consumption etgreen and etblue is essential for improved management of water resources in agriculture and food security in the basin etblue is also known as incremental et or secondary et hoogeveen et al 2015 simons et al 2020 van dijk et al 2018 and etgreen as the et occurred due to the fraction of water infiltrates to soil and available for the plant growth jensen and allen 2016 note that such information is not commonly available and the ability of wa to provide it by following a scientific procedure is a useful strength etgreen and etblue fractions are mainly used to distinguish between the consumption of precipitation versus groundwater and surface water or stored water viz rivers lakes ponds etc simons et al 2020 singh et al 2021 the budyko curve represents the empirical relationship between the et pet p sposito 2017 by representing the ratio of et and p as evaporative index ei and pet and p as dryness index di the budyko curve is highly altered i e the points ei and di due to extensive human interventions particularly due to irrigation where the p is not the only source to meet consumptive demands chen et al 2020 simons et al 2020 generally et p should not exceed unity until and unless additional water is added to the basin the water balance approach and energy balance approaches are incorporated into the budyko hypothesis a separate water balance calculation is done for each of the green and blue pixels which identifies the rainfed and irrigated areas water limited catchments ϕ 1 and energy limited catchments ϕ 1 are separated by this notion singh et al 2022 fig 7 when the et needs are met via rainfall the pixels lying underneath the dotted curve are nothing but the green pixels singh et al 2021 and the resulting et is the etgreen if the et is appreciably higher than the rainfall obtained when a pixel falls above the dotted curve then it is argued that there is a further supply of water withdrawal from groundwater or surface water in that particular pixel and the resulting et is the etblue and the incremental yield is due to the incremental irrigation water the budyko equation is expressed creed et al 2014 singh et al 2022 as 6 f ϕ ϕ tanh 1 ϕ 1 e ϕ 7 et green min f ϕ xp et 8 ϕ pet p the relationship between etgreen and etblue is expressed as simons et al 2020 9 et etgreen etblue in this study the budyko hypothesis bh budyko 174 is used in wa framework to compute etgreen and etblue for irrigated and rainfed areas for the mahi basin 4 3 6 estimation of land productivity and water productivity as discussed above we used remote sensing satellite products such as npp gpp and estimates of etgreen and etblue to assess the spatial and temporal variability of lp and wp here we define the wp as the ratio of harvested crop yield above ground biomass dry matter eq 14 per unit of the total water consumed et etgreen etblue individually for both rainfed and irrigated agriculture similarly lp is defined as the ratio of harvested crop yield dry matter per unit of the crop acreage eqs 10 11 12 here we use crop specific coefficients harvesting index and moisture content to convert total dry matter production to crop yield peiser and bastiaanssen 2015 salvadore et al 2020 10 yield lp hi ndm 1 θ 11 f et blue et blue et green 12 lp irr lp f 13 lp rain lp lp irr 14 wp lp et blue et green 15 wp rain lp rain et blue et green 16 wp irri lp irri et blue et green where hi represents the harvest index f is the blue water fraction and ɵ denotes the moisture content yield or lp in kg ha and wp in kg m³ wpirri and wprain are the wps of the irrigated rainfed crop in kg m3 respectively yieldirr and yieldrain are irrigated and rainfed yields of crops in kg ha respectively these estimates will help diagnose the causes of low performance and identify interventions for improving wp and lp worth mentioning safi et al 2022 that observing the variability of wp and lp alone will not contribute to improvements and these findings must be translated to actionable information by identifying the causes for the variability by the stakeholders and policymakers a representative crop or crops are to be chosen to compute the fresh crop yield for each of the agricultural crop classes here we choose the representative crop cereals which mainly include rice and wheat as the major crop class in the basin for each type of crop harvest indices and water content are calculated to translate dry matter output into crop yield aiding growing season influence singh et al 2021 according to the indian crop calendar rabi and kharif seasons are considered as the growing seasons of irrigated and rainfed cereals 4 3 7 performance indicators wa includes several standard indicators each sheet has its own set of indicators that are derived from the data in the sheets as given in table 6 section 4 2 7 to comprehend the water consumption patterns in the basin and devise various management strategies 5 results and discussion this section presents the results obtained from this study and critically discusses these results and their implication in the field applications for improving agricultural water management and enhancing wp and lp for managing water resources and food security in the basin 5 1 et partitioning and land use interaction the knowledge of the water fluxes et and its components e t and i within the soil vegetation system to maximize the productive water loss t and minimize the non productive water losses e and i is crucial sutanto et al 2012 the et partitioning is also a crucial factor for global climate models as the partitioning of et has proven to be a significant source of uncertainty for future climate projections lawrence et al 2007 however the quantification of the relative contribution of e and t from et zhang et al 2010 is difficult in this work the wa framework is used for the partitioning of et considering the interaction of distinct land and water use categories i e plu ulu mlu and mwu the et partitioning as per four major landuse classes will further enrich its usefulness in agriculture et partitioning as per the four land and water use classes was done using the wa framework as discussed in section 3 7 and the results are given in table 2 the results show that the long term average annual et in the mahi basin is 27 48 km³ year with partitioning into e t and i for all four land and water use classes for the period of 2003 2020 this specific partitioning with respect to land and water use classes is extremely useful for managing agricultural waters and ecosystems the ulu consists of closed deciduous and green forest moorland and shrubs which is the case with the mahi basin contributes maximum to et i e 35 30 9 36 km³ year surprisingly similar is the case with the mwu class irrigated crops mainly i e it contributes 32 63 9 23 km³ year the mlu class rainfed agriculture mainly contributes 31 32 9 01 km³ year of the total et agriculture contributes about 64 62 of the total et in the mahi basin the et partitioning shows that the t for mwu is lower as compared to the mlu class which indicates that there exists a scope for agricultural water management maybe by using improved crop varieties or by improved irrigation practices or both in this basin to increase beneficial water consumptions the e component from soil and water both in mwu classis higher as compared to the mlu class table 2 also shows that though the area under mwu is less as compared to the mlu class but the e component non beneficial is higher fig 8a also shows the variability of et components e t and i for the period of 2003 2020 this shows that the e component is always higher than the t and has an increasing pattern for most of the years except for a few years fig 8b represents the seasonal variation of transpiration fig 9 shows the variation of et components as per the landuse classes a close look at fig 9 shows that the irrigated crops have a higher e component than the rainfed crops followed by the ulu class the et partitioning also shows that the average annual t of the basin is 11 33 km³ year which is about 40 16 of the average annual et whereas the e component from soil and water is about 15 93 km³ year 56 44 and accounts for 0 96 km³ year 3 40 of the et the t component is referred to as the beneficial et because it is responsible for food and fiber production and contributes to the economy the t component is highest in the mlu followed by the mwu and ulu which implies that rainfed agriculture contributes significantly to the food security of the basin similar results were also reported by singh et al 2022 while estimating evaporative demand using the budyko hypothesis for the mahi basin overall these findings imply that there is an enormous possibility to put into effective water management practices in the basin which will reduce non beneficial consumption e and i along with an increase in beneficial consumption via advanced irrigation practices the water thus saved may be used for irrigating larger areas or for other purposes than agriculture fig 10 a b also shows the et partitioning sheet developed by wa framework for the mahi basin respectively for wet and dry years these sheets can assist in formulating actionable plans agronomical engineering and societal managerial for reducing e and i and increasing t from irrigated crops in particular and rainfed in general 5 2 estimation of etgreen and etblue we know that green water is the sole water source for rainfed agriculture and an important part of the water source for irrigated croplands li et al 2022 agriculture is the only sector where green and blue water both contribute mutually liu et al 2022 and that crop irrigation consumes the largest proportion of blue water mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 mao et al 2020 state that even though green water is the dominant water resource blue water is also critical which is back into the soil through physical and human induced processes to meet the water demand of the ecosystem in this study etblue and etgreen are quantified using the budyko hypothesis the results show that the long term average annual etgreen in the basin is 15 8 km³ year which is 1 28 times higher than the etblue 12 32 km³ year the district wise estimates of the long term monthly average of etgreen and etblue are shown in fig 11 and the spatial variability is shown in fig 12 a b in general the results show that the districts falling in the gujarat state have more etblue followed by the districts in rajasthan and madhya pradesh within the gujarat state the bharuch 73 2 mm month and anand 58 1 mm month districts have the largest etblue followed by the mahisagar district 51 9 mm month than the others fig 12 a b also shows that the districts falling in the states of madhya pradesh and rajasthan in the mahi basin have higher etgreen than etblue the district wise estimates of etgreen and etblue are also given in table 3 both etgreen and etblue are lowest in ratlam 34 56 mm month 13 63 mm month district and highest in the bharuch 49 28 mm month 73 20 mm month table 3 district of the mahi basin we also calculated the blue water index bwi etblue etblue etgreen and green water index gwi etgreen etblue etgreen and the results are given in table 3 an index value of 1 shows that the crop yield is from irrigation only whereas an index of 0 indicates that precipitation is sufficient to achieve maximum crop yields johansson et al 2016 the bwi and gwi are found to vary from 0 282 to 0 598 and 0 40 0 72 the bwi is highest in the district of gujarat and the gwi is highest in the districts of madhya pradesh the higher value of bwi is an indication of the intensively irrigated agriculture in the basin districts the districts like bharuch anand kheda mahisagar panchmahal and vadodara are more dependent on the irrigation for their agricultural production than the other districts this the quantification of etblue and etgreen both spatial and temporal and will help identify the bwi hotspots districts for managing water in agriculture by adopting advanced irrigation technologies or by using less water requiring crops in those districts 5 3 spatial and temporal variability of lp and wp it is crucial to quantify the crop yields water consumption and wp for an efficient agricultural water management and sustaining food security in a basin the spatial and temporal quantification of these indicators helps identify the bright spots and hot spots to devise actionable goals the bright spots well performing crop fields are the regions or spots with the highest wp and lp and the hot spots poor performing crop fields are the regions or spots with the lowest wp and lp due to the complex land use land cover and hydrological processes involved the quantification and assessment of wp and lp are usually difficult especially at the regional scale ren et al 2021 these assessments require an understanding of the relationship between the hydrological variables such as e t i and other bio physical variables karimi et al 2013 safi et al 2022 such as lai npp and gpp secondly at the same time the field experiments and the regional observations are also scanty and are usually time consuming to collect the required data as discussed in the previous sections these limitations can be sorted out by using the newly developed wa framework which translates open source earth observation datasets to lp and wp for rainfed and irrigated agriculture individually using the budyko hypothesis and establishes the linkage between the hydrological and biophysical variables following this the wa framework is used for quantifying the wp and lp for the mahi basin at the district administrative scale the mathematical expressions for the estimation of lp and wp from irrigated and rainfed agriculture are discussed in section 4 2 6 wa reports these results in agricultural services or productivity sheet the spatial maps of the wp and lp are also developed in the wa framework which is very useful for identifying the bright spots and hot spots in the basin in the mahi basin the cereals are the major crop of the basin and are grown in both the seasons of rabi and kharif as mentioned in section 4 2 6 we took the representative crop as cereals to compute the lp and wp and other indicators the results show that the long term average lp of the irrigated and rainfed cereals is 2287 71 kg ha 1713 62 kg ha respectively from 2003 to 2020 table 4 similarly the long term average of wp of the irrigated and rainfed cereals is 0 721 kg m³ 0 483 kg m³ respectively from 2003 to 2020 fig 13 a b agricultural services sheets show the estimates of lp and wp for the year 2008 09 and 2016 17 individually as well as average for both therainfed and irrigated agriculture a close look at the agricultural services sheets fig 13a b shows that in case of the irrigated agriculture the estimation of the lp and wp is due to both rainfall and incremental irrigation whereas in case of the rainfed agriculture the estimates of lp and wp are due to rainfall only fig 14 a d shows the spatial variability district wise of wp and lp for rainfed and irrigated cereals in the mahi basin fig 15 shows the comparison of the wp and lp irrigated and rainfed both for all the districts of the mahi basin the district wise long term average of the lp and wp is also given in table 5 it can be inferred from fig 15 and table 5 that the districts such as anand bharuch vadodara dhar neemach jhabua and ratlam have higher lp irrigated more than 2300 kg ha with the highest value for ratlam 2573 96 kg ha than the other districts of the basin the lp irrigated is lowest for the aravali district of rajasthan than the other districts the districts falling in the state of madhya pradesh i e neemach jhabua alirajpur and the districts falling in the state of rajasthan i e udaipur chhataurgarh pratapgarh and others have higher lp rainfed than all the districts of gujarat the neemach district of madhya pradesh is found to have the highest lp rainfed 1948 13 kg ha followed by udaipur 1898 93 kg ha with the lowest value of lp for the kheda district 1526 79 kg ha of gujarat based on the lp estimates it is concluded that the ratlam and neemach districts of madhya pradesh have the highest lp for both irrigated and rainfed cereals fig 14c d fig 15 and also show the estimates of wp of the cereals irrigated and rainfed both for all the districts of the mahi basin the wp rainfed of all the districts of gujarat is comparatively lower varying from 0 34 kg m3 to 0 5 kg m3 than the districts of madhya pradesh varying from 0 59 kg m3 to 0 70 kg m3 and the rajasthan varying from 0 48 kg m3 to 0 73 kg m3 the pratapgarh district of rajasthan has the highest rainfed wp 0 73 kg m3 followed by ratlam 0 70 kg m3 of madhya pradesh the wp irrigated for all the districts of the mahi basin is also given in fig 14c d fig 15 and table 5 the wp irrigated of all five districts of madhya pradesh is found to vary from 1 46 kg m3 to 2 26 kg m3 followed by the districts of rajasthan varying from 0 79 kg m3 to 1 57 kg m3 and gujarat 0 44 kg m3 to 0 89 kg m3 these estimates of wp and lp irrigated and rainfed both can be further used for the classification of the districts of the mahi basin in bright spots district and hot spot district using the criteria given by safi et al 2022 for irrigated cereals the districts falling in the state of madhya pradesh have the highest lp and wp than the states of rajasthan and gujarat the ratlam and dhar districts report the highest wp irrigated and lp irrigated among all the districts and ratlam with the highest values of both wp and lp i e 2 14 kg m³ and 2573 96 kg ha respectively hence ratlam district is classified as the bright spot district similarly the anand district is found to have the lowest wp irrigated and is classified as the hot spot district as for as rainfed agriculture is concerned the districts falling in the state of madhya pradesh have the highest wp and lp followed by rajasthan and gujarat the neemuch district of madhya pradesh is classified as the bright spot district with wp and lp as 0 59 kg m3 and 1948 13 kg ha respectively and anand as the hot spot district with the lowest wp and lp as 0 34 kg m3 1572 21 kg ha respectively overall at the state level region level it can be stated the state of madhya pradesh is the bright spot state and gujarat as the hot spot state in irrigated and rainfed agriculture both 5 4 performance indicators the basin performance indicators such as transpiration fraction t et cao et al 2022 tong et al 2019 beneficial et fraction agricultural et fraction irrigated et fraction and food irrigation dependency karimi et al 2013a b plays an important role in assessing how do the water is being used in producing services such as in agriculture and sustaining ecosystem services along with this these indicators also indicate the coupling characteristics of the ecological and hydrological systems in a basin tong et al 2019 worth mentioning cao et al 2022 that the transpiration ratio t et also plays an important role in understanding the water cycle and land atmosphere interactions kool et al 2014 the ratio t et has great scientific and practical importance in sustainable development in the future tong et al 2019 these works show the importance of basin indicators for sustaining water resources and food security in a basin the estimated values of these indicators are given in table 6 the ratio t et also gives the fraction of et vaporized via plant leaves the managed et fraction represents gives the fraction of et through human interventions i e through mlu and mwu classes and help may help in saving water in agriculture the agricultural et reflects how intensively the water is being used in agriculture and irrigated et fraction reflects the contribution of irrigated agriculture to the et finally the food irrigation dependency reflects the dependency of the basin on irrigated agriculture for food production the long term average for the period of 2003 2020 of all indicators is shown in table 6 the higher the t et fraction better is the performance of the basin and for the mahi basin it is 40 and this indicates that there is a significantly lower amount of vegetation water consumption which in turn indicates that most of the water in the basin is depleted due to soil moisture evaporation and this is remarkable but unfavorable this necessitates for application of conservation practices and advanced irrigation technologies for reducing e from the basin the managed et fraction is 0 66 implying that human activities are controlling the water depletions largely in the basin the agricultural et fraction in the basin is 61 showing that agricultural activities consume the largest amount of water the reason for this is the basin s extremely large dependence on agricultural activities as the lulc map shows section 3 6 that there is 63 of agricultural land the irrigated et fraction for the basin is 55 representing that blue water incremental et consumption is contributing 55 to agriculture food irrigation dependency is about 90 which shows that food security is significantly influenced by the irrigation activities in the basin fig 16a shows the yearly variation of the performance indicators for the mahi basin out of these five indicators as mentioned herein and taken from karimi et al 2013 only the transpiration ratio t et has been a topic of much attention among researchers cao et al 2022 reported the values of t et varying between 0 52 and 0 61 across the world and found that lai vegetation water consumption is the most important factor controlling it in a basin coenders gerrits et al 2014 reported t et range of 0 35 0 80 tong et al 2019 quantified the t et ratio for different ecosystems and reported that the average t et is highest for the cropland ecosystem 0 80 followed by the alpine meadow ecosystem 0 79 the desert riparian forest 0 67 the desert riparian shrub ecosystem 0 67 0 06 and meadow 0 55 0 23 the lai was found to be the first order controlling factor on the t et ratio the t et ratio was also found to be different for different ecosystems in this study irrigated agriculture is found to have a lower value of t et ratio 0 40 as compared to the rainfed crops 0 45 as shown in fig 16b this reflects there is a need to either enhance the ecosystem productivity or apply controls on et process through reduced water supplies in terms of incremental irrigation the average transpiration fraction t et of different land uses is shown in fig 16b the t et is found to be highest for the grassland ecosystem 0 62 followed by shrublands 0 50 forest cover 0 45 and rainfed crops 0 45 irrigated crops 0 40 and least for the waterbodies 0 18 and built up 0 099 0 05 areas respectively the t et ratio is higher for rainfed agriculture 0 45 than the irrigated agriculture 0 40 however still it has a larger scope for improvements in both the cases i e for both rainfed and irrigated agriculture these indicators highlight the basin s performance in terms of ecosystem productivity and water services in the basin and possible improvements for efficient agricultural water management and sustaining food security in the basin 6 conclusions in this study we applied the newly developed wa framework for estimating the water consumption patterns in terms of etgreen and etblue for assessing the lp and wp in a semi arid mahi basin in india to formulate the actionable management plans for the stakeholders and policymakers we also partitioned et flux into e t and i flux as per the four major landuse and water classes and quantified the basin performance indicators for this purpose in this study we used freely available open source remote sensing datasets by assessing the spatial and temporal variability of both lp and lp at the administrative units districts in this case scale we classified these administrative units as bright spots and hot spots to help identify the causes behind what is affecting their performance in the basin the following conclusions are drawn from this study as the long term etgreen and etblue in the mahi basin are found to be 15 8 km3 year and 12 32 km3 year respectively in general the districts falling in the state of gujarat have the highest values of long term average annual etblue than the administrative units falling in the state of rajasthan and madhya pradesh the districts of gujarat such as bharuch anand and mahisagar have the highest values of long term average annual etblue i e 73 2 mm month 58 1 mm month and 51 9 mm month respectively than the districts of the rajasthan and madhya pradesh in the mahi basin the bwi and gwi in the mahi basin vary from 0 28 to 0 59and 0 40 0 71 the bwi is highest in the district of gujarat and the gwi is highest in the districts of madhya pradesh the higher value of bwi is an indication of the more dependency on irrigation for agricultural production and vice versa the long term average of lp and wp of the irrigated and rainfed cereals is found to be 2287 71 kg ha 1713 62 kg ha and 0 721 kg m³ 0 483 kg m³ respectively for the period of 2003 2020 the districts such as anand bharuch vadodara dhar neemach jhabua and ratlam have higher lp irrigated more than 2300 kg ha with the highest value for ratlam 2573 96 kg ha than the other districts of the basin the lp irrigated is lowest for the aravali district of rajasthan than the other districts the neemach district of madhya pradesh has the highest lp rainfed 1948 13 kg ha followed by udaipur 1898 93 kg ha with the lowest value of lp for the kheda district 1526 79 kg ha of gujarat the wp irrigated of all five districts of madhya pradesh is higher and vary from 1 46 kg m³ to 2 26 kg m³ than the districts of rajasthan varying from 0 79 kg m³ to 1 57 kg m³ and gujarat 0 44 kg m³to 0 89 kg m³ the wp rainfed of all the districts of gujarat is comparatively lower varying from 0 34 kg m³ to 0 50 kg m³ than the districts of madhya pradesh varying from 0 59 kg m³ to 0 70 kg m³ and the rajasthan varying from 0 48 kg m³ to 0 73 kg m³ as per the criteria are given by safi et al 2022 for classification of the districts as the bright spots district and hot spot district for irrigated cereals the ratlam district is found to have both high lp and wp as 2573 96 kg ha and 2 14 kg m3 respectively among all the districts of the mahi basin and hence the ratlam district is classified as the bright spot district similarly the anand district is found to have the lowest wp 0 44 kg m3 and the lp as 2467 51 kg ha and hence it is classified as the hot spot district as per the criteria are given by safi et al 2022 for classification of the districts as the bright spots district and hot spot district for rainfed cereals the neemuch district of madhya pradesh is classified as the bright spot district with wp and lp as 0 59 kg m3 and 1948 13 kg ha respectively and anand as the hot spot district with the lowest wp as 0 34 kg m3 and lp as 1572 21 kg ha respectively overall at the state level region level the results show that the state of madhya pradesh is the bright spot state and gujarat as the hot spot state for irrigated and rainfed agriculture both 7 limitations of wa technique despite wa s strong performance one of the major limitations of wa technique is its reliance on satellite based remote sensing datasets due to the unavailability of the observed datasets such as et npp gpp irrigated and rainfed crop maps and others in many parts of the developing world e g india the satellite data are prone to inaccuracy because they are used to estimate hydrological processes indirectly hence attention should be taken to enriching the satellite datasets through validation and ensemble processes e g et ensemble products by using satellite and observed et datasets during applications wa estimates of wp and lp are highly dependent on the irrigated and rainfed crop map of the basin this necessitates for field surveys of cropping patterns for enhanced performance finally the wa based lulc map walu needs to be customized for local conditions say region specific as the many classes out of 80 classes are not applicable to all the regions of the world we took the cereals as the major crop class in the basin as without segregating them into wheat and paddy due to the absence of a detailed and accurate crop map area of the mahi basin this aspect also needs a major refinement to estimate crop wise lp and wp in the basin salvadore et al 2020 also emphasized and accurate and detailed crop map of the basin to estimate the crop wise yield productivity heavy dependence of the wa technique on the satellite datasets limits this technique s applicability to future assessments incorporating climate change scenarios the wa technique does not have the snow glacier component and this limits its applicability to the glacier basins 8 future scope of research in arid and semi arid regions agricultural activities have the largest proportion of the water consumption and therefore this study was formulated to estimate the green and blue water consumption etblue and etgreen and assess the spatial and temporal variability of the wp and lp to identify the bright spots and hot spots at the district administrative unit level for effectively managing the scarce water resources and sustaining food security in highly non resilient basin of india the findings will ultimately help formulate the actionable management plans to the stakeholders and policymakers of the mahi basin however to address the limitations of the wa technique as discussed above this technique should be coupled with a hydrological model say soil and water assessment tool swat and spatial processes in hydrology sphy model to address the current and future status of the water availability demand and supply scenarios this ensemble modelling framework wa coupled with the swat and sphy may also include the socio economic aspects in the devising of actionable water management plans 9 recommendations suggestions as the wp both irrigated and rainfed of the districts of gujarat such as anand vadodara kheda and bharuch is lower than that of the districts of madhya pradesh and rajasthan in the mahi basin and hence advanced irrigation techniques coupled with the crop diversification adopting the technological and agronomical interventions of the bright spot districts such as ratlam and neemach to increase the wp without effecting the lp of these hot spot districts the higher values of bwi are an indication of the more dependency on irrigation for agricultural production and hence efforts should be made to incentivize the farmers for crop diversification and shifting from more water intensive crops to less water intensive crops these findings can be taken as baseline for developing

9131,drought adversely affects crop production in areas with water shortages in such areas various methods need to be implemented to alleviate the effect of water stress on plants nitric oxide no is an important plant growth regulator that affects various physiological processes in this study we determined ways to increase water stress tolerance of lettuce by applying exogenous sodium nitroprusside snp a donor of no in total 12 treatments were administered including three snp doses 0 50 and 100 µm and four levels of irrigation i100 i80 i60 and i40 an increase in the doses of no partially increased the water consumption of lettuce under full and deficit irrigation conditions the highest water consumption 125 1 mm and the highest yield 39 1 t ha were recorded for lettuce plants that were administered the i10 0 treatment with 100 µm snp snp significantly increased the lettuce yield and irrigation water productivity iwp under deficit irrigation and full irrigation snp promoted chlorophyll synthesis by increasing photosynthesis the application of 100 µm snp increased catalase cat activity approximately three times compared to cat activity in the control group and it also significantly increased peroxidase pod activity additionally high doses of snp reduced membrane damage in lettuce leaves these results indicated that under water stress exogenous no improves photosynthesis by increasing chlorophyll synthesis activates antioxidant enzymes such as cat and pod protects lettuce against oxidative damage and increases irrigation water productivity thus increasing the yield keywords deficit irrigation enzyme activity lactuca sativa nitric oxide water productivity yield response factor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plant growth is adversely affected by abiotic stress factors such as drought salinity flood alkalinity and extremes of temperature the severity and duration of these stress factors may vary greatly teklić et al 2021 due to the effects of global warming abiotic stress factors have led to a reduction in yield by up to 50 in agricultural areas godoy et al 2021 sachdev et al 2021 an increase in the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere has increased surface temperatures and irregularities in the precipitation regime gray et al 2016 an increase in the surface temperature by 1 c increases the quantity of water needed by the plant by 4 4 5 ye et al 2015 shah et al 2019 water scarcity strongly limits agricultural production in areas with water shortages and causes yield losses naeem et al 2018 yavuz et al 2020 although low intensity droughts slightly affect plant growth droughts of moderate and high intensities decrease photosynthesis rate inhibit plant growth by causing morphological and physiological damages and decrease crop yield considerably rahman et al 2021 sun et al 2021 additionally the lack of water in the plant root zone prevents the uptake of nutrients from the soil by the roots which in turn causes nutrient deficiency in the plant razmjoo et al 2008 hosseini et al 2021 plants have developed several mechanisms to alleviate of the negative effects of water stress during stress many defense mechanisms such as reduction in growth shrinkage of vegetative parts thickening of the leaves synthesis of osmolyte reduction in the water potential and changes in the root architecture are activated if the duration and severity of water stress increase roots shrink leading to nutritional deficiency and deterioration of water balance as well as the formation of reactive oxygen species ros which disrupts membrane and protein functions takahashi et al 2021 ros are produced from molecular oxygen and have different origins apoplastic ros are produced by the respiratory burst oxidase homolog rboh proteins located in the plasma membrane these proteins produce superoxide anions o2 the short lived o2 radical is converted to non radical hydrogen peroxide h2o2 either spontaneously or by ascorbate peroxidases apx or superoxide dismutase sod under stress the cellular ros balance is disrupted which impairs photosynthetic electron transport rate and photochemical efficiency of psii resulting in leaf senescence inhibition of plant growth and a decrease in yield sasidharan et al 2018 elkelish et al 2020 nitrite oxide no is a volatile lipophilic free radical and is a signal molecule produced as a physiological response it exhibits antioxidant effects under stress oz et al 2015 ekinci et al 2020 kaya et al 2020a no reduces the ros related negative effects of stress by inducing transcriptional changes in targets involved in ros metabolism under stress del castello et al 2019 no prevents or reduces the accumulation of ros by activating antioxidant enzymes and prevents oxidative damage by reducing the levels of superoxide anions hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and lipid free radicals hu et al 2007 additionally applying no increases plant growth chlorophyll content and leaf relative water content lrwc maintains photosynthesis increases lipoxygenase activity and reduces membrane ion leakage xiong et al 2012 sánchez romera et al 2018 lau et al 2021 sodium nitroprusside snp a donor of no applied to plants reduces the negative effects of drought by reducing transpiration and ion leakage preventing leaf water loss and activating stomatal closure simontacchi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 hamurcu et al 2020 lettuce is grown in many parts of the world and is consumed extensively due to its low calorie and high nutritional content yavuz et al 2021 it has high content of fiber iron and vitamin c ketnawa et al 2020 the annual production of lettuce in the world is approximately 29 1 million tons and china 16 3 million tons india 1 3 million tons and spain 1 million tons are the biggest producers anon 2021 lettuce lactuca sativa l is usually grown in open fields in spring and autumn and greenhouses in winter the water content of curly lettuce is higher than that of other lettuce varieties short term water deficit causes lettuce to become bitter or dry out and lose its economic importance on the other hand high levels of moisture in the air and soil in the greenhouse cause root collar rot where the transmission bundles are blocked leading to the death of the plants the emergence and rapid spread of this disease in irregularly irrigated plants lead to a considerable decrease in crop yield hence determining an appropriate irrigation program is important for farming curly lettuce many studies have investigated the effectiveness of snp in lettuce such as those on cadmium toxicity xu et al 2014 2015 arsenic toxicity silveira et al 2015 cobalt toxicity samet 2020 ultraviolet b radiation stress esringu et al 2016 and temperature light stress deng and song 2012 however comprehensive studies on the efficacy of snp in lettuce under water stress are limited therefore in this study we determined the effects of different doses of snp on agronomic physiological and antioxidant enzyme activities in curly lettuce lactuca sativa l var crispa under deficit irrigation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted in winter between 13 december 2021 and 7 march 2022 in a glass greenhouse belonging to the selçuk university faculty of agriculture in konya turkey the data on the climate of the area where the greenhouse was located were recorded every hour by the automatic climate station installed in the greenhouse during the study 85 days the temperature inside the greenhouse varied between 1 7 and 40 8 c average temperature 17 4 c fig 1 the maximum relative humidity in the greenhouse was 66 8 and the average relative humidity was 43 8 during the trial period fig 1 the soil in the plant root zone 40 cm deep belonged to the clay loam class and the organic matter content of the soil was 2 43 the field capacity fc and wilting point wp moisture values of the soil were 33 4 and 17 0 respectively the water used for irrigation was taken from the selçuk university water distribution network and the quality of the water was determined as c2s1 the soil and the irrigation water used were suitable for lettuce cultivation 2 2 irrigation system plant material and experimental treatments before planting the seedlings a drip irrigation system 16 mm in diameter was installed with a dripper spacing of 33 cm and a flow rate of 4 l h in the greenhouse next 8 seedlings m2 50 cm row spacing and 25 cm row above were planted on 13 december 2021 one drip irrigation pipe was provided to each lettuce row and each plot was 5 m long the caipira variety was used in this experiment as it is the preferred variety for curly lettuce cultivation caipira is a commercial and high yielding variety with good leaf quality and market value and thus it is preferred by farmers in total 12 treatments including three nitric oxide doses no0 control no50 50 µm snp and no100 100 µm snp and four irrigation levels i100 i80 i60 and i40 were administered based on a factorial design with three replicates the sodium nitroprusside snp a donor of no sigma treatment was applied on february 6 54 dap days after planting in the vegetation period cycle no50 and no100 doses were calculated and dissolved in distilled water and applied as a spray to cover all aboveground parts of the plants in the no0 control treatment pure water was sprayed on the plants 2 3 measuring the soil moisture content the pr2 6 profile probe delta t and access tubes were used to determine the moisture content the profile probe was calibrated based on the soil moisture values measured by the gravimetric method the soil moisture values were measured from the surface to a depth of 1 m using a profile probe after the irrigation started on january 7 26 dap soil moisture was measured at least twice a week until harvest 2 4 calculation of irrigation water for treatments the depth of the irrigation water to be used for treatment was calculated based on the changes in the soil moisture in the no0i100 treatment and using eq 1 the moisture content was measured with a profile probe up to a depth of 1 m but no change in soil moisture was recorded during the trial period after the first 40 cm i e from 40 to 100 cm thus soil moisture values at a depth of 0 40 cm were used to calculate the volume of irrigation water when the total available water taw in the 0 40 cm region of the no0i100 treatment decreased by approximately 30 the moisture in the soil was replenished to the field capacity by irrigation 1 d n t k v m n v d 10 dn irrigation water depth mm tkv soil moisture in field capacity m3 m3 mnv soil moisture in treatment no0i100 before irrigations m3 m3 d plant root

percolation mm δs change in the soil moisture content mm the value of i in the equation was obtained from the applied irrigation water depth and the values of δs were obtained from the soil moisture measurements the value of dp was ignored in the calculations since no seepage was measured below the 0 40 cm root zone 2 6 yield response factor ky and irrigation water productivity iwp the yield response factor ky which indicates the relationship between the quantity of water consumed by the plants and the crop yield was determined using the equation developed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 the irrigation water productivity iwp expressed as unit water utilization rate was determined using eq 4 4 i w p e y i v iwp irrigation water productivity kg m3 ey lettuce yield kg ha iv volume of irrigation water per ha m3 ha 2 7 growth parameters the height of the plant and the number of leaves were recorded from 10 plants just before harvest the surface areas of five fully developed leaves were calculated using the winfolia computer program i̇pek et al 2014 the harvested plants were weighed and the yield t ha per unit area was determined then the underground roots were removed and cleaned and the fresh weight per plant was determined the samples were placed in an oven and dried at 65 c for 72 h and their dry weights were recorded the amount of underground and above ground dry matter was calculated as a percentage seymen 2021 2 8 physiological parameters the proportional water content in leaves was determined according to the methods described by kaya et al 2003 to determine membrane damage md three discs of 1 cm2 were taken from the lettuce leaves these discs were shaken in 10 ml of distilled water at room temperature for 24 h in a shaker then the ec values ec1 of the samples were measured using ec meters after the samples were autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min they were cooled to room temperature then the second ec ec2 values of the samples were measured and the membrane damage was calculated using eq 5 lutts et al 1996 5 md ec 1 ec 2 x 100 2 9 pigment and carotenoid content after harvesting 0 2 g of the lettuce leaf samples stored at 20 c were weighed and ground in 10 ml of acetone the samples were centrifuged and precipitated in 2 ml tubes and the supernatant was collected and measured using a shimadzu uv1900i spectrophotometer at 663 652 and 645 nm the data were analyzed using the formula developed by lichtenthaler and buschmann 2001 to determine the contents of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll the jaspars formula developed by witham et al 1971 was used to determine the carotenoid content 2 10 determination of the carbohydrate content the carbohydrate content was determined following the method described by herbert et al 1971 briefly 0 1 g of the sample was taken and extracted in 10 and 5 ml of naoh respectively and after 10 min the protein was extracted the residues were washed with water and extracted with h2so4 for 30 min at room temperature after the samples were diluted 1 ml of 5 phenol was added to 1 ml of the sample then 5 ml of h2so4 was mixed and kept at room temperature for 30 min finally the mixture was measured at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer and the total carbohydrate content was calculated 2 11 mda and h2o2 content the method developed by heath and packer 1968 was used for determining the malondialdehyde mda content to determine the concentration of h2o2 0 2 g of leaf tissue sample was incubated with 5 ml of 0 1 tca and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min velikova et al 2000 then 0 5 ml of the obtained superficial residue was taken and added to a mixture of 0 5 ml of phosphate buffer ph 7 0 and 1 ml of 1 m ki the transmittance of the mixture was read at 390 nm and the concentration of h2o2 was calculated using the formula obtained from the standard graph 2 12 protein and proline content the lettuce leaf samples 0 5 g were weighed and crushed in a 0 05 m phosphate solution the homogenate was transferred into the centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 20 min then 0 2 ml of the phase formed at the top of the tube was taken and mixed with 3 ml of bradford buffer solution the protein content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer the protein content in the leaves was calculated based on a standard graph bradford 1976 to determine the proline content the acid ninhydrin method developed by bates et al 1973 was used 2 13 antioxidant enzyme activity to determine the enzyme activity 1 g of leaf tissue was weighed and ground in a porcelain mortar with liquid nitrogen until it turned into a powder the pod activity was determined based on the increase in absorbance at 470 nm caused by the colored compound which was formed by the reaction between guaiacol and h2o2 angelini and federico 1989 the method proposed by agarwal and pandey 2004 was used to determine the sod activity the method of havir and mchale 1987 was used to measure the cat activity 2 14 chlorophyll fluorescence and stomatal conductance before harvesting the lettuce chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a portable li 600 porometer fluorometer li 600 licor biosciences inc lincoln ne usa from old and fully developed leaves at noon between 10 00 and 12 00 on sunny days mathobo et al 2017 the photosynthesis efficiency psii and stomatal conductance gs were measured under bright conditions whereas chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm maximum quantum yield fm f0 fm was measured from plants that were kept in the dark for 1 h shin et al 2021 2 15 statistical analysis all data obtained from treatments were analyzed by using the spss version 22 0 computer program first data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova and then the results were tested at the 5 significance level according to duncan s multiple comparison test to determine statistically significant differences between means of different groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content irrigation depth and evapotranspiration et the soil moisture was measured regularly and the data are shown in fig 2 the moisture was measured from 0 10 to 1 00 m below the soil surface using a profile probe moisture measuring device but no changes in the moisture were recorded below 40 cm under full and deficit irrigation conditions thus the lettuce plants consumed water from the first 40 cm of soil below the surface therefore only the soil moisture changes from 0 to 40 cm below the soil surface are shown in the fig 2 the soil moisture values changed between fc and wp during the vegetation period of lettuce lower soil moisture values were recorded in water stress treatments but soil moisture did not fall below the wilting point wp even at the i40 irrigation level under 60 water stress fig 2 irrigation water was applied to the treatments six times during the vegetation period fig 2 and the total quantity of water applied varied between 53 7 mm i40 and 111 8 mm i100 according to the treatments table 1 although the increase in water stress decreased the water consumption of lettuce this decrease was lower than the decrease in the quantity of irrigation water this was due to the presence of high moisture in the soil at the time of planting such that the variation in the soil moisture content δs between planting and harvesting was between 30 4 and 40 5 mm depending on the applied dose of no for the plants in the i40 treatment group on the other hand increasing the dose of no partially increased the water consumption of lettuce under full and deficit irrigation conditions with the highest water consumption of 125 1 mm measured in the no100i100 treatment group table 1 in some studies conducted in open field conditions the water consumption of lettuce varied between 135 1 and 254 6 mm kuslu et al 2008 and 337 and 413 mm karam et al 2002 depending on the treatments on the other hand in studies where experiments were conducted in glass greenhouses the water consumption of lettuce under full irrigation conditions was 115 mm yıldırım et al 2015 and 125 mm kırnak et al 2016 oliveira et al 2005 reported that the water consumption of lettuce was 117 mm for the plants irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation the water consumption of lettuce differed in the greenhouse and under open field conditions our results concerning plant water consumption were similar to those of other studies conducted in greenhouses 3 2 lettuce yield and yield components the effects of the application of snp on the yield and yield components under full and deficit irrigation conditions are presented in table 2 based on the average values we found that an increase in the dose of snp significantly increased the lettuce yield table 2 however the treatments with moderate water stress i60 treatment and severe water stress i40 treatment were associated with a significant decrease in yield the interaction between the dose of snp and water stress significantly affected the yield the highest lettuce yield of 39 1 t ha was recorded for the no100i100 treatment and there was no significant difference between these plants and those in the no100i80 and no50i100 treatment groups on the other hand the lettuce yield was 28 4 t ha in the no0i100 treatment group control no snp application and fully irrigated while the yield was 28 1 t ha in the no100i40 treatment group these results showed that the application of snp to lettuce had positive effects on the yield under full and deficit irrigation conditions similarly snp increased yield components such as head height and leaf area in lettuce but it did not significantly affect the number of leaves and the dry matter content although an increase in water stress caused a decrease in the head height leaf area and leaf number per plant it caused a proportional increase in dry matter content water stress causes a significant decrease in lettuce yield rashid 2021 yavuz et al 2021 yıldırım et al 2015 kuslu et al 2008 the results of this study indicated that nitric oxide application can reduce the effect of water stress and increase the yield of lettuce under limited irrigation conditions nitric oxide no acts as a potent biostimulant in plants under stress fancy et al 2017 it helps plants to cope with different types of abiotic stress such as iron deficiency shanmugam et al 2015 kaya et al 2020b salinity ahanger et al 2019 ahmad et al 2016 2018 ragaey et al 2022 and water stress cechin et al 2015 kaya et al 2019 sadak 2022 sodium nitroprusside snp as an exogenous no donor was shown to alleviate the negative effects of water stress on plants hajihashemi 2021 yıldıztugay et al 2014 3 3 colour pigments chlorophyll carotenoid protein and carbohydrate contents increasing the dose of no significantly increased the content of chl a chl b total chl and car carotenoid and the highest values were recorded from the plants in which 100 µm snp was applied table 3 an increase in the water stress caused a significant decrease in the content of chl a chl b and total chl but a significant increase in the content of car when the interaction between the dose of no and the irrigation were examined the highest content of chl a chl b and total chl was recorded for the no100i100 and no50i100 treatments snp applied under deficit irrigation conditions significantly increased the color pigments of lettuce compared to water stress treatments without the application of snp thus the application of 50 and 100 µm snp at i40 and i60 irrigation levels exposed to severe and moderate water stress resulted in a significant increase in the chlorophyll content some researchers argue that the decrease in the chlorophyll a and b content under stress is due to a reduction in the metabolic activities of plants foyer and shigeoka 2011 the chlorophyll content of plants reflects the state of photosynthetic activity which is sensitive to stress kalaji et al 2016 kaya et al 2019 in studies on the water deficit stress of various plants the chlorophyll content was found to decrease as the severity of stress increased seymen 2021 jabeen et al 2019 yavuz et al 2021 kaya et al 2019 yasmeen et al 2013 akram et al 2016 however no significantly increases the chl a and b content in plants under water stress in a study on saffron grown under deficit irrigation conditions no was found to have a supportive effect on the content of chl a and b in plants under water stress hajihashemi 2021 similarly no was found to play a critical role in the recovery of chlorophyll under water stress kaya et al 2019 nitric oxide can increase the tolerance of plants to environmental stress by activating antioxidant systems such as car kaya et al 2020a yıldıztugay et al 2014 in our study an increase in the dose of no significantly increased the content of car in lettuce leaves an increase in water stress also caused an increase in the content of car the content of car was reported to increase in lettuce yavuz et al 2021 basahi et al 2014 and spinach seymen 2021 xu and leskovar 2015 under stress the treatment of lettuce with snp caused a significant decrease in the water soluble carbohydrate wsc content and the proline content table 3 however an increase in water stress caused a significant increase in the content of proline and wsc in lettuce leaves due to the production and accumulation of osmotic solutions such as proline and wsc plants try to avoid the negative effects of drought stress gholami and zahedi 2019 additionally the negative effects of water stress can be mitigated through the transport of soluble compounds such as proline and carbohydrates from the roots to the leaves zahedi et al 2019 similar to our findings an increase in water stress was found in another study to increase the sugar content in soybeans du et al 2020 soluble substances such as organic acids free amino acids and carbohydrates increase in flax plants under drought stress rashwan and abdelaal 2019 similar to our findings the content of carbohydrates and proline in strawberry leaves was found to increase with an increase in drought stress zahedi et al 2020 drought resistant wheat genotypes have higher wsc concentrations than susceptible ones goggin and setter 2004 yang et al 2007 when the interaction between the dose of no and water stress was examined in our study the highest wsc values were found at i80 i60 and i40 irrigation levels in the absence of snp in contrast the application of 100 µm snp resulted in a decrease in the wsc content under full and deficit irrigation conditions these results showed that snp can reduce the negative effects of water stress in lettuce 3 4 enzyme activities and malondialdehyde and h2o2 concentrations the application of exogenous snp significantly increased the cat and pod levels in lettuce table 4 however an increase in the dose of snp significantly decreased the sod enzyme activity regarding irrigation the highest cat pod and sod levels were found in the i40 treatments in which the plants were under the greatest water stress intracellular antioxidant enzymes protect plants under stress in general sod catalyzes the conversion of superoxide to h2o2 and o2 pod helps to detect reactive oxygen species ros and cat helps to eliminate ros kalefetoğlu and ekmekci 2005 demiral 2003 mittler 2002 the enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms reduce the damage caused by ros in plants under water stress naveed et al 2014 yavuz et al 2022 kayak et al 2022 additionally the application of exogenous snp can reduce oxidative damage and improve antioxidant enzyme activities in plants under water stress garcı a mata and lamattina 2001 tan et al 2008 gan et al 2015 ekinci et al 2020 our results showed that enzymes such as cat and pod increase significantly after the application of snp in plants under water stress and provide support to the defense system an increase in water stress increased the content of the compounds that cause oxidative damage such as malondialdehyde mda and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 table 4 stress causes the overproduction of ros which damages lipid membranes and increases the mda content perveen et al 2013 water stress also increases the concentration of h2o2 in lettuce basahi et al 2014 in this study the application of snp did not decrease the levels of mda and h2o2 but instead caused a slight increase 3 5 membrane damage lrwc stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence in lettuce leaf under water stress the highest membrane damage of 17 7 occurred in the plants of the i40 treatment group where severe water stress was applied table 5 the extent of membrane damage was not significantly different among the plants in the i100 i80 and i60 treatment groups similar to our findings other studies found that the greatest extent of membrane damage occurred under severe water stress in spinach seymen 2021 and lettuce yavuz et al 2021 the leaf relative water content lrwc decreased as membrane damage increased in lettuce leaves table 5 the highest lrwc values average 81 3 were recorded in plants that were in the i100 treatment group on the other hand the average value of lrwc was 71 for the plants in the i40 treatment group the application of snp did not alter membrane damage or lrwc in lettuce an increase in water stress decreased stomatal conductance gs and chlorophyll fluorescence phi ps2 and fv fm however the results of duncan s test concerning the gs and fv fm maximum quantum yield values did not differ significantly between the fully irrigated i100 and mild water stress i80 treatments under water stress plants cope with drought by closing their stomata which leads to a decrease in stomatal conductance in our study the application of no under full and deficit irrigation conditions did not improve the stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence rates of lettuce in some studies no was found to decrease rather than increase stomatal conductance ekinci et al 2020 exogenous no can also induce stomatal closure under drought stress depending on the applied dose neill et al 2002 garcı a mata and lamattina 2001 no has different effects under different environmental and plant conditions certain doses of exogenous no can increase the stomatal conductance of vicia faba leaves sakihama et al 2003 3 6 water yield relationships we determined the relationships between lettuce yield and evapotranspiration et and the results are shown in fig 3 quadratic polynomial relationships were found between lettuce yield and et p 0 01 and the coefficients of determination r2 and equations are shown in the fig 3 in the study the yield response factor ky was calculated for different doses of no to determine the effect of the decrease in et on the yield and the results are shown in fig 4 the ky values for lettuce ranged from 0 70 non snp to 1 13 100 µm snp when ky is greater than 1 the plant is sensitive to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1979 the lettuce grown in the greenhouse and treated with 50 and 100 µm snp showed a greater decrease in the yield than the plants in the control no snp treatment group under water stress when the lettuce yields were examined table 2 the differences in the yields between fully irrigated i100 and severely water stressed i40 treatment groups were found to be 7 3 14 5 and 11 0 t ha for the control no snp 50 µm snp and 100 µm snp doses respectively the results of irrigation water productivity iwp an indicator of the contribution of unit water to yield are shown in fig 5 the iwp values for the plants in the control group no snp varied between 25 4 and 39 2 kg m3 and the iwp values increased with an increase in water stress the iwp values were 23 0 and 28 4 higher after treatment with 50 and 100 µm snp respectively compared to the iwp values without snp treatment similar to our findings a study showed that 100 µm snp applied to soybean increased water use efficiency de sousa et al 2020 stomatal closure a response to water stress can reduce transpiration and also increase water use efficiency martins et al 2016 some studies have shown that no can increase plant tolerance to water stress as it is involved in signaling pathways associated with stomatal closure joudoi et al 2013 sun et al 2017 our results showed that snp applied to lettuce significantly increased irrigation water productivity under deficit and full irrigation conditions 4 conclusions in this study we determined the effectiveness of different doses of no under full and deficit irrigation conditions in alleviating the effect of water stress increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and improving growth parameters in lettuce our results showed that applying 50 and 100 µm snp under full irrigation i100 conditions caused a 32 3 and 37 6 increase in the lettuce yield respectively compared to no snp treatment additionally snp contributed to an increase in the yield under deficit irrigation conditions this effect was more pronounced at the i80 treatment under mild water stress and the yield between this application and that at the i100 irrigation level did not differ significantly the application of no increased the yield components such as head height leaf area and the number of leaves the

9131,drought adversely affects crop production in areas with water shortages in such areas various methods need to be implemented to alleviate the effect of water stress on plants nitric oxide no is an important plant growth regulator that affects various physiological processes in this study we determined ways to increase water stress tolerance of lettuce by applying exogenous sodium nitroprusside snp a donor of no in total 12 treatments were administered including three snp doses 0 50 and 100 µm and four levels of irrigation i100 i80 i60 and i40 an increase in the doses of no partially increased the water consumption of lettuce under full and deficit irrigation conditions the highest water consumption 125 1 mm and the highest yield 39 1 t ha were recorded for lettuce plants that were administered the i10 0 treatment with 100 µm snp snp significantly increased the lettuce yield and irrigation water productivity iwp under deficit irrigation and full irrigation snp promoted chlorophyll synthesis by increasing photosynthesis the application of 100 µm snp increased catalase cat activity approximately three times compared to cat activity in the control group and it also significantly increased peroxidase pod activity additionally high doses of snp reduced membrane damage in lettuce leaves these results indicated that under water stress exogenous no improves photosynthesis by increasing chlorophyll synthesis activates antioxidant enzymes such as cat and pod protects lettuce against oxidative damage and increases irrigation water productivity thus increasing the yield keywords deficit irrigation enzyme activity lactuca sativa nitric oxide water productivity yield response factor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plant growth is adversely affected by abiotic stress factors such as drought salinity flood alkalinity and extremes of temperature the severity and duration of these stress factors may vary greatly teklić et al 2021 due to the effects of global warming abiotic stress factors have led to a reduction in yield by up to 50 in agricultural areas godoy et al 2021 sachdev et al 2021 an increase in the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere has increased surface temperatures and irregularities in the precipitation regime gray et al 2016 an increase in the surface temperature by 1 c increases the quantity of water needed by the plant by 4 4 5 ye et al 2015 shah et al 2019 water scarcity strongly limits agricultural production in areas with water shortages and causes yield losses naeem et al 2018 yavuz et al 2020 although low intensity droughts slightly affect plant growth droughts of moderate and high intensities decrease photosynthesis rate inhibit plant growth by causing morphological and physiological damages and decrease crop yield considerably rahman et al 2021 sun et al 2021 additionally the lack of water in the plant root zone prevents the uptake of nutrients from the soil by the roots which in turn causes nutrient deficiency in the plant razmjoo et al 2008 hosseini et al 2021 plants have developed several mechanisms to alleviate of the negative effects of water stress during stress many defense mechanisms such as reduction in growth shrinkage of vegetative parts thickening of the leaves synthesis of osmolyte reduction in the water potential and changes in the root architecture are activated if the duration and severity of water stress increase roots shrink leading to nutritional deficiency and deterioration of water balance as well as the formation of reactive oxygen species ros which disrupts membrane and protein functions takahashi et al 2021 ros are produced from molecular oxygen and have different origins apoplastic ros are produced by the respiratory burst oxidase homolog rboh proteins located in the plasma membrane these proteins produce superoxide anions o2 the short lived o2 radical is converted to non radical hydrogen peroxide h2o2 either spontaneously or by ascorbate peroxidases apx or superoxide dismutase sod under stress the cellular ros balance is disrupted which impairs photosynthetic electron transport rate and photochemical efficiency of psii resulting in leaf senescence inhibition of plant growth and a decrease in yield sasidharan et al 2018 elkelish et al 2020 nitrite oxide no is a volatile lipophilic free radical and is a signal molecule produced as a physiological response it exhibits antioxidant effects under stress oz et al 2015 ekinci et al 2020 kaya et al 2020a no reduces the ros related negative effects of stress by inducing transcriptional changes in targets involved in ros metabolism under stress del castello et al 2019 no prevents or reduces the accumulation of ros by activating antioxidant enzymes and prevents oxidative damage by reducing the levels of superoxide anions hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and lipid free radicals hu et al 2007 additionally applying no increases plant growth chlorophyll content and leaf relative water content lrwc maintains photosynthesis increases lipoxygenase activity and reduces membrane ion leakage xiong et al 2012 sánchez romera et al 2018 lau et al 2021 sodium nitroprusside snp a donor of no applied to plants reduces the negative effects of drought by reducing transpiration and ion leakage preventing leaf water loss and activating stomatal closure simontacchi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 hamurcu et al 2020 lettuce is grown in many parts of the world and is consumed extensively due to its low calorie and high nutritional content yavuz et al 2021 it has high content of fiber iron and vitamin c ketnawa et al 2020 the annual production of lettuce in the world is approximately 29 1 million tons and china 16 3 million tons india 1 3 million tons and spain 1 million tons are the biggest producers anon 2021 lettuce lactuca sativa l is usually grown in open fields in spring and autumn and greenhouses in winter the water content of curly lettuce is higher than that of other lettuce varieties short term water deficit causes lettuce to become bitter or dry out and lose its economic importance on the other hand high levels of moisture in the air and soil in the greenhouse cause root collar rot where the transmission bundles are blocked leading to the death of the plants the emergence and rapid spread of this disease in irregularly irrigated plants lead to a considerable decrease in crop yield hence determining an appropriate irrigation program is important for farming curly lettuce many studies have investigated the effectiveness of snp in lettuce such as those on cadmium toxicity xu et al 2014 2015 arsenic toxicity silveira et al 2015 cobalt toxicity samet 2020 ultraviolet b radiation stress esringu et al 2016 and temperature light stress deng and song 2012 however comprehensive studies on the efficacy of snp in lettuce under water stress are limited therefore in this study we determined the effects of different doses of snp on agronomic physiological and antioxidant enzyme activities in curly lettuce lactuca sativa l var crispa under deficit irrigation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted in winter between 13 december 2021 and 7 march 2022 in a glass greenhouse belonging to the selçuk university faculty of agriculture in konya turkey the data on the climate of the area where the greenhouse was located were recorded every hour by the automatic climate station installed in the greenhouse during the study 85 days the temperature inside the greenhouse varied between 1 7 and 40 8 c average temperature 17 4 c fig 1 the maximum relative humidity in the greenhouse was 66 8 and the average relative humidity was 43 8 during the trial period fig 1 the soil in the plant root zone 40 cm deep belonged to the clay loam class and the organic matter content of the soil was 2 43 the field capacity fc and wilting point wp moisture values of the soil were 33 4 and 17 0 respectively the water used for irrigation was taken from the selçuk university water distribution network and the quality of the water was determined as c2s1 the soil and the irrigation water used were suitable for lettuce cultivation 2 2 irrigation system plant material and experimental treatments before planting the seedlings a drip irrigation system 16 mm in diameter was installed with a dripper spacing of 33 cm and a flow rate of 4 l h in the greenhouse next 8 seedlings m2 50 cm row spacing and 25 cm row above were planted on 13 december 2021 one drip irrigation pipe was provided to each lettuce row and each plot was 5 m long the caipira variety was used in this experiment as it is the preferred variety for curly lettuce cultivation caipira is a commercial and high yielding variety with good leaf quality and market value and thus it is preferred by farmers in total 12 treatments including three nitric oxide doses no0 control no50 50 µm snp and no100 100 µm snp and four irrigation levels i100 i80 i60 and i40 were administered based on a factorial design with three replicates the sodium nitroprusside snp a donor of no sigma treatment was applied on february 6 54 dap days after planting in the vegetation period cycle no50 and no100 doses were calculated and dissolved in distilled water and applied as a spray to cover all aboveground parts of the plants in the no0 control treatment pure water was sprayed on the plants 2 3 measuring the soil moisture content the pr2 6 profile probe delta t and access tubes were used to determine the moisture content the profile probe was calibrated based on the soil moisture values measured by the gravimetric method the soil moisture values were measured from the surface to a depth of 1 m using a profile probe after the irrigation started on january 7 26 dap soil moisture was measured at least twice a week until harvest 2 4 calculation of irrigation water for treatments the depth of the irrigation water to be used for treatment was calculated based on the changes in the soil moisture in the no0i100 treatment and using eq 1 the moisture content was measured with a profile probe up to a depth of 1 m but no change in soil moisture was recorded during the trial period after the first 40 cm i e from 40 to 100 cm thus soil moisture values at a depth of 0 40 cm were used to calculate the volume of irrigation water when the total available water taw in the 0 40 cm region of the no0i100 treatment decreased by approximately 30 the moisture in the soil was replenished to the field capacity by irrigation 1 d n t k v m n v d 10 dn irrigation water depth mm tkv soil moisture in field capacity m3 m3 mnv soil moisture in treatment no0i100 before irrigations m3 m3 d plant root

percolation mm δs change in the soil moisture content mm the value of i in the equation was obtained from the applied irrigation water depth and the values of δs were obtained from the soil moisture measurements the value of dp was ignored in the calculations since no seepage was measured below the 0 40 cm root zone 2 6 yield response factor ky and irrigation water productivity iwp the yield response factor ky which indicates the relationship between the quantity of water consumed by the plants and the crop yield was determined using the equation developed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 the irrigation water productivity iwp expressed as unit water utilization rate was determined using eq 4 4 i w p e y i v iwp irrigation water productivity kg m3 ey lettuce yield kg ha iv volume of irrigation water per ha m3 ha 2 7 growth parameters the height of the plant and the number of leaves were recorded from 10 plants just before harvest the surface areas of five fully developed leaves were calculated using the winfolia computer program i̇pek et al 2014 the harvested plants were weighed and the yield t ha per unit area was determined then the underground roots were removed and cleaned and the fresh weight per plant was determined the samples were placed in an oven and dried at 65 c for 72 h and their dry weights were recorded the amount of underground and above ground dry matter was calculated as a percentage seymen 2021 2 8 physiological parameters the proportional water content in leaves was determined according to the methods described by kaya et al 2003 to determine membrane damage md three discs of 1 cm2 were taken from the lettuce leaves these discs were shaken in 10 ml of distilled water at room temperature for 24 h in a shaker then the ec values ec1 of the samples were measured using ec meters after the samples were autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min they were cooled to room temperature then the second ec ec2 values of the samples were measured and the membrane damage was calculated using eq 5 lutts et al 1996 5 md ec 1 ec 2 x 100 2 9 pigment and carotenoid content after harvesting 0 2 g of the lettuce leaf samples stored at 20 c were weighed and ground in 10 ml of acetone the samples were centrifuged and precipitated in 2 ml tubes and the supernatant was collected and measured using a shimadzu uv1900i spectrophotometer at 663 652 and 645 nm the data were analyzed using the formula developed by lichtenthaler and buschmann 2001 to determine the contents of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll the jaspars formula developed by witham et al 1971 was used to determine the carotenoid content 2 10 determination of the carbohydrate content the carbohydrate content was determined following the method described by herbert et al 1971 briefly 0 1 g of the sample was taken and extracted in 10 and 5 ml of naoh respectively and after 10 min the protein was extracted the residues were washed with water and extracted with h2so4 for 30 min at room temperature after the samples were diluted 1 ml of 5 phenol was added to 1 ml of the sample then 5 ml of h2so4 was mixed and kept at room temperature for 30 min finally the mixture was measured at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer and the total carbohydrate content was calculated 2 11 mda and h2o2 content the method developed by heath and packer 1968 was used for determining the malondialdehyde mda content to determine the concentration of h2o2 0 2 g of leaf tissue sample was incubated with 5 ml of 0 1 tca and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min velikova et al 2000 then 0 5 ml of the obtained superficial residue was taken and added to a mixture of 0 5 ml of phosphate buffer ph 7 0 and 1 ml of 1 m ki the transmittance of the mixture was read at 390 nm and the concentration of h2o2 was calculated using the formula obtained from the standard graph 2 12 protein and proline content the lettuce leaf samples 0 5 g were weighed and crushed in a 0 05 m phosphate solution the homogenate was transferred into the centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 20 min then 0 2 ml of the phase formed at the top of the tube was taken and mixed with 3 ml of bradford buffer solution the protein content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer the protein content in the leaves was calculated based on a standard graph bradford 1976 to determine the proline content the acid ninhydrin method developed by bates et al 1973 was used 2 13 antioxidant enzyme activity to determine the enzyme activity 1 g of leaf tissue was weighed and ground in a porcelain mortar with liquid nitrogen until it turned into a powder the pod activity was determined based on the increase in absorbance at 470 nm caused by the colored compound which was formed by the reaction between guaiacol and h2o2 angelini and federico 1989 the method proposed by agarwal and pandey 2004 was used to determine the sod activity the method of havir and mchale 1987 was used to measure the cat activity 2 14 chlorophyll fluorescence and stomatal conductance before harvesting the lettuce chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a portable li 600 porometer fluorometer li 600 licor biosciences inc lincoln ne usa from old and fully developed leaves at noon between 10 00 and 12 00 on sunny days mathobo et al 2017 the photosynthesis efficiency psii and stomatal conductance gs were measured under bright conditions whereas chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm maximum quantum yield fm f0 fm was measured from plants that were kept in the dark for 1 h shin et al 2021 2 15 statistical analysis all data obtained from treatments were analyzed by using the spss version 22 0 computer program first data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova and then the results were tested at the 5 significance level according to duncan s multiple comparison test to determine statistically significant differences between means of different groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content irrigation depth and evapotranspiration et the soil moisture was measured regularly and the data are shown in fig 2 the moisture was measured from 0 10 to 1 00 m below the soil surface using a profile probe moisture measuring device but no changes in the moisture were recorded below 40 cm under full and deficit irrigation conditions thus the lettuce plants consumed water from the first 40 cm of soil below the surface therefore only the soil moisture changes from 0 to 40 cm below the soil surface are shown in the fig 2 the soil moisture values changed between fc and wp during the vegetation period of lettuce lower soil moisture values were recorded in water stress treatments but soil moisture did not fall below the wilting point wp even at the i40 irrigation level under 60 water stress fig 2 irrigation water was applied to the treatments six times during the vegetation period fig 2 and the total quantity of water applied varied between 53 7 mm i40 and 111 8 mm i100 according to the treatments table 1 although the increase in water stress decreased the water consumption of lettuce this decrease was lower than the decrease in the quantity of irrigation water this was due to the presence of high moisture in the soil at the time of planting such that the variation in the soil moisture content δs between planting and harvesting was between 30 4 and 40 5 mm depending on the applied dose of no for the plants in the i40 treatment group on the other hand increasing the dose of no partially increased the water consumption of lettuce under full and deficit irrigation conditions with the highest water consumption of 125 1 mm measured in the no100i100 treatment group table 1 in some studies conducted in open field conditions the water consumption of lettuce varied between 135 1 and 254 6 mm kuslu et al 2008 and 337 and 413 mm karam et al 2002 depending on the treatments on the other hand in studies where experiments were conducted in glass greenhouses the water consumption of lettuce under full irrigation conditions was 115 mm yıldırım et al 2015 and 125 mm kırnak et al 2016 oliveira et al 2005 reported that the water consumption of lettuce was 117 mm for the plants irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation the water consumption of lettuce differed in the greenhouse and under open field conditions our results concerning plant water consumption were similar to those of other studies conducted in greenhouses 3 2 lettuce yield and yield components the effects of the application of snp on the yield and yield components under full and deficit irrigation conditions are presented in table 2 based on the average values we found that an increase in the dose of snp significantly increased the lettuce yield table 2 however the treatments with moderate water stress i60 treatment and severe water stress i40 treatment were associated with a significant decrease in yield the interaction between the dose of snp and water stress significantly affected the yield the highest lettuce yield of 39 1 t ha was recorded for the no100i100 treatment and there was no significant difference between these plants and those in the no100i80 and no50i100 treatment groups on the other hand the lettuce yield was 28 4 t ha in the no0i100 treatment group control no snp application and fully irrigated while the yield was 28 1 t ha in the no100i40 treatment group these results showed that the application of snp to lettuce had positive effects on the yield under full and deficit irrigation conditions similarly snp increased yield components such as head height and leaf area in lettuce but it did not significantly affect the number of leaves and the dry matter content although an increase in water stress caused a decrease in the head height leaf area and leaf number per plant it caused a proportional increase in dry matter content water stress causes a significant decrease in lettuce yield rashid 2021 yavuz et al 2021 yıldırım et al 2015 kuslu et al 2008 the results of this study indicated that nitric oxide application can reduce the effect of water stress and increase the yield of lettuce under limited irrigation conditions nitric oxide no acts as a potent biostimulant in plants under stress fancy et al 2017 it helps plants to cope with different types of abiotic stress such as iron deficiency shanmugam et al 2015 kaya et al 2020b salinity ahanger et al 2019 ahmad et al 2016 2018 ragaey et al 2022 and water stress cechin et al 2015 kaya et al 2019 sadak 2022 sodium nitroprusside snp as an exogenous no donor was shown to alleviate the negative effects of water stress on plants hajihashemi 2021 yıldıztugay et al 2014 3 3 colour pigments chlorophyll carotenoid protein and carbohydrate contents increasing the dose of no significantly increased the content of chl a chl b total chl and car carotenoid and the highest values were recorded from the plants in which 100 µm snp was applied table 3 an increase in the water stress caused a significant decrease in the content of chl a chl b and total chl but a significant increase in the content of car when the interaction between the dose of no and the irrigation were examined the highest content of chl a chl b and total chl was recorded for the no100i100 and no50i100 treatments snp applied under deficit irrigation conditions significantly increased the color pigments of lettuce compared to water stress treatments without the application of snp thus the application of 50 and 100 µm snp at i40 and i60 irrigation levels exposed to severe and moderate water stress resulted in a significant increase in the chlorophyll content some researchers argue that the decrease in the chlorophyll a and b content under stress is due to a reduction in the metabolic activities of plants foyer and shigeoka 2011 the chlorophyll content of plants reflects the state of photosynthetic activity which is sensitive to stress kalaji et al 2016 kaya et al 2019 in studies on the water deficit stress of various plants the chlorophyll content was found to decrease as the severity of stress increased seymen 2021 jabeen et al 2019 yavuz et al 2021 kaya et al 2019 yasmeen et al 2013 akram et al 2016 however no significantly increases the chl a and b content in plants under water stress in a study on saffron grown under deficit irrigation conditions no was found to have a supportive effect on the content of chl a and b in plants under water stress hajihashemi 2021 similarly no was found to play a critical role in the recovery of chlorophyll under water stress kaya et al 2019 nitric oxide can increase the tolerance of plants to environmental stress by activating antioxidant systems such as car kaya et al 2020a yıldıztugay et al 2014 in our study an increase in the dose of no significantly increased the content of car in lettuce leaves an increase in water stress also caused an increase in the content of car the content of car was reported to increase in lettuce yavuz et al 2021 basahi et al 2014 and spinach seymen 2021 xu and leskovar 2015 under stress the treatment of lettuce with snp caused a significant decrease in the water soluble carbohydrate wsc content and the proline content table 3 however an increase in water stress caused a significant increase in the content of proline and wsc in lettuce leaves due to the production and accumulation of osmotic solutions such as proline and wsc plants try to avoid the negative effects of drought stress gholami and zahedi 2019 additionally the negative effects of water stress can be mitigated through the transport of soluble compounds such as proline and carbohydrates from the roots to the leaves zahedi et al 2019 similar to our findings an increase in water stress was found in another study to increase the sugar content in soybeans du et al 2020 soluble substances such as organic acids free amino acids and carbohydrates increase in flax plants under drought stress rashwan and abdelaal 2019 similar to our findings the content of carbohydrates and proline in strawberry leaves was found to increase with an increase in drought stress zahedi et al 2020 drought resistant wheat genotypes have higher wsc concentrations than susceptible ones goggin and setter 2004 yang et al 2007 when the interaction between the dose of no and water stress was examined in our study the highest wsc values were found at i80 i60 and i40 irrigation levels in the absence of snp in contrast the application of 100 µm snp resulted in a decrease in the wsc content under full and deficit irrigation conditions these results showed that snp can reduce the negative effects of water stress in lettuce 3 4 enzyme activities and malondialdehyde and h2o2 concentrations the application of exogenous snp significantly increased the cat and pod levels in lettuce table 4 however an increase in the dose of snp significantly decreased the sod enzyme activity regarding irrigation the highest cat pod and sod levels were found in the i40 treatments in which the plants were under the greatest water stress intracellular antioxidant enzymes protect plants under stress in general sod catalyzes the conversion of superoxide to h2o2 and o2 pod helps to detect reactive oxygen species ros and cat helps to eliminate ros kalefetoğlu and ekmekci 2005 demiral 2003 mittler 2002 the enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms reduce the damage caused by ros in plants under water stress naveed et al 2014 yavuz et al 2022 kayak et al 2022 additionally the application of exogenous snp can reduce oxidative damage and improve antioxidant enzyme activities in plants under water stress garcı a mata and lamattina 2001 tan et al 2008 gan et al 2015 ekinci et al 2020 our results showed that enzymes such as cat and pod increase significantly after the application of snp in plants under water stress and provide support to the defense system an increase in water stress increased the content of the compounds that cause oxidative damage such as malondialdehyde mda and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 table 4 stress causes the overproduction of ros which damages lipid membranes and increases the mda content perveen et al 2013 water stress also increases the concentration of h2o2 in lettuce basahi et al 2014 in this study the application of snp did not decrease the levels of mda and h2o2 but instead caused a slight increase 3 5 membrane damage lrwc stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence in lettuce leaf under water stress the highest membrane damage of 17 7 occurred in the plants of the i40 treatment group where severe water stress was applied table 5 the extent of membrane damage was not significantly different among the plants in the i100 i80 and i60 treatment groups similar to our findings other studies found that the greatest extent of membrane damage occurred under severe water stress in spinach seymen 2021 and lettuce yavuz et al 2021 the leaf relative water content lrwc decreased as membrane damage increased in lettuce leaves table 5 the highest lrwc values average 81 3 were recorded in plants that were in the i100 treatment group on the other hand the average value of lrwc was 71 for the plants in the i40 treatment group the application of snp did not alter membrane damage or lrwc in lettuce an increase in water stress decreased stomatal conductance gs and chlorophyll fluorescence phi ps2 and fv fm however the results of duncan s test concerning the gs and fv fm maximum quantum yield values did not differ significantly between the fully irrigated i100 and mild water stress i80 treatments under water stress plants cope with drought by closing their stomata which leads to a decrease in stomatal conductance in our study the application of no under full and deficit irrigation conditions did not improve the stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence rates of lettuce in some studies no was found to decrease rather than increase stomatal conductance ekinci et al 2020 exogenous no can also induce stomatal closure under drought stress depending on the applied dose neill et al 2002 garcı a mata and lamattina 2001 no has different effects under different environmental and plant conditions certain doses of exogenous no can increase the stomatal conductance of vicia faba leaves sakihama et al 2003 3 6 water yield relationships we determined the relationships between lettuce yield and evapotranspiration et and the results are shown in fig 3 quadratic polynomial relationships were found between lettuce yield and et p 0 01 and the coefficients of determination r2 and equations are shown in the fig 3 in the study the yield response factor ky was calculated for different doses of no to determine the effect of the decrease in et on the yield and the results are shown in fig 4 the ky values for lettuce ranged from 0 70 non snp to 1 13 100 µm snp when ky is greater than 1 the plant is sensitive to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1979 the lettuce grown in the greenhouse and treated with 50 and 100 µm snp showed a greater decrease in the yield than the plants in the control no snp treatment group under water stress when the lettuce yields were examined table 2 the differences in the yields between fully irrigated i100 and severely water stressed i40 treatment groups were found to be 7 3 14 5 and 11 0 t ha for the control no snp 50 µm snp and 100 µm snp doses respectively the results of irrigation water productivity iwp an indicator of the contribution of unit water to yield are shown in fig 5 the iwp values for the plants in the control group no snp varied between 25 4 and 39 2 kg m3 and the iwp values increased with an increase in water stress the iwp values were 23 0 and 28 4 higher after treatment with 50 and 100 µm snp respectively compared to the iwp values without snp treatment similar to our findings a study showed that 100 µm snp applied to soybean increased water use efficiency de sousa et al 2020 stomatal closure a response to water stress can reduce transpiration and also increase water use efficiency martins et al 2016 some studies have shown that no can increase plant tolerance to water stress as it is involved in signaling pathways associated with stomatal closure joudoi et al 2013 sun et al 2017 our results showed that snp applied to lettuce significantly increased irrigation water productivity under deficit and full irrigation conditions 4 conclusions in this study we determined the effectiveness of different doses of no under full and deficit irrigation conditions in alleviating the effect of water stress increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and improving growth parameters in lettuce our results showed that applying 50 and 100 µm snp under full irrigation i100 conditions caused a 32 3 and 37 6 increase in the lettuce yield respectively compared to no snp treatment additionally snp contributed to an increase in the yield under deficit irrigation conditions this effect was more pronounced at the i80 treatment under mild water stress and the yield between this application and that at the i100 irrigation level did not differ significantly the application of no increased the yield components such as head height leaf area and the number of leaves the antioxidant enzyme activity of cat and pod chlorophyll content and irrigation water productivity under full and deficit irrigation conditions our results might provide new insights into the no

9132,improving irrigation efficiency ie to alleviate water shortage has been deemed viable however the so called irrigation efficiency paradox iep can complicate this process where agricultural water consumption remains high despite the enhanced irrigation efficiency particularly in arid regions this study developed a judgment method of iep based on a water accounting framework and the iep definition to detect the iep occurring across spatial scales in the middle heihe river basin the second largest inland river basin in northwest china furthermore the scale effects of the iep were analyzed the results showed that evaluated by evapotranspiration et and transpiration t the scale effect occurred because iep does not necessarily occur at the field scale but at the irrigation district scale and basin scale evaluated by inflows i and surface water diversion and groundwater extraction isg the scale effect occurred because iep may occur at the field and the irrigation district scales but not at the basin scale further the iep was also influenced by time scales and regional agricultural characteristics the results can be referenced for water saving measures avoiding the potential iep for actual water savings in arid regions worldwide keywords scale effect irrigation efficiency paradox water accounting framework heihe river basin data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction water shortage is a posing threat to the sustainable development of agriculture countries have formulated policies to improve irrigation efficiency ie and achieve water savings the united nations high level leadership group on water and the united nations sustainable development goal 6 4 encourage water users including irrigators to improve water efficiency to address water scarcity hplw outcome report 2018 however improved ie does not necessarily reduce water consumption but rather aggravates the already unsustainable water use leading to an irrigation efficiency paradox iep berbel et al 2018 jevons and flux 1965 sears et al 2018 arid regions are prone to alarming water scarcity elhassnaoui et al 2021 seckler et al 1999 therefore research is warranted on iep in arid regions in the arid regions of northwest china water resources are the key constraint of socio economic development impacting ecological security water use has reached or exceeded tolerable limits in areas with severe water shortages chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china with prominent water conflict between its middle and lower reaches the agricultural production water in the middle reaches crowds out the ecological water in the lower reaches resulting in soil desertification and ecosystem degradation in the downstream areas to this end in 1997 the state council approved the heihe river water diversion scheme to allocate water resources between the middle and lower reaches of the hrb huang 2015 mwr 2004 yi et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 measures have been implemented in the middle reaches to ensure the downstream water distribution including upgrading water saving adjustments to the agricultural planting structure and rational allocating of water resources however with the expansion of the irrigated area agricultural water consumption remains high resulting in environmental degradation in the middle hrb and water distribution goal failure to meet in the lower hrb geng et al 2021 hu et al 2016 huang 2015 tan and zheng 2019 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to demonstrate whether the iep occurs after improving ie in the hrb referring to agricultural water savings current research has demonstrated conflicting results on the existence of iep berbel et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 with the transition to more efficient irrigation techniques groundwater pumping increases dramatically due to increased planting density at the field scale and irrigated areas at the basin scale pfeiffer and lin 2014 by reconstructing water consumption on a global scale huang et al 2018 found that global water consumption increased significantly mainly due to the increased total irrigation water resources these researches indicate the occurrence of iep on the other hand berbel et al 2015 found that the iep did not occur at the field scale when local farmers followed the three rules for obtaining government subsidies not increasing irrigated areas reducing water rights and redistributing environmental water huang et al 2017 found that water saving technologies can reduce water use at the field scale conflicting results on the existence of the iep may be because the impact of increased ie at the field level differs from the impact on a larger scale in the irrigation district scale or basin scale water consumption depends not only on ie but also on return flows unbeneficial evaporation irrigation area crop patterns or agronomic berbel et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 it is crucial to conduct comprehensive water accounting from the field scale to the basin scale analyze the scale effects of iep to explain the conflicting results and formulate practical policies to prevent the potential iep however the scaling effect of the iep has yet to be explored due to the lack of comprehensive water accounting from field to basin scale berbel et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 recently satellite based evapotranspiration et products that divide et into evaporation e and transpiration t have flourished stoy et al 2019 enabling the assessment of the iep s scale effect on the water accounting framework the objective of this study was to analyze the scale effect of the iep based on the water accounting framework in the hrb northwest china this study applied a water accounting framework to estimate inflow evaporation transpiration and return flow at multiple spatial scales field irrigation district and basin further based on the water accounting framework and the concept of iep a method for judging iep at different spatial scales was proposed first and the iep at different spatial scales was judged third the scale effects of iep were analyzed according to differences and connections of iep in the field irrigation districts and basin scale the research can provide a scientific basis for water saving measures to prevent the potential iep at multiple scales contributing to real water savings in arid zones worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in the desert region of northwestern china fig 1 upstream is located above yingluoxia gorge midstream is located between yingluoxia gorge and zhengyixia gorge and downstream is located below zhengyixia gorge the precipitation in the middle hrb is low with an average annual precipitation of 150 mm moreover agricultural development heavily relies on surface water diversion and groundwater extraction over 90 of all hrb cultivated area is in the middle stream with 13 irrigation districts including daman shangsan yingke xijun shahe yanuan banqiao pingchuan liaoquan liyuanhe youlian liuba and luocheng water utilization contradictions are very prominent in the middle and downstream hrb thus the water diversion scheme of the heihe river trunk stream 97 wds was approved by the state council of china in 1997 geng et al 2021 the core of the 97 wds is when the annual average water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 58 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 95 billion m3 when the 25 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 71 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 1 09 billion m3 when the 75 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 42 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 76 billion m3 when the 90 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 29 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 63 billion m3 when other guarantee rates come in the water discharged from the zhengyixia gorge is calculated by linear interpolation based on the guaranteed rates the average water consumption distributed to the middle hrb is 0 63 billion m3 jiang et al 2019 to complete the releasing goal of the zhengyixia section the middle hrb developed 496 33 km2 of water saving irrigation area from 2000 to 2017 accounting for 42 42 of the cultivated area geng 2021 according to the 97 wds there is still a certain gap between the discharge of the zhengyixia section and the scheme the possible reason is the occurrence of iep in the middle hrb therefore this paper studies the scale effect of the iep in the middle hrb this paper studies iep at three scales basin scale irrigation district scale and field scale the basin scale refers to the middle hrb the irrigation district scale refers to the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb the field scale refers to the fields that make up the irrigation district 2 2 inflow evapotranspiration transpiration and return flow at the field scale inflow water i includes surface water diversion is groundwater extraction ig and precipitation p without considering precipitation p the field inflow can be expressed as follows i is ig p is ig is and ig are not distinguished collectively referred to as surface water diversion and groundwater extraction isg the formula becomes i isg the author s research group obtained the isg from the survey on the field irrigation water of farmers in the study area under different irrigation methods in october 2020 the crop evapotranspiration was expressed by the net irrigation water provided by the water resource management office of yingke irrigation district the net irrigation water in the field was the amount of irrigated water the crops could use crop evapotranspiration is the water consumed by the crops with a lack of precipitation p and groundwater at closer depths crop growth depended on irrigation therefore the net irrigation water can represent crop evapotranspiration shen et al 2013 the net irrigation water in the field was calculated from the field test method by measuring the change in the field water volume before and after irrigation in typical fields chen et al 2022 shen et al 2013 crop evapotranspiration et m3 was estimated as eq 1 1 et w net i 1 n 667 γ h θ gi θ oi where w net m3 represents net irrigation water h denotes the planned wet layer depth of the field during the irrigation period γ is the dry bulk density of the soil at depth h of the field θ oi and θ gi are the soil moisture content at depth h before and after the ith irrigation respectively n is the number of irrigations the inflow to the irrigation district was the sum of surface water diversion groundwater extraction and precipitation i is ig p isg p inflow to the middle hrb was the sum of the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the inflow from liyuanhe and the precipitation minus the discharge of zhengyixia gorge i is ig p isg p where is iyingluoxia i liyuanhe i zhengyixia ig 0 the above data were obtained from the heihe river bureau the water affairs bureau of zhangye and various counties the modis16a3 estimates evapotranspiration at irrigation district and basin scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m available at https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov the et algorithm was based on the penman monteith equation the transpiration data was from the equation of et multiplied by t et et was the irrigation district and basin evapotranspiration obtained by modis16a3 and t et was the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio obtained by the t et dataset of chinese terrestrial ecosystems from 1981 to 2015 available at https doi org 10 17605 osf io merzn the spatial resolution is 0 05 0 05 and the t et data has no unit niu et al 2020 1981 2015 daily precipitation from 1960 to 2014 at the irrigation district and basin scales was obtained by spatial interpolation of gauge precipitation using regional climate model simulation in the hrb with a spatial resolution of 3 km http data tpdc ac cn wang et al 2017 yang 2016 return flow was estimated as the difference between inflow and evapotranspiration additionally all raster data were rescaled to 1 km and resampled for all variables the data was interpolated if necessary 2 3 water accounting framework water accounting analyzes water use consumption and productivity based on water balance molden and sakthivadivel 1999 water accounting includes estimating return flow and evapotranspiration and defining water rights diversion use and consumption berbel et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 perry 2007 proposed an accounting framework for irrigation water fig 2a b which is divided into four parts i beneficial water consumption i e transpiration for crop growth ii non beneficial water consumption i e evaporation from bare soil and weed transpiration iii recoverable return flows i e water return to rivers reservoirs and fresh aquifers iv non recoverable return flows i e seepage into saline aquifers the water accounting framework has been applied in multiple case studies karimi et al 2013a b vardon et al 2007 water accounting can be performed at different scales including field irrigation district and basin grafton et al 2018 perry 2007 water resources follow the law of water balance at any scale and the inflow equals the outflow taking storage changes δ storage as zero the water balance formula for the inflow and outflow grafton et al 2018 can be expressed as 2 inflows i evaporation e transpiration t return flow r where e and t are consumption parts the r is non consumption parts which may also be referred to as subsurface recharge re and surface runoff ru r re ru 2 4 judgment method of iep at different scales and scale effect 2 4 1 irrigation efficiency at the field scale ie is the ratio of beneficial irrigation water primarily crop et to total irrigation water from yearly crop evapotranspiration per unit of land liu 2016 grafton et al 2018 at the irrigation district scale and basin scale ie refers to the ratio of evapotranspiration to water withdrawal from the mainstream during the crop growth period equivalent to the chinese irrigation water utilization coefficient zhou et al 2013 the same formula may be used to calculate ie at the irrigation district and basin scales for its applicability at the field scale grafton et al 2018 the ie cet and beneficial ie ct are calculated as follows 3 c et c e c t et i 4 c t t i measures for increasing ie differ between field scales and larger scales the field scale refers to converting flood irrigation to water saving irrigation such as drip irrigation pipe irrigation or sprinkler irrigation grafton et al 2018 other water saving irrigation measures can also increase ie such as plastic film mulching furrow irrigation ridge furrow irrigation and channel anti seepage however these measures save less consumption water and are therefore not discussed in this paper the irrigation district scale or basin scale refers to expanding the water saving irrigation area drip or sprinkler irrigation area if the same formula is used to quantify ie at the field and larger scales improving ie at the field scale can either increase or decrease ie at larger scales the reasons are as follows firstly non consumable r at the field scale is recovered and reused resulting in higher ie at the irrigation district scale or basin scale xiong et al 2021 secondly the water cycle at the basin scale is much more complex than at the field scale government subsidized advanced irrigation technologies may encourage the expansion of irrigated land resulting in greater water consumption at the basin scale xiong et al 2021 xu and song 2022 if the newly developed irrigated area is dominated by flood irrigation ie at the basin scale may decrease but the iep occurs finally the basin scale influences ie by planting structure precipitation and water diversion therefore this paper uses the increase of water saving irrigation area to represent the increasing ie at the irrigation district and basin scale 2 4 2 iep the iep is a particular jevons paradox the jevons paradox also known as the rebound effect asserts that total coal consumption will rise as coal use efficiency increases jevons 1865 alcott 2008 in industrial production coal is consumed however in irrigation water water use water extraction the consumed components are e and t while the non consumed components are recoverable r and non recoverable r perry 2007 burt et al 1997 berbel et al 2018 implementing irrigation modernization drip sprinkler in agricultural water management may unintendedly increase water use or consumption i or et in the field or on a broader scale a phenomenon known as the iep gutierrez martin and gomez 2011 berbel et al 2018 xu and song 2022 in the jevons paradox high efficiency is associated with high levels of resource consumption they are correlations rather than causal polimeni and polimeni 2006 york 2006 causal may be one of the processes in the complex coupling process of efficiency and resource consumption there are three possible correlations between high efficiency and resource consumption first the association may be incidental e g chance co trending where factors unrelated to efficiency are gained to the high levels of resource consumption second through various mechanisms potentially both direct and indirect efficiency spurs production and consumption and does so enough to overwhelm the direct gains from efficiency itself third the same process may drive efficiency and consumption york and mcgee 2016 based on the correlations rather than causal between improving ie and water consumption we proposed a judgment method of the iep 2 4 3 judgment method of iep at the different scale we first proposed a judgment method of iep eq 5 and eq 6 to judge the occurrence of iep at different scales according to the definition of iep at the field scale the iep was judged according to its definition water use or consumption increased when the ie increased from flood to drip irrigation the increased ie cet can be expressed by cet in drip irrigation minus cet in flood irrigation cet in drip irrigation is higher than in flood irrigation fig 2b therefore cet 0 water use at the field scale refers to surface water diversion and groundwater extraction isg without considering precipitation p the increased isg isg can be expressed by isg in drip irrigation minus isg in flood irrigation water consumption refers to et no separation is made due to the difficulty of separating t from et the increased et et can be expressed by et in drip irrigation minus in flood irrigation the following formula can determine the field scale iep 5 when δ c et 0 δlsg 0 or δet 0 iep occurs δisg 0 δet 0 iep does not occurs where cet is ie isg is surface water diversion and groundwater extraction et is evapotranspiration the sum of e and t cet is equal to cet in drip irrigation minus cet in flood irrigation isg refers to isg in drip irrigation minus isg in flood irrigation et refers to et in drip irrigation minus et in flood irrigation at the irrigation district and basin scale iep was judged according to its definition water use or consumption increased when the ie increased from flood to drip irrigation the increased ie cet can be expressed by expanding the water saving irrigation areas because measures for cet refer to expanding the water saving irrigation area at the irrigation district scale or basin scale after 2000 the water saving irrigation drip and sprinkler irrigation area in the middle hrb saw an annual increase cai et al 2022 from 2000 to 2017 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb developed 496 33 km2 of water saving irrigation areas geng 2021 therefore cet 0 in water use distinguishing between i and isg is necessary for i is the sum of p and isg grafton et al 2018 since 2000 p has been increasing while isg has been decreasing cai et al 2022 geng et al 2021 at the irrigation district scale the increased i i can be expressed by i in 2018 minus i in 2000 and the increased isg isg can be expressed by isg in 2018 minus isg in 2000 at the basin scale i have two cases 1 i in 2018 minus i in 2000 2 i in t 1 minus i in t the range of t is 2000 2018 isg has two cases 1 isg in 2018 minus isg in 2000 2 isg in t 1 minus isg in t the range of t is 2000 2018 water resources in the middle hrb come from the mainstream of the heihe river the groundwater is recharged by surface water so isg at the basin scale only refers to surface water diversion in water consumption distinguishing between et and t is necessary the satellite based et product is employed to distinguish between et and t at the irrigation district scale the increased et et can be expressed by et in 2018 minus et in 2000 and the increased t t can be expressed by t in 2018 minus t in 2000 at the basin scale et has two cases 1 et in 2018 minus et in 2000 2 et in t 1 minus et in t the range of t is 2000 2018 t has two cases 1 t in 2018 minus t in 2000 2 t in t 1 minus t in t the range of t is 2000 2018 the following equation determines the iep at irrigation district and basin scales 6 when δ c et 0 δi 0 or δisg 0 or δet 0 or δt 0 iep occurs δi 0 δisg 0 δet 0 δt 0 iep does not occurs where water resources in the middle hrb come from the mainstream of the heihe river the groundwater is recharged by surface water so isg at the basin scale only refers to surface water diversion 2 4 4 scale effects of the iep the scale effect was analyzed by comparing the difference and connection of iep between different scales based on judging whether iep occurs at the field irrigation district or basin scale 3 result 3 1 iep at field scale through the field test method and farmer surveys the average et and average isg of different crop types under different irrigation methods at the field scale were determined as shown in fig 3 as far as et is concerned 33 representative fields with more crop types and irrigation methods in the study area were selected to calculate their water consumption each representative field has a crop type irrigation method and water consumption the crop types have corn winter wheat seed corn vegetables and fruits irrigation methods have flood irrigation and drip irrigation water saving irrigation in 33 representative fields corn was irrigated by flood irrigation winter wheat was irrigated by flood irrigation vegetables and fruits were irrigated by drip irrigation and seed corn was irrigated by flood and drip irrigation the average et for a certain crop type and irrigation method is obtained by averaging the et of representative fields with the same crop type and irrigation method which can be ranked as et seed corn flood 473 m3 mu et seed corn drip 311 m3 mu et corn flood 306 m3 mu et winter wheat flood 298 m3 mu et vegetable and fruit drip 269 m3 mu through the farmer survey the corresponding isg is obtained and ranked as i sgseed corn flood 1044 m3 mu isg seed corn drip 1011 m3 mu isg corn flood 800 m3 mu isg winter wheat flood 560 m3 mu isg vegetable and fruit drip 300 m3 mu mu a unit for measuring area that is commonly 666 7 square meters when evaluated by et the field scale iep may or may not occur fig 4a no iep occurred when switching from flood to drip irrigation in the following two situations 1 et could decrease without changing crop types for instance with seed corn switched from flood irrigation to drip irrigation the et was reduced from 473 m3 mu to 310 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from types with high et to low et for instance from flood irrigated seed corn 473 m3 mu corn 306 m3 mu and winter wheat 298 m3 mu to drip irrigated vegetables and fruits 269 m3 mu the iep occurred when switching from flood irrigation to drip irrigation under two situations 1 crops were changed from types with low et to types with high et for instance from flood irrigated corn 306 m3 mu and winter wheat 298 m3 mu to drip irrigated seed corn 311 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from any types with low et to greenhouse vegetables and fruits with a 3 4 times growth period and high et for instance from flood irrigated seed corn 473 m3 mu corn 306 m3 mu and winter wheat 298 m3 mu to drip irrigated greenhouse vegetables and fruits 806 m3 mu when evaluated by isg the field scale iep may or may not occur fig 4b no iep occurred when switching from flood irrigation to drip irrigation in the following two situations 1 isg could decrease without changing crop types for instance with seed corn from flood to drip irrigation the isg is decreased from 1044 m3 mu to 1011 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from types with high isg to types with low isg for instance from flood irrigated seed corn 1044 m3 mu corn 800 m3 mu and winter wheat 560 m3 mu to drip irrigated vegetables and fruits 300 m3 mu the iep occurred when switching from flood irrigation to drip irrigation under two situations 1 crops were changed from types with low isg to types with high isg for instance from flood irrigated corn 800 m3 mu and winter wheat 560 m3 mu to drip irrigated seed corn 1011 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from types with low isg to greenhouse vegetables and fruits with 3 4 times growth period and high isg for instance from flood irrigated corn 800 m3 mu and winter wheat 560 m3 mu to drip irrigated greenhouse vegetables and fruits 900 m3 mu 3 2 iep at irrigation district scale we calculated the i isg et and t of each irrigation district in the middle hrb from 2000 to 2018 moreover the iep in each irrigation district was judged according to eq 6 the iep at the irrigation district scale is shown in table 1 and fig 5 when evaluated by et the iep occurs in 13 irrigation districts when evaluated by t the iep occurs in 13 irrigation districts when evaluated by i the iep occurs in daman yingke yanuan and luocheng irrigation districts but does not occur in the other 9 irrigation districts when evaluated by isg the iep occurs in yingke and yanuan irrigation districts but not in the other 11 irrigation districts in yingke and yanuan iep occurs evaluated by et t i or isg in daman and luocheng iep occurs evaluated by et t or i but not by isg in xijun shangsan banqiao pingchuan liaoquan shahe liyuanhe youlian and liuba iep occurs evaluated by et or t but not by i and isg 3 3 iep at basin scale at the basin scale in the middle hrb the iep is affected by the time scale which is different from the annual scale to the 19 year scale from 2000 2018 the iep occurs evaluated by et or t at the basin scale however the iep did not occur evaluated by isg and i fig 6 et and t increased by 0 26 billion m3 and 0 212 billion m3 respectively et 0 t 0 the increased et is dominated by t accounting for 81 54 isg and i decreased by 0 125 billion m3 and 0 006 billion m3 i 0 isg 0 respectively the reduction in isg was much more significant than in i due to the increased p partially offsetting the decrease in isg in the middle hrb since 2000 at the basin scale with the expansion of water saving irrigation areas in the middle hrb whether the iep occurs at the year scale has six situations as follows fig 7 1 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by one of et t i and isg iep does not occur such as in the years 2001 2004 2006 and 2018 2 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by t iep occurs while evaluated by one of et i isg iep does not occur such as in the years 2008 and 2011 3 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by et or t iep occurs while evaluated by i or isg iep does not occur such as in the years 2010 2013 2015 and 2016 4 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by i or isg iep occurs while evaluated by et or t iep does not occur such as in the year 2012 5 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by one of et i isg iep occurs while evaluated by t iep does not occur such as in the year 2009 6 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by one of et t i isg iep occurs such as in the years 2002 2003 2005 2007 2014 and 2017 situations 1 3 and 6 have a high frequency from 2000 to 2018 it can be seen that the occurrence of iep at the year scale is affected by the selection of evaluation indicators in addition et t i and isg fluctuate yearly resulting in a fluctuating trend of iep iep occurs in some years but not in others 3 4 scale effects of iep scale effects of iep occurred at the field irrigation districts and basin scales fig 8 evaluated by et and t the scale effect occurred because iep does not necessarily occur at the field scale but at the irrigation district scale and basin scale at the field scale the iep will not occur in the two cases 1 without changing planting types and growth period the irrigation method was changed from flood to drip 2 crops were changed from types with flood irrigated high et to types with drip irrigated low et in comparison the iep will occur in two cases 1 crops were changed from types with flood irrigated low et to types with drip irrigated high et 2 crops were changed from any types with flood irrigated low et to drip irrigated greenhouse vegetables and fruits with 3 4 times growth period and high et at the irrigation district scale the iep occurred in 13 irrigation districts because of the combination of different crop types irrigation methods growth periods and cultivated areas at the field scale at the basin scale the iep occurred because et and t increased in 13 irrigation districts evaluated by i and isg the scale effect occurred because iep may occur at the field and irrigation district scales but not occur at the basin scale at the field scale as ie improves the iep will not occur in the two cases 1 without changing the planting types and growth period the irrigation method is changed from flood to drip 2 crops were changed from types with flood irrigation high isg to types with drip irrigation low isg in comparison the iep will occur in two cases 1 without changing growth period crops were changed from types with flood irrigation low isg to types with drip irrigation high isg 2 with changing growth period crops were changed from types with flood irrigation low isg to greenhouse vegetables and fruits with drip irrigation 3 4 times growth period and high isg at the irrigation district scale evaluated by i the iep occurred in 4 of 13 irrigation districts daman yingke yanuan and luocheng evaluated by isg the iep occurred in 2 of 13 irrigation districts yingke and yanuan the reason was that the combination of different crop types irrigation methods growth periods and cultivated areas at the field scale increased i in daman yingke yanuan and luocheng as well as isg in yingke and yanuan at the basin scale the iep did not occur because the increase and decrease in i and isg of the 13 irrigation districts caused the decrease in i and isg in the middle hrb 4 discussion 4 1 increased ie does not necessarily increase et at the field scale scholars believe higher ie increases et at the field scale assuming that yield would be proportionate to et ward and pulido velazquez 2008 however we found that in the middle hrb higher ie does not necessarily increase et firstly et was reduced by increasing ie without changing crop type and growing period under high ie drip irrigation seed corn plant height and ear were lower and the growth period was two days shorter than low ie flood irrigation but with higher corn yield zhao 2018 secondly et is no longer proportionate to yield as ie improves at the field scale et could be reduced by increasing ie and yields however in prior research yield is assumed to be proportional to et with increasing ie the iep is caused by the increase in et due to the increase in yield berbel et al 2018 liu 2016 finally farmer decisions impact whether or not et increases further whether the iep occurs berbel et al 2018 instead of profit maximization farmers choose the most advantageous crop combination based on market demand planting experience government direction the influence of friends and irrigation methods it is conceivable for farmers to decide to transition from high et to low et crops or from low et to high et crops resulting in changes in et at the field scale 4 2 scaling effect of iep evaluated by isg and i evaluated by isg and i the reason for the scale effect of iep is that isg and i decrease at the basin scale but both increase and decrease at the irrigation district and field scales at the basin scale iep was not identified due to the reduced isg from 2000 to 2018 the water diversion to the middle hrb was reduced to meet the downstream requirement based on the 97 wds promulgated by the state council in 1997 leading to the lower isg and i in the middle hrb at the irrigation district scale evaluated by isg iep was identified in 2 of the 13 irrigation districts evaluated by i iep was identified in 4 of the 13 irrigation districts the isg of the two irrigation districts yingke and yanuan allocated by the basin scale increased from 2000 to 2018 to satisfy greenhouse vegetables and fruits water demand for the four irrigation districts i increased in yingke and yanuan for the increased isg and daman and luocheng for the increased precipitation at the field scale iep was identified in 4 of 9 situations the iep is affected by the amount time and frequency of isg allocated to the field scale by the irrigation district scale which further influences the planting structure irrigation methods and cultivated areas of farmers 4 3 scale effect of iep evaluated by et and t evaluated by et and t there are two reasons for the scale effect of iep firstly r is considered a loss at the field scale but recovered and utilized at the irrigation district and basin scales secondly at the field scale only some farmers but not all tend to plant high water consuming crops and expand the cultivated area after implementing water saving irrigation at the basin scale iep was identified due to the increased et and t from the water balance perspective eq 2 i will be converted into et and r when i changed nothing or very little r decreased but et increased fig 6 the decreased r was converted into increased et the decrease in r was due to water saving irrigation under flood irrigation r accounted for 30 of isg while under drip irrigation r accounted for 5 of isg 496 33 km2 of water saving irrigation areas was developed from 2000 to 2017 the increase in et and t was due to the high et crops the greenhouse vegetables and fruits and the expansion of the cultivated areas et will increase from other crops with flood irrigation to seed corn with drip irrigation the proportion of seed corn area increased from 15 76 in 2004 to 46 4 in 2016 the number of greenhouses is growing annually due to its high profit the cultivated area increased by 291 55 km2 in the middle hrb from 2000 to 2015 jiang 2020 jiang et al 2019 at the irrigation district scale iep was identified in all 13 irrigation districts due to the increased et and t water saving irrigation areas and the proportion of seed corn area and greenhouse vegetables and fruits increased the cultivated area increased in 12 of the 13 irrigated districts while only the irrigation district in banqiao decreased by 1 km2 at the field scale iep was identified in 5 of 9 situations farmers cultivate according to their own planting experience the agricultural industry development guidance of the government cultivated area labor force education water source available and irrigation method farmers typically switch from corn and winter wheat with low et to seed corn greenhouse vegetables and fruits with high et expanding the cultivated area to increase income 4 4 the time scale influences the scale effect the scale effect relates to temporal scales as well at the 19 year scale and the annual scale the scale effect of the iep is different due to differences in the precipitation the soil water storage the abundance of water from upstream and the planting structure on the 19 year scale the scale effect results in section 3 4 are achieved on the annual scale at the irrigation districts and basin scale iep does not necessarily occur due to changes in the precipitation the soil water storage the cultivated areas the abundance of water from upstream and the planting structure the inner mechanism that generates the scale effect of the iep needs further investigation 4 5 scale effects of iep and regional agricultural characteristics the scale effect of the iep is related to regional agricultural characteristics for semi arid northern china the iep is less likely to occur because urbanization promoted by economic development may reduce cultivated areas the saved isg has no cultivated area to irrigate liu 2016 for the arid region of bazhou china the iep occurs for et increase the increased et was because water saved by water saving irrigation is used to expand more cultivated areas liu 2016 for valencia region the iep does not occur with a depressed citrus market aging of farmers rising temperature and decreasing water availability it is difficult to switch to other more productive crops in the short term and the abandonment of the cultivated area is quite apparent resulting in the decreased isg and et sanchis ibor et al 2017 for hetao irrigation district of the yellow river basin located in a drought desert mainly relies on water from the yellow river for irrigation and has a severe water scarcity the main reasons for the iep are the expansion of cultivated areas and the increase in the proportion of irrigated areas xu and song 2022 however water resources are allocated uniformly throughout the yellow river basin agricultural irrigation water can only be supplemented by pumping more groundwater when the total water diversion increases and the surface water diversion right decreases ma et al 2010 zhang argued that with limited water resources and unlimited irrigated land the water use would not change while the water consumption would increase slightly at the field scale with a relatively high reuse of return flow water consumption will increase slightly at the basin scale zhang et al 2019 limited water resources and unlimited irrigated land characterize the hrb to complete the releasing indicator of the 79 wds the water diversion from the mainstream of the heihe river in the middle hrb will inevitably decrease nevertheless the allocation of water resources within the middle hrb is unrestricted and water diversions in some irrigation districts may also increase therefore evaluated by inflow the iep does not occur at the basin scale but may occur at the irrigation district scale with limited water diversion improving ie converts unconsumed return flow at the field scale into water consumption or beneficial water consumption at the irrigation district or basin scale therefore evaluated by evapotranspiration or transpiration the iep occurs at the irrigation district and basin scales 4 6 the selection of evaluation indexes for iep when ie is not improved return flow that is not consumed at the field scale is returned to the water system and can be reused downstream so it is important to distinguish between water use and water consumption when exploring the impact of improved ie berbel et al 2018 it is necessary to study the impact of efficiency improvements on water use and consumption under alternative constraints on water and land supply but this has received less attention in the literature zhang et al 2019 existing studies have obtained contradictory or ambiguous results on whether there is a paradox after improving ie the reasons may be no distinction between water use and water consumption analysis on different scales different assumptions behind the methodology or other influencing factors zhang et al 2019 in the middle hrb a place with limited water supply but unlimited land resources it seems necessary to evaluate the iep by distinguishing water use and consumption at different spatial scales water use includes surface water diversion is groundwater extraction ig and precipitation i isg p the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation in arid regions like the middle hrb greatly impact agricultural water use in water resource management the government often manages isg especially in the hrb where abundant surface water diversion is is used for water distribution to the middle and lower reaches for better water management we distinguish between isg and i water consumption et can be divided into beneficial water consumption t and non beneficial water consumption e perry 2007 the increase in beneficial water consumption t due to increased ie must be fully offset by decreases in non beneficial water consumption e recoverable return flows to surface water or groundwater and non recoverable return flows r grafton et al 2018 therefore a distinction is made between water consumption et and beneficial water consumption t 4 7 suggestions for water resources management taking t as the evaluation index when t increases and e decreases as long as et does not increase the iep is allowed evaluated by et the following policies can be adopted to prevent the iep guide farmers to plant crops with low water consumption but high economic returns determine the reasonable cultivated area to expand according to the saved water under the condition that the amount of surface water diversion is controlled the extraction of groundwater shall be strictly controlled to ensure that the groundwater level does not drop evaluated by i and isg it is allowed that the iep does not occur at the basin scale but at some irrigation districts because of spatial differences in regional agricultural development however with the decrease of isg in the middle hrb iep does not occur at the basin scale and it is still difficult to meet the releasing indicator stated by the 97 wds the total amount of surface water diversion in the middle hrb is certain and the surface and ground water are frequently converted in order to meet the releasing indicator a possible solution is to control the amount of groundwater extraction strictly it can be seen that the iep study serves water resources management and it is not enough to only study whether the iep occurs for water resources management it is necessary to consider local water management policy select reasonable evaluation indicators and spatial scales and take measures consistent with local water resource management et is the most suitable for evaluating iep and studying water resource management in the middle hrb 5 conclusion in the middle hrb an arid region with limited water resources and unlimited cultivated area by implementing water saving irrigation to complete the releasing goal of the 97 wds we analyzed the scale effect of the iep based on the water accounting framework and the concept of iep a method for judging iep at different spatial scales was proposed the iep at different spatial scales was evaluated furthermore the scale effect was analyzed based on the difference and connection of the iep at different spatial scales our findings indicated that the scale effect of the iep did exist in the middle hrb this thesis has provided more profound insights into 1 the difference and relationship between field scale and larger scale ie increased ie at the irrigation district and basin scale should increase water saving irrigation areas rather than the increased ratio of et i 2 based on the water accounting framework and the concept of the iep a method for judging the iep at different spatial scales is proposed the iep at different spatial scales is judged 3 evaluated by et t i and isg the scale effect of the iep is analyzed respectively 4 reason for the scale effect of iep is analyzed 5 the relationship between iep and time scale is analyzed several limitations need to be noted regarding the present study first while water accounting at different scales the storage variable is regarded as zero the results are limited without considering the soil water storage at the field scale and storage variables at the irrigation district and basin scale further work needs to be carried out to evaluate the fluctuation of storage variables at different spatial scales second in this paper we only analyzed the scale effect of the iep and discussed the reasons for the scale effect the intrinsic mechanism of scale effect in iep how iep occurs by water saving irrigation farmers planting behavior expansion of cultivated adjustment of planting structure water diversion water consumption policies and other variables interact should be further analyzed in the future to put forward better suggestions to prevent potential iep third there was no distinction between t and et at the field scale due to data availability four iep uncertainty is associated with the input data mod16 et one of several global et products that typically differ substantially for a given study area simons et al 2016 this limitation leads to uncertainty in the assessment of the iep the research results in this paper are only applicable to arid regions like hrb where water resources are limited and need to be diverted downstream and the cultivated area is unlimited the study offers reference to the evaluation of iep scale effect in arid regions

9132,improving irrigation efficiency ie to alleviate water shortage has been deemed viable however the so called irrigation efficiency paradox iep can complicate this process where agricultural water consumption remains high despite the enhanced irrigation efficiency particularly in arid regions this study developed a judgment method of iep based on a water accounting framework and the iep definition to detect the iep occurring across spatial scales in the middle heihe river basin the second largest inland river basin in northwest china furthermore the scale effects of the iep were analyzed the results showed that evaluated by evapotranspiration et and transpiration t the scale effect occurred because iep does not necessarily occur at the field scale but at the irrigation district scale and basin scale evaluated by inflows i and surface water diversion and groundwater extraction isg the scale effect occurred because iep may occur at the field and the irrigation district scales but not at the basin scale further the iep was also influenced by time scales and regional agricultural characteristics the results can be referenced for water saving measures avoiding the potential iep for actual water savings in arid regions worldwide keywords scale effect irrigation efficiency paradox water accounting framework heihe river basin data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction water shortage is a posing threat to the sustainable development of agriculture countries have formulated policies to improve irrigation efficiency ie and achieve water savings the united nations high level leadership group on water and the united nations sustainable development goal 6 4 encourage water users including irrigators to improve water efficiency to address water scarcity hplw outcome report 2018 however improved ie does not necessarily reduce water consumption but rather aggravates the already unsustainable water use leading to an irrigation efficiency paradox iep berbel et al 2018 jevons and flux 1965 sears et al 2018 arid regions are prone to alarming water scarcity elhassnaoui et al 2021 seckler et al 1999 therefore research is warranted on iep in arid regions in the arid regions of northwest china water resources are the key constraint of socio economic development impacting ecological security water use has reached or exceeded tolerable limits in areas with severe water shortages chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china with prominent water conflict between its middle and lower reaches the agricultural production water in the middle reaches crowds out the ecological water in the lower reaches resulting in soil desertification and ecosystem degradation in the downstream areas to this end in 1997 the state council approved the heihe river water diversion scheme to allocate water resources between the middle and lower reaches of the hrb huang 2015 mwr 2004 yi et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 measures have been implemented in the middle reaches to ensure the downstream water distribution including upgrading water saving adjustments to the agricultural planting structure and rational allocating of water resources however with the expansion of the irrigated area agricultural water consumption remains high resulting in environmental degradation in the middle hrb and water distribution goal failure to meet in the lower hrb geng et al 2021 hu et al 2016 huang 2015 tan and zheng 2019 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to demonstrate whether the iep occurs after improving ie in the hrb referring to agricultural water savings current research has demonstrated conflicting results on the existence of iep berbel et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 with the transition to more efficient irrigation techniques groundwater pumping increases dramatically due to increased planting density at the field scale and irrigated areas at the basin scale pfeiffer and lin 2014 by reconstructing water consumption on a global scale huang et al 2018 found that global water consumption increased significantly mainly due to the increased total irrigation water resources these researches indicate the occurrence of iep on the other hand berbel et al 2015 found that the iep did not occur at the field scale when local farmers followed the three rules for obtaining government subsidies not increasing irrigated areas reducing water rights and redistributing environmental water huang et al 2017 found that water saving technologies can reduce water use at the field scale conflicting results on the existence of the iep may be because the impact of increased ie at the field level differs from the impact on a larger scale in the irrigation district scale or basin scale water consumption depends not only on ie but also on return flows unbeneficial evaporation irrigation area crop patterns or agronomic berbel et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 it is crucial to conduct comprehensive water accounting from the field scale to the basin scale analyze the scale effects of iep to explain the conflicting results and formulate practical policies to prevent the potential iep however the scaling effect of the iep has yet to be explored due to the lack of comprehensive water accounting from field to basin scale berbel et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 recently satellite based evapotranspiration et products that divide et into evaporation e and transpiration t have flourished stoy et al 2019 enabling the assessment of the iep s scale effect on the water accounting framework the objective of this study was to analyze the scale effect of the iep based on the water accounting framework in the hrb northwest china this study applied a water accounting framework to estimate inflow evaporation transpiration and return flow at multiple spatial scales field irrigation district and basin further based on the water accounting framework and the concept of iep a method for judging iep at different spatial scales was proposed first and the iep at different spatial scales was judged third the scale effects of iep were analyzed according to differences and connections of iep in the field irrigation districts and basin scale the research can provide a scientific basis for water saving measures to prevent the potential iep at multiple scales contributing to real water savings in arid zones worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in the desert region of northwestern china fig 1 upstream is located above yingluoxia gorge midstream is located between yingluoxia gorge and zhengyixia gorge and downstream is located below zhengyixia gorge the precipitation in the middle hrb is low with an average annual precipitation of 150 mm moreover agricultural development heavily relies on surface water diversion and groundwater extraction over 90 of all hrb cultivated area is in the middle stream with 13 irrigation districts including daman shangsan yingke xijun shahe yanuan banqiao pingchuan liaoquan liyuanhe youlian liuba and luocheng water utilization contradictions are very prominent in the middle and downstream hrb thus the water diversion scheme of the heihe river trunk stream 97 wds was approved by the state council of china in 1997 geng et al 2021 the core of the 97 wds is when the annual average water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 58 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 95 billion m3 when the 25 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 71 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 1 09 billion m3 when the 75 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 42 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 76 billion m3 when the 90 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 29 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 63 billion m3 when other guarantee rates come in the water discharged from the zhengyixia gorge is calculated by linear interpolation based on the guaranteed rates the average water consumption distributed to the middle hrb is 0 63 billion m3 jiang et al 2019 to complete the releasing goal of the zhengyixia section the middle hrb developed 496 33 km2 of water saving irrigation area from 2000 to 2017 accounting for 42 42 of the cultivated area geng 2021 according to the 97 wds there is still a certain gap between the discharge of the zhengyixia section and the scheme the possible reason is the occurrence of iep in the middle hrb therefore this paper studies the scale effect of the iep in the middle hrb this paper studies iep at three scales basin scale irrigation district scale and field scale the basin scale refers to the middle hrb the irrigation district scale refers to the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb the field scale refers to the fields that make up the irrigation district 2 2 inflow evapotranspiration transpiration and return flow at the field scale inflow water i includes surface water diversion is groundwater extraction ig and precipitation p without considering precipitation p the field inflow can be expressed as follows i is ig p is ig is and ig are not distinguished collectively referred to as surface water diversion and groundwater extraction isg the formula becomes i isg the author s research group obtained the isg from the survey on the field irrigation water of farmers in the study area under different irrigation methods in october 2020 the crop evapotranspiration was expressed by the net irrigation water provided by the water resource management office of yingke irrigation district the net irrigation water in the field was the amount of irrigated water the crops could use crop evapotranspiration is the water consumed by the crops with a lack of precipitation p and groundwater at closer depths crop growth depended on irrigation therefore the net irrigation water can represent crop evapotranspiration shen et al 2013 the net irrigation water in the field was calculated from the field test method by measuring the change in the field water volume before and after irrigation in typical fields chen et al 2022 shen et al 2013 crop evapotranspiration et m3 was estimated as eq 1 1 et w net i 1 n 667 γ h θ gi θ oi where w net m3 represents net irrigation water h denotes the planned wet layer depth of the field during the irrigation period γ is the dry bulk density of the soil at depth h of the field θ oi and θ gi are the soil moisture content at depth h before and after the ith irrigation respectively n is the number of irrigations the inflow to the irrigation district was the sum of surface water diversion groundwater extraction and precipitation i is ig p isg p inflow to the middle hrb was the sum of the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the inflow from liyuanhe and the precipitation minus the discharge of zhengyixia gorge i is ig p isg p where is iyingluoxia i liyuanhe i zhengyixia ig 0 the above data were obtained from the heihe river bureau the water affairs bureau of zhangye and various counties the modis16a3 estimates evapotranspiration at irrigation district and basin scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m available at https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov the et algorithm was based on the penman monteith equation the transpiration data was from the equation of et multiplied by t et et was the irrigation district and basin evapotranspiration obtained by modis16a3 and t et was the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio obtained by the t et dataset of chinese terrestrial ecosystems from 1981 to 2015 available at https doi org 10 17605 osf io merzn the spatial resolution is 0 05 0 05 and the t et data has no unit niu et al 2020 1981 2015 daily precipitation from 1960 to 2014 at the irrigation district and basin scales was obtained by spatial interpolation of gauge precipitation using regional climate model simulation in the hrb with a spatial resolution of 3 km http data tpdc ac cn wang et al 2017 yang 2016 return flow was estimated as the difference between inflow and evapotranspiration additionally all raster data were rescaled to 1 km and resampled for all variables the data was interpolated if necessary 2 3 water accounting framework water accounting analyzes water use consumption and productivity based on water balance molden and sakthivadivel 1999 water accounting includes estimating return flow and evapotranspiration and defining water rights diversion use and consumption berbel et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 perry 2007 proposed an accounting framework for irrigation water fig 2a b which is divided into four parts i beneficial water consumption i e transpiration for crop growth ii non beneficial water consumption i e evaporation from bare soil and weed transpiration iii recoverable return flows i e water return to rivers reservoirs and fresh aquifers iv non recoverable return flows i e seepage into saline aquifers the water accounting framework has been applied in multiple case studies karimi et al 2013a b vardon et al 2007 water accounting can be performed at different scales including field irrigation district and basin grafton et al 2018 perry 2007 water resources follow the law of water balance at any scale and the inflow equals the outflow taking storage changes δ storage as zero the water balance formula for the inflow and outflow grafton et al 2018 can be expressed as 2 inflows i evaporation e transpiration t return flow r where e and t are consumption parts the r is non consumption parts which may also be referred to as subsurface recharge re and surface runoff ru r re ru 2 4 judgment method of iep at different scales and scale effect 2 4 1 irrigation efficiency at the field scale ie is the ratio of beneficial irrigation water primarily crop et to total irrigation water from yearly crop evapotranspiration per unit of land liu 2016 grafton et al 2018 at the irrigation district scale and basin scale ie refers to the ratio of evapotranspiration to water withdrawal from the mainstream during the crop growth period equivalent to the chinese irrigation water utilization coefficient zhou et al 2013 the same formula may be used to calculate ie at the irrigation district and basin scales for its applicability at the field scale grafton et al 2018 the ie cet and beneficial ie ct are calculated as follows 3 c et c e c t et i 4 c t t i measures for increasing ie differ between field scales and larger scales the field scale refers to converting flood irrigation to water saving irrigation such as drip irrigation pipe irrigation or sprinkler irrigation grafton et al 2018 other water saving irrigation measures can also increase ie such as plastic film mulching furrow irrigation ridge furrow irrigation and channel anti seepage however these measures save less consumption water and are therefore not discussed in this paper the irrigation district scale or basin scale refers to expanding the water saving irrigation area drip or sprinkler irrigation area if the same formula is used to quantify ie at the field and larger scales improving ie at the field scale can either increase or decrease ie at larger scales the reasons are as follows firstly non consumable r at the field scale is recovered and reused resulting in higher ie at the irrigation district scale or basin scale xiong et al 2021 secondly the water cycle at the basin scale is much more complex than at the field scale government subsidized advanced irrigation technologies may encourage the expansion of irrigated land resulting in greater water consumption at the basin scale xiong et al 2021 xu and song 2022 if the newly developed irrigated area is dominated by flood irrigation ie at the basin scale may decrease but the iep occurs finally the basin scale influences ie by planting structure precipitation and water diversion therefore this paper uses the increase of water saving irrigation area to represent the increasing ie at the irrigation district and basin scale 2 4 2 iep the iep is a particular jevons paradox the jevons paradox also known as the rebound effect asserts that total coal consumption will rise as coal use efficiency increases jevons 1865 alcott 2008 in industrial production coal is consumed however in irrigation water water use water extraction the consumed components are e and t while the non consumed components are recoverable r and non recoverable r perry 2007 burt et al 1997 berbel et al 2018 implementing irrigation modernization drip sprinkler in agricultural water management may unintendedly increase water use or consumption i or et in the field or on a broader scale a phenomenon known as the iep gutierrez martin and gomez 2011 berbel et al 2018 xu and song 2022 in the jevons paradox high efficiency is associated with high levels of resource consumption they are correlations rather than causal polimeni and polimeni 2006 york 2006 causal may be one of the processes in the complex coupling process of efficiency and resource consumption there are three possible correlations between high efficiency and resource consumption first the association may be incidental e g chance co trending where factors unrelated to efficiency are gained to the high levels of resource consumption second through various mechanisms potentially both direct and indirect efficiency spurs production and consumption and does so enough to overwhelm the direct gains from efficiency itself third the same process may drive efficiency and consumption york and mcgee 2016 based on the correlations rather than causal between improving ie and water consumption we proposed a judgment method of the iep 2 4 3 judgment method of iep at the different scale we first proposed a judgment method of iep eq 5 and eq 6 to judge the occurrence of iep at different scales according to the definition of iep at the field scale the iep was judged according to its definition water use or consumption increased when the ie increased from flood to drip irrigation the increased ie cet can be expressed by cet in drip irrigation minus cet in flood irrigation cet in drip irrigation is higher than in flood irrigation fig 2b therefore cet 0 water use at the field scale refers to surface water diversion and groundwater extraction isg without considering precipitation p the increased isg isg can be expressed by isg in drip irrigation minus isg in flood irrigation water consumption refers to et no separation is made due to the difficulty of separating t from et the increased et et can be expressed by et in drip irrigation minus in flood irrigation the following formula can determine the field scale iep 5 when δ c et 0 δlsg 0 or δet 0 iep occurs δisg 0 δet 0 iep does not occurs where cet is ie isg is surface water diversion and groundwater extraction et is evapotranspiration the sum of e and t cet is equal to cet in drip irrigation minus cet in flood irrigation isg refers to isg in drip irrigation minus isg in flood irrigation et refers to et in drip irrigation minus et in flood irrigation at the irrigation district and basin scale iep was judged according to its definition water use or consumption increased when the ie increased from flood to drip irrigation the increased ie cet can be expressed by expanding the water saving irrigation areas because measures for cet refer to expanding the water saving irrigation area at the irrigation district scale or basin scale after 2000 the water saving irrigation drip and sprinkler irrigation area in the middle hrb saw an annual increase cai et al 2022 from 2000 to 2017 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb developed 496 33 km2 of water saving irrigation areas geng 2021 therefore cet 0 in water use distinguishing between i and isg is necessary for i is the sum of p and isg grafton et al 2018 since 2000 p has been increasing while isg has been decreasing cai et al 2022 geng et al 2021 at the irrigation district scale the increased i i can be expressed by i in 2018 minus i in 2000 and the increased isg isg can be expressed by isg in 2018 minus isg in 2000 at the basin scale i have two cases 1 i in 2018 minus i in 2000 2 i in t 1 minus i in t the range of t is 2000 2018 isg has two cases 1 isg in 2018 minus isg in 2000 2 isg in t 1 minus isg in t the range of t is 2000 2018 water resources in the middle hrb come from the mainstream of the heihe river the groundwater is recharged by surface water so isg at the basin scale only refers to surface water diversion in water consumption distinguishing between et and t is necessary the satellite based et product is employed to distinguish between et and t at the irrigation district scale the increased et et can be expressed by et in 2018 minus et in 2000 and the increased t t can be expressed by t in 2018 minus t in 2000 at the basin scale et has two cases 1 et in 2018 minus et in 2000 2 et in t 1 minus et in t the range of t is 2000 2018 t has two cases 1 t in 2018 minus t in 2000 2 t in t 1 minus t in t the range of t is 2000 2018 the following equation determines the iep at irrigation district and basin scales 6 when δ c et 0 δi 0 or δisg 0 or δet 0 or δt 0 iep occurs δi 0 δisg 0 δet 0 δt 0 iep does not occurs where water resources in the middle hrb come from the mainstream of the heihe river the groundwater is recharged by surface water so isg at the basin scale only refers to surface water diversion 2 4 4 scale effects of the iep the scale effect was analyzed by comparing the difference and connection of iep between different scales based on judging whether iep occurs at the field irrigation district or basin scale 3 result 3 1 iep at field scale through the field test method and farmer surveys the average et and average isg of different crop types under different irrigation methods at the field scale were determined as shown in fig 3 as far as et is concerned 33 representative fields with more crop types and irrigation methods in the study area were selected to calculate their water consumption each representative field has a crop type irrigation method and water consumption the crop types have corn winter wheat seed corn vegetables and fruits irrigation methods have flood irrigation and drip irrigation water saving irrigation in 33 representative fields corn was irrigated by flood irrigation winter wheat was irrigated by flood irrigation vegetables and fruits were irrigated by drip irrigation and seed corn was irrigated by flood and drip irrigation the average et for a certain crop type and irrigation method is obtained by averaging the et of representative fields with the same crop type and irrigation method which can be ranked as et seed corn flood 473 m3 mu et seed corn drip 311 m3 mu et corn flood 306 m3 mu et winter wheat flood 298 m3 mu et vegetable and fruit drip 269 m3 mu through the farmer survey the corresponding isg is obtained and ranked as i sgseed corn flood 1044 m3 mu isg seed corn drip 1011 m3 mu isg corn flood 800 m3 mu isg winter wheat flood 560 m3 mu isg vegetable and fruit drip 300 m3 mu mu a unit for measuring area that is commonly 666 7 square meters when evaluated by et the field scale iep may or may not occur fig 4a no iep occurred when switching from flood to drip irrigation in the following two situations 1 et could decrease without changing crop types for instance with seed corn switched from flood irrigation to drip irrigation the et was reduced from 473 m3 mu to 310 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from types with high et to low et for instance from flood irrigated seed corn 473 m3 mu corn 306 m3 mu and winter wheat 298 m3 mu to drip irrigated vegetables and fruits 269 m3 mu the iep occurred when switching from flood irrigation to drip irrigation under two situations 1 crops were changed from types with low et to types with high et for instance from flood irrigated corn 306 m3 mu and winter wheat 298 m3 mu to drip irrigated seed corn 311 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from any types with low et to greenhouse vegetables and fruits with a 3 4 times growth period and high et for instance from flood irrigated seed corn 473 m3 mu corn 306 m3 mu and winter wheat 298 m3 mu to drip irrigated greenhouse vegetables and fruits 806 m3 mu when evaluated by isg the field scale iep may or may not occur fig 4b no iep occurred when switching from flood irrigation to drip irrigation in the following two situations 1 isg could decrease without changing crop types for instance with seed corn from flood to drip irrigation the isg is decreased from 1044 m3 mu to 1011 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from types with high isg to types with low isg for instance from flood irrigated seed corn 1044 m3 mu corn 800 m3 mu and winter wheat 560 m3 mu to drip irrigated vegetables and fruits 300 m3 mu the iep occurred when switching from flood irrigation to drip irrigation under two situations 1 crops were changed from types with low isg to types with high isg for instance from flood irrigated corn 800 m3 mu and winter wheat 560 m3 mu to drip irrigated seed corn 1011 m3 mu 2 crops were changed from types with low isg to greenhouse vegetables and fruits with 3 4 times growth period and high isg for instance from flood irrigated corn 800 m3 mu and winter wheat 560 m3 mu to drip irrigated greenhouse vegetables and fruits 900 m3 mu 3 2 iep at irrigation district scale we calculated the i isg et and t of each irrigation district in the middle hrb from 2000 to 2018 moreover the iep in each irrigation district was judged according to eq 6 the iep at the irrigation district scale is shown in table 1 and fig 5 when evaluated by et the iep occurs in 13 irrigation districts when evaluated by t the iep occurs in 13 irrigation districts when evaluated by i the iep occurs in daman yingke yanuan and luocheng irrigation districts but does not occur in the other 9 irrigation districts when evaluated by isg the iep occurs in yingke and yanuan irrigation districts but not in the other 11 irrigation districts in yingke and yanuan iep occurs evaluated by et t i or isg in daman and luocheng iep occurs evaluated by et t or i but not by isg in xijun shangsan banqiao pingchuan liaoquan shahe liyuanhe youlian and liuba iep occurs evaluated by et or t but not by i and isg 3 3 iep at basin scale at the basin scale in the middle hrb the iep is affected by the time scale which is different from the annual scale to the 19 year scale from 2000 2018 the iep occurs evaluated by et or t at the basin scale however the iep did not occur evaluated by isg and i fig 6 et and t increased by 0 26 billion m3 and 0 212 billion m3 respectively et 0 t 0 the increased et is dominated by t accounting for 81 54 isg and i decreased by 0 125 billion m3 and 0 006 billion m3 i 0 isg 0 respectively the reduction in isg was much more significant than in i due to the increased p partially offsetting the decrease in isg in the middle hrb since 2000 at the basin scale with the expansion of water saving irrigation areas in the middle hrb whether the iep occurs at the year scale has six situations as follows fig 7 1 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by one of et t i and isg iep does not occur such as in the years 2001 2004 2006 and 2018 2 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by t iep occurs while evaluated by one of et i isg iep does not occur such as in the years 2008 and 2011 3 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by et or t iep occurs while evaluated by i or isg iep does not occur such as in the years 2010 2013 2015 and 2016 4 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by i or isg iep occurs while evaluated by et or t iep does not occur such as in the year 2012 5 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by one of et i isg iep occurs while evaluated by t iep does not occur such as in the year 2009 6 when et 0 t 0 i 0 isg 0 evaluated by one of et t i isg iep occurs such as in the years 2002 2003 2005 2007 2014 and 2017 situations 1 3 and 6 have a high frequency from 2000 to 2018 it can be seen that the occurrence of iep at the year scale is affected by the selection of evaluation indicators in addition et t i and isg fluctuate yearly resulting in a fluctuating trend of iep iep occurs in some years but not in others 3 4 scale effects of iep scale effects of iep occurred at the field irrigation districts and basin scales fig 8 evaluated by et and t the scale effect occurred because iep does not necessarily occur at the field scale but at the irrigation district scale and basin scale at the field scale the iep will not occur in the two cases 1 without changing planting types and growth period the irrigation method was changed from flood to drip 2 crops were changed from types with flood irrigated high et to types with drip irrigated low et in comparison the iep will occur in two cases 1 crops were changed from types with flood irrigated low et to types with drip irrigated high et 2 crops were changed from any types with flood irrigated low et to drip irrigated greenhouse vegetables and fruits with 3 4 times growth period and high et at the irrigation district scale the iep occurred in 13 irrigation districts because of the combination of different crop types irrigation methods growth periods and cultivated areas at the field scale at the basin scale the iep occurred because et and t increased in 13 irrigation districts evaluated by i and isg the scale effect occurred because iep may occur at the field and irrigation district scales but not occur at the basin scale at the field scale as ie improves the iep will not occur in the two cases 1 without changing the planting types and growth period the irrigation method is changed from flood to drip 2 crops were changed from types with flood irrigation high isg to types with drip irrigation low isg in comparison the iep will occur in two cases 1 without changing growth period crops were changed from types with flood irrigation low isg to types with drip irrigation high isg 2 with changing growth period crops were changed from types with flood irrigation low isg to greenhouse vegetables and fruits with drip irrigation 3 4 times growth period and high isg at the irrigation district scale evaluated by i the iep occurred in 4 of 13 irrigation districts daman yingke yanuan and luocheng evaluated by isg the iep occurred in 2 of 13 irrigation districts yingke and yanuan the reason was that the combination of different crop types irrigation methods growth periods and cultivated areas at the field scale increased i in daman yingke yanuan and luocheng as well as isg in yingke and yanuan at the basin scale the iep did not occur because the increase and decrease in i and isg of the 13 irrigation districts caused the decrease in i and isg in the middle hrb 4 discussion 4 1 increased ie does not necessarily increase et at the field scale scholars believe higher ie increases et at the field scale assuming that yield would be proportionate to et ward and pulido velazquez 2008 however we found that in the middle hrb higher ie does not necessarily increase et firstly et was reduced by increasing ie without changing crop type and growing period under high ie drip irrigation seed corn plant height and ear were lower and the growth period was two days shorter than low ie flood irrigation but with higher corn yield zhao 2018 secondly et is no longer proportionate to yield as ie improves at the field scale et could be reduced by increasing ie and yields however in prior research yield is assumed to be proportional to et with increasing ie the iep is caused by the increase in et due to the increase in yield berbel et al 2018 liu 2016 finally farmer decisions impact whether or not et increases further whether the iep occurs berbel et al 2018 instead of profit maximization farmers choose the most advantageous crop combination based on market demand planting experience government direction the influence of friends and irrigation methods it is conceivable for farmers to decide to transition from high et to low et crops or from low et to high et crops resulting in changes in et at the field scale 4 2 scaling effect of iep evaluated by isg and i evaluated by isg and i the reason for the scale effect of iep is that isg and i decrease at the basin scale but both increase and decrease at the irrigation district and field scales at the basin scale iep was not identified due to the reduced isg from 2000 to 2018 the water diversion to the middle hrb was reduced to meet the downstream requirement based on the 97 wds promulgated by the state council in 1997 leading to the lower isg and i in the middle hrb at the irrigation district scale evaluated by isg iep was identified in 2 of the 13 irrigation districts evaluated by i iep was identified in 4 of the 13 irrigation districts the isg of the two irrigation districts yingke and yanuan allocated by the basin scale increased from 2000 to 2018 to satisfy greenhouse vegetables and fruits water demand for the four irrigation districts i increased in yingke and yanuan for the increased isg and daman and luocheng for the increased precipitation at the field scale iep was identified in 4 of 9 situations the iep is affected by the amount time and frequency of isg allocated to the field scale by the irrigation district scale which further influences the planting structure irrigation methods and cultivated areas of farmers 4 3 scale effect of iep evaluated by et and t evaluated by et and t there are two reasons for the scale effect of iep firstly r is considered a loss at the field scale but recovered and utilized at the irrigation district and basin scales secondly at the field scale only some farmers but not all tend to plant high water consuming crops and expand the cultivated area after implementing water saving irrigation at the basin scale iep was identified due to the increased et and t from the water balance perspective eq 2 i will be converted into et and r when i changed nothing or very little r decreased but et increased fig 6 the decreased r was converted into increased et the decrease in r was due to water saving irrigation under flood irrigation r accounted for 30 of isg while under drip irrigation r accounted for 5 of isg 496 33 km2 of water saving irrigation areas was developed from 2000 to 2017 the increase in et and t was due to the high et crops the greenhouse vegetables and fruits and the expansion of the cultivated areas et will increase from other crops with flood irrigation to seed corn with drip irrigation the proportion of seed corn area increased from 15 76 in 2004 to 46 4 in 2016 the number of greenhouses is growing annually due to its high profit the cultivated area increased by 291 55 km2 in the middle hrb from 2000 to 2015 jiang 2020 jiang et al 2019 at the irrigation district scale iep was identified in all 13 irrigation districts due to the increased et and t water saving irrigation areas and the proportion of seed corn area and greenhouse vegetables and fruits increased the cultivated area increased in 12 of the 13 irrigated districts while only the irrigation district in banqiao decreased by 1 km2 at the field scale iep was identified in 5 of 9 situations farmers cultivate according to their own planting experience the agricultural industry development guidance of the government cultivated area labor force education water source available and irrigation method farmers typically switch from corn and winter wheat with low et to seed corn greenhouse vegetables and fruits with high et expanding the cultivated area to increase income 4 4 the time scale influences the scale effect the scale effect relates to temporal scales as well at the 19 year scale and the annual scale the scale effect of the iep is different due to differences in the precipitation the soil water storage the abundance of water from upstream and the planting structure on the 19 year scale the scale effect results in section 3 4 are achieved on the annual scale at the irrigation districts and basin scale iep does not necessarily occur due to changes in the precipitation the soil water storage the cultivated areas the abundance of water from upstream and the planting structure the inner mechanism that generates the scale effect of the iep needs further investigation 4 5 scale effects of iep and regional agricultural characteristics the scale effect of the iep is related to regional agricultural characteristics for semi arid northern china the iep is less likely to occur because urbanization promoted by economic development may reduce cultivated areas the saved isg has no cultivated area to irrigate liu 2016 for the arid region of bazhou china the iep occurs for et increase the increased et was because water saved by water saving irrigation is used to expand more cultivated areas liu 2016 for valencia region the iep does not occur with a depressed citrus market aging of farmers rising temperature and decreasing water availability it is difficult to switch to other more productive crops in the short term and the abandonment of the cultivated area is quite apparent resulting in the decreased isg and et sanchis ibor et al 2017 for hetao irrigation district of the yellow river basin located in a drought desert mainly relies on water from the yellow river for irrigation and has a severe water scarcity the main reasons for the iep are the expansion of cultivated areas and the increase in the proportion of irrigated areas xu and song 2022 however water resources are allocated uniformly throughout the yellow river basin agricultural irrigation water can only be supplemented by pumping more groundwater when the total water diversion increases and the surface water diversion right decreases ma et al 2010 zhang argued that with limited water resources and unlimited irrigated land the water use would not change while the water consumption would increase slightly at the field scale with a relatively high reuse of return flow water consumption will increase slightly at the basin scale zhang et al 2019 limited water resources and unlimited irrigated land characterize the hrb to complete the releasing indicator of the 79 wds the water diversion from the mainstream of the heihe river in the middle hrb will inevitably decrease nevertheless the allocation of water resources within the middle hrb is unrestricted and water diversions in some irrigation districts may also increase therefore evaluated by inflow the iep does not occur at the basin scale but may occur at the irrigation district scale with limited water diversion improving ie converts unconsumed return flow at the field scale into water consumption or beneficial water consumption at the irrigation district or basin scale therefore evaluated by evapotranspiration or transpiration the iep occurs at the irrigation district and basin scales 4 6 the selection of evaluation indexes for iep when ie is not improved return flow that is not consumed at the field scale is returned to the water system and can be reused downstream so it is important to distinguish between water use and water consumption when exploring the impact of improved ie berbel et al 2018 it is necessary to study the impact of efficiency improvements on water use and consumption under alternative constraints on water and land supply but this has received less attention in the literature zhang et al 2019 existing studies have obtained contradictory or ambiguous results on whether there is a paradox after improving ie the reasons may be no distinction between water use and water consumption analysis on different scales different assumptions behind the methodology or other influencing factors zhang et al 2019 in the middle hrb a place with limited water supply but unlimited land resources it seems necessary to evaluate the iep by distinguishing water use and consumption at different spatial scales water use includes surface water diversion is groundwater extraction ig and precipitation i isg p the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation in arid regions like the middle hrb greatly impact agricultural water use in water resource management the government often manages isg especially in the hrb where abundant surface water diversion is is used for water distribution to the middle and lower reaches for better water management we distinguish between isg and i water consumption et can be divided into beneficial water consumption t and non beneficial water consumption e perry 2007 the increase in beneficial water consumption t due to increased ie must be fully offset by decreases in non beneficial water consumption e recoverable return flows to surface water or groundwater and non recoverable return flows r grafton et al 2018 therefore a distinction is made between water consumption et and beneficial water consumption t 4 7 suggestions for water resources management taking t as the evaluation index when t increases and e decreases as long as et does not increase the iep is allowed evaluated by et the following policies can be adopted to prevent the iep guide farmers to plant crops with low water consumption but high economic returns determine the reasonable cultivated area to expand according to the saved water under the condition that the amount of surface water diversion is controlled the extraction of groundwater shall be strictly controlled to ensure that the groundwater level does not drop evaluated by i and isg it is allowed that the iep does not occur at the basin scale but at some irrigation districts because of spatial differences in regional agricultural development however with the decrease of isg in the middle hrb iep does not occur at the basin scale and it is still difficult to meet the releasing indicator stated by the 97 wds the total amount of surface water diversion in the middle hrb is certain and the surface and ground water are frequently converted in order to meet the releasing indicator a possible solution is to control the amount of groundwater extraction strictly it can be seen that the iep study serves water resources management and it is not enough to only study whether the iep occurs for water resources management it is necessary to consider local water management policy select reasonable evaluation indicators and spatial scales and take measures consistent with local water resource management et is the most suitable for evaluating iep and studying water resource management in the middle hrb 5 conclusion in the middle hrb an arid region with limited water resources and unlimited cultivated area by implementing water saving irrigation to complete the releasing goal of the 97 wds we analyzed the scale effect of the iep based on the water accounting framework and the concept of iep a method for judging iep at different spatial scales was proposed the iep at different spatial scales was evaluated furthermore the scale effect was analyzed based on the difference and connection of the iep at different spatial scales our findings indicated that the scale effect of the iep did exist in the middle hrb this thesis has provided more profound insights into 1 the difference and relationship between field scale and larger scale ie increased ie at the irrigation district and basin scale should increase water saving irrigation areas rather than the increased ratio of et i 2 based on the water accounting framework and the concept of the iep a method for judging the iep at different spatial scales is proposed the iep at different spatial scales is judged 3 evaluated by et t i and isg the scale effect of the iep is analyzed respectively 4 reason for the scale effect of iep is analyzed 5 the relationship between iep and time scale is analyzed several limitations need to be noted regarding the present study first while water accounting at different scales the storage variable is regarded as zero the results are limited without considering the soil water storage at the field scale and storage variables at the irrigation district and basin scale further work needs to be carried out to evaluate the fluctuation of storage variables at different spatial scales second in this paper we only analyzed the scale effect of the iep and discussed the reasons for the scale effect the intrinsic mechanism of scale effect in iep how iep occurs by water saving irrigation farmers planting behavior expansion of cultivated adjustment of planting structure water diversion water consumption policies and other variables interact should be further analyzed in the future to put forward better suggestions to prevent potential iep third there was no distinction between t and et at the field scale due to data availability four iep uncertainty is associated with the input data mod16 et one of several global et products that typically differ substantially for a given study area simons et al 2016 this limitation leads to uncertainty in the assessment of the iep the research results in this paper are only applicable to arid regions like hrb where water resources are limited and need to be diverted downstream and the cultivated area is unlimited the study offers reference to the evaluation of iep scale effect in arid regions

9133,the physical based and machine learning ml models are two distinctive tools for predicting soil salt content ssc however few studies have compared their performances and it is yet unknown how they differ in terms of simulation accuracy at the field scale to address this issue based on a field experiment with sunflowers a physical based model and three ml models including distributed random forest drf gradient boosting machine gbm and deep learning deeplearning were developed to predict ssc in two common scenarios a and b in scenario a the ssc was predicted using the training dataset in the in situ field while in scenario b the ssc was predicted with the training dataset from the other fields results show that the physical based model remains an accurate tool to predict ssc ml models hold a similar prediction capacity with specific algorithms and input variables in scenario a with limited input variables of the initial status of ssc and related spatiotemporal information the drf model achieved better simulation accuracies r2 higher by 0 05 0 37 nrmse lower by 0 0 19 than the other two ml models however as more input variables were added the simulation accuracies of the gbm model gradually improved nrmse decreased from 0 61 to 0 30 and eventually outperformed the drf model although the variable importance was significant in the deeplearning model poor simulation performances were obtained in scenario a however in scenario b the simulation accuracy of the deeplearning model was higher than other ml models especially for the ssc prediction at the deep soil and during the crop s late growth period the median of the nrmse boxplot approaching 0 31 these simulation results indicated the potential of ml models to substitute the physical based model for ssc prediction still the preferred ml model differs depending on the prediction scenarios and input variables keywords soil salt prediction sunflower swap model distributed random forest gradient boosting machine deep learning variable importance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil salinization is a soil degradation threatening soil fertility biological activity and agricultural productivity butcher et al 2016 hassani et al 2020 over 10 of the worldwide irrigated land and 8 31 11 73 mkm2 of soils suffer salinization aquastat 2011 hassani et al 2021 which might result in annual losses of more than 10 billion us dollars qadir et al 2014 many techniques including irrigation leaching fertilizer optimization chemical amendments and planting of salt tolerant crops are applied to alleviate the adverse effects of soil salinization zeng et al 2016 cuevas et al 2019 liu et al 2022 to develop a sustainable strategy for these treatments it is essential to precisely predict the spatiotemporal variations of salt status at the field scale payo et al 2017 ivushkin et al 2019 the physical based model is a typical method to predict soil salt dynamics šimůnek et al 2005 kroes et al 2017 according to differences in model development and solution methodology two types of physical based models the mass balance model and the numerical model have been proposed for simulating salt transport sun et al 2019 the mass balance model is developed from the principle of solute mass conservation in this model the soil salt in the root zone is quantified by multiple independent physical processes including the salt recharge and leaching from irrigation precipitation capillary rise etc the mass balance model is widely used in the aquacrop foster et al 2017 saltmod zhang et al 2022b saltirsoil visconti et al 2011 and oasis mod askri et al 2010 models due to its simplicity of the solution however the mass balance model is commonly used to simulate soil salt status over a large scale and spanning a relatively long time eishoeei et al 2019 singh 2022 moreover its simulation accuracy is constrained by the simulation uncertainty of the associated influential processes de louw et al 2011 sun et al 2019 unlike the mass balance model the numerical model describes the convection dispersion and diffusion of solutes in soil based on the convection dispersion equation cde the salt transport could be successfully simulated at an adequate space and time scale in the well known agro hydrology models such as hydrus feng et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a and swap kumar et al 2015 lei et al 2021 the salt transport process is quantified by the numerical model however a more stringent requirement is imposed on its solution because the numerical model not only accounts for the transport of solutes but also requires the solution of soil water dynamics provided by the richards equation the unusual initial conditions boundaries and grid size could easily induce numerical dispersion and oscillation issues kamalyar et al 2014 zha et al 2019 moreover the physical parameters in the richards equation and cde such as soil hydraulic conductivity water retention capacity and coefficients of dispersion and diffusion inevitably exhibit a spatiotemporal heterogeneity at the field scale kargas et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 for these reasons cautious parameter calibration is generally required for numerical model application in recent years owing to their powerful learning ability machine learning ml models have been widely used in many predictive applications including for the predictions of meteorological factors plant transpiration and crop growth fan et al 2021 chen et al 2022 dong et al 2022 in soil physics ml models such as artificial neural networks decision tree support vector machine etc have also been used to build soil maps and soil transfer functions related to soil water organic carbon and pollutants padarian et al 2020 wadoux et al 2020 several studies have investigated the simulation difference between the physical based and the ml models such as for soil water prediction karandish and šimůnek 2016 found hydrus 2d model holds the highest simulation accuracy while the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems and support vector machine models can obtain close simulation accuracy with simple input data still they also found that the ml model does not well predict sharp changes in soil water content during irrigation li et al 2020 found that richards based soil water simulations were more susceptible to soil heterogeneity initial conditions and boundary conditions while artificial neural network models were difficult for simulating the peaks and valleys of soil water changes fewer ml models have been developed to predict soil salt dynamics compared with soil water prediction three categories of ml applications can be identified for soil salt prediction based on the differences in predictor types and simulation objects one is focused on predicting soil surface salinity using the spectral information or features of the remote sensing image as in studies of wang and wang 2019 wang et al 2020 and habibi et al 2021 besides some studies have described the in situ variations of soil salinity based on ml models such as zou et al 2010 predicted the dynamic changes in soil water and salinity using artificial neural networks and autoregressive integrated moving averages moreover some attempts have employed ml models to predict soil salinity using its influential factors for example sarangi et al 2006 predicted soil and drainage salinity of paddy fields using irrigation depth evapotranspiration drain discharges water table depths etc based on an ensemble regression tree model hassani et al 2020 2021 predicted the soil salinity dynamics at a global scale using predictors including soil classification texture soil field capacity topography elevation etc although the above studies have demonstrated the feasibility of the ml algorithms for predicting soil salinity most studies neglected the vertical heterogeneity of soil salinity in the root zone which is crucial for quantifying the salt stress in soil plant water transport models feddes et al 1978 lei et al 2019 moreover it is still being determined what extent they differ from physical based models in terms of prediction accuracy at the field scale particularly the simulation results of ml models are closely correlated with the implicated information in the training dataset but this varies depending on specific predictions such as soil salinity prediction at the in situ field or different fields it is essential to clarify the disparities in prediction between physical based and ml models in different prediction scenarios to address the above issues taking the two years of field experiments planting with sunflower as the background a physical based numerical model and three typical ml models including distributed random forest drf gradient boosting machine gbm and deep learning deeplearning were developed to predict the spatiotemporal variations of soil salt content ssc in two common scenarios a and b in scenario a the ssc during the crop s late growth period was predicted based on the training dataset at the in situ field while in scenario b the ssc during the whole growth period of the crop was predicted based on the training dataset from other fields the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a physical based and three ml models for ssc predictions based on different calibration strategies and combinations of input variables cois 2 to compare the simulation accuracy of the ml and physical models for ssc prediction 3 to identify the optimal ml model for ssc predictions in different scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment data the field experiment was conducted at the yonglian experiment station in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia 108

annual evaporation approaches 2000 mm the experiment was carried out in nine field plots naturally with different initial soil salinity 1 05 ds m 1 ece 10 32 ds m 1 six of which were conducted in 2016 field id 1 6 and the other three were in 2017 field id 7 9 the sunflower helianthus annuus l was sown by the hill drop method on june 5 2016 and may 27 2017 the row and plant spacing were controlled as 50 cm 50 cm surface flood irrigation was applied before the plant sowing the irrigation depth was nearly 30 cm then no irrigation was applied during the crop growth the crops were harvested on september 19 2016 and september 15 2017 the experimental indicators including volumetric soil water content swc and ssc meteorological data groundwater level groundwater leaf area index lai crop height height and root length density rld were dynamically observed during the crop growth period the meteorological data fig 1 including solar radiation temperature wind speed and rainfall were monitored hourly by an auto meteorological station installed at the experimental site the daily status of meteorological data was taken as the average of the observations during the day the lai converted from the crop s green leaf area and plant density the rld was separately identified from the scanning images of roots at seven soil layers 15 cm a layer which were observed by the minirhizotron methods using the root 700 root growth monitoring system ecomatik munich germany the detailed sampling method and frequency of crop indicators can be found in wu et al 2022 the soil samples were collected from three points randomly distributed in each field plot by the core sampling method the average status of swc and ssw in each field was indicated by three soil samples swc was measured by oven drying 105 for 8 h ssc was characterized by saturated electrical conductivity ece ds m 1 which was converted by ec1 5 ece 7 4 ec1 5 the ec1 5 ds m 1 was measured as the electrical conductivity of soil solution with dry soil and deionized water mixed volume ratio of both was 1 5 zeng et al 2016 the soil sampling depth was 100 cm and the sampling interval was 10 cm at the 0 40 cm soil layer and 20 cm at the 40 100 cm soil layer the dynamics of ssc at different depths in each field are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the ssc of field id 1 2 and field 8 was relatively low during the whole observation ece 4 ds m 1 while the ssc of other fields presented an accumulative trend 4 ds m 1 ece 12 ds m 1 especially in fields 5 7 the ece reached 9 12 ds m 1 in the late observation stage days after sowing das 60 and the ece in field 7 increased nearly 5 10 ds m 1 compared with it on sowing day 2 2 physical based model 2 2 1 soil water and salt transport modeling a physical based model swap soil water atmosphere plant was used to simulate the dynamic transport of soil water and salt in the fields the swap model was developed by the wageningen environmental research center and wageningen university kroes et al 2017 it can quantify the multiple mass and energy transport at the field scale between the vegetation canopy and the vadose zone the soil water

was simulated in a soil profile of 0 100 cm vertically discretized in 2 cm layers the upper and lower boundaries of the soil profile were controlled by atmospheric conditions and groundwater tables respectively the crop growth simulation module in the swap model was closed the daily crop indicators of lai and plant height in the penman monteith equation and the rld in the feddes jarvis model jarvis 1989 were selected as inputs which were linear interpolated based on the experimental observations the potential soil evaporation was determined by the reference crop evapotranspiration by setting the soil factor according to the recommended value in the swap model cfbs 0 5 the reduction of soil evaporation was estimated by the black model black et al 1969 the simulation starts on the sowing day and ends on the harvest day the initial conditions of the soil water and salt status were determined by experimental observations 2 2 3 parameter calibration in the physical based model the parameters of the soil water and salt transport in the van genuchten function and cde the thresholds of water and salinity stress the critical compensatory factors in the feddes jarvis model and the solute concentration in the groundwater cw were calibrated based on the experimental data the parameter of soil water ks α n θs and θr and salt ddis transport parameters were hierarchically calibrated according to 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm meanwhile to reduce the parameter dimension in the calibration based on the soil transfer function of rosseta schaap et al 2001 the basic soil water transport parameters of different fields were first determined using soil physical properties of soil texture and bulk density then taking these fundamental values as a whole their multiples were calibrated the observed variables of swc and ssc were selected as calibrated targets and the dimensionless values of simulation and observation were calculated to eliminate the dimensional influence as follows 10 y m n o w y m n o w y m o w 11 y m n s w y m n s w y m o w where y m n o w is the nth observed value of the m type variable obtained from the wth observation in the field experiment y m n s w is the corresponding simulated value y m o w is the average observed value of m type variables obtained from the wth observation in the field experiment y m n o w and y m n s w are dimensionless observed and simulated values the average weighted square of the difference between the dimensionless observed and simulated values was taken as the objective function and the same weight was assumed for each group of observed and simulated values in this study the parameters were calibrated using the pest parameter optimization software white et al 2020 the calibrated results are presented in appendix a table a1 3 2 3 ml models to find the appropriate ml models to predict the ssc the prediction performances of two tree based ensemble models of drf and gbm and a neural network model of deeplearning were evaluated 2 3 1 drf model drf is a powerful ensemble bagging ml algorithm breiman 2001 biau and scornet 2016 in drf a forest of individual regression trees weak learners is generated for the regression issue and each tree is applied to a random subset of the dataset fig 3 b taking the gini index as an evaluation criterion a random subset of candidate features is used to determine the most discriminative thresholds picked as the splitting rule a single tree will stop splitting if it reaches a predefined max depth or if no splits satisfy the minimum relative improvement in squared error reduction the final prediction of the drf model is calculated by the average prediction of each independent tree which contributes to making a more robust prediction compared with other individual ml algorithms and to tune the drf model the hyperparameters regarding the number of trees and the columns were optimized based on a 5 fold cross validation by random repeating 100 times the optimized parameters are presented in appendix a table a4 5 the importance measure of splitting variables in each tree was calculated based on the difference in the estimation squared error between that node and its children nodes the importance of each variable was the accumulation of corresponding importance measures over all trees the aggregated values of variable importance were scaled between 0 and 1 such that the most important variable had an importance value of 1 2 3 2 gbm model gbm is a forward ensemble ml algorithm natekin and knoll 2013 which weight integrates multiple weak learners into a strong learner the principle idea of the gbm algorithm is to generate the new base learners to be maximally correlated with the negative gradient of the loss function fig 3 c in this study the classical squared loss function was used to penalize large deviations from the target outputs while neglecting small residuals and conveniently calculate the pseudo residual and optimal solution direction of the iteration step moreover gbm can sequentially generate regression trees on all the features of the dataset in a fully distributed way each tree is built in parallel meanwhile to tune the gbm model the hyperparameters regarding the number of trees the learning rate the maximum tree depth and the column sampling rate were optimized based on a 5 fold cross validation by random repeating 100 times the optimized parameters are presented in appendix a table a4 5 the variable importance of the gbm model was evaluated using the same calculation method as the drf model 2 3 3 deeplearning model deeplearning is a neural network algorithm with a large number of hidden layers fig 3 d lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 in this study a multi layer feedforward artificial neural network was used which is trained with stochastic gradient descent using backpropagation several activation functions e g sigmoid function hyperbolic tangent function and rectified linear unit relu can be used to transform the inputs of a neuron into output in a layer of the network in this study the relu activation function was selected to reduce computation and overfitting problems the hyperparameters regarding the number of times to iterate the dataset the hidden layer sizes the input layer dropout ratio and the adaptive learning rate time decay factor were optimized based on a 5 fold cross validation by random repeating 100 times the optimized parameters are presented in appendix a table a4 5 the variable importance of the deeplearning model was evaluated using the gedeon method gedeon 1997 2 4 simulation strategies in this study the ssc and its related variables refer to the physical based model including initial soil salt content intial ssc das soil depth depth groundwater daily reference evapotranspiration et0 soil texture the relative content of sand silt and clay swc lai and height were collected to build the dataset fig 3 a the spatiotemporal variations of ssc were predicted in scenarios a and b fig 4 in scenario a the dataset with das 80 was selected to train the ml model and calibrate the physical based model and the dataset with das 80 was used to test and validate the model in scenario b the dataset with the samples in seven random field plots was selected to train calibrate the model and the samples from the remaining field plots were utilized to test the model the ssc in each field plot was predicted eight times with different trained models there were two primary differences between these two scenarios one difference was that the training dataset in scenario a contained the implicit information between ssc and input features at the in situ field in contrast scenario b contained implicit information from other fields the other difference was that the training dataset in scenario b included complete information during the entire crop growth period while scenario a did not for the prediction in the physical based model two calibration strategies of indcal and unical were tested according to whether the model parameters were consistent in training field plots in indcal the model parameters were independently calibrated in each field as opposed to unical the model parameters were uniformly calibrated using the data information across all fields regarding ml models five cois coi 1 5 were designed to predict the ssc as shown in table 1 in coi 1 the basic information of das depth and intial ssc were selected as predictors in coi 2 5 the variables regarding environmental conditions groundwater and et0 soil texture the relative content of sand silt and clay swc and crop indicators lai and height were subsequently added 2 5 statistical analysis the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were selected to evaluate the model performances calculated as follows 12 r 2 i 1 m y i o y i s i 1 m y i o i 1 m y i s m 2 i

prediction in scenario a 3 1 1 performance of the physical based model based on the physical based model the ssc was simulated with two calibration strategies of indcal and unical in scenario a the comparisons between observed and simulated ssc are shown in fig 5 in the calibration fig 5 a b the good simulation performances of ssc were obtained with both calibration strategies r2 0 71 rmse 1 35 ds m 1 nrmse 0 3 and nse 0 67 however the performance with the indcal strategy was better than with the unical strategy with r2 higher by 0 11 and rmse lower by 0 31 ds m 1 meanwhile it can be seen that the scatter points of observed simulated ssc with the unical strategy were more discretely distributed on the sides of the 1 1 line especially for the data in fields 7 and 8 in the validation fig 5 c d the simulation accuracies of ssc were lower than those in the calibration r2 rmse nrmse and nse within 0 52 0 61 1 63 1 84 ds m 1 0 28 0 32 and 0 42 0 55 respectively meanwhile similar to calibration the ssc simulation performances with the indcal strategy were better than with the unical strategy with r2 higher by 0 09 and nrmse lower by 0 04 3 1 2 performance of ml models the validation results of ssc in three ml models with different cois are shown in fig 6 regarding the drf model relatively better simulation performances of ssc were obtained with coi 1 4 compared with those of gbm and deeplearning models with r2 higher by 0 05 0 37 rmse and nrmse lower by 0 1 7 ds m 1 and 0 0 19 fig 6 a d it is noteworthy that the simulation performances of the drf model with coi 3 were improved compared with those with coi 1 2 nrmse decreased by 0 1 however the simulation performances with coi 4 5 were comparable to those with coi 3 compared with the drf model the scatter points of the observed simulated ssc of the gbm model with coi 1 4 especially with coi 1 2 were more discretely distributed on the sides of the 1 1 line fig 6 e and nse values were lower than 0 5 fig 6 d however the simulation performances of the gbm model were gradually improved when with coi 1 to coi 5 nrmse decreased from 0 61 to 0 30 and the best simulation performances of three ml models were obtained when the gbm model with coi 5 which was close to the simulation accuracy of the physical based model nse close to 0 5 different from drf and gbm models the simulation accuracy of the deeplearnig model was gradually decreased when with coi 1 4 especially with coi 4 the nrmse over 0 6 although the simulation accuracy of the deeplearnig model with coi 5 was improved compared with that with coi 4 it remained lower than drf and gbm models 3 1 3 variable importance of ml models the variable importance of three ml models with coi 5 is shown in fig 7 the initial ssc was the most important variable in all three ml models while the relative importance of the other variables was different in the three ml models for the drf model the importance of height 0 27 was second only to initial ssc close to the importance of lai the importance of depth and das were also relatively obvious all higher than 0 125 while the importance of swc clay silt sand and et0 was lower no more than 0 1 compared with the drf model the similar importance of silt clay and et0 was obtained in the gbm model however the importance of height depth swc and groundwater were more apparent especially for height the importance was close to 0 75 different from drf and gbm models the importance among different variables was closer in the deeplearning model and the importance of initial ssc height depth and caly were over 0 75 and the importance of other variables was within 0 5 0 75 3 2 prediction in scenario b the four statistical indexes were evaluated in scenario b the nrmse index was selected as a representative in this section and other statistical indexes of r2 rmse and nse are presented in appendix c 3 2 1 performance of the physical based model based on the physical based model the nrmse boxplots of validated ssc with two calibration strategies were compared in different fields time and depths in scenario b fig 8 the main parts of the nrmse boxplot in fields 1 6 were mainly located in 0 18 0 38 which was lower than in the other three fields in fields 7 9 the medians of the boxplot approached 0 25 0 62 compared with the indcal strategy the medians and the differences between the upper and lower quartiles of the nrmse boxplot in different fields and depths were generally lower with the unical strategy moreover except for das 58 and 68 the median differences of nrmse boxplot between the two calibration strategies were generally enlarged over time and eventually over 0 25 on das 110 3 2 2 performance of ml models the nrmse boxplots of validated ssc with three ml models in different fields are shown in fig 9 the main parts of the nrmse boxplot in fields 3 6 were mainly within 0 3 0 45 which was lower than those in other fields the medians of the nrmse boxplot of three ml models in each field except the deeplearning model with coi 5 were generally higher than the physical based model moreover compared with the drf and gbm models the upper and lower quartiles of the nrmse boxplot of the deeplearning model were generally lower with different cois in fields 1 3 5 8 and with coi 5 in fields 2 7 and 9 based on the three ml models with five cois the nrmse boxplots of validated ssc were evaluated under different depths and time as shown in fig 10 compared with depths within 0 50 cm the median and quartiles of nrmse boxplots were lower when the depths were within 50 100 cm meanwhile it was note worthing that the boxplot of the deeplearning model was generally lower than drf and gbm models especially with coi 5 the boxplot median of the deeplearning model approach to 0 31 was close to the physical based model when depths within 50 100 cm and das within 60 110 3 2 3 variable importance of ml models the variable importance of the three ml models with coi 5 in scenario b is shown in fig 11 similar to scenario a the importance of initial ssc was obviously greater than other variables in three ml models and the median of importance boxplot was close to 1 the importance of height was second only to initial ssc especially in the deeplearning model the boxplot median was close to initial ssc however except for initial ssc and height the importance of other variables was different in the three ml models such as the median of importance boxplot of lai was third ranked in the drf and deeplearning models but it was lower than das and clay in the gbm model and the differences between the upper and lower quartiles of importance boxplot of groundwater 0 18 et0 0 17 depth 0 10 das 0 52 and clay 0 34 in the gbm model were greater than those in the drf models moreover compared with drf and gbm models the importance boxplots of different variables were closer and greater in the deeplearning model and medians of the importance boxplot were mainly within 0 55 0 8 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons between physical based and ml models similar to the swc simulation in karandish and šimůnek 2016 and li et al 2020 the highest simulation accuracies of ssc were generally obtained in the physical based model which indicates the physical based model remains an accurate tool for predicting the ssc dynamics however the superior calibration strategy of the physical based model differed in the two scenarios of a and b in scenario a simulation performances with the indcal calibration strategy were better than those with the unical strategy demonstrating that the physical based model can accurately predict ssc with limited calibrating data in the in situ field it was worth noting that the spatial variability of parameters in different fields was ignored with the unical calibration strategy which might be inconsistent with the real situations of fields precisely in the physical based model the ssc status was closely correlated with the soil water movements according to the richards equation and cde similar simulation performances of swc were presented with two indcal calibration strategies fig a1 the physical parameters including the soil hydraulic properties salt diffusion and dispersion generally exhibited substantial spatial variability at the field scale erşahin et al 2017 godoy et al 2019 moreover as the sink term of the richards equation rwu was quantified by the feddes jarvis model and several stress thresholds were involved in this model numerous studies have demonstrated that the stress tolerance of plants differs depending on their growth stages and environments amor et al 2001 lei et al 2019 javaux and carminati 2021 different in scenario a the ssc in scenario b was predicted based on the training dataset from the different fields which represents a possible situation in the absence of in situ calibration data the simulation performances of ssc and swc in the physical based model figs a2 5 calibrated with the unical strategy were better than with the indcal strategy in scenario b it indicated that using the parameters calibrated in an independent field plot was insufficient to simulate ssc and swc at different fields this result could be attributed to the unical strategy expanded calibration information by utilizing more observations from different fields compared with the indcal strategy which could contribute to reducing the parameter uncertainty and equifinality in calibration her and chaubey 2015 he et al 2017 compared with the physical based model the approximative simulation accuracies of ml models were obtained in drf and gbm models with coi 4 5 in scenario a and deeplearning model with coi 5 in scenario b these results imply that ml models hold a similar capacity for ssc prediction when with a suitable algorithm and input variables such as for the ssc predictions in deep soil depth 50 100 cm fig 10 b and the late growth period of the crop das 60 110 fig 10 d in scenario b the prediction accuracy of the deeplearning model with coi 5 was close to the physical based model in these situations the simulation accuracy of the physical based model decreased a bit compared with the situations in depths 0 50 cm and das 60 110 with rmse increased by 0 3 0 75 ds m 1 and r2 decreased by 0 01 0 125 fig a12 13 different from the physical based model ml models directly explore the high dimensional correlations in data with their robust learning capacity instead of quantifying the detailed physical process of predictions hastie et al 2009 wu et al 2022 which allows ml models to capture the implicit relationships between salinity and associated variables in complex environmental conditions however it should be noted that the simulation accuracies of the ml models were generally lower than the physical based model such as in upper soil depths 0 50 cm fig 10 a and the early growth period of the crop das 0 60 fig 10 c the environmental influences from soil evaporation and rainfall were significant in these situations which brings challenges for ssc prediction with ml models thus more appropriate methods need further exploration including considering more influential factors as inputs and employing the time series analysis in ssc prediction 4 2 ml strategies for soil salt simulation the simulation results of the three ml models show that their performances differ depending on the cois and prediction scenarios in scenario a the drf model achieves better simulation accuracies than gbm and deeplearning models with coi 1 4 however the simulation accuracy of the drf model was not improved by adding the variables of swc and crop indicators lai and height in coi 4 5 correspondingly the variable importance showed that the importance of swc and crop indicators in the drf model was relatively low than in the other two ml models fig 7 these results could relate to the modeling principles of drf which builds datasets through the bagging sampling method multiple weak learners are created simultaneously to learn the variable relationships this method makes each tree learn the various information while reducing the model sensitivity to noise points or outliers therefore the drf model typically can achieve better robust simulation results with limited input information but as more variables are input it could be difficult to accurately capture the implicated information among input features biau and scornet 2016 speiser et al 2019 different from the drf model the unacceptable simulation accuracies of the gbm model were presented with limited input variables coi 1 2 in scenario a while the simulation accuracy of the gbm model gradually improved with the increase of input variables similar outperformance of the gbm model has been obtained by kim et al 2018 and sachdeva and kumar 2020 who predicted landslide susceptibility and groundwater potential in this study with coi 5 the nrmse of the gbm model was lower than other ml models even close to the physical based model and as shown in the variable importance of the gbm model fig 7 the importance of height and swc were greater than those in the drf model these results were attributed to the gbm model continuously optimizing the loss function of the boosting algorithm by the gradient descent method which ensures the gbm model could gradually improve the learning ability for the complex relationship among samples however it should be noted that since the gbm is highly sensitive to the outliers of abnormal sample points the gbm is susceptible to overfitting when the input variables or available information are limited friedman 2001 natekin and knoll 2013 with multiple non linear layers of neural networks the deeplearning model discovers intricate structures in the dataset using a backpropagation algorithm and is extremely sensitive to minute changes in input variables lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 figs 7 and 11 show that the variable importance of swc lai and environmental factors in the deeplearning model was obviously higher than those of the gbm and drf models however the simulation accuracy of the deeplearning model was lower than the other ml models in scenario a similar unsatisfactory simulation results of the deeplearning model have been found for estimating the reference evapotranspiration feng et al 2017 surface roughness lengths hu et al 2020 urban land use changes jun 2021 etc in this study the poor performances of the deeplearing model could be attributed to the information differences between the training das 80 and test das 80 datasets in scenario a for instance one of the input variables lai gradually decreased in the late growth stage since das 80 which made the lai approach to the early growth period of the crop but the implicated relationship between lai and ssc was different in these two periods a greater lai generally indicates a high ssc during the early vegetative growth stage of the crop but it is opposite during the reproductive growth stage in addition no irrigation was applied during the crop growth which caused a substantial difference in swc between the crop s early and late growth periods different from scenario a the deeplearning model obtained lower nrmse values of ssc at different time and depths compared with the gbm and drf models which indicates that the deeplearning model was more suitable for the ssc prediction in scenario b the reason behind this was that the implicated information between ssc and related variables during the entire crop growth period was completely contained in the training datasets in scenario b which enabled the deeplearning model to capture the implicated relationships between ssc and input variables comprehensively the variable importance shows that the initial ssc was the most important variable for ssc prediction in three ml models however owing to different principles of modeling the importance of other variables was distinct in the three ml models significantly the variable importance in the deeplearning model was obviously greater than that in the drf and gbm models as shown in fig 12 the spatiotemporal variations of ssc were simulated with different ml models based on the different crop lai and height and environmental et0 and groundwater input variables it is noted that compared with benchmarking scenario selected 0 7 lai 0 7 height and 1 3 et0 0 7 groundwater as inputs the increases in ssc simulated with deeplearning model were significantly greater than these with the drf and gbm models these results indicate that the deeplearing model could be a sensitive tool for predicting ssc when using various crop indicators and under varying environmental conditions moreover it should be noted that many factors besides those described in this study could influence the status of ssc such as irrigation was not considered in our study since irrigation was not applied during the ssc simulation however irrigation has a significant impact on ssc further exploration is needed to determine the irrigation influences under different irrigation situations more relevant factors like irrigation methods amounts and time could be collected as inputs in the ml models 5 conclusions based on the field experiments with sunflower a physical based model and three ml models including rf gbm and deeplearning were developed to predict the spatiotemporal status of ssc with different modeling strategies and prediction scenarios by comparing the simulation performances of ssc in these situations the following conclusions can be made 1 the physical based model can accurately predict ssc with limited calibration data at the in situ field r2 and nrmse equal 0 61 and 0 28 respectively but for prediction at different fields unified parameter calibration based on more samples from various fields could be a suitable strategy 2 compared with the simulation performances of the physical based model ml models hold a similar capacity for ssc prediction with specific algorithms and input variables for the prediction at the in situ field the drf model achieves the best simulation accuracies with limited input variables coi 1 2 nrmse lower 0 0 19 while with the increase of input variables the simulation accuracy of the gbm model gradually outperformed the nrmse eventually close to the physical based model with coi 5 nse close to 0 5 3 the poor simulation performances of the deeplearning model were obtained for the ssc prediction at the in situ field nrmse over 0 6 however for prediction in the different fields the simulation accuracy of the deeplearning model was higher than other ml models especially with coi 5 for ssc prediction on depths within 50 100 cm and das 60 110 the median of the nrmse boxplot approaching 0 31 generally the physical based model is an accurate tool for predicting the ssc which is recommended when requiring high precision however it should be noted that the prediction accuracy of the physical based model could be affected by the parameter calibration strategy meanwhile the numerous parameters need to be calibrated in the physical based model which brings a great challenge for model application by directly exploring the correlations in data information ml models reduce the requirements for user mastery of physical processes and model calibration which provides opportunities to predict ssc in complex environments or at large scales however the preferred ml model differs in prediction scenarios and input variables and the prediction accuracy of the ml models depends on the diversity of training samples thus more investigations are still needed such as testing more advanced ml models expanding training samples and adding more

9133,the physical based and machine learning ml models are two distinctive tools for predicting soil salt content ssc however few studies have compared their performances and it is yet unknown how they differ in terms of simulation accuracy at the field scale to address this issue based on a field experiment with sunflowers a physical based model and three ml models including distributed random forest drf gradient boosting machine gbm and deep learning deeplearning were developed to predict ssc in two common scenarios a and b in scenario a the ssc was predicted using the training dataset in the in situ field while in scenario b the ssc was predicted with the training dataset from the other fields results show that the physical based model remains an accurate tool to predict ssc ml models hold a similar prediction capacity with specific algorithms and input variables in scenario a with limited input variables of the initial status of ssc and related spatiotemporal information the drf model achieved better simulation accuracies r2 higher by 0 05 0 37 nrmse lower by 0 0 19 than the other two ml models however as more input variables were added the simulation accuracies of the gbm model gradually improved nrmse decreased from 0 61 to 0 30 and eventually outperformed the drf model although the variable importance was significant in the deeplearning model poor simulation performances were obtained in scenario a however in scenario b the simulation accuracy of the deeplearning model was higher than other ml models especially for the ssc prediction at the deep soil and during the crop s late growth period the median of the nrmse boxplot approaching 0 31 these simulation results indicated the potential of ml models to substitute the physical based model for ssc prediction still the preferred ml model differs depending on the prediction scenarios and input variables keywords soil salt prediction sunflower swap model distributed random forest gradient boosting

and agricultural productivity butcher et al 2016 hassani et al 2020 over 10 of the worldwide irrigated land and 8 31 11 73 mkm2 of soils suffer salinization aquastat 2011 hassani et al 2021 which might result in annual losses of more than 10 billion us dollars qadir et al 2014 many techniques including irrigation leaching fertilizer optimization chemical amendments and planting of salt tolerant crops are applied to alleviate the adverse effects of soil salinization zeng et al 2016 cuevas et al 2019 liu et al 2022 to develop a sustainable strategy for these treatments it is essential to precisely predict the spatiotemporal variations of salt status at the field scale payo et al 2017 ivushkin et al 2019 the physical based model is a typical method to predict soil salt dynamics šimůnek et al 2005 kroes et al 2017 according to differences in model development and solution methodology two types of physical based models the mass balance model and the numerical model have been proposed for simulating salt transport sun et al 2019 the mass balance model is developed from the principle of solute mass conservation in this model the soil salt in the root zone is quantified by multiple independent physical processes including the salt recharge and leaching from irrigation precipitation capillary rise etc the mass balance model is widely used in the aquacrop foster et al 2017 saltmod zhang et al 2022b saltirsoil visconti et al 2011 and oasis mod askri et al 2010 models due to its simplicity of the solution however the mass balance model is commonly used to simulate soil salt status over a large scale and spanning a relatively long time eishoeei et al 2019 singh 2022 moreover its simulation accuracy is constrained by the simulation uncertainty of the associated influential processes de louw et al 2011 sun et al 2019 unlike the mass balance model the numerical model describes the convection dispersion and diffusion of solutes in soil based on the convection dispersion equation cde the salt transport could be successfully simulated at an adequate space and time scale in the well known agro hydrology models such as hydrus feng et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a and swap kumar et al 2015 lei et al 2021 the salt transport process is quantified by the numerical model however a more stringent requirement is imposed on its solution because the numerical model not only accounts for the transport of solutes but also requires the solution of soil water dynamics provided by the richards equation the unusual initial conditions boundaries and grid size could easily induce numerical dispersion and oscillation issues kamalyar et al 2014 zha et al 2019 moreover the physical parameters in the richards equation and cde such as soil hydraulic conductivity water retention capacity and coefficients of dispersion and diffusion inevitably exhibit a spatiotemporal heterogeneity at the field scale kargas et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 for these reasons cautious parameter calibration is generally required for numerical model application in recent years owing to their powerful learning ability machine learning ml models have been widely used in many predictive applications including for the predictions of meteorological factors plant transpiration and crop growth fan et al 2021 chen et al 2022 dong et al 2022 in soil physics ml models such as artificial neural networks decision tree support vector machine etc have also been used to build soil maps and soil transfer functions related to soil water organic carbon and pollutants padarian et al 2020 wadoux et al 2020 several studies have investigated the simulation difference between the physical based and the ml models such as for soil water prediction karandish and šimůnek 2016 found hydrus 2d model holds the highest simulation accuracy while the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems and support vector machine models can obtain close simulation accuracy with simple input data still they also found that the ml model does not well predict sharp changes in soil water content during irrigation li et al 2020 found that richards based soil water simulations were more susceptible to soil heterogeneity initial conditions and boundary conditions while artificial neural network models were difficult for simulating the peaks and valleys of soil water changes fewer ml models have been developed to predict soil salt dynamics compared with soil water prediction three categories of ml applications can be identified for soil salt prediction based on the differences in predictor types and simulation objects one is focused on predicting soil surface salinity using the spectral information or features of the remote sensing image as in studies of wang and wang 2019 wang et al 2020 and habibi et al 2021 besides some studies have described the in situ variations of soil salinity based on ml models such as zou et al 2010 predicted the dynamic changes in soil water and salinity using artificial neural networks and autoregressive integrated moving averages moreover some attempts have employed ml models to predict soil salinity using its influential factors for example sarangi et al 2006 predicted soil and drainage salinity of paddy fields using irrigation depth evapotranspiration drain discharges water table depths etc based on an ensemble regression tree model hassani et al 2020 2021 predicted the soil salinity dynamics at a global scale using predictors including soil classification texture soil field capacity topography elevation etc although the above studies have demonstrated the feasibility of the ml algorithms for predicting soil salinity most studies neglected the vertical heterogeneity of soil salinity in the root zone which is crucial for quantifying the salt stress in soil plant water transport models feddes et al 1978 lei et al 2019 moreover it is still being determined what extent they differ from physical based models in terms of prediction accuracy at the field scale particularly the simulation results of ml models are closely correlated with the implicated information in the training dataset but this varies depending on specific predictions such as soil salinity prediction at the in situ field or different fields it is essential to clarify the disparities in prediction between physical based and ml models in different prediction scenarios to address the above issues taking the two years of field experiments planting with sunflower as the background a physical based numerical model and three typical ml models including distributed random forest drf gradient boosting machine gbm and deep learning deeplearning were developed to predict the spatiotemporal variations of soil salt content ssc in two common scenarios a and b in scenario a the ssc during the crop s late growth period was predicted based on the training dataset at the in situ field while in scenario b the ssc during the whole growth period of the crop was predicted based on the training dataset from other fields the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a physical based and three ml models for ssc predictions based on different calibration strategies and combinations of input variables cois 2 to compare the simulation accuracy of the ml and physical models for ssc prediction 3 to identify the optimal ml model for ssc predictions in different scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment data the field experiment was conducted at the yonglian experiment station in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia 108

as 50 cm 50 cm surface flood irrigation was applied before the plant sowing the irrigation depth was nearly 30 cm then no irrigation was applied during the crop growth the crops were harvested on september 19 2016 and september 15 2017 the experimental indicators including volumetric soil water content swc and ssc meteorological data groundwater level groundwater leaf area index lai crop height height and root length density rld were dynamically observed during the crop growth period the meteorological data fig 1 including solar radiation temperature wind speed and rainfall were monitored hourly by an auto meteorological station installed at the experimental site the daily status of meteorological data was taken as the average of the observations during the day the lai converted from the crop s green leaf area and plant density the rld was separately identified from the scanning images of roots at seven soil layers 15 cm a layer which were observed by the minirhizotron methods using the root 700 root growth monitoring system ecomatik munich germany the detailed sampling method and frequency of crop indicators can be found in wu et al 2022 the soil samples were collected from three points randomly distributed in each field plot by the core sampling method the average status of swc and ssw in each field was indicated by three soil samples swc was measured by oven drying 105 for 8 h ssc was characterized by saturated electrical conductivity ece ds m 1 which was converted by ec1 5 ece 7 4 ec1 5 the ec1 5 ds m 1 was measured as the electrical conductivity of soil solution with dry soil and deionized water mixed volume ratio of both was 1 5 zeng et al 2016 the soil sampling depth was 100 cm and the sampling interval was 10 cm at the 0 40 cm soil layer and 20 cm at the 40 100 cm soil layer the dynamics of ssc at different depths in each field are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the ssc of field id 1 2 and field 8 was relatively low during the whole observation ece 4 ds m 1 while the ssc of other fields presented an accumulative trend 4 ds m 1 ece 12 ds m 1 especially in fields 5 7 the ece reached 9 12 ds m 1 in the late observation stage days after sowing das 60 and the ece in field 7 increased nearly 5 10 ds m 1 compared with it on sowing day 2 2 physical based model 2 2 1 soil water and salt transport modeling a physical based model swap soil water atmosphere plant was used to simulate the dynamic transport of soil water and salt in the fields the swap model was developed by the wageningen environmental research center and wageningen university kroes et al 2017 it can quantify the multiple mass and energy transport at the field scale between the vegetation canopy and the vadose zone the soil water

was simulated in a soil profile of 0 100 cm vertically discretized in 2 cm layers the upper and lower boundaries of the soil profile were controlled by atmospheric conditions and groundwater tables respectively the crop growth simulation module in the swap model was closed the daily crop indicators of lai and plant height in the penman monteith equation and the rld in the feddes jarvis model jarvis 1989 were selected as inputs which were linear interpolated based on the experimental observations the potential soil evaporation was determined by the reference crop evapotranspiration by setting the soil factor according to the recommended value in the swap model cfbs 0 5 the reduction of soil evaporation was estimated by the black model black et al 1969 the simulation starts on the sowing day and ends on the harvest day the initial conditions of the soil water and salt status were determined by experimental observations 2 2 3 parameter calibration in the physical based model the parameters of the soil water and salt transport in the van genuchten function and cde the thresholds of water and salinity stress the critical compensatory factors in the feddes jarvis model and the solute concentration in the groundwater cw were calibrated based on the experimental data the parameter of soil water ks α n θs and θr and salt ddis transport parameters were hierarchically calibrated according to 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm meanwhile to reduce the parameter dimension in the calibration based on the soil transfer function of rosseta schaap et al 2001 the basic soil water transport parameters of different fields were first determined using soil physical properties of soil texture and bulk density then taking these fundamental values as a whole their multiples were calibrated the observed variables of swc and ssc were selected as calibrated targets and the dimensionless values of simulation and observation were calculated to eliminate the dimensional influence as follows 10 y m n o w y m n o w y m o w 11 y m n s w y m n s w y m o w where y m n o w is the nth observed value of the m type variable obtained from the wth observation in the field experiment y m n s w is the corresponding simulated value y m o w is the average observed value of m type variables obtained from the wth observation in the field experiment y m n o w and y m n s w are dimensionless observed and simulated values the average weighted square of the difference between the dimensionless observed and simulated values was taken as the objective function and the same weight was assumed for each group of observed and simulated values in this study the parameters were calibrated using the pest parameter optimization software white et al 2020 the calibrated results are presented in appendix a table a1 3 2 3 ml models to find the appropriate ml models to predict the ssc the prediction performances of two tree based ensemble models of drf and gbm and a neural network model of deeplearning were evaluated 2 3 1 drf model drf is a powerful ensemble bagging ml algorithm breiman 2001 biau and scornet 2016 in drf a forest of individual regression trees weak learners is generated for the regression issue and each tree is applied to a random subset of the dataset fig 3 b taking the gini index as an evaluation criterion a random subset of candidate features is used to determine the most discriminative thresholds picked as the splitting rule a single tree will stop splitting if it reaches a predefined max depth or if no splits satisfy the minimum relative improvement in squared error reduction the final prediction of the drf model is calculated by the average prediction of each independent tree which contributes to making a more robust prediction compared with other individual ml algorithms and to tune the drf model the hyperparameters regarding the number of trees and the columns were optimized based on a 5 fold cross validation by random repeating 100 times the optimized parameters are presented in appendix a table a4 5 the importance measure of splitting variables in each tree was calculated based on the difference in the estimation squared error between that node and its children nodes the importance of each variable was the accumulation of corresponding importance measures over all trees the aggregated values of variable importance were scaled between 0 and 1 such that the most important variable had an importance value of 1 2 3 2 gbm model gbm is a forward ensemble ml algorithm natekin and knoll 2013 which weight integrates multiple weak learners into a strong learner the principle idea of the gbm algorithm is to generate the new base learners to be maximally correlated with the negative gradient of the loss function fig 3 c in this study the classical squared loss function was used to penalize large deviations from the target outputs while neglecting small residuals and conveniently calculate the pseudo residual and optimal solution direction of the iteration step moreover gbm can sequentially generate regression trees on all the features of the dataset in a fully distributed way each tree is built in parallel meanwhile to tune the gbm model the hyperparameters regarding the number of trees the learning rate the maximum tree depth and the column sampling rate were optimized based on a 5 fold cross validation by random repeating 100 times the optimized parameters are presented in appendix a table a4 5 the variable importance of the gbm model was evaluated using the same calculation method as the drf model 2 3 3 deeplearning model deeplearning is a neural network algorithm with a large number of hidden layers fig 3 d lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 in this study a multi layer feedforward artificial neural network was used which is trained with stochastic gradient descent using backpropagation several activation functions e g sigmoid function hyperbolic tangent function and rectified linear unit relu can be used to transform the inputs of a neuron into output in a layer of the network in this study the relu activation function was selected to reduce computation and overfitting problems the hyperparameters regarding the number of times to iterate the dataset the hidden layer sizes the input layer dropout ratio and the adaptive learning rate time decay factor were optimized based on a 5 fold cross validation by random repeating 100 times the optimized parameters are presented in appendix a table a4 5 the variable importance of the deeplearning model was evaluated using the gedeon method gedeon 1997 2 4 simulation strategies in this study the ssc and its related variables refer to the physical based model including initial soil salt content intial ssc das soil depth depth groundwater daily reference evapotranspiration et0 soil texture the relative content of sand silt and clay swc lai and height were collected to build the dataset fig 3 a the spatiotemporal variations of ssc were predicted in scenarios a and b fig 4 in scenario a the dataset with das 80 was selected to train the ml model and calibrate the physical based model and the dataset with das 80 was used to test and validate the model in scenario b the dataset with the samples in seven random field plots was selected to train calibrate the model and the samples from the remaining field plots were utilized to test the model the ssc in each field plot was predicted eight times with different trained models there were two primary differences between these two scenarios one difference was that the training dataset in scenario a contained the implicit information between ssc and input features at the in situ field in contrast scenario b contained implicit information from other fields the other difference was that the training dataset in scenario b included complete information during the entire crop growth period while scenario a did not for the prediction in the physical based model two calibration strategies of indcal and unical were tested according to whether the model parameters were consistent in training field plots in indcal the model parameters were independently calibrated in each field as opposed to unical the model parameters were uniformly calibrated using the data information across all fields regarding ml models five cois coi 1 5 were designed to predict the ssc as shown in table 1 in coi 1 the basic information of das depth and intial ssc were selected as predictors in coi 2 5 the variables regarding environmental conditions groundwater and et0 soil texture the relative content of sand silt and clay swc and crop indicators lai and height were subsequently added 2 5 statistical analysis the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were selected to evaluate the model performances calculated as follows 12 r 2 i 1 m y i o y i s i 1 m y i o i 1 m y i s m 2 i

prediction in scenario a 3 1 1 performance of the physical based model based on the physical based model the ssc was simulated with two calibration strategies of indcal and unical in scenario a the comparisons between observed and simulated ssc are shown in fig 5 in the calibration fig 5 a b the good simulation performances of ssc were obtained with both calibration strategies r2 0 71 rmse 1 35 ds m 1 nrmse 0 3 and nse 0 67 however the performance with the indcal strategy was better than with the unical strategy with r2 higher by 0 11 and rmse lower by 0 31 ds m 1 meanwhile it can be seen that the scatter points of observed simulated ssc with the unical strategy were more discretely distributed on the sides of the 1 1 line especially for the data in fields 7 and 8 in the validation fig 5 c d the simulation accuracies of ssc were lower than those in the calibration r2 rmse nrmse and nse within 0 52 0 61 1 63 1 84 ds m 1 0 28 0 32 and 0 42 0 55 respectively meanwhile similar to calibration the ssc simulation performances with the indcal strategy were better than with the unical strategy with r2 higher by 0 09 and nrmse lower by 0 04 3 1 2 performance of ml models the validation results of ssc in three ml models with different cois are shown in fig 6 regarding the drf model relatively better simulation performances of ssc were obtained with coi 1 4 compared with those of gbm and deeplearning models with r2 higher by 0 05 0 37 rmse and nrmse lower by 0 1 7 ds m 1 and 0 0 19 fig 6 a d it is noteworthy that the simulation performances of the drf model with coi 3 were improved compared with those with coi 1 2 nrmse decreased by 0 1 however the simulation performances with coi 4 5 were comparable to those with coi 3 compared with the drf model the scatter points of the observed simulated ssc of the gbm model with coi 1 4 especially with coi 1 2 were more discretely distributed on the sides of the 1 1 line fig 6 e and nse values were lower than 0 5 fig 6 d however the simulation performances of the gbm model were gradually improved when with coi 1 to coi 5 nrmse decreased from 0 61 to 0 30 and the best simulation performances of three ml models were obtained when the gbm model with coi 5 which was close to the simulation accuracy of the physical based model nse close to 0 5 different from drf and gbm models the simulation accuracy of the deeplearnig model was gradually decreased when with coi 1 4 especially with coi 4 the nrmse over 0 6 although the simulation accuracy of the deeplearnig model with coi 5 was improved compared with that with coi 4 it remained lower than drf and gbm models 3 1 3 variable importance of ml models the variable importance of three ml models with coi 5 is shown in fig 7 the initial ssc was the most important variable in all three ml models while the relative importance of the other variables was different in the three ml models for the drf model the importance of height 0 27 was second only to initial ssc close to the importance of lai the importance of depth and das were also relatively obvious all higher than 0 125 while the importance of swc clay silt sand and et0 was lower no more than 0 1 compared with the drf model the similar importance of silt clay and et0 was obtained in the gbm model however the importance of height depth swc and groundwater were more apparent especially for height the importance was close to 0 75 different from drf and gbm models the importance among different variables was closer in the deeplearning model and the importance of initial ssc height depth and caly were over 0 75 and the importance of other variables was within 0 5 0 75 3 2 prediction in scenario b the four statistical indexes were evaluated in scenario b the nrmse index was selected as a representative in this section and other statistical indexes of r2 rmse and nse are presented in appendix c 3 2 1 performance of the physical based model based on the physical based model the nrmse boxplots of validated ssc with two calibration strategies were compared in different fields time and depths in scenario b fig 8 the main parts of the nrmse boxplot in fields 1 6 were mainly located in 0 18 0 38 which was lower than in the other three fields in fields 7 9 the medians of the boxplot approached 0 25 0 62 compared with the indcal strategy the medians and the differences between the upper and lower quartiles of the nrmse boxplot in different fields and depths were generally lower with the unical strategy moreover except for das 58 and 68 the median differences of nrmse boxplot between the two calibration strategies were generally enlarged over time and eventually over 0 25 on das 110 3 2 2 performance of ml models the nrmse boxplots of validated ssc with three ml models in different fields are shown in fig 9 the main parts of the nrmse boxplot in fields 3 6 were mainly within 0 3 0 45 which was lower than those in other fields the medians of the nrmse boxplot of three ml models in each field except the deeplearning model with coi 5 were generally higher than the physical based model moreover compared with the drf and gbm models the upper and lower quartiles of the nrmse boxplot of the deeplearning model were generally lower with different cois in fields 1 3 5 8 and with coi 5 in fields 2 7 and 9 based on the three ml models with five cois the nrmse boxplots of validated ssc were evaluated under different depths and time as shown in fig 10 compared with depths within 0 50 cm the median and quartiles of nrmse boxplots were lower when the depths were within 50 100 cm meanwhile it was note worthing that the boxplot of the deeplearning model was generally lower than drf and gbm models especially with coi 5 the boxplot median of the deeplearning model approach to 0 31 was close to the physical based model when depths within 50 100 cm and das within 60 110 3 2 3 variable importance of ml models the variable importance of the three ml models with coi 5 in scenario b is shown in fig 11 similar to scenario a the importance of initial ssc was obviously greater than other variables in three ml models and the median of importance boxplot was close to 1 the importance of height was second only to initial ssc especially in the deeplearning model the boxplot median was close to initial ssc however except for initial ssc and height the importance of other variables was different in the three ml models such as the median of importance boxplot of lai was third ranked in the drf and deeplearning models but it was lower than das and clay in the gbm model and the differences between the upper and lower quartiles of importance boxplot of groundwater 0 18 et0 0 17 depth 0 10 das 0 52 and clay 0 34 in the gbm model were greater than those in the drf models moreover compared with drf and gbm models the importance boxplots of different variables were closer and greater in the deeplearning model and medians of the importance boxplot were mainly within 0 55 0 8 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons between physical based and ml models similar to the swc simulation in karandish and šimůnek 2016 and li et al 2020 the highest simulation accuracies of ssc were generally obtained in the physical based model which indicates the physical based model remains an accurate tool for predicting the ssc dynamics however the superior calibration strategy of the physical based model differed in the two scenarios of a and b in scenario a simulation performances with the indcal calibration strategy were better than those with the unical strategy demonstrating that the physical based model can accurately predict ssc with limited calibrating data in the in situ field it was worth noting that the spatial variability of parameters in different fields was ignored with the unical calibration strategy which might be inconsistent with the real situations of fields precisely in the physical based model the ssc status was closely correlated with the soil water movements according to the richards equation and cde similar simulation performances of swc were presented with two indcal calibration strategies fig a1 the physical parameters including the soil hydraulic properties salt diffusion and dispersion generally exhibited substantial spatial variability at the field scale erşahin et al 2017 godoy et al 2019 moreover as the sink term of the richards equation rwu was quantified by the feddes jarvis model and several stress thresholds were involved in this model numerous studies have demonstrated that the stress tolerance of plants differs depending on their growth stages and environments amor et al 2001 lei et al 2019 javaux and carminati 2021 different in scenario a the ssc in scenario b was predicted based on the training dataset from the different fields which represents a possible situation in the absence of in situ calibration data the simulation performances of ssc and swc in the physical based model figs a2 5 calibrated with the unical strategy were better than with the indcal strategy in scenario b it indicated that using the parameters calibrated in an independent field plot was insufficient to simulate ssc and swc at different fields this result could be attributed to the unical strategy expanded calibration information by utilizing more observations from different fields compared with the indcal strategy which could contribute to reducing the parameter uncertainty and equifinality in calibration her and chaubey 2015 he et al 2017 compared with the physical based model the approximative simulation accuracies of ml models were obtained in drf and gbm models with coi 4 5 in scenario a and deeplearning model with coi 5 in scenario b these results imply that ml models hold a similar capacity for ssc prediction when with a suitable algorithm and input variables such as for the ssc predictions in deep soil depth 50 100 cm fig 10 b and the late growth period of the crop das 60 110 fig 10 d in scenario b the prediction accuracy of the deeplearning model with coi 5 was close to the physical based model in these situations the simulation accuracy of the physical based model decreased a bit compared with the situations in depths 0 50 cm and das 60 110 with rmse increased by 0 3 0 75 ds m 1 and r2 decreased by 0 01 0 125 fig a12 13 different from the physical based model ml models directly explore the high dimensional correlations in data with their robust learning capacity instead of quantifying the detailed physical process of predictions hastie et al 2009 wu et al 2022 which allows ml models to capture the implicit relationships between salinity and associated variables in complex environmental conditions however it should be noted that the simulation accuracies of the ml models were generally lower than the physical based model such as in upper soil depths 0 50 cm fig 10 a and the early growth period of the crop das 0 60 fig 10 c the environmental influences from soil evaporation and rainfall were significant in these situations which brings challenges for ssc prediction with ml models thus more appropriate methods need further exploration including considering more influential factors as inputs and employing the time series analysis in ssc prediction 4 2 ml strategies for soil salt simulation the simulation results of the three ml models show that their performances differ depending on the cois and prediction scenarios in scenario a the drf model achieves better simulation accuracies than gbm and deeplearning models with coi 1 4 however the simulation accuracy of the drf model was not improved by adding the variables of swc and crop indicators lai and height in coi 4 5 correspondingly the variable importance showed that the importance of swc and crop indicators in the drf model was relatively low than in the other two ml models fig 7 these results could relate to the modeling principles of drf which builds datasets through the bagging sampling method multiple weak learners are created simultaneously to learn the variable relationships this method makes each tree learn the various information while reducing the model sensitivity to noise points or outliers therefore the drf model typically can achieve better robust simulation results with limited input information but as more variables are input it could be difficult to accurately capture the implicated information among input features biau and scornet 2016 speiser et al 2019 different from the drf model the unacceptable simulation accuracies of the gbm model were presented with limited input variables coi 1 2 in scenario a while the simulation accuracy of the gbm model gradually improved with the increase of input variables similar outperformance of the gbm model has been obtained by kim et al 2018 and sachdeva and kumar 2020 who predicted landslide susceptibility and groundwater potential in this study with coi 5 the nrmse of the gbm model was lower than other ml models even close to the physical based model and as shown in the variable importance of the gbm model fig 7 the importance of height and swc were greater than those in the drf model these results were attributed to the gbm model continuously optimizing the loss function of the boosting algorithm by the gradient descent method which ensures the gbm model could gradually improve the learning ability for the complex relationship among samples however it should be noted that since the gbm is highly sensitive to the outliers of abnormal sample points the gbm is susceptible to overfitting when the input variables or available information are limited friedman 2001 natekin and knoll 2013 with multiple non linear layers of neural networks the deeplearning model discovers intricate structures in the dataset using a backpropagation algorithm and is extremely sensitive to minute changes in input variables lecun et al 2015 schmidhuber 2015 figs 7 and 11 show that the variable importance of swc lai and environmental factors in the deeplearning model was obviously higher than those of the gbm and drf models however the simulation accuracy of the deeplearning model was lower than the other ml models in scenario a similar unsatisfactory simulation results of the deeplearning model have been found for estimating the reference evapotranspiration feng et al 2017 surface roughness lengths hu et al 2020 urban land use changes jun 2021 etc in this study the poor performances of the deeplearing model could be attributed to the information differences between the training das 80 and test das 80 datasets in scenario a for instance one of the input variables lai gradually decreased in the late growth stage since das 80 which made the lai approach to the early growth period of the crop but the implicated relationship between lai and ssc was different in these two periods a greater lai generally indicates a high ssc during the early vegetative growth stage of the crop but it is opposite during the reproductive growth stage in addition no irrigation was applied during the crop growth which caused a substantial difference in swc between the crop s early and late growth periods different from scenario a the deeplearning model obtained lower nrmse values of ssc at different time and depths compared with the gbm and drf models which indicates that the deeplearning model was more suitable for the ssc prediction in scenario b the reason behind this was that the implicated information between ssc and related variables during the entire crop growth period was completely contained in the training datasets in scenario b which enabled the deeplearning model to capture the implicated relationships between ssc and input variables comprehensively the variable importance shows that the initial ssc was the most important variable for ssc prediction in three ml models however owing to different principles of modeling the importance of other variables was distinct in the three ml models significantly the variable importance in the deeplearning model was obviously greater than that in the drf and gbm models as shown in fig 12 the spatiotemporal variations of ssc were simulated with different ml models based on the different crop lai and height and environmental et0 and groundwater input variables it is noted that compared with benchmarking scenario selected 0 7 lai 0 7 height and 1 3 et0 0 7 groundwater as inputs the increases in ssc simulated with deeplearning model were significantly greater than these with the drf and gbm models these results indicate that the deeplearing model could be a sensitive tool for predicting ssc when using various crop indicators and under varying environmental conditions moreover it should be noted that many factors besides those described in this study could influence the status of ssc such as irrigation was not considered in our study since irrigation was not applied during the ssc simulation however irrigation has a significant impact on ssc further exploration is needed to determine the irrigation influences under different irrigation situations more relevant factors like irrigation methods amounts and time could be collected as inputs in the ml models 5 conclusions based on the field experiments with sunflower a physical based model and three ml models including rf gbm and deeplearning were developed to predict the spatiotemporal status of ssc with different modeling strategies and prediction scenarios by comparing the simulation performances of ssc in these situations the following conclusions can be made 1 the physical based model can accurately predict ssc with limited calibration data at the in situ field r2 and nrmse equal 0 61 and 0 28 respectively but for prediction at different fields unified parameter calibration based on more samples from various fields could be a suitable strategy 2 compared with the simulation performances of the physical based model ml models hold a similar capacity for ssc prediction with specific algorithms and input variables for the prediction at the in situ field the drf model achieves the best simulation accuracies with limited input variables coi 1 2 nrmse lower 0 0 19 while with the increase of input variables the simulation accuracy of the gbm model gradually outperformed the nrmse eventually close to the physical based model with coi 5 nse close to 0 5 3 the poor simulation performances of the deeplearning model were obtained for the ssc prediction at the in situ field nrmse over 0 6 however for prediction in the different fields the simulation accuracy of the deeplearning model was higher than other ml models especially with coi 5 for ssc prediction on depths within 50 100 cm and das 60 110 the median of the nrmse boxplot approaching 0 31 generally the physical based model is an accurate tool for predicting the ssc which is recommended when requiring high precision however it should be noted that the prediction accuracy of the physical based model could be affected by the parameter calibration strategy meanwhile the numerous parameters need to be calibrated in the physical based model which brings a great challenge for model application by directly exploring the correlations in data information ml models reduce the requirements for user mastery of physical processes and model calibration which provides opportunities to predict ssc in complex environments or at large scales however the preferred ml model differs in prediction scenarios and input variables and the prediction accuracy of the ml models depends on the diversity of training samples thus more investigations are still needed such as testing more advanced ml models expanding training samples and adding more

9134,the current study aims to document evapotranspiration and associated surface energy fluxes for rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem in order to provide information on crop water use under such little studied conditions for this an experimental study is conducted within the tunisian study site of the omere observatory french acronym for the mediterranean observatory of water and the rural environment located in the north eastern cap bon peninsula it relies on eddy covariance ec measurements at the plot scale we report that 1 observations are consistent with previous studies under mediterranean or semi arid contexts with time series of energy fluxes that depict classical seasonal dynamics 2 common flux ratios i e bowen ratio ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration may change according to upwinds and downwinds which requires further investigations about possible changes in aerodynamic conditions and 3 a reference evapotranspiration value of 4 mm day 1 seems to be a threshold beyond which actual evapotranspiration decreases systematically and rapidly in terms of agricultural water management the current study suggests to look for early sowing species varieties in order to reduce the evaporation based water loss in autumn overall ec measurements seem promising over rainfed annual crops within semiarid hilly agrosystems for long term observations environmental modelling and operational purposes since the current study is conducted over few small fields within a specific hilly topography the original results we report here need to be strengthened with complementary studies keywords rainfed annual crops mediterranean hilly agrosystems evapotranspiration eddy covariance times series upwinds downwinds seasonal dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the southern shore of the mediterranean region has limited water resources water scarcity is likely to increase under climate change impact with consequences on crop functioning and yields brouziyne et al 2018 vadez et al 2022 the combination of crop yield decrease and population growth is likely to induce food insecurity and rural exodus weiss et al 2020 zouabi 2021 such forecast is critical for rainfed annual crops where plants with shallow rooting systems do not benefit from irrigation hossain et al 2020 in this context there are pressing demands for optimising crop water consumption by means of different techniques such as changes in crop variety or on farm practices karrou and oweis 2012 the optimisation of crop water consumption within agrosystems can be explored using numerical tools that address crop functioning and hydrological cycle including modelling platforms lebon et al 2019 siad et al 2019 and learning machine methods cheng et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2020 where both approaches rely on long term observations jarlan et al 2015 molénat et al 2018 within mediterranean rainfed agrosystems annual crops functioning is mainly driven by root zone water content while evapotranspiration is the most significant term of the hydrological balance aouade et al 2020 thus several numerical tools rely on first order relations between plant transpiration and biomass production dhouib et al 2022 ran et al 2020 while their calibrations require complementary observations of plant growth root zone water content and evapotranspiration kanda et al 2021 yang et al 2019 hilly catchments are widespread around the mediterranean their topography allows for water harvesting techniques that compensate for rainfall shortage by increasing infiltration such as land use or hydro agricultural structures ammar et al 2016 harmanny and malek 2019 mekki et al 2006 thus margin progresses are explored within hilly rainfed agrosystems by modulating changes in cropping systems and water harvesting techniques al khuzaie et al 2020 grum et al 2017 when dealing with water consumption it is necessary to account for additional processes induced by topography for both observation and modelling this includes 1 changes in solar radiation with slope orientation nie et al 1992 2 changes in soil depth soil moisture and vegetation growth along upstream downstream transects tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and 3 changes in air streamlines within the boundary layer in aerodynamic and micrometeorological conditions in source contributions and consequently in convective fluxes chen et al 2019 finnigan et al 2015 several studies have addressed micrometeorology and boundary layer turbulence over sloping and heterogeneous terrains mainly for mountainous conditions hammerle et al 2007 hiller et al 2008 serrano ortiz et al 2016 however very few studies dealt with crop water consumption for rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly catchments whereas the latter differ from mountainous conditions because of 1 the absence of anabatic and katabatic winds 2 the absence of valley breeze along catchment longitudinal axis and 3 the presence of externally driven winds that induce forced convection with neutral conditions zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 when dealing with modelling few works focused on the performances of crop models designed for flat terrains boudhina et al 2019 the formulation of aerodynamic resistance rana et al 2007 and the tailoring of variables within the penman monteith equation rana et al 2011 when dealing with observation few studies investigated 1 the processing of eddy covariance ec measurements according to upwinds downwinds and to vegetation height zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 2 the assessment of ec measurements according to sloping conditions boudhina et al 2017 2018a and 3 the tailoring of gap filling methods according to upwinds and downwinds boudhina et al 2018b zitouna chebbi et al 2018 beyond the aforementioned works on data processing and gap filling obtaining times series of crop water consumption over several crop cycles is paramount it permits to study the temporal dynamics of root zone soil water content crop functioning and water consumption longobardi and villani 2013 it opens path to documenting water fluxes over large periods in relation to hydrological cycle and crop water consumption french et al 2020 liu et al 2012 payero and irmak 2013 talebizadeh et al 2018 it permits to document long term influence of anthropogenic and climate forcing molénat et al 2018 several efforts have been conducted to produce and analyse times series of evapotranspiration over vegetated land surfaces including irrigated maize dare idowu et al 2021 irrigated wheat french et al 2020 rafi et al 2019 irrigated cotton anapalli et al 2020 and rainfed chickpea chakraborty et al 2021 however and to our best knowledge no study addressed rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly agrosystems whereas specific trends are likely to be observed in such context because of differences in soil depth soil moisture within shallow rooting systems vegetation growth and insolation aerodynamic conditions that drive convective fluxes the main objective of the current study is to document evapotranspiration and related surface energy fluxes over rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem this main objective is broken down into two specific objectives in relation to existing knowledge a first specific objective is to account for upwinds and downwinds follow on from the aforementioned studies that reported the influence of such winds on data processing and gap filling a second specific objective is to analyse evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes as well as several proxies that document on vegetation water status for this we analyse fluxes and related ratios by considering daily timescale and annual extent in relation to crop phenology and hydrometeorological conditions to reach the main objective and specific objectives we conduct an experimental study within a hilly agrosystem located in the cap bon peninsula north eastern tunisia over four rainfed annual crops that are representative of the mediterranean context the current paper is structured as follows we first detail the materials including the experimental setup and the measurement features the experimental conditions the data processing and the strategy for producing complete time series of energy fluxes thereafter we simultaneously report and discuss the results we obtain for energy fluxes and related ratios when considering the daily timescale and the annual extent we finally conclude on the contribution of the current study to the knowledge of evapotranspiration for rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly agrosystems along with further perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kamech catchment the experiment takes place within the kamech experimental site 2 5 km2 which is a sub catchment of the lebna regional catchment 210 km2 located in the cap bon peninsula north eastern tunisia 36 52 40 n 10 52 40 e 108 m above sea level kamech belongs to the long term environmental research observatory omere french acronym for the mediterranean observatory of water and the rural environment a detailed description of kamech is given in mekki et al 2006 and a detailed description of the omere observatory is given in molénat et al 2018 the catchment topography is v shaped along the northeast southwest axis the altitude ranges from 94 m to 194 m the terrain slope ranges from 0 to 30 the soil depth ranges from a few millimetres to two metres according to the location within the catchment and to the local topography the catchment includes four dominant soil types mekki et al 2018 namely cambisols 46 of the catchment area luvisols 26 vertisols 10 and regosols 18 the soils have sandy loam textures which make them swelling soils that exhibit shrinkage cracks under dry conditions during the summer raclot and albergel 2006 the regional climate is at the frontier between sub humid and semi arid with annual values of 667 mm and 1336 mm for rainfall and penman monteith evapotranspiration respectively average values over the 2004 2006 period the main crops are rainfed including winter cereals durum and bread wheat barley oat triticale and legumes chickpeas faba bean these crops can be harvested or grazed the steepest parts of the catchment are covered by natural vegetation and used as rangelands for grazing agricultural land parcel is typified by small plots with an average size of 0 62 ha a small hilly dam is set at the outlet of the kamech sub catchment and belongs to the network of small hilly dams along the hydrographic network within the regional lebna catchment gaubi et al 2017 2 2 measurement location and calendar in line with the previous works aforementioned we rely in the current study on the use of eddy covariance ec systems for measuring convective fluxes i e sensible and latent heat fluxes along with classical measurement devices for net radiation and soil heat flux in relation to the footprint of the ec measurements which can extend over several tens of metres depending upon airflows within the boundary layer aubinet et al 2012 we select agricultural plots larger than 1 ha so that any ec footprint mainly extends within the corresponding plot additionally we select 1 plots with regular slope to avoid transient airflows within the ec footprint and 2 plots far from the outlet dam to avoid possible advection these constraints lead to select three plots labelled a b and c fig 1 field data are collected throughout vegetation growth cycles in plots a b and c the experiment is conducted in 2004 2005 and 2006 and it encompasses successions of vegetation growth and bare soil after harvest or grazing the corresponding four datasets are labelled a04 b05 a06 and c06 where the letter represents the plot and the two digits represent the year detailed descriptions of both topography and relative position within the catchment for these plots are given in zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 we briefly synthetise here the area the slope the soil type the period of experiment and the land use table 1 2 3 data collection agro meteorological data energy flux data vegetation data a agro meteorological station is located near the catchment outlet labelled m to perform the following measurements 1 rainfall at a daily time step with a manual rain gauge ore omere hysae database https www umr lisah fr hysae 2 solar irradiance with a sp1110 pyranometer skye uk 3 air temperature and humidity with an hmp45c probe vaisala finland 4 wind speed with an a100r anemometer vector instruments uk and 5 wind direction with a w200p wind vane vector instruments uk the instruments are installed 2 m above ground except the rain gauge which is installed 1 m above ground level and they are connected to a cr10x data logger campbell scientific usa apart from rainfall variables are sampled at a 1 hz frequency averaged and stored with a 30 mn time step all instruments are new or recently new and are calibrated by the manufacturer one or two eddy covariance ec stations are installed on different plots in 2004 2005 and 2006 to measure sensible and latent heat fluxes at the plot scale fig 1 and table 1 in 2004 respectively 2005 an ec station is installed on plot a respectively plot b in 2006 an ec station is installed on both plot a and c each ec station measures wind speed in three dimensions u and v are horizontal coordinates w is vertical coordinate and air temperature t with a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific usa for datasets a04 b05 a06 and with a young 81000v sonic anemometer r m young usa for dataset c06 each ec station also measures specific humidity q with a kh20 krypton hygrometer campbell scientific usa for datasets a04 and c06 the kh20 does not operate for datasets a06 and b05 because of instrumental degradation the raw data of the sonic anemometer and of the krypton hygrometer are recorded with a 10 hz frequency they are stored in a cr23x datalogger campbell scientific usa and they are downloaded every minute to a laptop through a rs232 serial port additionally the cr23x datalogger directly calculates convective fluxes without any prior instrumental correction the goal is to produce complete time series of evapotranspiration thanks to gap filling approaches the process is briefly explained in section 2 6 and detailed in supplementary materials section 1 a hmp45c probe vaisala finland is installed on each ec station to measure air temperature and humidity and next correct the calibration drift of the krypton hygrometer net radiation rn is measured at each ec station using a nr lite device kipp zonen nl the net radiometers are installed 1 5 m above the ground soil heat flux g is measured at each ec station using three hfp01 soil heat flux plates hukseflux netherlands that are distributed two metres away from the station and are buried between 2 and 5 cm below the soil surface these measurements are recorded with a 1 hz frequency they are next averaged and stored with a 30 mn time step in the cr23x datalogger the sonic anemometers the krypton hygrometers and the air temperature and humidity probes are installed at the same height above the ground during each period of data acquisition 1 96 m for field a in 2004 data set a04 1 78 m for field a in 2006 dataset a06 and 2 02 m for field c in 2006 data set c06 zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 verified that 1 70 80 of each flux measurement originated from the corresponding field with a unique crop and 2 the measurement heights were located within the inertial sublayer above the roughness sublayer regardless of vegetation height vegetation measurements include plant height and leaf area index lai for plant height the number of observations per plot ranges from 30 for annual crops homogeneous canopies to 100 for rangelands heterogeneous canopies with several species for each measurement date for lai sample collection is replicated within delimited areas of 0 30 0 30 m2 size at each measurement date the number of replicates per plot varies from 5 to 10 depending upon the canopy heterogeneity for both plant height and lai frequency of measurement collection ranges from 2 to 4 weeks in accordance to the vegetation growth observed within each plot plant height is estimated using a tape measure and each sample is weighed next a sub sample is selected corresponding to about 1 3 of the sample weight to measure leaf area using a windias planimeter delta t devices ltd cambridge uk finally plant height and leaf area index at the plot scale are estimated as average values across all samples for each date 2 4 characterisation of experimental conditions 2 4 1 vegetation conditions for each dataset we provide an overview about crops and varieties as well as about vegetation development throughout growth cycle following allen et al 1998 we using leaf area index lai and vegetation height table 2 summarises vegetation growth stage as well as measurements of lai and plant height throughout the experiment the experiment starts on plot a in 2004 dataset a04 when durum wheat crop karim variety common in north africa is at full development stage fd agricultural practices are not optimal and we note the presence of both weeds and diseases wheat rust lai reaches his maximum value lai max at the end of march with a value of 0 8 m2 m 2 the senescence stage se starts on 26 may after harvest on 17 july the plot is used for grazing and it is covered by wheat straw residues that slowly decompose until the end of the summer the first ploughing for next crop is done at the beginning of november 2004 the experiment starts on plot b in 2005 dataset b05 one month after sowing when oat local variety is at mid season development stage md the fd stage starts on 01 april with an lai max equal to 3 m2 m 2 on average and a plant height equal to 1 m on average senescence stage se starts on 25 may and the oat crop is green cut at the end of may for animal feeding the experiment starts on plot a in 2006 dataset a06 with a faba bean crop vicia faba l local variety measurements start during the md stage and the fd stage occurs on 28 march lai max 1 34 m2 m 2 plant height 0 45 m after harvest of the pods in mid may the plot is used for grazing with natural vegetation until the dry period during 2006 another experiment is conducted on plot c dataset c06 plot c is not cultivated and spontaneous vegetation is used for grazing vegetation canopy is very heterogeneous the measurements start at fd stage with lai max 0 92 m2 m 2 and se stage starts on 18 may the spontaneous vegetation depicts a similar dynamic than cultivated crops with similar periods of greenness and senescence 2 4 2 meteorological conditions we characterise climatic conditions during the experiment on the basis of daytime values of air temperature ta solar radiation rg wind speed u and vapour pressure deficit vpd where daytime corresponds to solar and net radiation above 20 w m 2 these meteorological variables are collected by the agro meteorological station located at the outlet of the kamech catchment section 2 3 a prerequisite for the analysis of these variables is to obtain complete time series throughout the experiment despite missing data due to equipment malfunction mainly for measurements of air temperature and humidity to this end we use linear relationships between half hourly values of air temperature and humidity from coincident measurements with hmp45c probes at the agro meteorological station and the ec stations these linear relationships are typified by 1 correlation coefficients r2 around 0 99 and 2 discrepancies around the regression lines around 0 1 c and 0 03 kpa for air temperature and vpd respectively next daily reference evapotranspiration et0 is calculated using fao56 method according to allen et al 1998 table 3 displays daytime values when separating winds from the northwest sector wind direction greater than 220 and less than 70 and winds from the south sector wind direction between 135 and 225 as well as when separating conditions of vegetated surface and bare soil rg ranges from 384 w m 2 for dataset a04 with bare soil to 560 w m 2 for dataset c06 with bare soil on plot a in 2004 rg is low during the bare soil period in autumn neither systematic nor significant difference is observed between northwest and south winds u ranges from 4 and 6 4 m s 1 which corresponds to large values as compared to fao worldwide mean value allen et al 1998 these large wind speed values are in agreement with the micrometeorological data that indicated dominant regimes of forced convection along with conditions of near neutrality or low instability zitouna chebbi et al 2012 south winds are typified by lower speeds as compared to northwest winds ta ranges from 13 to 30 c which is representative of the seasonal variability throughout the experiment we note larger ta values for south winds as compared to northwest winds with differences ranging from 1 to 3 c vpd varies between 0 11 kpa for bare soil conditions on plot a in 2004 and 2 8 kpa for bare soil conditions on both plot a in 2006 and plot c in 2006 south winds are typified by larger vpd values as compared to northwest winds since they correspond to larger air temperatures values fig 2 displays times series of daily rainfall for 2004 2005 and 2006 yearly cumulated rainfall r is 515 mm 726 mm and 761 mm respectively daily rainfall depicts an inter seasonal variability cumulated rainfall is larger for northwest winds as compared to south winds which results from the combination of 1 similar average values for both with directions and 2 a larger occurrence of northwest winds from a seasonal viewpoint that combines rainfall with vegetation growth stage larger cumulated rainfalls are recorded during the mid development md stage than during the full development fd stage for datasets b05 a06 and c06 fig 2 also displays times series of daily reference et0 cumulated values at the yearly timescale are 1427 mm 1252 mm and 1329 mm for 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively daily et0 ranges from 1 to 8 mm day 1 and largest values are observed when maximum values occur for both air temperature and vdp thus the winter season respectively summer season corresponds to lowest values respectively largest values of et0 during the summer season et0 is larger for south winds as compared to northwest winds whereas it is similar regardless of wind direction during the other seasons when comparing rainfall against et0 for different stages of vegetation development we observe that daily rainfall r is larger than daily et0 only for the b05 dataset during the mid development md stage with r 3 56 mm day 1 and et0 1 93 mm day 1 on average over the period daily water supply is heterogeneously distributed throughout the vegetation growth cycle overall the meteorological conditions of the kamech catchment are typically mediterranean with a water limitation during the summer and an energy limitation during the winter 2 5 flux data processing half hourly data of net radiation rn are corrected from sloping effect on solar exposure by following holst et al 2005 as detailed in zitouna chebbi et al 2012 in addition a side by side comparison of nr lite net radiometers is conducted during one month within the same plot instrumental differences are within the instrumental accuracies with a root mean square difference rmsd of about 20 w m 2 the three soil heat flux measurements g are averaged over 30 mn periods and no correction is applied for the heat storage between the surface and the sensors we chose not to apply any correction since existing corrections are questionable for swelling soils zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 as mentioned previously the cr23x datalogger also calculates convective fluxes without any prior instrumental correction in order to produce complete time series of evapotranspiration convective fluxes are calculated as h ρ cp cov w t for sensible heat and le ρ lv cov w q for latent heat where ρ is air density cp is air specific heat lv is vaporisation latent heat w and t are vertical wind speed and air temperature measured by the sonic anemometer q is specific humidity measured by the krypton hygrometer and cov stands for covariance sensible and latent heat fluxes are calculated over 30 mn periods and stored in the cr23x datalogger they are labelled h wc for sensible heat and le wc for latent heat where wc stands for without correction the raw data recorded at 10 hz are postprocessed using the ecpack open source library version 2 5 22 van dijk et al 2004 postprocessing steps include spike detection vickers and mahrt 1997 air humidity corrections for sensible heat flux schotanus et al 1983 density corrections for latent heat flux webb et al 1980 and planar fit rotation wilczak et al 2001 when applying planar fit rotation we account for the influence of hilly topography by separating upwinds and downwinds and by separating different intervals of vegetation height zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 convective fluxes are calculated over 30 mn periods next we apply quality control tests to select ec high quality data foken and wichura 1996 for this we keep the two first classes of quality control test since they are considered as high quality data for long term flux estimation foken et al 2005 these convective fluxes are labelled h pf for sensible heat and le pf for latent heat where pf stands for planar fit eventually each dataset a04 a06 b05 and c06 includes a number of 30 mn data for each energy flux and each processing level on convective fluxes the number of data depends upon the length of data acquisition period the daytime length throughout the data acquisition period the data availability and the quality filtering table 4 indicates the numbers of data for rn and g for h wc and le wc as well as for h pf and le pf when dealing with rn datasets cover all measurement periods as compared to the number of rn data within each dataset we note slight missing rates for g within datasets a04 and b05 about 0 1 and 3 8 respectively for h wc and le wc we note moderate missing rates when measurements are available from 12 5 to 34 8 and from 33 4 to 44 6 respectively for h pf and le pf we note significant missing rates when measurements are available from 58 4 to 89 8 and from 63 2 to 91 8 respectively these significant missing rates stem from experimental troubles for data storage in relation to power failure for convective fluxes with correction h pf and le pf the few numbers of data highlight the necessity to use gap filling methods based on available data of net radiation and of convective fluxes without correction h wc and le wc 2 6 generating time series of convective fluxes table 4 in section 2 5 highlights the low percentages of data available for convective fluxes relative to the numbers of data to be collected throughout the experiment duration as indicated with the number of available data for net radiation in order to document evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes under the specific conditions on which focuses the current study namely rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem we set up and implement an overall strategy to produce times series of convective fluxes for each of the datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 we produce time series of surface energy fluxes at the half hourly timescale we focus on daytime measurements since nighttime values of sensible and latent heat fluxes are low on a daily timescale we separate upwinds and downwinds following zitouna chebbi et al 2012 for plots a and b the downwinds belong to the northwest sector wind direction greater than 220 and less than 70 while the upwinds belong to the south sector wind direction between 135 and 225 the reverse is true for plot c namely downwinds belong to the south sector while upwinds belong to the northwest sector east winds are disregarded due to the position of the anemometer and the thermo hygrometer zitouna chebbi et al 2012 we also separate different intervals of vegetation following table 2 in section 2 4 1 and in accordance to zitouna chebbi et al 2015 when dealing with datasets a04 and c06 we setup a gap filling strategy for the time series of convective flux data h and le on the basis of 1 linear regressions between corrected and non corrected convective fluxes and 2 linear regressions between corrected convective fluxes and net radiation when dealing with datasets b05 and a06 no convective le flux are available we therefore apply the above mentioned gap filling strategy on sensible heat flux h only and we estimate latent heat flux as the residual of surface energy balance more details are given in supplementary materials section 1 for gap filling methodology and supplementary materials section 2 for gap filling performances 3 results and discussions we report and discuss the results we obtain for temporal dynamics of energy fluxes and related ratios including ratio of net radiation to solar irradiance bowen ratio as well as ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration in most cases we address the daily timescale and the annual extent in order to capture temporal dynamics in relation to vegetation development stages and hydrometeorological conditions throughout several seasons also we analyse and discuss ratios of energy fluxes according to upwinds and downwinds since the influence of meteorological conditions related to northwest and south winds section 2 4 2 is mitigated for ratios as compared to fluxes 3 1 temporal dynamics of daily energy fluxes fig 3 displays for each of the four datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 the seasonal variations of daytime energy fluxes at the daily timescale including net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible and latent heat flux h and le le flux magnitude is displayed in both w m 2 left axis and mm day 1 right axis fig 3 also displays the seasonal variations of energy balance error residue eb res rn g h le that is a proxy of uncertainties related to measurements and data processing as well as a proxy of intrinsic limitations of energy balance closure daily rn does not exceed 500 w m 2 for all seasons and datasets it reaches maximum values in spring for the four datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 mainly during senescence se stages and depicts lower values in summer and autumn with bare soils we observe minimal rn values for dataset b05 until winter around 240 w m 2 on average additionally the abrupt decreases in rn we observe throughout the time series are ascribed to cloud coverage for the current study daily soil heat flux depicts the lower magnitude with values always below 100 w m 2 it also depicts no seasonal variability and no increase during dry seasons g corresponds to 5 of rn during full development fd stage of the wheat crop dataset a04 and to 17 of rn during bare soil conditions dataset a06 daily sensible heat flux does not exceed 300 w m 2 over the four datasets and it depicts clear seasonal variations it increases from spring to reach a maximum in summer and decreases thereafter it is very low during winter for dataset b05 and it does not exceed 50 w m 2 during the rainy periods overall it is less than 40 of rn when vegetation is well developed and it is more than 60 of rn in summer with bare soil conditions daily latent heat flux which corresponds to actual evapotranspiration et rarely exceeds 200 w m 2 4 mm day 1 even when it exceeds sensible heat flux it depicts seasonal patterns with maximum values in spring followed by decreases to zero in summer also it increases after each rain event during the mid development md stages of barley and faba bean crops le corresponds to 50 and 44 of rn during the fd stages of wheat barley faba bean and rangeland it corresponds to 44 55 38 and 38 of rn respectively during the senescence stages it corresponds to 25 36 32 and 29 of rn respectively we also observe lower values for bare soil conditions where le corresponds to 14 18 19 and 24 of rn respectively additionally we observe an increase up to 25 of rn for bare soil in autumn dataset a04 which is ascribed to rain events daily value of energy balance residual eb res reaches up to 100 w m 2 in some cases dataset a04 it is close to h and g at the beginning of the time series for dataset b05 and it has the same magnitude than g and le during the summer for all datasets it represents between 6 and 14 of rn during md stage for dataset b05 and fd stage for dataset a04 respectively overall high values of g rn are often accompanied by low values of eb res rn finally we note that energy fluxes rn h le are lower for dataset c06 as compared to the three other datasets a04 b05 and a06 besides times series show simultaneous decreases and increases of the fluxes which confirms the consistency between the independent measurements of the four energy balance components rn g h le 3 2 seasonal variations of daily rn rg to analyse the partitioning of daily energy fluxes under the specific conditions we address here namely rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly agrosystems we study the temporal dynamic of net radiation to solar irradiance rn rg at the daily time scale this ratio is a proxy of the solar irradiance amount to be transformed into net radiation and subsequently into soil heat flux and convective fluxes ryu et al 2008 also this ratio permits to quantify changes in net radiation rn according to upwinds and downwinds while attenuating the impact of changes in rg between northwest and south winds section 2 4 2 the ratio rn rg shows a large variability from 0 35 to 0 7 fig 4 first we note some differences between upwinds and downwinds these differences between 0 04 and 0 12 on average are observed for all plots all years and throughout all experimental periods the ratio rn rg is larger for downwinds northwest winds for datasets a04 b05 and a06 south winds for dataset c06 as compared to upwinds south winds for datasets a04 b05 and a06 northwest winds for dataset c06 second we note some differences from the viewpoint of vegetation development the ratio rn rg depicts largest values 0 59 on average during the full development fe and senescence se stages and lowest values 0 55 on average during bare soil conditions third the temporal dynamics depicts seasonalities the ratio rn rg increases during autumn with the first rainfall for dataset a04 and it is smaller in winter than in spring for dataset b05 indeed the partitioning of the ratio rn rg depends upon land cover and surface humidity with larger values for humid and green covered surfaces 3 3 seasonal variation of daily bowen ratio the ratio h le is known as bowen ratio br and is a proxy of water status perez et al 2008 we analyse its temporal dynamic according to upwinds downwinds by assuming that ratioing the two convective fluxes mitigates the influence of meteorological conditions between northwest and south winds section 2 4 2 we observe a clear variability during the experimental periods for the four datasets fig 5 it varies from less than one to more than four across all datasets it is lower than one during the mid development md stages and the full development fd stages it depicts the lowest values during the fd stage for dataset b05 with an average value of 0 53 it increases during the senescence se stage with an average value of 1 57 and increases up to more than 2 during the bare soil periods for the dataset a06 it depicts an abrupt increase as compared to gradual increases for the other datasets it depicts significant fluctuations during dry summer which is ascribed to small variations in le flux near zero finally it changes according to upwinds and downwinds for dataset a06 with larger values for downwinds northwest winds 3 4 seasonal variation of daily et et0 fig 6 displays the temporal variations of et et0 ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration for the four datasets by separating upwinds and downwinds additionally subplots in fig 5 indicate the vegetation growth stages as determined by the measurements of lai and plant height section 2 4 1 dataset a04 spreads over the fd and se stages of the wheat crop for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 1 3 and 0 4 mm day 1 et0 2 7 and 5 1 mm day 1 et 2 2 and 1 7 mm day 1 eb res 0 5 and 0 7 mm day 1 and lai max 0 8 m2 m2 the ratio et et0 is stable throughout the fd stage with an average value around 0 84 then it decreases during the se stage down to 0 13 at the harvest period and next increases to around 0 4 after the first autumn rainfall finally et et0 is larger for downwinds northwest winds than for upwinds south winds with differences about 0 45 and 0 12 on average for fd and se respectively dataset b05 spreads over the md fd and se stages of the oat crop for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 3 5 2 5 and 0 5 mm day 1 et0 1 9 2 5 and 4 3 mm day 1 et 1 4 2 3 and 2 2 mm day 1 and eb res 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mm day 1 and lai max 3 m2 m2 et et0 is lower than 0 5 during the md stage with peaks above unity after rain events it next increases until the middle of the md stage and is then typified by a stress period i e decrease until the end of the md stage indeed cumulated rainfall is larger than cumulated et0 on average during the md stage but it is unequally distributed fig sp4 thus rainfall amounts are large at the beginning of the md stage whereas both et0 and lai are low the subsequent soil water storage is large at the beginning of the md period for the benefit of vegetation growth but it vanishes with time during the fd stage we observe a stress event after which the ratio et et0 is stabilised around unity next the se period is typified by a decrease of et et0 down to 0 4 at the harvest time we observe non negligible et et0 value after harvest which indicates that vegetation is still active conversely to what is observed for the wheat crop dataset a04 finally the ratio et et0 is larger for downwinds northwest winds than for upwinds south winds with differences about 0 15 0 24 and 0 08 on average for md fd and se stages respectively dataset a06 spreads over the md and fd stages of the faba bean crop as well as over the following rangeland period for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 1 3 0 9 and 0 4 mm day 1 et0 2 6 3 7 and 5 5 mm day 1 et 1 8 2 and 1 9 mm day 1 eb res 0 4 0 6 and 0 7 mm day 1 and lai max 1 3 m2 m2 the ratio et et0 is slightly larger during the md stage 0 69 than during the fd stage 0 56 which is explained by the lack of rainfall during the fd period the rangeland period is typified by an average value of 0 35 for et et0 with a decrease trend on the first half and an increase trend at the beginning of the second part that start after a 10 mm rainfall finally the ratio et et0 is similar for upwinds and downwinds where et et0 is slightly larger for upwinds south winds as compared to downwinds northwest with differences about 0 06 on average for md dataset c06 spreads over fd and se stages of the rangeland for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 1 5 and 0 8 mm day 1 et0 3 3 and 5 4 mm day 1 et 1 6 and 1 5 mm day 1 eb res 0 51 and 0 67 mm day 1 and lai max 0 9 m2 m2 during the fd stage the ratio et et0 is relatively stable with an average value of 0 5 and it decreases during the se stage down to 0 2 with an average value of 0 3 over the se stage the ratio et et0 is lower for upwinds northwest winds as compared to the downwinds south winds with differences about 0 07 and 0 05 respectively for fd and se on the basis of the results reported and discussed across the four datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 we highlight general outcomes listed below for the bare soil periods the ratio et et0 corresponds to an evaporation term it is lower than 0 2 only until the end of the experimental periods for dataset a04 except after the autumnal rainfalls where it reaches values close to unity across all datasets periods with water loss from evaporation are observed during the autumn season or at the beginning of the md period the maximum values we observe for the ratio et et0 are lower than 1 2 this threshold value is consistent with the interval suggested by allen et al 2011 we note that adding eb res to le fluxes which corresponds to the most pessimistic case would lead to a maximum value for et et0 that does not exceed 1 5 which is still within the aforementioned interval all times series for the ratio et et0 clearly depict seasonal behaviours despite fluctuations that are ascribed to temporal changes in water supply for rainfed annual crops across the four datasets we observe rapid and systematic decreases of et when et0 is larger than 4 mm day 1 where the latter seems to be a threshold value for vegetation transpiration this systematic and rapid decrease of etr et0 may be explained by two driving factors namely vegetation senescence and decrease of water content these two driving factors being linked because of water shortage thus decrease in etr induced increase of the temperature of the vegetation and thus acceleration of phenology that is driven by cumulated temperature sacks and kucharik 2011 the faba bean crop depict vegetation growth similar to that reported by manschadi et al 1998 in mediterranean conditions in conditions similar to those of our study for water limited case and late sowing december they report that et is lower but water use efficiency is larger than for well watered conditions 4 discussion our observations for the temporal dynamics of daily energy fluxes are consistent with previous studies in similar contexts either mediterranean or semi arid 1 rn is low over dry vegetation bare soil without evapotranspiration since larger albedo values induce decreases in shortwave radiation that drives net radiation by 60 80 while larger surface temperature values induce decrease in longwave radiation jacob et al 2002 ryu et al 2008 2 for the same reason rn is slightly larger over covering crops like wheat and slightly lower over sparse vegetation like rangeland 3 only g does not depict any seasonal pattern as previously observed by wang et al 2010 and it is quite similar regardless of crop 4 the magnitude of et is less than 4 mm day 1 over the four growth cycles of rainfed vegetation we consider here and it corresponds to 60 of rn at most which is moderately lower than the le rn ratio of 85 reported during the growing season of grassland by ryu et al 2008 5 the partition between h and le we observe here is similar to that reported by wang et al 2010 this is consistent with the seasonal variations of the energy balance components where sensible respectively latent heat flux is the main consumer of available energy in summer and autumn respectively winter and spring 6 the magnitude of le is slightly larger over covering crops like wheat and slightly lower over sparse vegetation like rangeland since soil moisture decreases faster than root zone moisture galleguillos et al 2017 montes et al 2014 7 regardless of crop h is larger than le after day 140 150 because of water shortage which is typical of water driven processes 7 the magnitude of eb res is close to that of g and it varies similarly to g possible explanations are related to available energy and soil thermal conductivity that are driven by vegetation fraction cover that depends on phenological stage and by seasonal dynamics of soil moisture then it is expected that correcting soil heat flux could improve energy balance ratio indeed wang et al 2010 improved energy balance ratio h le rn g from 0 78 to 0 86 by correcting the soil heat flux for heat storage also franssen et al 2010 stated that a 20 w m 2 non closure of energy balance can be attributed to measurement errors and or neglected storage terms however we recall that existing corrections are questionable for the swelling soils we consider here section 2 5 8 finally the time series we observe over rainfed annual crops are notably different from those reported over irrigated annual crops by payero and irmak 2013 with larger values for h and lower values for le in our case we report here larger values for the ratio rn rg as compared to those reported by ryu et al 2008 for mediterranean grasslands and for several fluxnet sites this indicates that incoming solar energy is more efficiently converted into available energy for the sites we consider in the current study also we note that the changes in ratio rn rg we observe according to upwinds and downwinds has not been reported by any study in the literature to our best knowledge as compared to previous studies we obtain consistent values of bowen ratio for different periods throughout our times series namely winter end of spring with water stress summer with vegetation drying and bare soil mamadou et al 2014 however we cannot draw any conclusion since we found in the literature only one report on such long time series also we note that our time series are not consistent anymore when assuming all measurement errors on le no energy balance error residue since br does not depict any stress event during drying periods this indicates that measurements errors do not affect le data only data not shown the largest value we observe for the ratio et et0 during the winter does not correspond to large values of et because et0 is low in winter this season which is energy limited is on contrary typified by large rainfalls that are not directly used by vegetation and that are distributed between infiltration and runoff thus the rainfall distribution between green and blue water is a significant concern in hilly mediterranean catchments for better water management modes in context of water scarcity mekki et al 2006 looking for technical practices strategies is therefore important in fact for wheat and oat the uniform row pattern plantation is a classical technical practice quanqi et al 2012 reported that in semi arid areas water use efficiency for wheat crops is larger when using furrow and bed planting patterns by 13 and 6 respectively as compared to the use of uniform row planting pattern for all ratios of energy fluxes namely the ratio of net radiation to solar irradiance rn rg the bowen ratio br as well as the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration et et0 we observe some differences between upwinds and downwinds in agreement with former experimental reports by zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 rn rg and bowen ratio are systematically larger for downwinds as compared to upwinds whereas this trend is not systematic for et et0 also the differences between upwinds and downwinds have a magnitude that is comparable to the energy balance residual eb res while et is reconstructed as energy balance residual for dataset b05 and a06 these elements make any conclusion questionable and further works are necessary a possible line of investigation is the change of aerodynamic conditions roughness length that drive convective fluxes because of airflow streamline dilatation and contraction as reported numerically and analytically by belcher et al 1993 raupach and finnigan 1997 5 conclusion the current study aims to document evapotranspiration and related surface energy fluxes for rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem by considering the plot scale within a case study located in the cap bon peninsula north eastern tunisia we report on seasonal variability of daily evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes as well as on seasonal variability of several proxies that document vegetation water status flux ratios rn rg h le and et et0 by considering daily timescale and annual extent in relation to crop phenology and hydrometeorological conditions it is shown that 1 our time series of energy fluxes show classical seasonal dynamics 2 our observations are consistent with previous studies in mediterranean or semi arid contexts and 3 our observations are notably different from those reported over irrigated annual crops for flux ratios we observe changes according to upwinds and downwinds although the magnitudes of these changes are within the energy balance residual further investigations are therefore necessary such as possible changes in aerodynamic conditions because of streamline dilatation contraction in accordance to upwinds and downwinds overall we state that ec measurements are promising over rainfed annual crops within semiarid hilly agrosystems for long term observations environmental modelling and operational purposes thus the current study provides a database of energy flux observations that can be used to calibrate or validate various models dealing with land surface processes for agricultural water management this study also provides some insights about the identification of energy limited and water limited periods for different crops growth cycles where climate forcing is more important than eco physiological differences between crops thus it seems that an et0 value of 4 mm day 1 is a threshold beyond which et decreases systematically and rapidly at least for the four crops included in our study case additionally we recommend to practitioners the setting up of a wind direction sensor within any agrometeorological station when dealing with hilly agrosystems so that any experimental correction can be further tailored by accounting for the combination of topography and wind direction in terms of agricultural water management the current study suggests to look for early sowing species varieties in order to reduce the evaporation based water loss in autumn it also suggests to explore supplemental irrigation during the critical phenological stages with water shortages finally the current study is conducted over few small fields within a specific hilly topography the results we report here are new and they need to be strengthened with additional experiments for a better understanding of the underlying processes such as changes in solar radiation with slope orientation changes in soil depth soil moisture and vegetation growth as well as changes in convective fluxes because of various factors air streamlines within the boundary layer aerodynamic and

9134,the current study aims to document evapotranspiration and associated surface energy fluxes for rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem in order to provide information on crop water use under such little studied conditions for this an experimental study is conducted within the tunisian study site of the omere observatory french acronym for the mediterranean observatory of water and the rural environment located in the north eastern cap bon peninsula it relies on eddy covariance ec measurements at the plot scale we report that 1 observations are consistent with previous studies under mediterranean or semi arid contexts with time series of energy fluxes that depict classical seasonal dynamics 2 common flux ratios i e bowen ratio ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration may change according to upwinds and downwinds which requires further investigations about possible changes in aerodynamic conditions and 3 a reference evapotranspiration value of 4 mm day 1 seems to be a threshold beyond which actual evapotranspiration decreases systematically and rapidly in terms of agricultural water management the current study suggests to look for early sowing species varieties in order to reduce the evaporation based water loss in autumn overall ec measurements seem promising over rainfed annual crops within semiarid hilly agrosystems for long term observations environmental modelling and operational purposes since the current study is conducted over few small fields within a specific hilly topography the original results we report here need to be strengthened with complementary studies keywords rainfed annual crops mediterranean hilly agrosystems evapotranspiration eddy covariance times series upwinds downwinds seasonal dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the southern shore of the mediterranean region has limited water resources water scarcity is likely to increase under climate change impact with consequences on crop functioning and yields brouziyne et al 2018 vadez et al 2022 the combination of crop yield decrease and population growth is likely to induce food insecurity and rural exodus weiss et al 2020 zouabi 2021 such forecast is critical for rainfed annual crops where plants with shallow rooting systems do not benefit from irrigation hossain et al 2020 in this context there are pressing demands for optimising crop water consumption by means of different techniques such as changes in crop variety or on farm practices karrou and oweis 2012 the optimisation of crop water consumption within agrosystems can be explored using numerical tools that address crop functioning and hydrological cycle including modelling platforms lebon et al 2019 siad et al 2019 and learning machine methods cheng et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2020 where both approaches rely on long term observations jarlan et al 2015 molénat et al 2018 within mediterranean rainfed agrosystems annual crops functioning is mainly driven by root zone water content while evapotranspiration is the most significant term of the hydrological balance aouade et al 2020 thus several numerical tools rely on first order relations between plant transpiration and biomass production dhouib et al 2022 ran et al 2020 while their calibrations require complementary observations of plant growth root zone water content and evapotranspiration kanda et al 2021 yang et al 2019 hilly catchments are widespread around the mediterranean their topography allows for water harvesting techniques that compensate for rainfall shortage by increasing infiltration such as land use or hydro agricultural structures ammar et al 2016 harmanny and malek 2019 mekki et al 2006 thus margin progresses are explored within hilly rainfed agrosystems by modulating changes in cropping systems and water harvesting techniques al khuzaie et al 2020 grum et al 2017 when dealing with water consumption it is necessary to account for additional processes induced by topography for both observation and modelling this includes 1 changes in solar radiation with slope orientation nie et al 1992 2 changes in soil depth soil moisture and vegetation growth along upstream downstream transects tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and 3 changes in air streamlines within the boundary layer in aerodynamic and micrometeorological conditions in source contributions and consequently in convective fluxes chen et al 2019 finnigan et al 2015 several studies have addressed micrometeorology and boundary layer turbulence over sloping and heterogeneous terrains mainly for mountainous conditions hammerle et al 2007 hiller et al 2008 serrano ortiz et al 2016 however very few studies dealt with crop water consumption for rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly catchments whereas the latter differ from mountainous conditions because of 1 the absence of anabatic and katabatic winds 2 the absence of valley breeze along catchment longitudinal axis and 3 the presence of externally driven winds that induce forced convection with neutral conditions zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 when dealing with modelling few works focused on the performances of crop models designed for flat terrains boudhina et al 2019 the formulation of aerodynamic resistance rana et al 2007 and the tailoring of variables within the penman monteith equation rana et al 2011 when dealing with observation few studies investigated 1 the processing of eddy covariance ec measurements according to upwinds downwinds and to vegetation height zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 2 the assessment of ec measurements according to sloping conditions boudhina et al 2017 2018a and 3 the tailoring of gap filling methods according to upwinds and downwinds boudhina et al 2018b zitouna chebbi et al 2018 beyond the aforementioned works on data processing and gap filling obtaining times series of crop water consumption over several crop cycles is paramount it permits to study the temporal dynamics of root zone soil water content crop functioning and water consumption longobardi and villani 2013 it opens path to documenting water fluxes over large periods in relation to hydrological cycle and crop water consumption french et al 2020 liu et al 2012 payero and irmak 2013 talebizadeh et al 2018 it permits to document long term influence of anthropogenic and climate forcing molénat et al 2018 several efforts have been conducted to produce and analyse times series of evapotranspiration over vegetated land surfaces including irrigated maize dare idowu et al 2021 irrigated wheat french et al 2020 rafi et al 2019 irrigated cotton anapalli et al 2020 and rainfed chickpea chakraborty et al 2021 however and to our best knowledge no study addressed rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly agrosystems whereas specific trends are likely to be observed in such context because of differences in soil depth soil moisture within shallow rooting systems vegetation growth and insolation aerodynamic conditions that drive convective fluxes the main objective of the current study is to document evapotranspiration and related surface energy fluxes over rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem this main objective is broken down into two specific objectives in relation to existing knowledge a first specific objective is to account for upwinds and downwinds follow on from the aforementioned studies that reported the influence of such winds on data processing and gap filling a second specific objective is to analyse evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes as well as several proxies that document on vegetation water status for this we analyse fluxes and related ratios by considering daily timescale and annual extent in relation to crop phenology and hydrometeorological conditions to reach the main objective and specific objectives we conduct an experimental study within a hilly agrosystem located in the cap bon peninsula north eastern tunisia over four rainfed annual crops that are representative of the mediterranean context the current paper is structured as follows we first detail the materials including the experimental setup and the measurement features the experimental conditions the data processing and the strategy for producing complete time series of energy fluxes thereafter we simultaneously report and discuss the results we obtain for energy fluxes and related ratios when considering the daily timescale and the annual extent we finally conclude on the contribution of the current study to the knowledge of evapotranspiration for rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly agrosystems along with further perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kamech catchment the experiment takes place within the kamech experimental site 2 5 km2 which is a sub catchment of the lebna regional catchment 210 km2 located in the cap bon peninsula north eastern tunisia 36 52 40 n 10 52 40 e 108 m above sea level kamech belongs to the long term environmental research observatory omere french acronym for the mediterranean observatory of water and the rural environment a detailed description of kamech is given in mekki et al 2006 and a detailed description of the omere observatory is given in molénat et al 2018 the catchment topography is v shaped along the northeast southwest axis the altitude ranges from 94 m to 194 m the terrain slope ranges from 0 to 30 the soil depth ranges from a few millimetres to two metres according to the location within the catchment and to the local topography the catchment includes four dominant soil types mekki et al 2018 namely cambisols 46 of the catchment area luvisols 26 vertisols 10 and regosols 18 the soils have sandy loam textures which make them swelling soils that exhibit shrinkage cracks under dry conditions during the summer raclot and albergel 2006 the regional climate is at the frontier between sub humid and semi arid with annual values of 667 mm and 1336 mm for rainfall and penman monteith evapotranspiration respectively average values over the 2004 2006 period the main crops are rainfed including winter cereals durum and bread wheat barley oat triticale and legumes chickpeas faba bean these crops can be harvested or grazed the steepest parts of the catchment are covered by natural vegetation and used as rangelands for grazing agricultural land parcel is typified by small plots with an average size of 0 62 ha a small hilly dam is set at the outlet of the kamech sub catchment and belongs to the network of small hilly dams along the hydrographic network within the regional lebna catchment gaubi et al 2017 2 2 measurement location and calendar in line with the previous works aforementioned we rely in the current study on the use of eddy covariance ec systems for measuring convective fluxes i e sensible and latent heat fluxes along with classical measurement devices for net radiation and soil heat flux in relation to the footprint of the ec measurements which can extend over several tens of metres depending upon airflows within the boundary layer aubinet et al 2012 we select agricultural plots larger than 1 ha so that any ec footprint mainly extends within the corresponding plot additionally we select 1 plots with regular slope to avoid transient airflows within the ec footprint and 2 plots far from the outlet dam to avoid possible advection these constraints lead to select three plots labelled a b and c fig 1 field data are collected throughout vegetation growth cycles in plots a b and c the experiment is conducted in 2004 2005 and 2006 and it encompasses successions of vegetation growth and bare soil after harvest or grazing the corresponding four datasets are labelled a04 b05 a06 and c06 where the letter represents the plot and the two digits represent the year detailed descriptions of both topography and relative position within the catchment for these plots are given in zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 we briefly synthetise here the area the slope the soil type the period of experiment and the land use table 1 2 3 data collection agro meteorological data energy flux data vegetation data a agro meteorological station is located near the catchment outlet labelled m to perform the following

sampled at a 1 hz frequency averaged and stored with a 30 mn time step all instruments are new or recently new and are calibrated by the manufacturer one or two eddy covariance ec stations are installed on different plots in 2004 2005 and 2006 to measure sensible and latent heat fluxes at the plot scale fig 1 and table 1 in 2004 respectively 2005 an ec station is installed on plot a

specific humidity q with a kh20 krypton hygrometer campbell scientific usa for datasets a04 and c06 the kh20 does not operate for datasets a06 and b05 because of instrumental degradation the raw data of the sonic anemometer and of the krypton hygrometer are recorded with a 10 hz frequency they are stored in a cr23x datalogger campbell scientific usa and they are downloaded every minute to a laptop through a rs232 serial port additionally the cr23x datalogger directly calculates convective fluxes without any prior instrumental correction the goal is to produce complete time series of evapotranspiration thanks to gap filling approaches the process is briefly explained in section 2 6 and detailed in supplementary materials section 1 a hmp45c probe vaisala finland is installed on each ec station to measure air temperature and humidity and next correct the calibration drift of the krypton hygrometer net radiation rn is measured at each ec station using a nr lite device kipp

the cr23x datalogger the sonic anemometers the krypton hygrometers and the air temperature and humidity probes are installed at the same height above the ground during each period of data acquisition 1 96 m for field a in 2004 data set a04 1 78 m for field a in 2006 dataset a06 and 2 02 m for field c in 2006 data set c06 zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 verified that 1 70 80 of each flux measurement originated from the corresponding field with a unique crop and 2 the measurement heights were located within the inertial sublayer above the roughness sublayer regardless of vegetation height vegetation measurements include plant height and leaf area index lai for plant height the number of observations per plot ranges from 30 for annual crops homogeneous canopies to 100 for rangelands heterogeneous canopies with several species for each measurement date for lai sample collection is replicated within delimited areas of 0 30 0 30 m2 size at each measurement date the number of replicates per plot varies from 5 to 10 depending upon the canopy heterogeneity for both plant height and lai frequency of measurement collection ranges from 2 to 4 weeks in accordance to the vegetation growth observed within each plot plant height is estimated using a tape measure and each sample is weighed next a sub sample is selected corresponding to about 1 3 of the sample weight to measure leaf area using a windias planimeter delta t devices ltd cambridge uk finally plant height and leaf area index at the plot scale are estimated as average values across all samples for each date 2 4 characterisation of experimental conditions 2 4 1 vegetation conditions for each dataset we provide an overview about crops and varieties as well as about vegetation development throughout growth cycle following allen et al 1998 we using leaf area index lai and vegetation height table 2 summarises vegetation growth stage as well as measurements of lai and plant height throughout the experiment the experiment starts on plot a in 2004 dataset a04 when durum wheat crop karim variety common in north africa is at full development stage fd agricultural practices are not optimal and we note the presence of both weeds and diseases wheat rust lai reaches his maximum value lai max at the end of march with a value of 0 8 m2 m 2 the senescence stage se starts on 26 may after harvest on 17 july the plot is used for grazing and it is covered by wheat straw residues that slowly decompose until the end of the summer the first ploughing for next crop is done at the beginning of november 2004 the experiment starts on plot b in 2005 dataset b05 one month after sowing when oat local variety is at mid season development stage md the fd stage starts on 01 april with an lai max equal to 3 m2 m 2 on average and a plant height equal to 1 m on average senescence stage se starts on 25 may and the oat crop is green cut at the end of may for animal feeding the experiment starts on plot a in 2006 dataset a06 with a faba bean crop vicia faba l local variety measurements start during the md stage and the fd stage occurs on 28 march lai max 1 34 m2 m 2 plant height 0 45 m after harvest of the pods in mid may the plot is used for grazing with natural vegetation until the dry period during 2006 another experiment is conducted on plot c dataset c06 plot c is not cultivated and spontaneous vegetation is used for grazing vegetation canopy is very heterogeneous the measurements start at fd stage with lai max 0 92 m2 m 2 and se stage starts on 18 may the spontaneous vegetation depicts a similar dynamic than cultivated crops with similar periods of greenness and senescence 2 4 2 meteorological conditions we characterise climatic conditions during the experiment on the basis of daytime values of air temperature ta solar radiation rg wind speed u and vapour pressure deficit vpd where daytime corresponds to solar and net radiation above 20 w m 2 these meteorological variables are collected by the agro meteorological station located at the outlet of the kamech catchment section 2 3 a prerequisite for the analysis of these variables is to obtain complete time series throughout the experiment despite missing data due to equipment malfunction mainly for measurements of air temperature and humidity to this end we use linear relationships between half hourly values of air temperature and humidity from coincident measurements with hmp45c probes at the agro meteorological station and the ec stations these linear relationships are typified by 1 correlation coefficients r2 around 0 99 and 2 discrepancies around the regression lines around 0 1 c and 0 03 kpa for air temperature and vpd respectively next daily reference evapotranspiration et0 is calculated using fao56 method according to allen et al 1998 table 3 displays daytime values when separating winds from the northwest sector wind direction greater than 220 and less than 70 and winds from the south sector wind direction between 135 and 225 as well as when separating conditions of vegetated surface and bare soil rg ranges from 384 w m 2 for dataset a04 with bare soil to 560 w m 2 for dataset c06 with bare soil on plot a in 2004 rg is low during the bare soil period in autumn neither systematic nor significant difference is observed between northwest and south winds u ranges from 4 and 6 4 m s 1 which corresponds to large values as compared to fao worldwide mean value allen et al 1998 these large wind speed values are in agreement with the micrometeorological data that indicated dominant regimes of forced convection along with conditions of near neutrality or low instability zitouna chebbi et al 2012 south winds are typified by lower speeds as compared to northwest winds ta ranges from 13 to 30 c which is representative of the seasonal variability throughout the experiment we note larger ta values for south winds as compared to northwest winds with differences ranging from 1 to 3 c vpd varies between 0 11 kpa for bare soil conditions on plot a in 2004 and 2 8 kpa for bare soil conditions on both plot a in 2006 and plot c in 2006 south winds are typified by larger vpd values as compared to northwest winds since they correspond to larger air temperatures values fig 2 displays times series of daily rainfall for 2004 2005 and 2006 yearly cumulated rainfall r is 515 mm 726 mm and 761 mm respectively daily rainfall depicts an inter seasonal variability cumulated rainfall is larger for northwest winds as compared to south winds which results from the combination of 1 similar average values for both with directions and 2 a larger occurrence of northwest winds from a seasonal viewpoint that combines rainfall with vegetation growth stage larger cumulated rainfalls are recorded during the mid development md stage than during the full development fd stage for datasets b05 a06 and c06 fig 2 also displays times series of daily reference et0 cumulated values at the yearly timescale are 1427 mm 1252 mm and 1329 mm for 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively daily et0 ranges from 1 to 8 mm day 1 and largest values are observed when maximum values occur for both air temperature and vdp thus the winter season respectively summer season corresponds to lowest values respectively largest values of et0 during the summer season et0 is larger for south winds as compared to northwest winds whereas it is similar regardless of wind direction during the other seasons when comparing rainfall against et0 for different stages of vegetation development we observe that daily rainfall r is larger than daily et0 only for the b05 dataset during the mid development md stage with r 3 56 mm day 1 and et0 1 93 mm day 1 on average over the period daily water supply is heterogeneously distributed throughout the vegetation growth cycle overall the meteorological conditions of the kamech catchment are typically mediterranean with a water limitation during the summer and an energy limitation during the winter 2 5 flux data processing half hourly data of net radiation rn are corrected from sloping effect on solar exposure by following holst et al 2005 as detailed in zitouna chebbi et al 2012 in addition a side by side comparison of nr lite net radiometers is conducted during one month within the same plot instrumental differences are within the instrumental accuracies with a root mean square difference rmsd of about 20 w m 2 the three soil heat flux measurements g are averaged over 30 mn periods and no correction is applied for the heat storage between the surface and the sensors we chose not to apply any correction since existing corrections are questionable for swelling soils zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 as mentioned previously the cr23x datalogger also calculates convective fluxes without any prior instrumental correction in order to produce complete time series of evapotranspiration convective fluxes are calculated as h ρ cp cov w t for sensible heat and le ρ lv cov w q for latent heat where ρ is air density cp is air specific heat lv is vaporisation latent heat w and t are vertical wind speed and air temperature measured by the sonic anemometer q is specific humidity measured by the krypton hygrometer and cov stands for covariance sensible and latent heat fluxes are calculated over 30 mn periods and stored in the cr23x datalogger they are labelled h wc for sensible heat and le wc for latent heat where wc stands for without correction the raw data recorded at 10 hz are postprocessed using the ecpack open source library version 2 5 22 van dijk et al 2004 postprocessing steps include spike detection vickers and mahrt 1997 air humidity corrections for sensible heat flux schotanus et al 1983 density corrections for latent heat flux webb et al 1980 and planar fit rotation wilczak et al 2001 when applying planar fit rotation we account for the influence of hilly topography by separating upwinds and downwinds and by separating different intervals of vegetation height zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 convective fluxes are calculated over 30 mn periods next we apply quality control tests to select ec high quality data foken and wichura 1996 for this we keep the two first classes of quality control test since they are considered as high quality data for long term flux estimation foken et al 2005 these convective fluxes are labelled h pf for sensible heat and le pf for latent heat where pf stands for planar fit eventually each dataset a04 a06 b05 and c06 includes a number of 30 mn data for each energy flux and each processing level on convective fluxes the number of data depends upon the length of data acquisition period the daytime length throughout the data acquisition period the data availability and the quality filtering table 4 indicates the numbers of data for rn and g for h wc and le wc as well as for h pf and le pf when dealing with rn datasets cover all measurement periods as compared to the number of rn data within each dataset we note slight missing rates for g within datasets a04 and b05 about 0 1 and 3 8 respectively for h wc and le wc we note moderate missing rates when measurements are available from 12 5 to 34 8 and from 33 4 to 44 6 respectively for h pf and le pf we note significant missing rates when measurements are available from 58 4 to 89 8 and from 63 2 to 91 8 respectively these significant missing rates stem from experimental troubles for data storage in relation to power failure for convective fluxes with correction h pf and le pf the few numbers of data highlight the necessity to use gap filling methods based on available data of net radiation and of convective fluxes without correction h wc and le wc 2 6 generating time series of convective fluxes table 4 in section 2 5 highlights the low percentages of data available for convective fluxes relative to the numbers of data to be collected throughout the experiment duration as indicated with the number of available data for net radiation in order to document evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes under the specific conditions on which focuses the current study namely rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem we set up and implement an overall strategy to produce times series of convective fluxes for each of the datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 we produce time series of surface energy fluxes at the half hourly timescale we focus on daytime measurements since nighttime values of sensible and latent heat fluxes are low on a daily timescale we separate upwinds and downwinds following zitouna chebbi et al 2012 for plots a and b the downwinds belong to the northwest sector wind direction greater than 220 and less than 70 while the upwinds belong to the south sector wind direction between 135 and 225 the reverse is true for plot c namely downwinds belong to the south sector while upwinds belong to the northwest sector east winds are disregarded due to the position of the anemometer and the thermo hygrometer zitouna chebbi et al 2012 we also separate different intervals of vegetation following table 2 in section 2 4 1 and in accordance to zitouna chebbi et al 2015 when dealing with datasets a04 and c06 we setup a gap filling strategy for the time series of convective flux data h and le on the basis of 1 linear regressions between corrected and non corrected convective fluxes and 2 linear regressions between corrected convective fluxes and net radiation when dealing with datasets b05 and a06 no convective le flux are available we therefore apply the above mentioned gap filling strategy on sensible heat flux h only and we estimate latent heat flux as the residual of surface energy balance more details are given in supplementary materials section 1 for gap filling methodology and supplementary materials section 2 for gap filling performances 3 results and discussions we report and discuss the results we obtain for temporal dynamics of energy fluxes and related ratios including ratio of net radiation to solar irradiance bowen ratio as well as ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration in most cases we address the daily timescale and the annual extent in order to capture temporal dynamics in relation to vegetation development stages and hydrometeorological conditions throughout several seasons also we analyse and discuss ratios of energy fluxes according to upwinds and downwinds since the influence of meteorological conditions related to northwest and south winds section 2 4 2 is mitigated for ratios as compared to fluxes 3 1 temporal dynamics of daily energy fluxes fig 3 displays for each of the four datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 the seasonal variations of daytime energy fluxes at the daily timescale including net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible and latent heat flux h and le le flux magnitude is displayed in both w m 2 left axis and mm day 1 right axis fig 3 also displays the seasonal variations of energy balance error residue eb res rn g h le that is a proxy of uncertainties related to measurements and data processing as well as a proxy of intrinsic limitations of energy balance closure daily rn does not exceed 500 w m 2 for all seasons and datasets it reaches maximum values in spring for the four datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 mainly during senescence se stages and depicts lower values in summer and autumn with bare soils we observe minimal rn values for dataset b05 until winter around 240 w m 2 on average additionally the abrupt decreases in rn we observe throughout the time series are ascribed to cloud coverage for the current study daily soil heat flux depicts the lower magnitude with values always below 100 w m 2 it also depicts no seasonal variability and no increase during dry seasons g corresponds to 5 of rn during full development fd stage of the wheat crop dataset a04 and to 17 of rn during bare soil conditions dataset a06 daily sensible heat flux does not exceed 300 w m 2 over the four datasets and it depicts clear seasonal variations it increases from spring to reach a maximum in summer and decreases thereafter it is very low during winter for dataset b05 and it does not exceed 50 w m 2 during the rainy periods overall it is less than 40 of rn when vegetation is well developed and it is more than 60 of rn in summer with bare soil conditions daily latent heat flux which corresponds to actual evapotranspiration et rarely exceeds 200 w m 2 4 mm day 1 even when it exceeds sensible heat flux it depicts seasonal patterns with maximum values in spring followed by decreases to zero in summer also it increases after each rain event during the mid development md stages of barley and faba bean crops le corresponds to 50 and 44 of rn during the fd stages of wheat barley faba bean and rangeland it corresponds to 44 55 38 and 38 of rn respectively during the senescence stages it corresponds to 25 36 32 and 29 of rn respectively we also observe lower values for bare soil conditions where le corresponds to 14 18 19 and 24 of rn respectively additionally we observe an increase up to 25 of rn for bare soil in autumn dataset a04 which is ascribed to rain events daily value of energy balance residual eb res reaches up to 100 w m 2 in some cases dataset a04 it is close to h and g at the beginning of the time series for dataset b05 and it has the same magnitude than g and le during the summer for all datasets it represents between 6 and 14 of rn during md stage for dataset b05 and fd stage for dataset a04 respectively overall high values of g rn are often accompanied by low values of eb res rn finally we note that energy fluxes rn h le are lower for dataset c06 as compared to the three other datasets a04 b05 and a06 besides times series show simultaneous decreases and increases of the fluxes which confirms the consistency between the independent measurements of the four energy balance components rn g h le 3 2 seasonal variations of daily rn rg to analyse the partitioning of daily energy fluxes under the specific conditions we address here namely rainfed annual crops within mediterranean hilly agrosystems we study the temporal dynamic of net radiation to solar irradiance rn rg at the daily time scale this ratio is a proxy of the solar irradiance amount to be transformed into net radiation and subsequently into soil heat flux and convective fluxes ryu et al 2008 also this ratio permits to quantify changes in net radiation rn according to upwinds and downwinds while attenuating the impact of changes in rg between northwest and south winds section 2 4 2 the ratio rn rg shows a large variability from 0 35 to 0 7 fig 4 first we note some differences between upwinds and downwinds these differences between 0 04 and 0 12 on average are observed for all plots all years and throughout all experimental periods the ratio rn rg is larger for downwinds northwest winds for datasets a04 b05 and a06 south winds for dataset c06 as compared to upwinds south winds for datasets a04 b05 and a06 northwest winds for dataset c06 second we note some differences from the viewpoint of vegetation development the ratio rn rg depicts largest values 0 59 on average during the full development fe and senescence se stages and lowest values 0 55 on average during bare soil conditions third the temporal dynamics depicts seasonalities the ratio rn rg increases during autumn with the first rainfall for dataset a04 and it is smaller in winter than in spring for dataset b05 indeed the partitioning of the ratio rn rg depends upon land cover and surface humidity with larger values for humid and green covered surfaces 3 3 seasonal variation of daily bowen ratio the ratio h le is known as bowen ratio br and is a proxy of water status perez et al 2008 we analyse its temporal dynamic according to upwinds downwinds by assuming that ratioing the two convective fluxes mitigates the influence of meteorological conditions between northwest and south winds section 2 4 2 we observe a clear variability during the experimental periods for the four datasets fig 5 it varies from less than one to more than four across all datasets it is lower than one during the mid development md stages and the full development fd stages it depicts the lowest values during the fd stage for dataset b05 with an average value of 0 53 it increases during the senescence se stage with an average value of 1 57 and increases up to more than 2 during the bare soil periods for the dataset a06 it depicts an abrupt increase as compared to gradual increases for the other datasets it depicts significant fluctuations during dry summer which is ascribed to small variations in le flux near zero finally it changes according to upwinds and downwinds for dataset a06 with larger values for downwinds northwest winds 3 4 seasonal variation of daily et et0 fig 6 displays the temporal variations of et et0 ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration for the four datasets by separating upwinds and downwinds additionally subplots in fig 5 indicate the vegetation growth stages as determined by the measurements of lai and plant height section 2 4 1 dataset a04 spreads over the fd and se stages of the wheat crop for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 1 3 and 0 4 mm day 1 et0 2 7 and 5 1 mm day 1 et 2 2 and 1 7 mm day 1 eb res 0 5 and 0 7 mm day 1 and lai max 0 8 m2 m2 the ratio et et0 is stable throughout the fd stage with an average value around 0 84 then it decreases during the se stage down to 0 13 at the harvest period and next increases to around 0 4 after the first autumn rainfall finally et et0 is larger for downwinds northwest winds than for upwinds south winds with differences about 0 45 and 0 12 on average for fd and se respectively dataset b05 spreads over the md fd and se stages of the oat crop for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 3 5 2 5 and 0 5 mm day 1 et0 1 9 2 5 and 4 3 mm day 1 et 1 4 2 3 and 2 2 mm day 1 and eb res 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mm day 1 and lai max 3 m2 m2 et et0 is lower than 0 5 during the md stage with peaks above unity after rain events it next increases until the middle of the md stage and is then typified by a stress period i e decrease until the end of the md stage indeed cumulated rainfall is larger than cumulated et0 on average during the md stage but it is unequally distributed fig sp4 thus rainfall amounts are large at the beginning of the md stage whereas both et0 and lai are low the subsequent soil water storage is large at the beginning of the md period for the benefit of vegetation growth but it vanishes with time during the fd stage we observe a stress event after which the ratio et et0 is stabilised around unity next the se period is typified by a decrease of et et0 down to 0 4 at the harvest time we observe non negligible et et0 value after harvest which indicates that vegetation is still active conversely to what is observed for the wheat crop dataset a04 finally the ratio et et0 is larger for downwinds northwest winds than for upwinds south winds with differences about 0 15 0 24 and 0 08 on average for md fd and se stages respectively dataset a06 spreads over the md and fd stages of the faba bean crop as well as over the following rangeland period for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 1 3 0 9 and 0 4 mm day 1 et0 2 6 3 7 and 5 5 mm day 1 et 1 8 2 and 1 9 mm day 1 eb res 0 4 0 6 and 0 7 mm day 1 and lai max 1 3 m2 m2 the ratio et et0 is slightly larger during the md stage 0 69 than during the fd stage 0 56 which is explained by the lack of rainfall during the fd period the rangeland period is typified by an average value of 0 35 for et et0 with a decrease trend on the first half and an increase trend at the beginning of the second part that start after a 10 mm rainfall finally the ratio et et0 is similar for upwinds and downwinds where et et0 is slightly larger for upwinds south winds as compared to downwinds northwest with differences about 0 06 on average for md dataset c06 spreads over fd and se stages of the rangeland for which we indicate the average values of rainfall 1 5 and 0 8 mm day 1 et0 3 3 and 5 4 mm day 1 et 1 6 and 1 5 mm day 1 eb res 0 51 and 0 67 mm day 1 and lai max 0 9 m2 m2 during the fd stage the ratio et et0 is relatively stable with an average value of 0 5 and it decreases during the se stage down to 0 2 with an average value of 0 3 over the se stage the ratio et et0 is lower for upwinds northwest winds as compared to the downwinds south winds with differences about 0 07 and 0 05 respectively for fd and se on the basis of the results reported and discussed across the four datasets a04 b05 a06 and c06 we highlight general outcomes listed below for the bare soil periods the ratio et et0 corresponds to an evaporation term it is lower than 0 2 only until the end of the experimental periods for dataset a04 except after the autumnal rainfalls where it reaches values close to unity across all datasets periods with water loss from evaporation are observed during the autumn season or at the beginning of the md period the maximum values we observe for the ratio et et0 are lower than 1 2 this threshold value is consistent with the interval suggested by allen et al 2011 we note that adding eb res to le fluxes which corresponds to the most pessimistic case would lead to a maximum value for et et0 that does not exceed 1 5 which is still within the aforementioned interval all times series for the ratio et et0 clearly depict seasonal behaviours despite fluctuations that are ascribed to temporal changes in water supply for rainfed annual crops across the four datasets we observe rapid and systematic decreases of et when et0 is larger than 4 mm day 1 where the latter seems to be a threshold value for vegetation transpiration this systematic and rapid decrease of etr et0 may be explained by two driving factors namely vegetation senescence and decrease of water content these two driving factors being linked because of water shortage thus decrease in etr induced increase of the temperature of the vegetation and thus acceleration of phenology that is driven by cumulated temperature sacks and kucharik 2011 the faba bean crop depict vegetation growth similar to that reported by manschadi et al 1998 in mediterranean conditions in conditions similar to those of our study for water limited case and late sowing december they report that et is lower but water use efficiency is larger than for well watered conditions 4 discussion our observations for the temporal dynamics of daily energy fluxes are consistent with previous studies in similar contexts either mediterranean or semi arid 1 rn is low over dry vegetation bare soil without evapotranspiration since larger albedo values induce decreases in shortwave radiation that drives net radiation by 60 80 while larger surface temperature values induce decrease in longwave radiation jacob et al 2002 ryu et al 2008 2 for the same reason rn is slightly larger over covering crops like wheat and slightly lower over sparse vegetation like rangeland 3 only g does not depict any seasonal pattern as previously observed by wang et al 2010 and it is quite similar regardless of crop 4 the magnitude of et is less than 4 mm day 1 over the four growth cycles of rainfed vegetation we consider here and it corresponds to 60 of rn at most which is moderately lower than the le rn ratio of 85 reported during the growing season of grassland by ryu et al 2008 5 the partition between h and le we observe here is similar to that reported by wang et al 2010 this is consistent with the seasonal variations of the energy balance components where sensible respectively latent heat flux is the main consumer of available energy in summer and autumn respectively winter and spring 6 the magnitude of le is slightly larger over covering crops like wheat and slightly lower over sparse vegetation like rangeland since soil moisture decreases faster than root zone moisture galleguillos et al 2017 montes et al 2014 7 regardless of crop h is larger than le after day 140 150 because of water shortage which is typical of water driven processes 7 the magnitude of eb res is close to that of g and it varies similarly to g possible explanations are related to available energy and soil thermal conductivity that are driven by vegetation fraction cover that depends on phenological stage and by seasonal dynamics of soil moisture then it is expected that correcting soil heat flux could improve energy balance ratio indeed wang et al 2010 improved energy balance ratio h le rn g from 0 78 to 0 86 by correcting the soil heat flux for heat storage also franssen et al 2010 stated that a 20 w m 2 non closure of energy balance can be attributed to measurement errors and or neglected storage terms however we recall that existing corrections are questionable for the swelling soils we consider here section 2 5 8 finally the time series we observe over rainfed annual crops are notably different from those reported over irrigated annual crops by payero and irmak 2013 with larger values for h and lower values for le in our case we report here larger values for the ratio rn rg as compared to those reported by ryu et al 2008 for mediterranean grasslands and for several fluxnet sites this indicates that incoming solar energy is more efficiently converted into available energy for the sites we consider in the current study also we note that the changes in ratio rn rg we observe according to upwinds and downwinds has not been reported by any study in the literature to our best knowledge as compared to previous studies we obtain consistent values of bowen ratio for different periods throughout our times series namely winter end of spring with water stress summer with vegetation drying and bare soil mamadou et al 2014 however we cannot draw any conclusion since we found in the literature only one report on such long time series also we note that our time series are not consistent anymore when assuming all measurement errors on le no energy balance error residue since br does not depict any stress event during drying periods this indicates that measurements errors do not affect le data only data not shown the largest value we observe for the ratio et et0 during the winter does not correspond to large values of et because et0 is low in winter this season which is energy limited is on contrary typified by large rainfalls that are not directly used by vegetation and that are distributed between infiltration and runoff thus the rainfall distribution between green and blue water is a significant concern in hilly mediterranean catchments for better water management modes in context of water scarcity mekki et al 2006 looking for technical practices strategies is therefore important in fact for wheat and oat the uniform row pattern plantation is a classical technical practice quanqi et al 2012 reported that in semi arid areas water use efficiency for wheat crops is larger when using furrow and bed planting patterns by 13 and 6 respectively as compared to the use of uniform row planting pattern for all ratios of energy fluxes namely the ratio of net radiation to solar irradiance rn rg the bowen ratio br as well as the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration et et0 we observe some differences between upwinds and downwinds in agreement with former experimental reports by zitouna chebbi et al 2015 2012 rn rg and bowen ratio are systematically larger for downwinds as compared to upwinds whereas this trend is not systematic for et et0 also the differences between upwinds and downwinds have a magnitude that is comparable to the energy balance residual eb res while et is reconstructed as energy balance residual for dataset b05 and a06 these elements make any conclusion questionable and further works are necessary a possible line of investigation is the change of aerodynamic conditions roughness length that drive convective fluxes because of airflow streamline dilatation and contraction as reported numerically and analytically by belcher et al 1993 raupach and finnigan 1997 5 conclusion the current study aims to document evapotranspiration and related surface energy fluxes for rainfed annual crops within a mediterranean hilly agrosystem by considering the plot scale within a case study located in the cap bon peninsula north eastern tunisia we report on seasonal variability of daily evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes as well as on seasonal variability of several proxies that document vegetation water status flux ratios rn rg h le and et et0 by considering daily timescale and annual extent in relation to crop phenology and hydrometeorological conditions it is shown that 1 our time series of energy fluxes show classical seasonal dynamics 2 our observations are consistent with previous studies in mediterranean or semi arid contexts and 3 our observations are notably different from those reported over irrigated annual crops for flux ratios we observe changes according to upwinds and downwinds although the magnitudes of these changes are within the energy balance residual further investigations are therefore necessary such as possible changes in aerodynamic conditions because of streamline dilatation contraction in accordance to upwinds and downwinds overall we state that ec measurements are promising over rainfed annual crops within semiarid hilly agrosystems for long term observations environmental modelling and operational purposes thus the current study provides a database of energy flux observations that can be used to calibrate or validate various models dealing with land surface processes for agricultural water management this study also provides some insights about the identification of energy limited and water limited periods for different crops growth cycles where climate forcing is more important than eco physiological differences between crops thus it seems that an et0 value of 4 mm day 1 is a threshold beyond which et decreases systematically and rapidly at least for the four crops included in our study case additionally we recommend to practitioners the setting up of a wind direction sensor within any agrometeorological station when dealing with hilly agrosystems so that any experimental correction can be further tailored by accounting for the combination of topography and wind direction in terms of agricultural water management the current study suggests to look for early sowing species varieties in order to reduce the evaporation based water loss in autumn it also suggests to explore supplemental irrigation during the critical phenological stages with water shortages finally the current study is conducted over few small fields within a specific hilly topography the results we report here are new and they need to be strengthened with additional experiments for a better understanding of the underlying processes such as changes in solar radiation with slope orientation changes in soil depth soil moisture and vegetation growth as well as changes in convective fluxes because of various factors air streamlines within the boundary layer aerodynamic and
