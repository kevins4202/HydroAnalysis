16645,reconditioning of food processing water streams for reuse is an increasingly common water management practice in the food industry and uv disinfection is often employed as part of the water treatment several factors may impact the effect of uv radiation here we aim to assess the impact of cell aggregation on uv inactivation kinetics and investigate if uv exposure induces aggregation three strains isolated from food processing water reuse lines raoultella ornithinolytica pseudomonas brenneri rothia mucilaginosa and both an aggregating and a non aggregating strain of staphylococcus aureus were exposed to uvc light at 255 nm using uv led equipment total viable count and phase contrast microscopy coupled with image analysis were used to compare the uv inactivation kinetics with the average particle size for a range of uv doses tailing effect seen as a strong reduction in inactivation rate was observed for all strains at higher uv doses industrial strains 50 or 120 mj cm2 s aureus strains 40 or 60 mj cm2 the naturally aggregating strains were more uv tolerant both within and between species when aggregates of s aureus were broken uv tolerance decreased for the processing water isolates the lowest applied uv dose 25 mj cm2 significantly increased the average particle size application of higher uv doses obtained with longer exposure times did not further increase the particle size compared with untreated samples for the s aureus strains however no consistent change in average particle size was observed due to uv our results demonstrate that aggregating strains have a higher degree of protection and that uv radiation induces aggregation in some but not all bacteria a better understanding of the mechanisms governing microbial aggregation and survival during uv treatment could help to improve uv applications and predictions of microbial inactivation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv treatment tailing effect bacterial aggregation water reuse food processing water 1 introduction the food processing industry needs large amounts of water daily for cleaning transport and food processing purposes from the raw materials to the final products and use of potable water quality has commonly been required however due to both cost and sustainability issues many food industries are trying to reduce their water footprint and looking at ways to do so one way is to reuse food processing water after appropriate treatment casani and knøchel 2002 and recently the food and agriculture organization fao together with the world health organization who published a report in which the concept of fit for purpose water for reuse in the food industry was presented using a risk based approach fao and who 2019 while the technology for efficient food processing water reuse is continuously advancing the main challenge is to ensure the quality and safety of the reconditioned water and the final products casani et al 2005 casani and knøchel 2002 ilsi 2013 ultraviolet uv light disinfection is among the treatment technologies that can successfully help to obtain a fit for purpose water quality uv is generally considered a robust water treatment technology with a wide antimicrobial spectrum also being effective against e g chlorine resistant protozoa cryptosporidium sp hijnen et al 2006 who 2017 uv treatment of process water is also attractive to the food industry since at the doses and wavelengths regularly used uv does not lead to formation of problematic disinfection by products dbp koutchma et al 2019 reckhow et al 2010 sommer et al 2005 pirnie et al 2006 who 2017 at high doses and low wavelengths however uv may lead to conversion of e g nitrate to nitrite pirnie et al 2006 uv mercury lamps and especially low pressure mercury lamps lpml are the main uv source used for industrial scale disinfection due to their high wall plug efficiency the ratio of optical power output to electrical power input reaching approx 40 and their monochromatic emission at 254 nm close to the dna absorption peak approx 260 nm koutchma et al 2019 however mercury lamps are fragile bulky surrounded by glass and contain toxic mercury the uv light emitting diode led technology is now rapidly emerging as an environmentally friendlier and easier to use alternative expected to replace mercury lamps in the future uv leds emit radiation at a narrow wavelength bandwidth which can be tailor made do not contain toxic mercury and are light compact and less fragile they offer flexibility in reactor design and the possibility of combining multiple wavelengths koutchma et al 2019 oguma et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 uv led chips manufacturing nevertheless still presents a challenge for short uvc wavelengths having a much lower wall plug efficiency 0 2 5 compared to lpml beck et al 2017 koutchma et al 2019 li et al 2019 but it is expected that the efficiency of uv leds will be increasing and the price decreasing koutchma et al 2019 uv radiation has been applied extensively over the last decades for drinking water and wastewater microbial disinfection either individually or in combination with other treatments such as membrane filtration however there is still limited information on the use of uv technology for disinfection of different types of food processing water streams chatzisymeon 2016 diaz et al 2001 ignat et al 2015 mavrov and bélières 2000 selma et al 2008 if the technology is used as a critical reconditioning step it is important to ensure the safety and the efficiency of the method as well as to be able to reliably predict inactivation of relevant microbiological hazards or nuisance organisms traditionally microbiological inactivation has often been described using log linear kinetics several studies have however observed a tailing effect defined as a phenomenon where the initial inactivation rate decreases with increasing uv doses during uv inactivation of microorganisms in aqueous suspensions using different wavelengths uv sources flow through or static set ups beck et al 2017 blatchley et al 2001 li et al 2017 mamane gravetz and linden 2005 mattle and kohn 2012 nyangaresi et al 2018 oguma et al 2013 shoults and ashbolt 2019 table 1 there are numerous hypotheses on the causes behind the tailing effect among these are the existence of resistant sub populations the ability to repair and be reactivated growth phase dependent tolerance experimental bias or shielding due to equipment design or presence of particles all of which may furthermore be affected by species and strains characteristics a probable explanation which has also been suggested several times is microbial aggregation blatchley et al 2001 hijnen et al 2006 mamane gravetz and linden 2005 mattle and kohn 2012 nyangaresi et al 2018 shoults and ashbolt 2019 microbial aggregates have a three dimensional structure such as seen in biofilms but are conglomerates of cells floating as planktonic cells like in biofilms cells in large aggregates exhibit high antibiotic resistance and tolerance towards chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid and physical stresses alhede et al 2011 blatchley et al 2001 haaber et al 2012 mamane gravetz and linden 2005 mattle et al 2011 planktonic aggregates may reach high cell numbers due to their three dimensional growth providing better access to growth resources kragh et al 2016 the ability to form planktonic aggregates has been demonstrated in several bacteria including pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus s aureus alhede et al 2011 haaber et al 2012 kragh et al 2016 since uv disinfection has no residual action after treatment it would be a concern if surviving microorganisms within aggregates would start growth and biofilm formation during storage of the reconditioned water and thus jeopardize the safety and quality of the food production the hypothesis behind uv induced microbial aggregation suggests that uv radiation can change the cell surface characteristics thereby decreasing the repulsion between the cells and making them attach more readily to each other in the center of these aggregates cells may be shielded by an outer shell of impaired cells and protected from further uv radiation blatchley et al 2001 lee et al 2018 fig 1 however research on uv induced microbial aggregation is limited to a few studies which by employing primarily escherichia coli e coli and different methods such as epifluorescence microscopy observations blatchley et al 2001 particle counter analysis kollu and örmeci 2015 and study of the changes in the electrostatic cell surface charge lee et al 2018 indicate that uv induced bacterial aggregation takes place the latter study by lee et al 2018 included also a s aureus and a p aeruginosa strain in this study our objective is to assess the impact of microbial aggregation on the uv inactivation kinetics and evaluate whether microbial aggregation is uv induced in naturally aggregating and non aggregating bacteria isolated from food industry process water as well as in s aureus isolates with different aggregation characteristics phase contrast microscopy with image analysis is employed to determine the average particle size before and after uv treatment for a range of uv doses and bacterial strains combined with determination of the total viable count tvc 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains a total of five strains were used table 2 three strains from food industries were chosen based on their occurrence in membrane filtered process water potentially destined for different reuse options the first strain was identified by 16s rrna sequencing as raoultella ornithinolytica r ornithinolytica and it was isolated from multi genera biofilms on the permeate side of reverse osmosis ro membranes in a whey water processing line stoica et al 2018 vitzilaiou et al 2019 two more strains were isolated from slaughterhouse side streams treated by multiple filtration steps and uv light lpml 250 mj cm2 in a pilot line for processing water for reuse the first strain was identified as pseudomonas brenneri p brenneri and the second as rothia mucilaginosa r mucilaginosa using the on rep seq sequencing krych et al 2018 the latter represents an example of a strongly self aggregating bacteria to compare uv inactivation kinetics within the same species two culture collection strains belonging to s aureus were also included in the study one strain was naturally aggregating when reaching late exponential phase s aureus 8325 4 wild type strain nctc 8325 cured of phages φ11 φ12 and φ13 haaber et al 2012 novick 1967 while the other was non aggregating s aureus newman clinical isolate atcc 25904 duthie and lorenz 1952 haaber et al 2012 according to haaber et al 2012 the difference in the aggregation level between these two strains derives from the icaadbc operon present in s aureus 8325 4 the expression of which is induced in the exponential growth phase and leads to the production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin pia pia has been found to be a major contributor to the formation of planktonic aggregates in s aureus and this operon has been found in most clinical isolates of s aureus 2 2 inoculum preparation a loopful from frozen culture stocks 80 c was streaked on tryptone soy agar tsa tryptone soy broth tsb cm0129 oxoid supplemented with 1 5 bacteriological grade agar powder grm026 himedia inoculated agar plates were incubated at optimum conditions table 2 colony material was then inoculated in 20 ml tsb tubes and incubated overnight with shaking at 225 rpm one hundred μl from the overnight cultures were inoculated in 100 ml tsb incubated overnight with shaking at 225 rpm and centrifuged 4000 g 5 min eppendorf centrifuge 5920r for the processing water strains the supernatant tsb was discarded and the pellet resuspended in saline peptone solution sps 1 g l peptone 8 5 g l sodium chloride ph 7 2 0 2 by vortexing the same centrifugation resuspension procedure was repeated twice with the final resuspension in sps solution for the s aureus strains pre trials showed that the aggregates were breaking up very easily so a slightly gentler procedure was employed in which centrifugation was conducted only once 1000 g 5 min before resuspension in sps solution and the pellet was resuspended by using a sterile loop instead of vortexing the same procedure was adopted for both s aureus strains broken aggregates of the otherwise aggregating s aureus 8325 4 strain were used for comparative purposes by applying centrifugation 4000 g 5 min three times with subsequent resuspension in sps by vortexing after the final resuspension the od at 600 nm was adjusted and reached an od corresponding to approx 107 8 cfu ml for the industrial strains and 108 9 cfu ml for the s aureus strains the latter was chosen to achieve a high degree of aggregation in the suspension of the aggregating strain ten fold serial dilutions of the inoculum in sps and spread plating on tsa agar were conducted to verify the inoculum level at the beginning of the experimental procedure phase contrast microscope olympus bx40 photos with a 10x objective and an imaging source dmk21f04 ccd camera were also taken to verify the presence absence of the aggregates at the starting point the inoculum was kept in the refrigerator at 4 c during the uv experimental procedure to prevent further growth 2 3 uvc radiation exposure the bacterial inocula were exposed to uvc radiation at 255 nm using the pearllab beamtm supplied by aquisense technologies erlganger ky usa a compact uv led collimated beam device the full width at half maximum bandwidth fwhm of the uv leds was approx 11 nm with a peak at 255 8 nm fig 2 the experimental protocol was structured with the technical support of the uv led manufacturer to calculate the necessary correction factors for the average germicidal fluence rate e a v g mw cm2 the protocols of bolton and linden 2003 for broadband uv lamps and kheyrandish et al 2018 for uv leds were used taking into account the polychromatic nature of the uv leds the incident irradiance e 0 was measured with an ilt2400 radiometer and a sed005 sensor provided by international light technologies peabody ma usa and varied between 0 052 0 056 mw cm2 the petri factor pf was calculated by scanning with an ilt 2400 radiometer and sed005 sensor the polar coordinates around the center point where the petri dish is placed recording the irradiance every 5 mm and dividing it with the center point irradiance to calculate the average of these ratios pf 0 922 the water factor wf was calculated by measuring the depth of the microbial suspension in the petri dish l 10 mm and the absorbance of the microbial suspension a at 255 nm using quartz suprasil cuvettes 100 qs hellma analytics and the uv vis 1800 shimadzu spectrophotometer wfprocessing water strains 0 949 wf s aureus strains 0 332 to account for the difference in irradiance around the narrow bandwidth wavelength emission of the uv leds the sensor factor sf was also included in the equation bolton and linden 2003 the sf is the ratio of the radiant power at the peak wavelength of uv led to its total radiant power the sf was calculated by the uv led manufacturer at 4 471 using the same uv led equipment ilt2400 radiometer and sed005 sensor the reflection factor rf and the divergence factor df were calculated at 0 978 and 0 947 respectively the following equation was used to calculate the average germicidal fluence rate e a v g mw cm2 e a v g e 0 p f w f s f r f d f finally to obtain the uv fluence or uv dose mj cm2 delivered on the surface of the microbial suspension by the uv leds the e a v g mw cm2 was multiplied with the exposure time s for each strain three individual uv exposures were conducted on separate days the inocula were prepared the day of uv exposure from overnight cultures for each dose 20 ml of the inoculum were poured into a petri dish 52 mm and a sterile magnetic stir bar 4 5 12 mm was added the petri dish was then placed on a magnetic stirrer and the speed was set at 200 rpm the pearllab beam stand was placed on top of the petri dish 85 mm distance between uv led and solution surface and the shutter and uv button were turned on and a timer was used to track the time for the desired dose an identical set up with shutter and uv button turned off was used for the corresponding control sample fig 3 the control and the uv treated samples for each uv dose were treated and analyzed in parallel exposure times were randomized for each trial and strain the temperature of the uv irradiated and control samples was measured before and after the end of each exposure and remained stable between 20 22 c after finishing the uv exposure the petri dishes were covered with aluminum foil to avoid photo reactivation 2 4 total viable count to determine the tvc ten fold serial dilutions in sps were conducted for the uv irradiated and control samples respectively right after each uv exposure in technical duplicates then spread plating of the three selected duplicate serial dilutions followed on tsa media 100 μl tsa agar plate limit of detection lod 10 cells ml this procedure generated six technical replicates for each combination control uv irradiated sample uv dose trial and strain when low counts were expected the triple plating method was employed by distributing 1 ml directly from the uv irradiated sample on three tsa agar plates to give a final lod 1 cell ml the inoculated tsa agar plates were incubated at optimum temperature time for each strain and tvc were counted in cfu ml table 2 for the aggregating strains pre trials showed that extra attention was needed to obtain single non merging colonies on the agar media for an accurate tvc determination therefore vortexing during serial dilutions and spread plating was prolonged 2 5 inactivation rate constant k calculation in order to assess the sensitivity of our strains to uv radiation and for reasons of comparison the dose based inactivation rate constant k cm2 mj was calculated for the initial rapid reduction for this purpose the log10 reduction values were plotted against the uv doses in a scatter plot and the equation of the trendline for the linear part of the curve was generated excluding the part where tailing was observed the linear relationship between log inactivation and uv dose is described by the following equation hijnen et al 2006 song et al 2016 log n 0 n k uv dose where n 0 is the average tvc cfu ml of the control sample n is the average tvc cfu ml of the uv irradiated sample k is the inactivation rate constant cm2 mj and uv dose is the corresponding uv dose mj cm2 2 6 phase contrast microscopy and image analysis for each of the strains samples for microscopy were prepared right after each uv exposure in each trial by placing 1 5 µl of the uv irradiated sample and 1 5 µl of the control sample respectively each on a microscope slide cover slips were placed above and the photos were captured using the phase contrast microscope olympus bx40 with a 10x objective and an imaging source dmk21f04 ccd camera four photos were captured using the software ic capture 2 4 from four different positions spread out on the cover slips up left up right down right and down left in order to reduce the bias this procedure was repeated twice for the same sample control or uv irradiated leading to eight photos per sample and when it was completed for the three trials in each strain 24 photos had been generated for each uv dose to compare between control and uv irradiated samples n 24 replicates the image j software was used to analyze the captured photos and count the number and the area of the particles per photo using the following functions the photos were transformed into binary the threshold was adjusted to auto and the function analyze particles was used applying a particle size threshold set at 2 42 μm2 to remove the noise considering that as the area of a single cell based on pre trials the area of each particle was chosen to be shown as outlines 2 7 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test were conducted to assess the differences in microbial log10 reduction cfu ml among the uv doses for each strain and the differences in uv tolerance among the strains n 6 replicates for each dose for the analysis of particle size the size of each individual particle was modelled in a mixed model with uv yes no and dose food processing water strains 25 50 120 180 240 mj cm2 s aureus strains 10 20 40 60 80 120 240 mj cm2 as systematic factors and trial day1 day2 or day3 and photo replicate n 24 replicate photos per sample as random effects variance components were estimated by satterthwaite s approximation this analysis was done in parallel for each bacterial strain r studio software version 4 0 2 2020 06 22 including ggplot2 version 3 3 2 lme4 version 1 1 23 lmertest version 3 1 2 tidyverse version 1 3 0 and broom version 0 7 0 were used for data handling plotting and analysis 3 results 3 1 overall inactivation kinetic patterns r mucilaginosa was the most uv tolerant strain among the five strains tested in this study with an inactivation rate constant k 0 049 cm2 mj while the non aggregating s aureus strain k 0 312 cm2 mj and p brenneri k 0 259 cm2 mj were the least uv tolerant fig 4 table 3 s aureus aggregating strain k 0 135 cm2 mj showed a similar inactivation trend to r ornithinolytica k 0 110 cm2 mj but when the aggregates of s aureus were broken the uv tolerance decreased markedly k 0 277 cm2 mj the tailing phenomenon was observed for all the strains used in this study fig 4 for p brenneri the tailing started from the uv dose of 50 mj cm2 while for r ornithinolytica and r mucilaginosa the tailing started later from the uv dose of 120 mj cm2 similarly for the s aureus strains the tailing for the non aggregating s aureus and the s aureus strain with broken aggregates started from the uv dose of 40 mj cm2 while for the aggregating s aureus the tailing started later from the uv dose of 60 mj cm2 3 2 food processing water strains the differences in average particle size among the different strains isolated from food processing water can be observed in the phase contrast microscope photos of control and uv treated samples fig 5 r mucilaginosa had already formed large aggregates before uv treatment with an average size of approx 111 μm2 i e 19 and 28 times larger than that of r ornithinolytica approx 6 μm2 and p brenneri approx 4 μm2 respectively supplementary data large variation was observed in the inactivation kinetics of the processing water strains with an average reduction of 4 5 log10 units r ornithinolytica 6 5 log10 units p brenneri and 1 6 log10 units r mucilaginosa at the lowest uv dose 25 mj cm2 applied fig 6 a c r mucilaginosa was markedly more uv tolerant than r ornithinolytica and p brenneri for all the doses p 0 01 while p brenneri was the most uv sensitive p 0 01 for r ornithinolytica and r mucilaginosa a further reduction was observed at longer exposure times i e higher doses reaching a 6 0 log10 at the uv dose of 240 mj cm2 and a 3 4 log10 reduction at the uv dose of 120 mj cm2 respectively however this observed dose response reached a tailing point soon after the first uv dose rendering the uv dose response effect insignificant p 0 01 in the violin plots the average particle size log10 area μm2 of the uv irradiated samples was compared with the average particle size of the control samples running in parallel with the uv irradiated samples for each uv dose fig 6d f the arrows in the plots indicate the increase or decrease in average particle size from the control to the uv irradiated sample for each uv dose for r ornithinolytica a significant increase of approx 21 in average particle size was observed in the uv treated compared with the control samples from the first dose of 25 mj cm2 and for all the following doses p 0 0001 fig 6d and supplementary data this relative difference did not increase significantly with longer exposure times p 0 542 for p brenneri the average particle size increased significantly by approx 3 in the uv treated samples compared with the control samples from the first dose applied 25 mj cm2 and for all the following doses p 0 0001 fig 6e and supplementary data there was a trend towards a dose response effect for the following doses p 0 002 however this relative increase was practically insignificant for r mucilaginosa an increase of approx 23 was observed in the uv treated compared with the control samples from 25 mj cm2 and for all the following doses p 0 0001 as also observed in the two former strains this relative difference did not increase significantly with increasing uv doses p 0 511 fig 6f and supplementary data 3 3 s aureus strains as it can be observed in the phase contrast microscope photos of fig 7 s aureus aggregating strain was already organized in aggregates having larger average particle size than the other two strains with extra centrifugation and vortexing the aggregates were broken and the average particle size decreased by 47 from approx 11 to 6 μm2 the non aggregating strain displayed the smallest average particle size of approx 4 μm2 supplementary data for the s aureus strains there was an initial reduction of approx 3 0 log10 units by applying the lowest uv dose 10 mj cm2 fig 8 a c the s aureus aggregating strain was significantly more uv tolerant than the non aggregating strain p 0 0001 for most of the applied uv doses but when the aggregates of s aureus aggregating strain were broken the uv tolerance decreased to a level closer to the non aggregating strain p 0 01 for most of the applied uv doses for the aggregating strain there was a further significant reduction of approx 1 0 and 2 0 additional log10 units by applying 20 and 40 mj cm2 respectively p 0 01 while no significant decrease was observed for the rest of the doses from 60 to 240 mj cm2 p 0 01 the initial population level of s aureus with broken aggregates was further significantly reduced by 2 5 log10 units by increasing the uv dose from 10 to 20 mj cm2 and by 2 0 log10 units more by increasing the uv dose to 80 mj cm2 p 0 01 there was no significant decrease for the rest of the doses p 0 01 for the non aggregating strain there was an additional significant reduction of 3 0 log10 units by increasing the uv exposure from 10 to 20 mj cm2 p 0 01 but no significant decrease for the rest of the doses p 0 01 in the s aureus aggregating strain the average particle size increased with exposure time in both control and uv irradiated samples p 0 0001 but a uv treatment effect was not observed p 0 801 fig 8d when the aggregates of s aureus were broken a decrease was observed in average particle size over time for both the control and the uv irradiated samples p 0 0001 but also here the relative difference between them did not change significantly over uv exposure time p 0 05 fig 7e for the non aggregating strain the average particle size decreased over uv exposure time for both the control and the uv irradiated samples p 0 0001 the decrease seemed to be constantly larger for the uv irradiated samples compared with the control samples p 0 0001 fig 8f 4 discussion in this study uv inactivation kinetics were combined with particle size microscope screening data before and after uv treatment a broad range of doses were applied for five different strains with different aggregation characteristics including two of the same species to gain more knowledge on the phenomenon of uv induced cell aggregation and the impact on the inactivation kinetics the use of parallel treatment of controls and uv treated samples allowed differentiation of uv induced vs time induced effects tailing of the survival curves was observed for all strains in this set up the aggregating strains were more uv tolerant when comparing species but also within species as seen for s aureus the s aureus aggregating strain became markedly more uv sensitive when the aggregates were broken clearly demonstrating the protective effect of cell self aggregation comparison of inactivation rates between studies is difficult due to different set ups but it is nevertheless interesting to note that the highly aggregating r mucilaginosa which had a two dimensional area ten times bigger than that of the aggregating s aureus supplementary data had an inactivation rate constant k in the order of those previously reported for bacillus subtilis b subtilis spores table 3 the s aureus aggregating strain here was more uv tolerant when compared with the s aureus atcc 25923 strain from the study of shoults and ashbolt 2019 they exposed this strain to uv with re exposure of surviving populations up to seven times the non aggregating strain in our study had a k value in between these populations survivors table 3 regarding the particle size analysis method used in this study it captures the two dimensional rather than the three dimensional size of the aggregates and thus it may underestimate the size of the microbial aggregates and the changes observed nevertheless in all the three strains isolated from food processing water uvc induced aggregation was registered regardless of the cell morphology aggregation and gram staining characteristics the increase in average particle size and the main reduction were observed already at the lowest uv dose applied and no further particle size increase was observed with increasing uv doses indicating that any inducing effect had already happened at 25 mj cm2 our findings here thus support that uv treatment induces microbial aggregation blatchley et al 2001 kollu and örmeci 2015 lee et al 2018 it is possible that the induced aggregation is a sign of general cell damage since lee et al 2018 found that the zeta potential as a marker of surface charge decreased with uv dose exposure as also seen in starved and generally stressed cells soni et al 2008 the decrease of zeta potential is a sign of reduced repulsion which could increase the possibility of cells to attach to each other interestingly the s aureus whether aggregating or not differed from the other bacteria in terms of not showing increased adhesion upon uv exposure the use of parallel control samples were important in order to differentiate between time induced and uv induced changes since both the uv treated and non uv treated samples may change particle size during the experiment since the other gram positive r mucilaginosa did increase particle size substantially upon uv exposure other factors besides gram characteristics must play a role lee et al 2018 employing a higher wavelength 275 nm found that the negative electrostatic surface charge decreased more for the gram negative strains of e coli and p aeruginosa than for a gram positive strain of s aureus upon exposure but the zeta size change was largest for s aureus the aggregating characteristics of this strain was not reported several authors have stated that the time dose reciprocity law where the same amount of photons always activates the same amount of molecules is valid for inactivation of bacteria at wavelengths within the uvc radiation bolton and cotton 2008 pousty et al 2021 song et al 2019 2016 in principle this should be independent of the time factor however kollu and örmeci 2015 using e coli as the test organism and lpml 254 nm noticed a higher proportion of larger particles when they decreased the lpml intensity and increased the exposure time to obtain the same dose and lee et al 2018 using a flow based set up reported that longer exposure times decreased the bactericidal effect since it seems clear that aggregation per se has a protective effect as seen in our results with whole and broken s aureus aggregates lower intensities and longer exposure times are therefore likely to reduce the inactivation rate the impact of the intensity exposure time and wavelength range on uv inactivation needs to be clarified more in the future especially if the industry will move from the industrial set ups of the present days with high intensity lpml and large flow through reactors to the lower intensity uv led treatment options the possibility for bacteria to adhere to each other depends on the bacterial levels and the opportunity to attach to each other abshire and dunton 1981 and chatzisymeon 2016 observed in earlier studies that log10 reduction times became longer with higher population levels pointing towards a cell density effect and lee et al 2018 found that if mixing chambers were introduced in flow systems more collision opportunities arouse reducing the uv effect it is therefore likely that some of the phenomena observed with aggregation and general tailing are reinforced by the high initial population levels that are usually used in lab scale uv inactivation studies since cell numbers strongly affect both energy absorption and the number of adherence opportunities the practical implication of cell aggregation whether induced or not and the corresponding decrease in uv treatment efficiency would be that log10 reduction times would vastly overestimate microbial inactivation if based on the initial reduction and applied to high microbial levels according to sommer et al 2008 a uv dose at 253 7 nm of 40 mj cm2 is required for drinking water treatment by known european standards such as the german association for gas and water gvgw and the austrian standards institute önorm this uv dose includes a 4 log10 reduction of most of the relevant viruses such as hepatitis a virus rotavirus poliovirus and calicivirus in our study a uv dose of approx 20 25 mj cm2 at 255 nm generated a 4 log10 reduction for all the strains tested apart from r mucilaginosa which needed an almost nine times higher uv dose 180 mj cm2 to reach the same level of inactivation the potential occurrence of highly resistant species or strains should be recognized and taken into account if they affect the quality of the products or the processes moreover the effect of some types of pre treatments on uv efficacy have to be considered especially within a food processing context where many different process technologies may be applied and high microbial loads may be encountered for example heat treatment can lead to many dead or impaired microbial cells that can facilitate further cell aggregation in a latter uv disinfection step other types of pre treatments e g membrane filtration seem to be necessary to remove the great bulk of suspended solids and microorganisms and increase the uvt another thing to consider is the composition of the food processing water that is supposed to be uv treated since e g ionic strength and acidity affect cell aggregation if microbial loads are low however these factors are most likely of limited importance in some cases extensive recycling may take place either for non food contact purposes or decontamination of brines here it is important to be aware of long term effects such as selection for uv resistant species or development of more resistant strains in the industry over time so continuous follow up on the water quality is needed the fit for purpose concept is risk based and from a food regulatory view the focus is on food safety however from the processor s view issues related to microbial caused spoilage process problems or work health concerns are also important the assessment of water quality is therefore case specific depending on the water source to be reused the potential food safety hazards other quality issues of interest the treatment efficacy distribution and storage monitoring options and the intended use if the intended use allows for direct or indirect contact with the food produced the whole process should be covered by the food safety management program of the company the requirements to the uv treatment therefore depends on many parameters but potential variations in microbial loads and processes should be taken into consideration our results add to a better understanding on how to predict microbial inactivation in different scenarios of uv treatment and some of the parameters involved these parameters may impact planning of suitable challenge trials and the design of efficient food processing water disinfection systems which will help in providing safe fit for purpose water for reuse thereby contributing to water savings and sustainability 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that uv light can induce aggregation during uv treatment of aqueous solutions in both gram positive and negative strains but not in the s aureus strains tested regardless of their aggregation characteristics which indicates species specific reactions a tailing effect was observed for all the strains after the initial population reduction the naturally aggregating species were more tolerant to uv irradiation both between and within species and a strong correlation between aggregation and uv tolerance was observed with the strongest aggregating strain requiring nine times higher uv dose compared with the rest of the strains tested to reach the same log10 reduction funding this work was supported by a phd scholarship for

16645,reconditioning of food processing water streams for reuse is an increasingly common water management practice in the food industry and uv disinfection is often employed as part of the water treatment several factors may impact the effect of uv radiation here we aim to assess the impact of cell aggregation on uv inactivation kinetics and investigate if uv exposure induces aggregation three strains isolated from food processing water reuse lines raoultella ornithinolytica pseudomonas brenneri rothia mucilaginosa and both an aggregating and a non aggregating strain of staphylococcus aureus were exposed to uvc light at 255 nm using uv led equipment total viable count and phase contrast microscopy coupled with image analysis were used to compare the uv inactivation kinetics with the average particle size for a range of uv doses tailing effect seen as a strong reduction in inactivation rate was observed for all strains at higher uv doses industrial strains 50 or 120 mj cm2 s aureus strains 40 or 60 mj cm2 the naturally aggregating strains were more uv tolerant both within and between species when aggregates of s aureus were broken uv tolerance decreased for the processing water isolates the lowest applied uv dose 25 mj cm2 significantly increased the average particle size application of higher uv doses obtained with longer exposure times did not further increase the particle size compared with untreated samples for the s aureus strains however no consistent change in average particle size was observed due to uv our results demonstrate that aggregating strains have a higher degree of protection and that uv radiation induces aggregation in some but not all bacteria a better understanding of the mechanisms governing microbial aggregation and survival during uv treatment could help to improve uv applications and predictions of microbial inactivation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv treatment tailing effect bacterial aggregation water reuse food processing water 1 introduction the food processing industry needs large amounts of water daily for cleaning transport and food processing purposes from the raw materials to the final products and use of potable water quality has commonly been required however due to both cost and sustainability issues many food industries are trying to reduce their water footprint and looking at ways to do so one way is to reuse food processing water after appropriate treatment casani and knøchel 2002 and recently the food and agriculture organization fao together with the world health organization who published a report in which the concept of fit for purpose water for reuse in the food industry was presented using a risk based approach fao and who 2019 while the technology for efficient food processing water reuse is continuously advancing the main challenge is to ensure the quality and safety of the reconditioned water and the final products casani et al 2005 casani and knøchel 2002 ilsi 2013 ultraviolet uv light disinfection is among the treatment technologies that can successfully help to obtain a fit for purpose water quality uv is generally considered a robust water treatment technology with a wide antimicrobial spectrum also being effective against e g chlorine resistant protozoa cryptosporidium sp hijnen et al 2006 who 2017 uv treatment of process water is also attractive to the food industry since at the doses and wavelengths regularly used uv does not lead to formation of problematic disinfection by products dbp koutchma et al 2019 reckhow et al 2010 sommer et al 2005 pirnie et al 2006 who 2017 at high doses and low wavelengths however uv may lead to conversion of e g nitrate to nitrite pirnie et al 2006 uv mercury lamps and especially low pressure mercury lamps lpml are the main uv source used for industrial scale disinfection due to their high wall plug efficiency the ratio of optical power output to electrical power input reaching approx 40 and their monochromatic emission at 254 nm close to the dna absorption peak approx 260 nm koutchma et al 2019 however mercury lamps are fragile bulky surrounded by glass and contain toxic mercury the uv light emitting diode led technology is now rapidly emerging as an environmentally friendlier and easier to use alternative expected to replace mercury lamps in the future uv leds emit radiation at a narrow wavelength bandwidth which can be tailor made do not contain toxic mercury and are light compact and less fragile they offer flexibility in reactor design and the possibility of combining multiple wavelengths koutchma et al 2019 oguma et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 uv led chips manufacturing nevertheless still presents a challenge for short uvc wavelengths having a much lower wall plug efficiency 0 2 5 compared to lpml beck et al 2017 koutchma et al 2019 li et al 2019 but it is expected that the efficiency of uv leds will be increasing and the price decreasing koutchma et al 2019 uv radiation has been applied extensively over the last decades for drinking water and wastewater microbial disinfection either individually or in combination with other treatments such as membrane filtration however there is still limited information on the use of uv technology for disinfection of different types of food processing water streams chatzisymeon 2016 diaz et al 2001 ignat et al 2015 mavrov and bélières 2000 selma et al 2008 if the technology is used as a critical reconditioning step it is important to ensure the safety and the efficiency of the method as well as to be able to reliably predict inactivation of relevant microbiological hazards or nuisance organisms traditionally microbiological inactivation has often been described using log linear kinetics several studies have however observed a tailing effect defined as a phenomenon where the initial inactivation rate decreases with increasing uv doses during uv inactivation of microorganisms in aqueous suspensions using different wavelengths uv sources flow through or static set ups beck et al 2017 blatchley et al 2001 li et al 2017 mamane gravetz and linden 2005 mattle and kohn 2012 nyangaresi et al 2018 oguma et al 2013 shoults and ashbolt 2019 table 1 there are numerous hypotheses on the causes behind the tailing effect among these are the existence of resistant sub populations the ability to repair and be reactivated growth phase dependent tolerance experimental bias or shielding due to equipment design or presence of particles all of which may furthermore be affected by species and strains characteristics a probable explanation which has also been suggested several times is microbial aggregation blatchley et al 2001 hijnen et al 2006 mamane gravetz and linden 2005 mattle and kohn 2012 nyangaresi et al 2018 shoults and ashbolt 2019 microbial aggregates have a three dimensional structure such as seen in biofilms but are conglomerates of cells floating as planktonic cells like in biofilms cells in large aggregates exhibit high antibiotic resistance and tolerance towards chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid and physical stresses alhede et al 2011 blatchley et al 2001 haaber et al 2012 mamane gravetz and linden 2005 mattle et al 2011 planktonic aggregates may reach high cell numbers due to their three dimensional growth providing better access to growth resources kragh et al 2016 the ability to form planktonic aggregates has been demonstrated in several bacteria including pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus s aureus alhede et al 2011 haaber et al 2012 kragh et al 2016 since uv disinfection has no residual action after treatment it would be a concern if surviving microorganisms within aggregates would start growth and biofilm formation during storage of the reconditioned water and thus jeopardize the safety and quality of the food production the hypothesis behind uv induced microbial aggregation suggests that uv radiation can change the cell surface characteristics thereby decreasing the repulsion between the cells and making them attach more readily to each other in the center of these aggregates cells may be shielded by an outer shell of impaired cells and protected from further uv radiation blatchley et al 2001 lee et al 2018 fig 1 however research on uv induced microbial aggregation is limited to a few studies which by employing primarily escherichia coli e coli and different methods such as epifluorescence microscopy observations blatchley et al 2001 particle counter analysis kollu and örmeci 2015 and study of the changes in the electrostatic cell surface charge lee et al 2018 indicate that uv induced bacterial aggregation takes place the latter study by lee et al 2018 included also a s aureus and a p aeruginosa strain in this study our objective is to assess the impact of microbial aggregation on the uv inactivation kinetics and evaluate whether microbial aggregation is uv induced in naturally aggregating and non aggregating bacteria isolated from food industry process water as well as in s aureus isolates with different aggregation characteristics phase contrast microscopy with image analysis is employed to determine the average particle size before and after uv treatment for a range of uv doses and bacterial strains combined with determination of the total viable count tvc 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains a total of five strains were used table 2 three strains from food industries were chosen based on their occurrence in membrane filtered process water potentially destined for different reuse options the first strain was identified by 16s rrna sequencing as raoultella ornithinolytica r ornithinolytica and it was isolated from multi genera biofilms on the permeate side of reverse osmosis ro membranes in a whey water processing line stoica et al 2018 vitzilaiou et al 2019 two more strains were isolated from slaughterhouse side streams treated by multiple filtration steps and uv light lpml 250 mj cm2 in a pilot line for processing water for reuse the first strain was identified as pseudomonas brenneri p brenneri and the second as rothia mucilaginosa r mucilaginosa using the on rep seq sequencing krych et al 2018 the latter represents an example of a strongly self aggregating bacteria to compare uv inactivation kinetics within the same species two culture collection strains belonging to s aureus were also included in the study one strain was naturally aggregating when reaching late exponential phase s aureus 8325 4 wild type strain nctc 8325 cured of phages φ11 φ12 and φ13 haaber et al 2012 novick 1967 while the other was non aggregating s aureus newman clinical isolate atcc 25904 duthie and lorenz 1952 haaber et al 2012 according to haaber et al 2012 the difference in the aggregation level between these two strains derives from the icaadbc operon present in s aureus 8325 4 the expression of which is induced in the exponential growth phase and leads to the production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin pia pia has been found to be a major contributor to the formation of planktonic aggregates in s aureus and this operon has been found in most clinical isolates of s aureus 2 2 inoculum preparation a loopful from frozen culture stocks 80 c was streaked on tryptone soy agar tsa tryptone soy broth tsb cm0129 oxoid supplemented with 1 5 bacteriological grade agar powder grm026 himedia inoculated agar plates were incubated at optimum conditions table 2 colony material was then inoculated in 20 ml tsb tubes and incubated overnight with shaking at 225 rpm one hundred μl from the overnight cultures were inoculated in 100 ml tsb incubated overnight with shaking at 225 rpm and centrifuged 4000 g 5 min eppendorf centrifuge 5920r for the processing water strains the supernatant tsb was discarded and the pellet resuspended in saline peptone solution sps 1 g l peptone 8 5 g l sodium chloride ph 7 2 0 2 by vortexing the same centrifugation resuspension procedure was repeated twice with the final resuspension in sps solution for the s aureus strains pre trials showed that the aggregates were breaking up very easily so a slightly gentler procedure was employed in which centrifugation was conducted only once 1000 g 5 min before resuspension in sps solution and the pellet was resuspended by using a sterile loop instead of vortexing the same procedure was adopted for both s aureus strains broken aggregates of the otherwise aggregating s aureus 8325 4 strain were used for comparative purposes by applying centrifugation 4000 g 5 min three times with subsequent resuspension in sps by vortexing after the final resuspension the od at 600 nm was adjusted and reached an od corresponding to approx 107 8 cfu ml for the industrial strains and 108 9 cfu ml for the s aureus strains the latter was chosen to achieve a high degree of aggregation in the suspension of the aggregating strain ten fold serial dilutions of the inoculum in sps and spread plating on tsa agar were conducted to verify the inoculum level at the beginning of the experimental procedure phase contrast microscope olympus bx40 photos with a 10x objective and an imaging source dmk21f04 ccd camera were also taken to verify the presence absence of the aggregates at the starting point the inoculum was kept in the refrigerator at 4 c during the uv experimental procedure to prevent further growth 2 3 uvc radiation exposure the bacterial inocula were exposed to uvc radiation at 255 nm using the pearllab beamtm supplied by aquisense technologies erlganger ky usa a compact uv led collimated beam device the full width at half maximum bandwidth fwhm of the uv leds was approx 11 nm with a peak at 255 8 nm fig 2 the experimental protocol was structured with the technical support of the uv led manufacturer to calculate the necessary correction factors for the average germicidal fluence rate e a v g mw cm2 the protocols of bolton and linden 2003 for broadband uv lamps and kheyrandish et al 2018 for uv leds were used taking into account the polychromatic nature of the uv leds the incident irradiance e 0 was measured with an ilt2400 radiometer and a sed005 sensor provided by international light technologies peabody ma usa and varied between 0 052 0 056 mw cm2 the petri factor pf was calculated by scanning with an ilt 2400 radiometer and sed005 sensor the polar coordinates around the center point where the petri dish is placed recording the irradiance every 5 mm and dividing it with the center point irradiance to calculate the average of these ratios pf 0 922 the water factor wf was calculated by measuring the depth of the microbial suspension in the petri dish l 10 mm and the absorbance of the microbial suspension a at 255 nm using quartz suprasil cuvettes 100 qs hellma analytics and the uv vis 1800 shimadzu spectrophotometer wfprocessing water strains 0 949 wf s aureus strains 0 332 to account for the difference in irradiance around the narrow bandwidth wavelength emission of the uv leds the sensor factor sf was also included in the equation bolton and linden 2003 the sf is the ratio of the radiant power at the peak wavelength of uv led to its total radiant power the sf was calculated by the uv led manufacturer at 4 471 using the same uv led equipment ilt2400 radiometer and sed005 sensor the reflection factor rf and the divergence factor df were calculated at 0 978 and 0 947 respectively the following equation was used to calculate the average germicidal fluence rate e a v g mw cm2 e a v g e 0 p f w f s f r f d f finally to obtain the uv fluence or uv dose mj cm2 delivered on the surface of the microbial suspension by the uv leds the e a v g mw cm2 was multiplied with the exposure time s for each strain three individual uv exposures were conducted on separate days the inocula were prepared the day of uv exposure from overnight cultures for each dose 20 ml of the inoculum were poured into a petri dish 52 mm and a sterile magnetic stir bar 4 5 12 mm was added the petri dish was then placed on a magnetic stirrer and the speed was set at 200 rpm the pearllab beam stand was placed on top of the petri dish 85 mm distance between uv led and solution surface and the shutter and uv button were turned on and a timer was used to track the time for the desired dose an identical set up with shutter and uv button turned off was used for the corresponding control sample fig 3 the control and the uv treated samples for each uv dose were treated and analyzed in parallel exposure times were randomized for each trial and strain the temperature of the uv irradiated and control samples was measured before and after the end of each exposure and remained stable between 20 22 c after finishing the uv exposure the petri dishes were covered with aluminum foil to avoid photo reactivation 2 4 total viable count to determine the tvc ten fold serial dilutions in sps were conducted for the uv irradiated and control samples respectively right after each uv exposure in technical duplicates then spread plating of the three selected duplicate serial dilutions followed on tsa media 100 μl tsa agar plate limit of detection lod 10 cells ml this procedure generated six technical replicates for each combination control uv irradiated sample uv dose trial and strain when low counts were expected the triple plating method was employed by distributing 1 ml directly from the uv irradiated sample on three tsa agar plates to give a final lod 1 cell ml the inoculated tsa agar plates were incubated at optimum temperature time for each strain and tvc were counted in cfu ml table 2 for the aggregating strains pre trials showed that extra attention was needed to obtain single non merging colonies on the agar media for an accurate tvc determination therefore vortexing during serial dilutions and spread plating was prolonged 2 5 inactivation rate constant k calculation in order to assess the sensitivity of our strains to uv radiation and for reasons of comparison the dose based inactivation rate constant k cm2 mj was calculated for the initial rapid reduction for this purpose the log10 reduction values were plotted against the uv doses in a scatter plot and the equation of the trendline for the linear part of the curve was generated excluding the part where tailing was observed the linear relationship between log inactivation and uv dose is described by the following equation hijnen et al 2006 song et al 2016 log n 0 n k uv dose where n 0 is the average tvc cfu ml of the control sample n is the average tvc cfu ml of the uv irradiated sample k is the inactivation rate constant cm2 mj and uv dose is the corresponding uv dose mj cm2 2 6 phase contrast microscopy and image analysis for each of the strains samples for microscopy were prepared right after each uv exposure in each trial by placing 1 5 µl of the uv irradiated sample and 1 5 µl of the control sample respectively each on a microscope slide cover slips were placed above and the photos were captured using the phase contrast microscope olympus bx40 with a 10x objective and an imaging source dmk21f04 ccd camera four photos were captured using the software ic capture 2 4 from four different positions spread out on the cover slips up left up right down right and down left in order to reduce the bias this procedure was repeated twice for the same sample control or uv irradiated leading to eight photos per sample and when it was completed for the three trials in each strain 24 photos had been generated for each uv dose to compare between control and uv irradiated samples n 24 replicates the image j software was used to analyze the captured photos and count the number and the area of the particles per photo using the following functions the photos were transformed into binary the threshold was adjusted to auto and the function analyze particles was used applying a particle size threshold set at 2 42 μm2 to remove the noise considering that as the area of a single cell based on pre trials the area of each particle was chosen to be shown as outlines 2 7 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test were conducted to assess the differences in microbial log10 reduction cfu ml among the uv doses for each strain and the differences in uv tolerance among the strains n 6 replicates for each dose for the analysis of particle size the size of each individual particle was modelled in a mixed model with uv yes no and dose food processing water strains 25 50 120 180 240 mj cm2 s aureus strains 10 20 40 60 80 120 240 mj cm2 as systematic factors and trial day1 day2 or day3 and photo replicate n 24 replicate photos per sample as random effects variance components were estimated by satterthwaite s approximation this analysis was done in parallel for each bacterial strain r studio software version 4 0 2 2020 06 22 including ggplot2 version 3 3 2 lme4 version 1 1 23 lmertest version 3 1 2 tidyverse version 1 3 0 and broom version 0 7 0 were used for data handling plotting and analysis 3 results 3 1 overall inactivation kinetic patterns r mucilaginosa was the most uv tolerant strain among the five strains tested in this study with an inactivation rate constant k 0 049 cm2 mj while the non aggregating s aureus strain k 0 312 cm2 mj and p brenneri k 0 259 cm2 mj were the least uv tolerant fig 4 table 3 s aureus aggregating strain k 0 135 cm2 mj showed a similar inactivation trend to r ornithinolytica k 0 110 cm2 mj but when the aggregates of s aureus were broken the uv tolerance decreased markedly k 0 277 cm2 mj the tailing phenomenon was observed for all the strains used in this study fig 4 for p brenneri the tailing started from the uv dose of 50 mj cm2 while for r ornithinolytica and r mucilaginosa the tailing started later from the uv dose of 120 mj cm2 similarly for the s aureus strains the tailing for the non aggregating s aureus and the s aureus strain with broken aggregates started from the uv dose of 40 mj cm2 while for the aggregating s aureus the tailing started later from the uv dose of 60 mj cm2 3 2 food processing water strains the differences in average particle size among the different strains isolated from food processing water can be observed in the phase contrast microscope photos of control and uv treated samples fig 5 r mucilaginosa had already formed large aggregates before uv treatment with an average size of approx 111 μm2 i e 19 and 28 times larger than that of r ornithinolytica approx 6 μm2 and p brenneri approx 4 μm2 respectively supplementary data large variation was observed in the inactivation kinetics of the processing water strains with an average reduction of 4 5 log10 units r ornithinolytica 6 5 log10 units p brenneri and 1 6 log10 units r mucilaginosa at the lowest uv dose 25 mj cm2 applied fig 6 a c r mucilaginosa was markedly more uv tolerant than r ornithinolytica and p brenneri for all the doses p 0 01 while p brenneri was the most uv sensitive p 0 01 for r ornithinolytica and r mucilaginosa a further reduction was observed at longer exposure times i e higher doses reaching a 6 0 log10 at the uv dose of 240 mj cm2 and a 3 4 log10 reduction at the uv dose of 120 mj cm2 respectively however this observed dose response reached a tailing point soon after the first uv dose rendering the uv dose response effect insignificant p 0 01 in the violin plots the average particle size log10 area μm2 of the uv irradiated samples was compared with the average particle size of the control samples running in parallel with the uv irradiated samples for each uv dose fig 6d f the arrows in the plots indicate the increase or decrease in average particle size from the control to the uv irradiated sample for each uv dose for r ornithinolytica a significant increase of approx 21 in average particle size was observed in the uv treated compared with the control samples from the first dose of 25 mj cm2 and for all the following doses p 0 0001 fig 6d and supplementary data this relative difference did not increase significantly with longer exposure times p 0 542 for p brenneri the average particle size increased significantly by approx 3 in the uv treated samples compared with the control samples from the first dose applied 25 mj cm2 and for all the following doses p 0 0001 fig 6e and supplementary data there was a trend towards a dose response effect for the following doses p 0 002 however this relative increase was practically insignificant for r mucilaginosa an increase of approx 23 was observed in the uv treated compared with the control samples from 25 mj cm2 and for all the following doses p 0 0001 as also observed in the two former strains this relative difference did not increase significantly with increasing uv doses p 0 511 fig 6f and supplementary data 3 3 s aureus strains as it can be observed in the phase contrast microscope photos of fig 7 s aureus aggregating strain was already organized in aggregates having larger average particle size than the other two strains with extra centrifugation and vortexing the aggregates were broken and the average particle size decreased by 47 from approx 11 to 6 μm2 the non aggregating strain displayed the smallest average particle size of approx 4 μm2 supplementary data for the s aureus strains there was an initial reduction of approx 3 0 log10 units by applying the lowest uv dose 10 mj cm2 fig 8 a c the s aureus aggregating strain was significantly more uv tolerant than the non aggregating strain p 0 0001 for most of the applied uv doses but when the aggregates of s aureus aggregating strain were broken the uv tolerance decreased to a level closer to the non aggregating strain p 0 01 for most of the applied uv doses for the aggregating strain there was a further significant reduction of approx 1 0 and 2 0 additional log10 units by applying 20 and 40 mj cm2 respectively p 0 01 while no significant decrease was observed for the rest of the doses from 60 to 240 mj cm2 p 0 01 the initial population level of s aureus with broken aggregates was further significantly reduced by 2 5 log10 units by increasing the uv dose from 10 to 20 mj cm2 and by 2 0 log10 units more by increasing the uv dose to 80 mj cm2 p 0 01 there was no significant decrease for the rest of the doses p 0 01 for the non aggregating strain there was an additional significant reduction of 3 0 log10 units by increasing the uv exposure from 10 to 20 mj cm2 p 0 01 but no significant decrease for the rest of the doses p 0 01 in the s aureus aggregating strain the average particle size increased with exposure time in both control and uv irradiated samples p 0 0001 but a uv treatment effect was not observed p 0 801 fig 8d when the aggregates of s aureus were broken a decrease was observed in average particle size over time for both the control and the uv irradiated samples p 0 0001 but also here the relative difference between them did not change significantly over uv exposure time p 0 05 fig 7e for the non aggregating strain the average particle size decreased over uv exposure time for both the control and the uv irradiated samples p 0 0001 the decrease seemed to be constantly larger for the uv irradiated samples compared with the control samples p 0 0001 fig 8f 4 discussion in this study uv inactivation kinetics were combined with particle size microscope screening data before and after uv treatment a broad range of doses were applied for five different strains with different aggregation characteristics including two of the same species to gain more knowledge on the phenomenon of uv induced cell aggregation and the impact on the inactivation kinetics the use of parallel treatment of controls and uv treated samples allowed differentiation of uv induced vs time induced effects tailing of the survival curves was observed for all strains in this set up the aggregating strains were more uv tolerant when comparing species but also within species as seen for s aureus the s aureus aggregating strain became markedly more uv sensitive when the aggregates were broken clearly demonstrating the protective effect of cell self aggregation comparison of inactivation rates between studies is difficult due to different set ups but it is nevertheless interesting to note that the highly aggregating r mucilaginosa which had a two dimensional area ten times bigger than that of the aggregating s aureus supplementary data had an inactivation rate constant k in the order of those previously reported for bacillus subtilis b subtilis spores table 3 the s aureus aggregating strain here was more uv tolerant when compared with the s aureus atcc 25923 strain from the study of shoults and ashbolt 2019 they exposed this strain to uv with re exposure of surviving populations up to seven times the non aggregating strain in our study had a k value in between these populations survivors table 3 regarding the particle size analysis method used in this study it captures the two dimensional rather than the three dimensional size of the aggregates and thus it may underestimate the size of the microbial aggregates and the changes observed nevertheless in all the three strains isolated from food processing water uvc induced aggregation was registered regardless of the cell morphology aggregation and gram staining characteristics the increase in average particle size and the main reduction were observed already at the lowest uv dose applied and no further particle size increase was observed with increasing uv doses indicating that any inducing effect had already happened at 25 mj cm2 our findings here thus support that uv treatment induces microbial aggregation blatchley et al 2001 kollu and örmeci 2015 lee et al 2018 it is possible that the induced aggregation is a sign of general cell damage since lee et al 2018 found that the zeta potential as a marker of surface charge decreased with uv dose exposure as also seen in starved and generally stressed cells soni et al 2008 the decrease of zeta potential is a sign of reduced repulsion which could increase the possibility of cells to attach to each other interestingly the s aureus whether aggregating or not differed from the other bacteria in terms of not showing increased adhesion upon uv exposure the use of parallel control samples were important in order to differentiate between time induced and uv induced changes since both the uv treated and non uv treated samples may change particle size during the experiment since the other gram positive r mucilaginosa did increase particle size substantially upon uv exposure other factors besides gram characteristics must play a role lee et al 2018 employing a higher wavelength 275 nm found that the negative electrostatic surface charge decreased more for the gram negative strains of e coli and p aeruginosa than for a gram positive strain of s aureus upon exposure but the zeta size change was largest for s aureus the aggregating characteristics of this strain was not reported several authors have stated that the time dose reciprocity law where the same amount of photons always activates the same amount of molecules is valid for inactivation of bacteria at wavelengths within the uvc radiation bolton and cotton 2008 pousty et al 2021 song et al 2019 2016 in principle this should be independent of the time factor however kollu and örmeci 2015 using e coli as the test organism and lpml 254 nm noticed a higher proportion of larger particles when they decreased the lpml intensity and increased the exposure time to obtain the same dose and lee et al 2018 using a flow based set up reported that longer exposure times decreased the bactericidal effect since it seems clear that aggregation per se has a protective effect as seen in our results with whole and broken s aureus aggregates lower intensities and longer exposure times are therefore likely to reduce the inactivation rate the impact of the intensity exposure time and wavelength range on uv inactivation needs to be clarified more in the future especially if the industry will move from the industrial set ups of the present days with high intensity lpml and large flow through reactors to the lower intensity uv led treatment options the possibility for bacteria to adhere to each other depends on the bacterial levels and the opportunity to attach to each other abshire and dunton 1981 and chatzisymeon 2016 observed in earlier studies that log10 reduction times became longer with higher population levels pointing towards a cell density effect and lee et al 2018 found that if mixing chambers were introduced in flow systems more collision opportunities arouse reducing the uv effect it is therefore likely that some of the phenomena observed with aggregation and general tailing are reinforced by the high initial population levels that are usually used in lab scale uv inactivation studies since cell numbers strongly affect both energy absorption and the number of adherence opportunities the practical implication of cell aggregation whether induced or not and the corresponding decrease in uv treatment efficiency would be that log10 reduction times would vastly overestimate microbial inactivation if based on the initial reduction and applied to high microbial levels according to sommer et al 2008 a uv dose at 253 7 nm of 40 mj cm2 is required for drinking water treatment by known european standards such as the german association for gas and water gvgw and the austrian standards institute önorm this uv dose includes a 4 log10 reduction of most of the relevant viruses such as hepatitis a virus rotavirus poliovirus and calicivirus in our study a uv dose of approx 20 25 mj cm2 at 255 nm generated a 4 log10 reduction for all the strains tested apart from r mucilaginosa which needed an almost nine times higher uv dose 180 mj cm2 to reach the same level of inactivation the potential occurrence of highly resistant species or strains should be recognized and taken into account if they affect the quality of the products or the processes moreover the effect of some types of pre treatments on uv efficacy have to be considered especially within a food processing context where many different process technologies may be applied and high microbial loads may be encountered for example heat treatment can lead to many dead or impaired microbial cells that can facilitate further cell aggregation in a latter uv disinfection step other types of pre treatments e g membrane filtration seem to be necessary to remove the great bulk of suspended solids and microorganisms and increase the uvt another thing to consider is the composition of the food processing water that is supposed to be uv treated since e g ionic strength and acidity affect cell aggregation if microbial loads are low however these factors are most likely of limited importance in some cases extensive recycling may take place either for non food contact purposes or decontamination of brines here it is important to be aware of long term effects such as selection for uv resistant species or development of more resistant strains in the industry over time so continuous follow up on the water quality is needed the fit for purpose concept is risk based and from a food regulatory view the focus is on food safety however from the processor s view issues related to microbial caused spoilage process problems or work health concerns are also important the assessment of water quality is therefore case specific depending on the water source to be reused the potential food safety hazards other quality issues of interest the treatment efficacy distribution and storage monitoring options and the intended use if the intended use allows for direct or indirect contact with the food produced the whole process should be covered by the food safety management program of the company the requirements to the uv treatment therefore depends on many parameters but potential variations in microbial loads and processes should be taken into consideration our results add to a better understanding on how to predict microbial inactivation in different scenarios of uv treatment and some of the parameters involved these parameters may impact planning of suitable challenge trials and the design of efficient food processing water disinfection systems which will help in providing safe fit for purpose water for reuse thereby contributing to water savings and sustainability 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that uv light can induce aggregation during uv treatment of aqueous solutions in both gram positive and negative strains but not in the s aureus strains tested regardless of their aggregation characteristics which indicates species specific reactions a tailing effect was observed for all the strains after the initial population reduction the naturally aggregating species were more tolerant to uv irradiation both between and within species and a strong correlation between aggregation and uv tolerance was observed with the strongest aggregating strain requiring nine times higher uv dose compared with the rest of the strains tested to reach the same log10 reduction funding this work was supported by a phd scholarship for

16646,the conversion of organic wastes wastewater into medium chain fatty acids mcfas such as caproate has attracted much attention while the effects of toxic compounds on the process have rarely been studied the present study investigated the effects of phenol 0 1 5 g l which is a toxicant and present in various organic wastes on the caproate production in the chain elongation ce process with ethanol as electron donor via two stage batch anaerobic fermentation of glucose the results showed phenol 1 g l did not affect short chain fatty acids scfas production while 1 g l phenol increased caproate production by 59 9 in the following ce process the higher selectivity of caproate and higher consumption of ethanol contributed to the higher caproate production at 1 g l phenol it was also shown 1 g l phenol had more positive effect on ce of butyrate than acetate 1 5 g l phenol inhibited both scfas production and ce processes 16s rrna genes analysis showed phenol had slight effect on the microbial communities for scfas production while it obviously changed the dominant microbes in ce process for ce process metagenomic analysis was further conducted and phenol mainly affected fatty acid biosynthesis fab pathway but not reverse β oxidization rbo pathway 1 g l phenol increased the abundances of genes in fab pathway which could be related with the higher caproate production genome reconstruction identified the dominant microbial species in ce process which were changed with different concentrations of phenol most of the dominant species were new microbial species potentially involved in ce the syntrophic cooperation between petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 might play important role in increased caproate production at 1 g l phenol and their adaption to phenol could be due to the presence of genes relating with active efflux system and refolding of proteins graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phenol caproate production chain elongation anaerobic fermentation metagenomic analysis 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad for methane production has been widely used in the treatment of organic wastes wastewater due to the low value of methane researchers have paid more attention to produce valuable and broad spectrum short chain fatty acids scfas agler et al 2011 however the scfas are completely miscible and therefore the separation process is of high cost which limits the application of scfas production in full scale bioreactors wu et al 2020b recently medium chain fatty acids mcfas production e g caproate from organic wastes wastewater has attracted much attention since it could upgrade the miscible scfas to less hydrophilic mcfas by chain elongation ce which extend the chain length of scfas with two carbons by acetyl coa produced through the oxidation of electron donor ed wu et al 2019 mcfas are also broad spectrum products in industry and agriculture and they have stronger hydrophobicity than scfas which can be easily separated from fermentation broth angenent et al 2016 there are already significant achievements in the mcfas production from organic wastes through ce a series of different organics methanol ethanol lactate and glycerol have been used as eds for mcfas production and ethanol has been demonstrated as one of the most suitable eds for mcfas production considering the relatively high mcfas production rates wu et al 2019 strategies to enhance mcfas production have also been proposed by avoiding product inhibition e g extracting mcfas through liquid liquid extraction wasewar and shende 2011 preventing competition reactions e g maintaining h2 partial pressure at least above 0 03 atm to avoid excessive ethanol oxidation grootscholten et al 2014 and adjusting the gas compositions e g providing exogenetic co2 to promote the growth of microbes for enhanced mcfa production roghair et al 2018a in addition various organic wastes wastewater cheese wey wastewater liquor making wastewater lignocellulosic stillage food wastes cellulosic materials etc have been used as feedstocks for mcfas production by one stage or two stage scfa production ce processes and the two stage process was shown to be more suitable considering the toxicity of exogenous ed on hydrolysis and the easier optimization of ce process reddy et al 2018 wu et al 2019 however there might be toxic compounds e g ammonia long chain fatty acids phenolic compounds either contained in organic wastes or formed during their anaerobic degradation chen et al 2014 having inhibition on mcfas production which have rarely been studied phenolic compounds have been recognized as one of the main toxic compounds for methane production and they are present in various organic wastes including sewage sludge palm oil mill effluent pig manure municipal solid waste etc chapleur et al 2016 poirier et al 2016 tomei et al 2021 the pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to increase their biodegradability also results in the production of phenolic compounds monlau et al 2014 the concentrations of phenolic compounds reach up to several grams per liter in different organic wastes leven et al 2012 rosenkranz et al 2013 it has been reported the high concentrations 0 5 g l of phenol significantly decreased both the methane yield and methane production rate during the ad of organic wastes wastewater for methane production poirier et al 2016 the changes of microbial communities were also observed in order to adapt to different concentrations of phenol chapleur et al 2016 na et al 2016 poirier et al 2016 phenol could also be degraded to scfas and methane during anaerobic conversion of organic wastes wastewater if the concentration is not too high mamimin et al 2012 poirier et al 2016 and there have been many studies investigating the degradation of phenol in biogas reactors with phenol as the sole carbon source na et al 2016 rosenkranz et al 2013 yan et al 2018 however the inhibition of phenol on mcfas production and the degradation of phenol in this process have not been studied until now the changes of microbial communities during mcfas production induced by phenol deserve in depth investigation the isolated microbes that could achieve ce mainly belong to the genera clostridium eubacterium megasphaera and rhodospirillum angenent et al 2016 wu et al 2019 clostridium kluyveri is a well known microbe performing ce process with ethanol as the ed angenent et al 2016 however the enrichment of other microbes belonging to the genera leptolinea exilispira and acinetobacter during mcfas production in mixed culture fermentation was also observed indicating the possible existence of new microbes that could achieve ce kucek et al 2016 wu et al 2020a it should be noted that more than 99 of the microbes in the environment could not be isolated in the lab which limits our understanding of the microbes involved in ce process campanaro et al 2018 a genome centric metagenomic approach allows the identification of individual species extracted from the complex community by reconstructing their genomes which would enable the discovery of new species and the exploration of their functions in mcfas production campanaro et al 2018 jing et al 2017a yan et al 2020 furthermore although phenol is known to be toxic to microbes chapleur et al 2016 poirier et al 2016 tomei et al 2021 certain microbes could still survive for examples it has been reported pseudomonas strains could adapt to phenol through the isomerization of cis into trans unsaturated heipieper et al 1994 it is still unknown what kind of microbes could be enriched at different phenol concentrations in ce process and how the different microbes adapt to phenol with the genome information of individual species by the genome centric metagenomic approach it was possible to explore the ways of the microbes to adapt to different concentrations of phenol the present study aimed to investigate the effects of phenol on the production of caproate which is one of the main mcfas and to elucidate the changes of microbial communities induced by phenol more importantly the genome centric metagenomic approach was applied to identify the key microbial species that involved in ce process with different concentrations of phenol in order to provide new insights in caproate production 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate anaerobic granular sludge with ts 30 2 0 7 g l vs 24 2 0 3 g l and ph 7 3 0 1 was obtained from a mesophilic uasb reactor treating cassava stillage the sludge was milled for 5 min to make it homogeneous and then heated to 100 c for 30 min in order to inhibit the activity of methanogens zagrodnik et al 2020 which was then used as inoculum for both scfas and caproate production glucose 99 5 aladdin was used as the model substrate for mcfas production ethanol 99 5 aladdin was used as ed for ce process 2 2 experimental set up the caproate production in the ce process with ethanol as electron donor via two stage anaerobic fermentation of glucose was investigated in the present study reddy et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the effects of phenol on caproate production were studied in batch experiments the experiments were conducted in 118 ml serum bottles with the working volume 75 ml first scfas production from glucose was conducted each bottle contained 5 g l glucose 50 mm phosphate buffer saline ph 6 5 basic medium angelidaki and sanders 2004 and 2 ml inoculum different amounts of phenol were added to the bottles in order to achieve the final concentrations of 0 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g l the ph was adjusted to 6 5 by 2 m naoh and hcl the bottles were flushed with pure n2 for 5 min sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and then incubated in a shaker with the temperature controlled at 37 c after 3 days of fermentation for scfas production the mixture was centrifuged and the liquid was transferred to a new bottle with 2 ml inoculum for ce process to produce caproate ethanol was also added to the bottle with the concentration 150 mm which was calculated based on the mole ratio of ed electron acceptor ea both acetate and butyrate in control bottles with phenol concentration 0 were considered as ea around 3 1 as used in many previous studies spirito et al 2018 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2020b the ph was also adjusted to 6 5 before fermentation the bottles were then flushed sealed and incubated with the same procedure as scfas production all the tests were conducted in triplicates the above experiments were repeated twice in order to accumulate the inocula for both scfas and caproate production and the data in the second experiments were obtained for analysis gas and liquid samples were collected and analyzed periodically the effects of phenol at both 0 and 1 g l on caproate production from either acetate or butyrate were also investigated in order to understand how phenol affected the ce process since it was found phenol at 1 g l promoted caproate production in the above experiments similar procedure was adopted as the caproate production experiments except that only acetate or butyrate was used as ea the concentration of acetate was 2 gcod l and that of butyrate was 2 7 gcod l which were similar as the concentrations after scfas production from glucose at phenol 1 g l the ethanol was also added based on the mole ratio of ed ea 3 1 2 3 high throughput sequencing hts of 16s rrna genes in the end of the scfas and caproate production microbial samples were obtained from all the bottles all the samples were used for dna extraction by qiaamp dna stool mini kit 51504 qiagen and the concentration and purification of the extracted dna were detected by nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa the extracted dna was then used for pcr amplification with the bacterial primers 338f 806r and the pcr products were then used for sequencing detailed information about pcr sequencing and the analysis of the sequences can be found in supporting information 2 4 metagenomic analysis in order to better understand the microbes involved in ce process with different concentrations of phenol metagenomic analysis was further conducted it was found 1 g l phenol promoted caproate production while 1 5 g l phenol inhibited caproate production in ce process therefore the samples obtained from ce experiments with phenol concentrations 0 1 and 1 5 g l were further used for metagenomic analysis to identify the key microbial species involved in ce process and to understand their changes with different phenol concentrations the extracted dna from the above samples was used for metagenomic sequencing metagenome library 2 150 bp was prepared with the illumina nexttera dna xt kit illumina san diego ca usa and then sequenced on illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc usa the raw sequences were submitted to ncbi with the accession number prjna728525 and the link https www ncbi nlm nih gov bioproject prjna728525 the sequences were filtered and trimmed using the trimmomatic software v0 38 and assembled using megahit v1 0 li et al 2016 concoct metabat2 and maxbin2 were used to reconstruct the genome bins gbs and the gbs generated from the above three binning softwares were consolidated into a single bin set using the metawrap pipeline to generate the final gbs and selecting only the medium to high quality by default uritskiy et al 2018 the completeness and contamination of each gb were estimated using checkm v1 0 18 the gbs were annotated using prokka v1 13 7 with the bacterial or archaeal mode according to their taxonomical assignment the e value threshold was set to 10 6 for predicting the functional annotation of proteins the coding sequences cds dataset of the gbs was annotated with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and evolutionary genealogy of genes non supervised orthologous groups eggnog kegg orthologous group ids ko were used for metabolic pathway analysis taxonomic classifications were assigned to the gbs based on protein alignment on ncbi reference genomes and maker proteins multiple sequence alignment using the cat v5 12 and toolkit gbdk tk v1 3 0 2 5 analytical methods the determination of ts vs glucose scfas mcfas ethanol phenol and ph was described in in supporting information both the analysis of variance anova and aldex2 were used to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant quinn et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 two stage caproate production from glucose at different phenol concentrations the changes of scfas and mcfas production in the two stage process are shown in fig s1 and fig 1 and the results are described in supporting information table 1 summarized the final scfas and mcfas concentrations in each stage acetate and butyrate were the two main products for scfas production the concentrations of phenol between 0 1 g l did not affect scfas production while phenol at 1 5 g l significantly inhibited both acetate and butyrate production by 32 and 35 p 0 05 respectively it should be noted that glucose was fully consumed when the concentrations of phenol were between 0 and 1 g l while there was still 45 left with phenol 1 5 g l table s1 which was consistent with the lower scfas production the scfas were further used for mcfas production through ce process for mcfas only caproate was detected for all the experiments acetate was fully consumed in 8 days in all the experiments which was accompanied by the consumption of ethanol and production of butyrate and caproate after 8 days fermentation caproate was still produced which was consistent with the consumption of ethanol it should be noted that more ethanol 6 5 gcod l was left at 1 5 g l phenol at the end of the fermentation and it was much higher than that 3 gcod l in the other conditions the results indicated phenol at 1 5 g l seriously inhibited the consumption of ethanol and further resulted in the lower production of caproate both 0 5 g l and 1 g l phenol significantly promoted caproate production by 37 8 and 59 9 p 0 05 respectively while 1 5 g l phenol significantly inhibited caproate production by 23 8 p 0 05 the above results show phenol at a certain level promoted caproate production however for the organic wastes wastewater containing higher phenol e g 1 5g l it has to be diluted before fermentation to decrease the negative effects of phenol on mcfas production the selectivity was also calculated based on the electron equivalents of products dividing by the consumed electrons from participant substrates which estimates the fraction of substrates converted into mcfas grootscholten et al 2014 fig s2 it was obvious the selectivity 70 at 1 g l phenol was much higher than the other conditions indicating more of the consumed electrons from participant substrates went to caproate the reported mcfas selectivities with ethanol as ed were between 30 85 for various organic wastes grootscholten et al 2013 roghair et al 2018b wu et al 2019 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b although it was difficult to make comparison among different studies considering the differences in substrates ed ea ratios inoculum etc the value of 80 obtained in the present study was in a high level in addition it should be noted that 1 g l phenol also promoted the consumption of ethanol although 0 5 g l phenol resulted in the similar consumption of ethanol as compared to 1 g l phenol the produced caproate was lower than that at 1 g l phenol which could be due to that the consumed ethanol was used to produce more butyrate leading to the lower selectivity overall both the higher selectivity and higher consumption of ethanol contributed to the higher caproate production at 1 g l phenol the degradation of phenol was also monitored in the two stage caproate production process fig s3 and phenol higher than 0 5 g l was not degraded the decrease of ph fig s1 and fig 1 and production of h2 in both scfas production and ce processes were observed as seen in table s1 which was a known phenomenon zagrodnik et al 2020 the ph between 5 and 7 has been widely used in previous studies wu et al 2019 and the acidic ph 5 5 was beneficial for the inhibition of methanogens while the neutral ph 7 could make the produced mcfas in dissociated forms to decrease the toxicity the initial ph of all the experiments in the present study were adjusted to 6 5 and the final ph were all above 6 0 which was mild acidic it not only reduced the activity of methanogens but also made part of the mcfas in the dissociated forms which were suitable for mcfas production cod mass balances for both scfas production process and ce process were calculated as seen in fig s4 the major metabolites were detected for both processes and the unbalanced cod in both processes were below 10 which could be attributed to microbial growth moscoviz and jimenez 2021 since the scfas produced from glucose contained both acetate and butyrate it is difficult to distinguish the role of phenol on the ce of acetate and butyrate therefore acetate and butyrate were used as ea individually to better understand the role of phenol on ce process fig s5 1 g l phenol significantly promoted caproate production from both acetate by 37 p 0 05 and butyrate by 66 p 0 05 and it also significantly increased the selectivities from 45 4 to 60 1 p 0 05 for acetate and 48 8 to 81 p 0 05 for butyrate fig s6 the above results showed phenol had more positive effects on the ce of butyrate it means for the organic wastes wastewater containing appropriate phenol the selective conversion of organic wastes wastewater to butyrate was crucial in the scfas production process in order to get higher caproate production in ce process it is possible to achieve selective butyrate production from organic wastes wastewater by adjusting fermentation temperature and ph which has been extensively studied previously agler et al 2011 lee et al 2014 3 2 microbial community analysis as revealed by hts of 16s rrna genes the microbial communities in both scfas production and ce processes were analyzed to better understand the effects of phenol on the two stage caproate production process the α and β diversities of the samples were described in supporting information fig s7 fig s8 and fig 2 pca analysis fig 2 showed phenol had more profound effects on the microbial community structures in ce process while the microbial community structures of scfas production were less affected the phylum level classification of all the samples is shown in fig 3 the samples for scfas production were dominant by firmicutes chloroflexi bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria which were also commonly found in scfas production in previous studies wan et al 2016 yang and wang 2019 the samples for ce process were dominant only by three phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes and synergistetes currently only firmicutes and proteobacteria are the known phyla that contain bacteria producing mcfas han et al 2019 wu et al 2019 table s2 however the abundance of firmicutes in sample m1 was significantly lower than that in samples m0 m0 25 and m0 5 p 0 05 indicating the presence of ce related bacteria in other phyla considering the highest caproate production in sample m1 genus level classification was further conducted as seen in fig 4 and table s3 for scfas production clostridium sensu stricto was dominant in all the samples the relative abundance between 28 and 38 and it has been reported to be involved in acidification of glucose lu et al 2020 the dominance of clostridium sensu stricto was not affected by phenol indicating its robust role in scfas production from glucose the relative abundances of other minor genera were changed with phenol for instance the relative abundances of clostridium xviii were increased gradually from 0 to 8 24 with the increase of phenol from 0 to 1 5 g l while the relative abundances of desulfovirga were decreased gradually from 7 32 to 1 88 which could contribute to the gradient from low to high phenol concentrations of the samples for scfas production in fig 2 it should be noted clostridium sensu stricto was also probably involved in mcfas production wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a clostridium sensu stricto was present in all the samples for mcfas production samples m0 m0 25 m0 5 m1 and m1 5 and the abundances of clostridium sensu stricto were between 6 9 however some genera with higher relative abundances than clostridium sensu stricto were obviously changed with the presence of phenol for instance lysinibacillus was dominant in samples m 0 m 0 25 and m 0 5 while it was significantly inhibited at higher phenol levels 1 and 1 5 g l p 0 05 lysinibacillus has been reported to accelerate the iron cycle and electron transfer to methanogens and participate in protein fermentation and its role in ce process has not been reported guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 considering its high abundance in the above mentioned samples it is potentially involved in ce process which deserved further investigation phenol induced the enrichment of aminobacterium bacillus petrimonas sporanaerobacter tepidanaerobacter and tepidimicrobium and some of the genera had higher relative abundances than clostridium sensu stricto i e aminobacterium petrimonas sporanaerobacter at both phenol 1 and 1 5 g l however all the above listed genera were not reported to be involved in ce process which indicated there might be more microbes that could achieve ce which remains to be discovered overall the above results showed phenol did not affect the dominant bacteria involved in scfas production while it significantly changed the dominant bacteria in ce process and the role of such bacteria needs to be further elucidated the changes of dominant bacteria could be directly related with the different caproate production at different phenol concentrations 3 3 metagenomic analysis 3 3 1 the relative abundances of genes involved in ce process the reverse β oxidization rbo pathway and fatty acid biosynthesis fab pathway are the two pathways for mcfas production and ethanol needs to be converted to acetyl coa first and then goes to either rbo or fab pathway for mcfas production fig s9 han et al 2018 wu et al 2020a the functional genes in each sample were annotated against kegg database in order to identify the coverage values of genes in caproate production in the whole metagenomes table 2 the results showed the coverage values of genes involved in rbo pathway were less affected by phenol while the coverage values of all the genes involved in fab pathway were affected by phenol statistical analysis for the comparison of compositional data was also conducted based on aldex2 and it was shown phenol mainly affected certain genes involved in fab pathway table s4 but not in rbo pathway for example the abundances of some genes fabd fabf and fabz involved in fab pathway were significantly increased in m1 as compared to m0 which might be related with the higher caproate production in m1 for m1 5 the abundances of some genes acaca fabf fabz and fabv involved in fab pathway were significantly decreased as compared to m0 and m1 which might be related with the lower caproate production in m1 5 although previous studies mainly focused on rbo pathway since it was considered to be more efficient than fab pathway the present study indicated fab pathway was more actively involved in mcfas production dellomonaco et al 2011 han et al 2018 a previous study also showed fab pathway was likely more active than rbo pathway during the ce of alkaline fermentation liquor of waste activated sludge wu et al 2020a it means more attention should be paid to fab pathway for future studies overall the above results demonstrated phenol affected the abundances of genes in fab pathway which might further result in the different caproate production at different phenol levels since metagenomic analysis was only based on dna which might include dead microbes and also could not identify the active pathways metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analysis are recommended be used in the future studies to verify the important role of fab pathway in ce process for caproate production since they reflected the active microbes and pathways in the microbial processes jing et al 2017b shi et al 2021 3 3 2 genome reconstruction and metabolic potentials in total 129 gbs were obtained 95 of which had high quality with completeness 70 and contamination 5 table s5 most of the gbs 60 could not be assigned to species level which were not previously characterized and might be related with new microbial species involved in ce process table s6 the functional genes of gbs with high quality were annotated against kegg database in order to identify the potential gbs those had the ability to perform ce table s7 table s8 shows the bins with complete gene sets of rbo and or fab pathways which were the most probable microbes involved in ce process in total 12 gbs contained complete gene sets in acetyl coa production together with fab pathway and or rbo pathway and they were most probably involved in ce process table 2 only one of them clostridium kluyveri fdu088 was known to be involved in ce process angenent et al 2016 and the rest gbs might be new species since they were not previously reported for mcfas production it should be noted that clostridium kluyveri fdu088 did not contain complete gene sets of rbo which could be due to the incompleteness of genome 70 22 currently the known microbes involved in ce process belong to the phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria table s2 while it seems the microbes involved in ce process might be more diverse since the listed gbs in table s8 also belong to other phyla including actinobacteria bacteroidetes and spirochaetes indicating the current understanding of ce related microbes is still limited the most abundant bacteria in m0 was lysinibacillus sphaericus fdu054 with the coverage value 6 24 while its coverage value was significantly decreased to 0 13 and 0 in m1 and m1 5 p 0 05 which means phenol inhibited its growth the result was consistent with 16s rrna genes analysis and the genus lysinibacillus was dominant in m0 and obviously inhibited by phenol as previously mentioned lysinibacillus has been reported to accelerate the iron cycle and electron transfer to methanogens and participate in protein fermentation and the present study further showed lysinibacillus sphaericus also had the ability to achieve ce bacillus badius fdu029 and proteiniclasticum sp fdu103 were less abundant microbes for caproate production in m0 as compared to lysinibacillus sphaericus fdu054 and their coverage values were also obviously decreased in m1 and m1 5 as compared to m0 p 0 05 indicating they were also sensitive to phenol the rest gbs listed in table s8 except bacteroidetes sp fdu127 and clostridium kluyveri fdu088 were enriched in m1 which might contribute to the higher caproate production however their abundances were all decreased at 1 5 g l phenol which were consistent with the lower caproate production at 1 5 g l phenol although clostridium kluyveri fdu088 has been reported to play important roles in mcfas production its coverage value was not high in the present study it should be noted clostridium kluyveri fdu088 could tolerant 1 g l phenol and it was inhibited with the increase of phenol to 1 5 g l the above mentioned gbs had the ability to perform ce independently since they had the complete gene sets however previous studies also indicated syntrophic cooperation between different microbes to achieve ce was also possible for example the direct electron transfer diet between ethanol oxidizing microbes and ce microbes through biochar or directly biological contact were proposed for mcfas production although there were no evidences liu et al 2017 wu et al 2021b therefore the gbs either with completed genes in fab rbo pathway or acetyl coa production were also analyzed as shown in table s8 it should be noted although the inoculum was heat pretreated to inhibit methanogens and no methane production were detected two gbs belonging to methanogens with high coverage values 0 05 16 1 for methanofollis sp fdu007 and 4 37 5 33 for methanobacterium sp fdu009 were still found which was not observed in 16s rrna genes analysis it was due to that bacterial primers for hts of 16s rrna genes analysis were used in the present study previous studies also mainly focused on the analysis of bacteria in mcfa production spirito et al 2018 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2020b in fact a previous study also found the presence of methanogens in mcfa production even 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium salt was added to inhibit methanogens liu et al 2017 taken together it was possible that methanogens also played roles in ce process it was found both methanofollis sp fdu007 and methanobacteriota sp fdu009 contained alcohol dehydrogenase it was consistent with a previous study that reported methanofollis ethanolicus could achieve ethanol oxidation to produce methane and acetate imachi et al 2009 without methane production in the present study the electrons during ethanol oxidation should be transferred to other species those could achieve ce through fab or rbo pathways the coverage values of methanofollis sp fdu007 was affected by phenol and it was higher in m1 16 1 which was also higher than that of most of other gbs in addition the coverage values of methanobacteriota sp fdu009 were not obviously affected by phenol p 0 05 for m0 m1 and m0 m1 5 the above results indicated methanofollis sp fdu007 played an important role in enhancing caproate production at 1 g l phenol petrimonas mucosa fdu058 was obviously enriched in sample m1 and the coverage value was 16 95 which was only 4 49 in m0 the enrichment of petrimonas mucosa fdu058 in sample m1 was also found by hts of 16s rrna genes analysis indicating this gb can adapt to high concentrations of phenol petrimonas mucosa fdu058 contained complete genes in fab pathway and aldehyde dehydrogenase but lacks alcohol dehydrogenase although it was possible petrimonas mucosa fdu058 might contain alcohol dehydrogenase due to the incompleteness of the genome it had high possibility to cooperate with methanofollis sp fdu007 for ce considering their consistent high abundances 16 95 for petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and 16 1 for methanofollis sp fdu007 in samples m1 methanofollis sp fdu007 could oxidize ethanol and petrimonas mucosa fdu058 could perform fab and therefore they could cooperate to produce caproate petrimonas species were known as mesophilic fermentative microbes capable of converting complex organics into acetate hydrogen and carbon dioxide grabowski et al 2005 hahnke et al 2016 and a previous study also speculated petrimonas had the ability to achieve extracellular electron transfer with methanothrix species for methane production through diet zhao and zhang 2019 pila k02650 is related with e pili and crucial for extracellular electron transfer and c type membrane cytochrome ccda k06196 is also necessary for extracellular electron transfer shrestha et al 2013 summers et al 2010 both the genes for pila and ccda were found in petrimonas mucosa fdu058 table s7 the gene for ccda was also found in methanofollis sp fdu007 table s7 the above results indicated petrimonas mucosa fdu058 might be involved in caproate production together with methanofollis sp fdu007 through diet by direct contact via e pili 3 3 3 mechanisms involved in phenol resistance the mechanisms involved in phenol resistance of certain microbes were further explored petrimonas mucosa fdu058 was the most abundant microbe at phenol 1 g l and 1 5 g l it was found petrimonas mucosa fdu058 contained genes in abc type transport system involved in resistance to organic solvents mlae k02066 genes relating with outer membrane efflux protein e g tolc k12340 and genes relating with peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase slyd k03775 table s9 the outer membrane efflux protein could export toxic compounds from the cells and the reduction of toxic compounds concentration in the cells by the induction of their active export through efflux pump is an important mechanism of adaption to solvents the first two genes were involved in the active efflux system santos et al 2004 peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase has specific role in stress tolerance mechanisms subin et al 2016 the process of aggregation of protein is minimized by molecular chaperons under stress condition while peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase accelerates the slow rate limiting isomerisation step in refolding of proteins the genes involved in protein folding are important for the microbes to adapt to phenol inhibition which has been proven previously santos et al 2007 the above genes were not present in lysinibacillus sphaericus fdu054 bacillus badius fdu029 and proteiniclasticum sp fdu103 which were abundant in sample m0 but significantly inhibited in sample m1 it seems petrimonas mucosa fdu058 adapted to phenol resistance through a combination of different mechanisms the gbs e g syntrophorhabdus sp fdu104 spiro sp fdu102 massilibacterium sp fdu015 and methanofollis sp fdu007 obviously enriched with the addition of phenol also contained some of the above mentioned genes however both spiro sp fdu102 and massilibacterium sp fdu015 were only enriched in sample m1 and inhibited in sample m1 5 and it indicated even the microbes contained genes involved in phenol resistance they had different tolerance to phenol inhibition it should be noted that the mechanism of phenol resistance is complex and previous studies also showed microbes could adapt to phenol by increasing the degree of saturation of membrane lipids which could not be elucidated by metagenomic analysis since most of the gbs in table s8 contained fab pathway and the effects of phenol on the expression of the genes e g faba fabb relating with saturated and unsaturated lipid could not be determined heath and rock 1996 heipieper et al 1994 the combination of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis should be conducted in future studies to better reveal the adaption mechanisms of different microbes to phenol inhibition in mixed cultures 3 3 4 syntrophic cooperation of microbes for caproate production although it has been proposed ce might be achieved by syntrophic cooperation of different microbes liu et al 2017 wu et al 2021b the present study for the first time showed petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 were potentially involved in caproate production through diet by metagenomic analysis petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 were enriched in m1 coverage values 16 while they were also detected in the m0 with lower coverage values 7 table s8 it suggests the syntrophic association for caproate production through diet was present in both m0 and m1 while the syntrophic association was favored at 1 g l phenol with increased relative abundances and improved caproate production the enrichment of these two microbes could be due to their higher tolerance to phenol since they had the genes relating with active efflux system and refolding of proteins for m1 5 petrimonas mucosa fdu058 still had high coverage value 13 98 while the coverage value of methanofollis sp fdu007 was decreased to 0 05 table s8 in this case petrimonas mucosa fdu058 might achieve ce together with other abundant ethanol oxidizing microbes methanobacteriota sp fdu009 methanomassiliicoccus sp fdu061 and syntrophorhabdus sp fdu104 those were more tolerant to phenol the above results indicated syntrophic cooperation might be more efficient for ce considering the high caproate production and enrichment of methanofollis sp fdu007 and petrimonas mucosa fdu058 in m1 1 5 g l phenol might change the syntrophic cooperated species the present study was conducted in batch experiments and continuous experiments should be tested in the future to understand whether phenol at 1 g l could still promote caproate production in order to promote the application of the process in addition the microbial communities in continuous experiments might be changed due to the different environmental conditions and the importance of syntrophic cooperation of microbes for caproate production especially at higher phenol conditions should be further explored and verified 4 conclusions the present study showed that phenol had more profound effects on ce process than scfas production process although 1 5 g l phenol inhibited both process 1 g l phenol increased caproate production by 59 9 in the ce process with ethanol as electron donor via two stage anaerobic fermentation of glucose and in this case ce of butyrate was better promoted than ce of acetate hts of 16s rrna genes analysis showed the bacterial communities of scfas production were slightly affected by phenol while the bacterial communities of ce process were significantly affected and different dominant microbes were observed at different concentrations of phenol 1 g l phenol increased the abundances of genes in fab pathway as revealed by metagenomic analysis and it might be related with the increased caproate production genome reconstruction identified the dominant microbial species involved in ce process at different phenol concentrations most of which were not reported to be involved in ce process previously 1 g l phenol resulted in the obvious enrichment of petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 which might achieve syntrophic cooperation in ce process and they could adapt to 1 g l phenol since they had the genes relating with active efflux system and refolding of proteins supporting information supporting information includes fig s1 s9 table s1 s9 hts of 16s rrna genes and analysis calculation of scfas and mcfas calculation of

16646,the conversion of organic wastes wastewater into medium chain fatty acids mcfas such as caproate has attracted much attention while the effects of toxic compounds on the process have rarely been studied the present study investigated the effects of phenol 0 1 5 g l which is a toxicant and present in various organic wastes on the caproate production in the chain elongation ce process with ethanol as electron donor via two stage batch anaerobic fermentation of glucose the results showed phenol 1 g l did not affect short chain fatty acids scfas production while 1 g l phenol increased caproate production by 59 9 in the following ce process the higher selectivity of caproate and higher consumption of ethanol contributed to the higher caproate production at 1 g l phenol it was also shown 1 g l phenol had more positive effect on ce of butyrate than acetate 1 5 g l phenol inhibited both scfas production and ce processes 16s rrna genes analysis showed phenol had slight effect on the microbial communities for scfas production while it obviously changed the dominant microbes in ce process for ce process metagenomic analysis was further conducted and phenol mainly affected fatty acid biosynthesis fab pathway but not reverse β oxidization rbo pathway 1 g l phenol increased the abundances of genes in fab pathway which could be related with the higher caproate production genome reconstruction identified the dominant microbial species in ce process which were changed with different concentrations of phenol most of the dominant species were new microbial species potentially involved in ce the syntrophic cooperation between petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 might play important role in increased caproate production at 1 g l phenol and their adaption to phenol could be due to the presence of genes relating with active efflux system and refolding of proteins graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phenol caproate production chain elongation anaerobic fermentation metagenomic analysis 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad for methane production has been widely used in the treatment of organic wastes wastewater due to the low value of methane researchers have paid more attention to produce valuable and broad spectrum short chain fatty acids scfas agler et al 2011 however the scfas are completely miscible and therefore the separation process is of high cost which limits the application of scfas production in full scale bioreactors wu et al 2020b recently medium chain fatty acids mcfas production e g caproate from organic wastes wastewater has attracted much attention since it could upgrade the miscible scfas to less hydrophilic mcfas by chain elongation ce which extend the chain length of scfas with two carbons by acetyl coa produced through the oxidation of electron donor ed wu et al 2019 mcfas are also broad spectrum products in industry and agriculture and they have stronger hydrophobicity than scfas which can be easily separated from fermentation broth angenent et al 2016 there are already significant achievements in the mcfas production from organic wastes through ce a series of different organics methanol ethanol lactate and glycerol have been used as eds for mcfas production and ethanol has been demonstrated as one of the most suitable eds for mcfas production considering the relatively high mcfas production rates wu et al 2019 strategies to enhance mcfas production have also been proposed by avoiding product inhibition e g extracting mcfas through liquid liquid extraction wasewar and shende 2011 preventing competition reactions e g maintaining h2 partial pressure at least above 0 03 atm to avoid excessive ethanol oxidation grootscholten et al 2014 and adjusting the gas compositions e g providing exogenetic co2 to promote the growth of microbes for enhanced mcfa production roghair et al 2018a in addition various organic wastes wastewater cheese wey wastewater liquor making wastewater lignocellulosic stillage food wastes cellulosic materials etc have been used as feedstocks for mcfas production by one stage or two stage scfa production ce processes and the two stage process was shown to be more suitable considering the toxicity of exogenous ed on hydrolysis and the easier optimization of ce process reddy et al 2018 wu et al 2019 however there might be toxic compounds e g ammonia long chain fatty acids phenolic compounds either contained in organic wastes or formed during their anaerobic degradation chen et al 2014 having inhibition on mcfas production which have rarely been studied phenolic compounds have been recognized as one of the main toxic compounds for methane production and they are present in various organic wastes including sewage sludge palm oil mill effluent pig manure municipal solid waste etc chapleur et al 2016 poirier et al 2016 tomei et al 2021 the pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to increase their biodegradability also results in the production of phenolic compounds monlau et al 2014 the concentrations of phenolic compounds reach up to several grams per liter in different organic wastes leven et al 2012 rosenkranz et al 2013 it has been reported the high concentrations 0 5 g l of phenol significantly decreased both the methane yield and methane production rate during the ad of organic wastes wastewater for methane production poirier et al 2016 the changes of microbial communities were also observed in order to adapt to different concentrations of phenol chapleur et al 2016 na et al 2016 poirier et al 2016 phenol could also be degraded to scfas and methane during anaerobic conversion of organic wastes wastewater if the concentration is not too high mamimin et al 2012 poirier et al 2016 and there have been many studies investigating the degradation of phenol in biogas reactors with phenol as the sole carbon source na et al 2016 rosenkranz et al 2013 yan et al 2018 however the inhibition of phenol on mcfas production and the degradation of phenol in this process have not been studied until now the changes of microbial communities during mcfas production induced by phenol deserve in depth investigation the isolated microbes that could achieve ce mainly belong to the genera clostridium eubacterium megasphaera and rhodospirillum angenent et al 2016 wu et al 2019 clostridium kluyveri is a well known microbe performing ce process with ethanol as the ed angenent et al 2016 however the enrichment of other microbes belonging to the genera leptolinea exilispira and acinetobacter during mcfas production in mixed culture fermentation was also observed indicating the possible existence of new microbes that could achieve ce kucek et al 2016 wu et al 2020a it should be noted that more than 99 of the microbes in the environment could not be isolated in the lab which limits our understanding of the microbes involved in ce process campanaro et al 2018 a genome centric metagenomic approach allows the identification of individual species extracted from the complex community by reconstructing their genomes which would enable the discovery of new species and the exploration of their functions in mcfas production campanaro et al 2018 jing et al 2017a yan et al 2020 furthermore although phenol is known to be toxic to microbes chapleur et al 2016 poirier et al 2016 tomei et al 2021 certain microbes could still survive for examples it has been reported pseudomonas strains could adapt to phenol through the isomerization of cis into trans unsaturated heipieper et al 1994 it is still unknown what kind of microbes could be enriched at different phenol concentrations in ce process and how the different microbes adapt to phenol with the genome information of individual species by the genome centric metagenomic approach it was possible to explore the ways of the microbes to adapt to different concentrations of phenol the present study aimed to investigate the effects of phenol on the production of caproate which is one of the main mcfas and to elucidate the changes of microbial communities induced by phenol more importantly the genome centric metagenomic approach was applied to identify the key microbial species that involved in ce process with different concentrations of phenol in order to provide new insights in caproate production 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate anaerobic granular sludge with ts 30 2 0 7 g l vs 24 2 0 3 g l and ph 7 3 0 1 was obtained from a mesophilic uasb reactor treating cassava stillage the sludge was milled for 5 min to make it homogeneous and then heated to 100 c for 30 min in order to inhibit the activity of methanogens zagrodnik et al 2020 which was then used as inoculum for both scfas and caproate production glucose 99 5 aladdin was used as the model substrate for mcfas production ethanol 99 5 aladdin was used as ed for ce process 2 2 experimental set up the caproate production in the ce process with ethanol as electron donor via two stage anaerobic fermentation of glucose was investigated in the present study reddy et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the effects of phenol on caproate production were studied in batch experiments the experiments were conducted in 118 ml serum bottles with the working volume 75 ml first scfas production from glucose was conducted each bottle contained 5 g l glucose 50 mm phosphate buffer saline ph 6 5 basic medium angelidaki and sanders 2004 and 2 ml inoculum different amounts of phenol were added to the bottles in order to achieve the final concentrations of 0 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g l the ph was adjusted to 6 5 by 2 m naoh and hcl the bottles were flushed with pure n2 for 5 min sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and then incubated in a shaker with the temperature controlled at 37 c after 3 days of fermentation for scfas production the mixture was centrifuged and the liquid was transferred to a new bottle with 2 ml inoculum for ce process to produce caproate ethanol was also added to the bottle with the concentration 150 mm which was calculated based on the mole ratio of ed electron acceptor ea both acetate and butyrate in control bottles with phenol concentration 0 were considered as ea around 3 1 as used in many previous studies spirito et al 2018 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2020b the ph was also adjusted to 6 5 before fermentation the bottles were then flushed sealed and incubated with the same procedure as scfas production all the tests were conducted in triplicates the above experiments were repeated twice in order to accumulate the inocula for both scfas and caproate production and the data in the second experiments were obtained for analysis gas and liquid samples were collected and analyzed periodically the effects of phenol at both 0 and 1 g l on caproate production from either acetate or butyrate were also investigated in order to understand how phenol affected the ce process since it was found phenol at 1 g l promoted caproate production in the above experiments similar procedure was adopted as the caproate production experiments except that only acetate or butyrate was used as ea the concentration of acetate was 2 gcod l and that of butyrate was 2 7 gcod l which were similar as the concentrations after scfas production from glucose at phenol 1 g l the ethanol was also added based on the mole ratio of ed ea 3 1 2 3 high throughput sequencing hts of 16s rrna genes in the end of the scfas and caproate production microbial samples were obtained from all the bottles all the samples were used for dna extraction by qiaamp dna stool mini kit 51504 qiagen and the concentration and purification of the extracted dna were detected by nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa the extracted dna was then used for pcr amplification with the bacterial primers 338f 806r and the pcr products were then used for sequencing detailed information about pcr sequencing and the analysis of the sequences can be found in supporting information 2 4 metagenomic analysis in order to better understand the microbes involved in ce process with different concentrations of phenol metagenomic analysis was further conducted it was found 1 g l phenol promoted caproate production while 1 5 g l phenol inhibited caproate production in ce process therefore the samples obtained from ce experiments with phenol concentrations 0 1 and 1 5 g l were further used for metagenomic analysis to identify the key microbial species involved in ce process and to understand their changes with different phenol concentrations the extracted dna from the above samples was used for metagenomic sequencing metagenome library 2 150 bp was prepared with the illumina nexttera dna xt kit illumina san diego ca usa and then sequenced on illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc usa the raw sequences were submitted to ncbi with the accession number prjna728525 and the link https www ncbi nlm nih gov bioproject prjna728525 the sequences were filtered and trimmed using the trimmomatic software v0 38 and assembled using megahit v1 0 li et al 2016 concoct metabat2 and maxbin2 were used to reconstruct the genome bins gbs and the gbs generated from the above three binning softwares were consolidated into a single bin set using the metawrap pipeline to generate the final gbs and selecting only the medium to high quality by default uritskiy et al 2018 the completeness and contamination of each gb were estimated using checkm v1 0 18 the gbs were annotated using prokka v1 13 7 with the bacterial or archaeal mode according to their taxonomical assignment the e value threshold was set to 10 6 for predicting the functional annotation of proteins the coding sequences cds dataset of the gbs was annotated with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and evolutionary genealogy of genes non supervised orthologous groups eggnog kegg orthologous group ids ko were used for metabolic pathway analysis taxonomic classifications were assigned to the gbs based on protein alignment on ncbi reference genomes and maker proteins multiple sequence alignment using the cat v5 12 and toolkit gbdk tk v1 3 0 2 5 analytical methods the determination of ts vs glucose scfas mcfas ethanol phenol and ph was described in in supporting information both the analysis of variance anova and aldex2 were used to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant quinn et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 two stage caproate production from glucose at different phenol concentrations the changes of scfas and mcfas production in the two stage process are shown in fig s1 and fig 1 and the results are described in supporting information table 1 summarized the final scfas and mcfas concentrations in each stage acetate and butyrate were the two main products for scfas production the concentrations of phenol between 0 1 g l did not affect scfas production while phenol at 1 5 g l significantly inhibited both acetate and butyrate production by 32 and 35 p 0 05 respectively it should be noted that glucose was fully consumed when the concentrations of phenol were between 0 and 1 g l while there was still 45 left with phenol 1 5 g l table s1 which was consistent with the lower scfas production the scfas were further used for mcfas production through ce process for mcfas only caproate was detected for all the experiments acetate was fully consumed in 8 days in all the experiments which was accompanied by the consumption of ethanol and production of butyrate and caproate after 8 days fermentation caproate was still produced which was consistent with the consumption of ethanol it should be noted that more ethanol 6 5 gcod l was left at 1 5 g l phenol at the end of the fermentation and it was much higher than that 3 gcod l in the other conditions the results indicated phenol at 1 5 g l seriously inhibited the consumption of ethanol and further resulted in the lower production of caproate both 0 5 g l and 1 g l phenol significantly promoted caproate production by 37 8 and 59 9 p 0 05 respectively while 1 5 g l phenol significantly inhibited caproate production by 23 8 p 0 05 the above results show phenol at a certain level promoted caproate production however for the organic wastes wastewater containing higher phenol e g 1 5g l it has to be diluted before fermentation to decrease the negative effects of phenol on mcfas production the selectivity was also calculated based on the electron equivalents of products dividing by the consumed electrons from participant substrates which estimates the fraction of substrates converted into mcfas grootscholten et al 2014 fig s2 it was obvious the selectivity 70 at 1 g l phenol was much higher than the other conditions indicating more of the consumed electrons from participant substrates went to caproate the reported mcfas selectivities with ethanol as ed were between 30 85 for various organic wastes grootscholten et al 2013 roghair et al 2018b wu et al 2019 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b although it was difficult to make comparison among different studies considering the differences in substrates ed ea ratios inoculum etc the value of 80 obtained in the present study was in a high level in addition it should be noted that 1 g l phenol also promoted the consumption of ethanol although 0 5 g l phenol resulted in the similar consumption of ethanol as compared to 1 g l phenol the produced caproate was lower than that at 1 g l phenol which could be due to that the consumed ethanol was used to produce more butyrate leading to the lower selectivity overall both the higher selectivity and higher consumption of ethanol contributed to the higher caproate production at 1 g l phenol the degradation of phenol was also monitored in the two stage caproate production process fig s3 and phenol higher than 0 5 g l was not degraded the decrease of ph fig s1 and fig 1 and production of h2 in both scfas production and ce processes were observed as seen in table s1 which was a known phenomenon zagrodnik et al 2020 the ph between 5 and 7 has been widely used in previous studies wu et al 2019 and the acidic ph 5 5 was beneficial for the inhibition of methanogens while the neutral ph 7 could make the produced mcfas in dissociated forms to decrease the toxicity the initial ph of all the experiments in the present study were adjusted to 6 5 and the final ph were all above 6 0 which was mild acidic it not only reduced the activity of methanogens but also made part of the mcfas in the dissociated forms which were suitable for mcfas production cod mass balances for both scfas production process and ce process were calculated as seen in fig s4 the major metabolites were detected for both processes and the unbalanced cod in both processes were below 10 which could be attributed to microbial growth moscoviz and jimenez 2021 since the scfas produced from glucose contained both acetate and butyrate it is difficult to distinguish the role of phenol on the ce of acetate and butyrate therefore acetate and butyrate were used as ea individually to better understand the role of phenol on ce process fig s5 1 g l phenol significantly promoted caproate production from both acetate by 37 p 0 05 and butyrate by 66 p 0 05 and it also significantly increased the selectivities from 45 4 to 60 1 p 0 05 for acetate and 48 8 to 81 p 0 05 for butyrate fig s6 the above results showed phenol had more positive effects on the ce of butyrate it means for the organic wastes wastewater containing appropriate phenol the selective conversion of organic wastes wastewater to butyrate was crucial in the scfas production process in order to get higher caproate production in ce process it is possible to achieve selective butyrate production from organic wastes wastewater by adjusting fermentation temperature and ph which has been extensively studied previously agler et al 2011 lee et al 2014 3 2 microbial community analysis as revealed by hts of 16s rrna genes the microbial communities in both scfas production and ce processes were analyzed to better understand the effects of phenol on the two stage caproate production process the α and β diversities of the samples were described in supporting information fig s7 fig s8 and fig 2 pca analysis fig 2 showed phenol had more profound effects on the microbial community structures in ce process while the microbial community structures of scfas production were less affected the phylum level classification of all the samples is shown in fig 3 the samples for scfas production were dominant by firmicutes chloroflexi bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria which were also commonly found in scfas production in previous studies wan et al 2016 yang and wang 2019 the samples for ce process were dominant only by three phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes and synergistetes currently only firmicutes and proteobacteria are the known phyla that contain bacteria producing mcfas han et al 2019 wu et al 2019 table s2 however the abundance of firmicutes in sample m1 was significantly lower than that in samples m0 m0 25 and m0 5 p 0 05 indicating the presence of ce related bacteria in other phyla considering the highest caproate production in sample m1 genus level classification was further conducted as seen in fig 4 and table s3 for scfas production clostridium sensu stricto was dominant in all the samples the relative abundance between 28 and 38 and it has been reported to be involved in acidification of glucose lu et al 2020 the dominance of clostridium sensu stricto was not affected by phenol indicating its robust role in scfas production from glucose the relative abundances of other minor genera were changed with phenol for instance the relative abundances of clostridium xviii were increased gradually from 0 to 8 24 with the increase of phenol from 0 to 1 5 g l while the relative abundances of desulfovirga were decreased gradually from 7 32 to 1 88 which could contribute to the gradient from low to high phenol concentrations of the samples for scfas production in fig 2 it should be noted clostridium sensu stricto was also probably involved in mcfas production wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a clostridium sensu stricto was present in all the samples for mcfas production samples m0 m0 25 m0 5 m1 and m1 5 and the abundances of clostridium sensu stricto were between 6 9 however some genera with higher relative abundances than clostridium sensu stricto were obviously changed with the presence of phenol for instance lysinibacillus was dominant in samples m 0 m 0 25 and m 0 5 while it was significantly inhibited at higher phenol levels 1 and 1 5 g l p 0 05 lysinibacillus has been reported to accelerate the iron cycle and electron transfer to methanogens and participate in protein fermentation and its role in ce process has not been reported guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 considering its high abundance in the above mentioned samples it is potentially involved in ce process which deserved further investigation phenol induced the enrichment of aminobacterium bacillus petrimonas sporanaerobacter tepidanaerobacter and tepidimicrobium and some of the genera had higher relative abundances than clostridium sensu stricto i e aminobacterium petrimonas sporanaerobacter at both phenol 1 and 1 5 g l however all the above listed genera were not reported to be involved in ce process which indicated there might be more microbes that could achieve ce which remains to be discovered overall the above results showed phenol did not affect the dominant bacteria involved in scfas production while it significantly changed the dominant bacteria in ce process and the role of such bacteria needs to be further elucidated the changes of dominant bacteria could be directly related with the different caproate production at different phenol concentrations 3 3 metagenomic analysis 3 3 1 the relative abundances of genes involved in ce process the reverse β oxidization rbo pathway and fatty acid biosynthesis fab pathway are the two pathways for mcfas production and ethanol needs to be converted to acetyl coa first and then goes to either rbo or fab pathway for mcfas production fig s9 han et al 2018 wu et al 2020a the functional genes in each sample were annotated against kegg database in order to identify the coverage values of genes in caproate production in the whole metagenomes table 2 the results showed the coverage values of genes involved in rbo pathway were less affected by phenol while the coverage values of all the genes involved in fab pathway were affected by phenol statistical analysis for the comparison of compositional data was also conducted based on aldex2 and it was shown phenol mainly affected certain genes involved in fab pathway table s4 but not in rbo pathway for example the abundances of some genes fabd fabf and fabz involved in fab pathway were significantly increased in m1 as compared to m0 which might be related with the higher caproate production in m1 for m1 5 the abundances of some genes acaca fabf fabz and fabv involved in fab pathway were significantly decreased as compared to m0 and m1 which might be related with the lower caproate production in m1 5 although previous studies mainly focused on rbo pathway since it was considered to be more efficient than fab pathway the present study indicated fab pathway was more actively involved in mcfas production dellomonaco et al 2011 han et al 2018 a previous study also showed fab pathway was likely more active than rbo pathway during the ce of alkaline fermentation liquor of waste activated sludge wu et al 2020a it means more attention should be paid to fab pathway for future studies overall the above results demonstrated phenol affected the abundances of genes in fab pathway which might further result in the different caproate production at different phenol levels since metagenomic analysis was only based on dna which might include dead microbes and also could not identify the active pathways metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analysis are recommended be used in the future studies to verify the important role of fab pathway in ce process for caproate production since they reflected the active microbes and pathways in the microbial processes jing et al 2017b shi et al 2021 3 3 2 genome reconstruction and metabolic potentials in total 129 gbs were obtained 95 of which had high quality with completeness 70 and contamination 5 table s5 most of the gbs 60 could not be assigned to species level which were not previously characterized and might be related with new microbial species involved in ce process table s6 the functional genes of gbs with high quality were annotated against kegg database in order to identify the potential gbs those had the ability to perform ce table s7 table s8 shows the bins with complete gene sets of rbo and or fab pathways which were the most probable microbes involved in ce process in total 12 gbs contained complete gene sets in acetyl coa production together with fab pathway and or rbo pathway and they were most probably involved in ce process table 2 only one of them clostridium kluyveri fdu088 was known to be involved in ce process angenent et al 2016 and the rest gbs might be new species since they were not previously reported for mcfas production it should be noted that clostridium kluyveri fdu088 did not contain complete gene sets of rbo which could be due to the incompleteness of genome 70 22 currently the known microbes involved in ce process belong to the phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria table s2 while it seems the microbes involved in ce process might be more diverse since the listed gbs in table s8 also belong to other phyla including actinobacteria bacteroidetes and spirochaetes indicating the current understanding of ce related microbes is still limited the most abundant bacteria in m0 was lysinibacillus sphaericus fdu054 with the coverage value 6 24 while its coverage value was significantly decreased to 0 13 and 0 in m1 and m1 5 p 0 05 which means phenol inhibited its growth the result was consistent with 16s rrna genes analysis and the genus lysinibacillus was dominant in m0 and obviously inhibited by phenol as previously mentioned lysinibacillus has been reported to accelerate the iron cycle and electron transfer to methanogens and participate in protein fermentation and the present study further showed lysinibacillus sphaericus also had the ability to achieve ce bacillus badius fdu029 and proteiniclasticum sp fdu103 were less abundant microbes for caproate production in m0 as compared to lysinibacillus sphaericus fdu054 and their coverage values were also obviously decreased in m1 and m1 5 as compared to m0 p 0 05 indicating they were also sensitive to phenol the rest gbs listed in table s8 except bacteroidetes sp fdu127 and clostridium kluyveri fdu088 were enriched in m1 which might contribute to the higher caproate production however their abundances were all decreased at 1 5 g l phenol which were consistent with the lower caproate production at 1 5 g l phenol although clostridium kluyveri fdu088 has been reported to play important roles in mcfas production its coverage value was not high in the present study it should be noted clostridium kluyveri fdu088 could tolerant 1 g l phenol and it was inhibited with the increase of phenol to 1 5 g l the above mentioned gbs had the ability to perform ce independently since they had the complete gene sets however previous studies also indicated syntrophic cooperation between different microbes to achieve ce was also possible for example the direct electron transfer diet between ethanol oxidizing microbes and ce microbes through biochar or directly biological contact were proposed for mcfas production although there were no evidences liu et al 2017 wu et al 2021b therefore the gbs either with completed genes in fab rbo pathway or acetyl coa production were also analyzed as shown in table s8 it should be noted although the inoculum was heat pretreated to inhibit methanogens and no methane production were detected two gbs belonging to methanogens with high coverage values 0 05 16 1 for methanofollis sp fdu007 and 4 37 5 33 for methanobacterium sp fdu009 were still found which was not observed in 16s rrna genes analysis it was due to that bacterial primers for hts of 16s rrna genes analysis were used in the present study previous studies also mainly focused on the analysis of bacteria in mcfa production spirito et al 2018 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2020b in fact a previous study also found the presence of methanogens in mcfa production even 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium salt was added to inhibit methanogens liu et al 2017 taken together it was possible that methanogens also played roles in ce process it was found both methanofollis sp fdu007 and methanobacteriota sp fdu009 contained alcohol dehydrogenase it was consistent with a previous study that reported methanofollis ethanolicus could achieve ethanol oxidation to produce methane and acetate imachi et al 2009 without methane production in the present study the electrons during ethanol oxidation should be transferred to other species those could achieve ce through fab or rbo pathways the coverage values of methanofollis sp fdu007 was affected by phenol and it was higher in m1 16 1 which was also higher than that of most of other gbs in addition the coverage values of methanobacteriota sp fdu009 were not obviously affected by phenol p 0 05 for m0 m1 and m0 m1 5 the above results indicated methanofollis sp fdu007 played an important role in enhancing caproate production at 1 g l phenol petrimonas mucosa fdu058 was obviously enriched in sample m1 and the coverage value was 16 95 which was only 4 49 in m0 the enrichment of petrimonas mucosa fdu058 in sample m1 was also found by hts of 16s rrna genes analysis indicating this gb can adapt to high concentrations of phenol petrimonas mucosa fdu058 contained complete genes in fab pathway and aldehyde dehydrogenase but lacks alcohol dehydrogenase although it was possible petrimonas mucosa fdu058 might contain alcohol dehydrogenase due to the incompleteness of the genome it had high possibility to cooperate with methanofollis sp fdu007 for ce considering their consistent high abundances 16 95 for petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and 16 1 for methanofollis sp fdu007 in samples m1 methanofollis sp fdu007 could oxidize ethanol and petrimonas mucosa fdu058 could perform fab and therefore they could cooperate to produce caproate petrimonas species were known as mesophilic fermentative microbes capable of converting complex organics into acetate hydrogen and carbon dioxide grabowski et al 2005 hahnke et al 2016 and a previous study also speculated petrimonas had the ability to achieve extracellular electron transfer with methanothrix species for methane production through diet zhao and zhang 2019 pila k02650 is related with e pili and crucial for extracellular electron transfer and c type membrane cytochrome ccda k06196 is also necessary for extracellular electron transfer shrestha et al 2013 summers et al 2010 both the genes for pila and ccda were found in petrimonas mucosa fdu058 table s7 the gene for ccda was also found in methanofollis sp fdu007 table s7 the above results indicated petrimonas mucosa fdu058 might be involved in caproate production together with methanofollis sp fdu007 through diet by direct contact via e pili 3 3 3 mechanisms involved in phenol resistance the mechanisms involved in phenol resistance of certain microbes were further explored petrimonas mucosa fdu058 was the most abundant microbe at phenol 1 g l and 1 5 g l it was found petrimonas mucosa fdu058 contained genes in abc type transport system involved in resistance to organic solvents mlae k02066 genes relating with outer membrane efflux protein e g tolc k12340 and genes relating with peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase slyd k03775 table s9 the outer membrane efflux protein could export toxic compounds from the cells and the reduction of toxic compounds concentration in the cells by the induction of their active export through efflux pump is an important mechanism of adaption to solvents the first two genes were involved in the active efflux system santos et al 2004 peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase has specific role in stress tolerance mechanisms subin et al 2016 the process of aggregation of protein is minimized by molecular chaperons under stress condition while peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase accelerates the slow rate limiting isomerisation step in refolding of proteins the genes involved in protein folding are important for the microbes to adapt to phenol inhibition which has been proven previously santos et al 2007 the above genes were not present in lysinibacillus sphaericus fdu054 bacillus badius fdu029 and proteiniclasticum sp fdu103 which were abundant in sample m0 but significantly inhibited in sample m1 it seems petrimonas mucosa fdu058 adapted to phenol resistance through a combination of different mechanisms the gbs e g syntrophorhabdus sp fdu104 spiro sp fdu102 massilibacterium sp fdu015 and methanofollis sp fdu007 obviously enriched with the addition of phenol also contained some of the above mentioned genes however both spiro sp fdu102 and massilibacterium sp fdu015 were only enriched in sample m1 and inhibited in sample m1 5 and it indicated even the microbes contained genes involved in phenol resistance they had different tolerance to phenol inhibition it should be noted that the mechanism of phenol resistance is complex and previous studies also showed microbes could adapt to phenol by increasing the degree of saturation of membrane lipids which could not be elucidated by metagenomic analysis since most of the gbs in table s8 contained fab pathway and the effects of phenol on the expression of the genes e g faba fabb relating with saturated and unsaturated lipid could not be determined heath and rock 1996 heipieper et al 1994 the combination of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis should be conducted in future studies to better reveal the adaption mechanisms of different microbes to phenol inhibition in mixed cultures 3 3 4 syntrophic cooperation of microbes for caproate production although it has been proposed ce might be achieved by syntrophic cooperation of different microbes liu et al 2017 wu et al 2021b the present study for the first time showed petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 were potentially involved in caproate production through diet by metagenomic analysis petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 were enriched in m1 coverage values 16 while they were also detected in the m0 with lower coverage values 7 table s8 it suggests the syntrophic association for caproate production through diet was present in both m0 and m1 while the syntrophic association was favored at 1 g l phenol with increased relative abundances and improved caproate production the enrichment of these two microbes could be due to their higher tolerance to phenol since they had the genes relating with active efflux system and refolding of proteins for m1 5 petrimonas mucosa fdu058 still had high coverage value 13 98 while the coverage value of methanofollis sp fdu007 was decreased to 0 05 table s8 in this case petrimonas mucosa fdu058 might achieve ce together with other abundant ethanol oxidizing microbes methanobacteriota sp fdu009 methanomassiliicoccus sp fdu061 and syntrophorhabdus sp fdu104 those were more tolerant to phenol the above results indicated syntrophic cooperation might be more efficient for ce considering the high caproate production and enrichment of methanofollis sp fdu007 and petrimonas mucosa fdu058 in m1 1 5 g l phenol might change the syntrophic cooperated species the present study was conducted in batch experiments and continuous experiments should be tested in the future to understand whether phenol at 1 g l could still promote caproate production in order to promote the application of the process in addition the microbial communities in continuous experiments might be changed due to the different environmental conditions and the importance of syntrophic cooperation of microbes for caproate production especially at higher phenol conditions should be further explored and verified 4 conclusions the present study showed that phenol had more profound effects on ce process than scfas production process although 1 5 g l phenol inhibited both process 1 g l phenol increased caproate production by 59 9 in the ce process with ethanol as electron donor via two stage anaerobic fermentation of glucose and in this case ce of butyrate was better promoted than ce of acetate hts of 16s rrna genes analysis showed the bacterial communities of scfas production were slightly affected by phenol while the bacterial communities of ce process were significantly affected and different dominant microbes were observed at different concentrations of phenol 1 g l phenol increased the abundances of genes in fab pathway as revealed by metagenomic analysis and it might be related with the increased caproate production genome reconstruction identified the dominant microbial species involved in ce process at different phenol concentrations most of which were not reported to be involved in ce process previously 1 g l phenol resulted in the obvious enrichment of petrimonas mucosa fdu058 and methanofollis sp fdu007 which might achieve syntrophic cooperation in ce process and they could adapt to 1 g l phenol since they had the genes relating with active efflux system and refolding of proteins supporting information supporting information includes fig s1 s9 table s1 s9 hts of 16s rrna genes and analysis calculation of scfas and mcfas calculation of

16647,selenate and sulfide are both contaminants which severely pollute water bodies respective bioremediation of selenate and sulfide contaminated wastewaters requires abundant electron donors and acceptors here we present a novel concept coupling biological selenate to selenite shortcut deselenization and chemical sulfide driven selenite reduction to remove multiple pollutants simultaneously vial tests showed that shortcut deselenization could save at least two thirds of operation time and one third of carbon source compared to the complete deselenization to elemental selenium subsequent co removal of sulfide and selenite was optimized at reaction ph of 10 and reactant molar ratio of 4 using a newly designed continuous flow system 95 removal of both selenate and sulfide was achieved by coupling shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation a series of characterization tools revealed that the final collected precipitates were comprised of high purity hexagonal selenium 97 4 wt and inconsiderable sulfur 2 6 wt superior over selenate reducing solutions generally producing selenium mixed with reagents or microorganisms the selenium products generated here were highly purified thus very favorable for further recovery and reuse overall this proof of concept study provided a promising technology not only for co removal of multiple pollutants but also for substantial costs saving as well as for valuable products recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shortcut deselenization sulfide oxidation selenite reduction elemental selenium 1 introduction selenium se pollution mainly in the form of selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 is associated with a variety of industries including production of photoelectric devices coal mining and combustion and flue gas desulfurization chung et al 2006 lemly 2004 these wastewaters always contain high se concentrations for example 170 4900 μg l of selenate in petrochemical effluent and up to 620 mg l in selenium mining drainage tan et al 2016 despite being an essential micronutrient excessive uptake of selenium can result in skin discoloration mental disorders and even death 5 mg day boyd 2011 making it necessary to remediate selenium laden waters before discharging to the environment reduction of selenate to elemental selenium se0 is considered a reliable strategy for removal of selenium pollution given that the product is insoluble and can be easily removed from wastewaters by filtration this process involves a two electron equivalent reduction of selenate to selenite step one and a subsequent four electron equivalent conversion to elemental selenium step two as shown in equations 1 and 2 respectively seby et al 2001 1 se o 4 2 h chooh hse o 3 c o 2 h 2 o g 0 125 4 kj mol e 2 hse o 3 h 2 chooh s e 0 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o g 0 96 7 kj mol e the term shortcut deselenization refers to only step one while complete deselenization refers to the sequential combination of both steps many lineages of microorganisms such as thauera selenatis and enterobacter cloacae sld1a 1 have been demonstrated to perform shortcut or complete deselenization when coupled to oxidation of energy sources fisher and hollibaugh 2008 hageman et al 2013 losi and frankenberger 1997 rech and macy 1992 shi et al 2021 in addition to bioremediation chemical reagents can efficiently reduce selenium oxyanions to elemental selenium as well such as fe ii rich minerals zero valent iron and sulfide ions geoffroy and demopoulos 2011 liang et al 2014 schellenger and larese casanova 2013 besides an active reductant sulfide s2 is also a toxicant present in various industrial waste streams at hundreds of mg per liter li and wei 2010 mahmood et al 2007 conventional tools for removing sulfide pollution include direct air stripping dell orco et al 1998 metal precipitation poulton et al 2002 biological conversion to other sulfur species sipma et al 2004 and chemical oxidation using strong oxidants e g potassium permanganate jayaraman and east 2012 similar to sulfite selenite has relatively high oxidation capacity able to react with sulfide thus eliminating both contaminants from wastewater as the following equation shows geoffroy and demopoulos 2011 3 2 h 2 s h 2 se o 3 s e 0 2 s 0 3 h 2 o however sulfide cannot reduce selenate directly requiring a pre transformation of selenate to selenite transient accumulation of selenite during selenate reduction to elemental selenium revealed that selenite reduction was the rate limiting step shi et al 2020c since the shortcut deselenization theoretically needs only one third of electron equivalents of the complete deselenization eqs 1 and 2 coupling the shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation would not only save substantial carbon source but also enable co removals of selenate and sulfide the present study aimed at optimizing conditions for maximizing selenite yield and for co removing selenite and sulfide and finally constructing a continuous flow reactor to simultaneously treat selenate and sulfide containing wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 shortcut deselenization in serum bottles approximately 10 ml of the enrichment culture was sampled from a parent selenate fed reactor and inoculated into 60 ml serum bottles shi et al 2020c along with 30 ml anoxic medium as previously described lv et al 2020 shi et al 2020b using formate and selenate as the sole electron donor and acceptor respectively briefly the basal medium contained nh4cl 0 02 g l cacl2 1 mg l nahco3 0 3 g l mgcl2 2 mg l mgso4 7h2o 0 2 mg l kh2po4 0 2 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 0 4 g l 1 ml l acid trace element solution consisted of hcl 100 mm fecl2 4h2o 1 49 g l zncl2 32 2 mg l h3bo3 14 mg l cocl2 6h2o 120 mg l mncl2 4h2o 500 mg l cucl2 270 mg l nicl2 6h2o 95 mg l and 1 ml l alkaline trace element solution consisted of naoh 100 mm na2wo4 2h2o 50 mg l na2moo4 2h2o 242 mg l seo2 67 mg l the medium was then autoclaved and degassed with argon for the downstream use we defined selenite yield according to the following equation 4 4 selenite yield produced selenite m m consumed selenate m m 100 to test the effect of carbon concentration on selenite yield we set a series of molar ratios of formate to selenate i e c se at 0 1 3 5 9 and 15 by varying formate concentration but keeping constant selenate concentration at 0 4 mm all the duplicate bottles were degassed with argon closed with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with crimped aluminum caps the liquid samples were taken every day using 1 ml syringes and filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters to monitor the concentrations of selenate and selenite to explore the stoichiometry of selenate and formate transformations about 5 3 mm of formate and 0 4 mm of selenate were incubated with the enriched culture in triplicate bottles one part of liquid samples i e 0 5 ml was filtered to measure the soluble formate selenate and selenite the other i e 1 0 ml was centrifuged and washed to obtain the precipitates for determining the content of elemental selenium 2 2 co removal of sulfide and selenite in batch vials to investigate the effect of ph the stock solutions of s2 and seo3 2 were first adjusted to certain ph values using hcl and naoh and then mixed in triplicate serum bottles at the initial concentrations of 1 5 mm for s2 and 0 5 mm for seo3 2 initial ph values were set as 4 7 9 10 and 12 according to the previous study 30 minutes is sufficient to allow the reaction to occur adequately jung et al 2016 therefore we filtered the liquid samples and measured the concentrations of s2 and seo3 2 immediately after 30 minutes of the reaction control setups with s2 only or seo3 2 only were also performed to evaluate the contribution of their interaction on the mutual removal to explore the effect of s2 seo3 2 ratio the stock solutions were adjusted to ph of 10 and mixed at a constant seo3 2 concentration of 0 5 mm in serum bottles the ratios of s2 to seo3 2 were set at 0 8 1 6 2 4 3 4 4 1 and 6 7 respectively by regulating the s2 concentrations other conditions including incubation and sampling were executed as described above and all the bottles were performed in triplicate 2 3 coupling of shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation a continuous reaction system was constructed to couple the shortcut deselenization with sulfide oxidation fig 1 this system includes two sections a biotic reactor for shortcut deselenization and an abiotic one for sulfide and selenite co removal the biotic reactor had a diameter of 120 mm and height of 200 mm of which the liquid volume was approximately 1 8 l a membrane module was included to prevent the loss of microbial culture the effluent was introduced into the abiotic tank for sulfide and selenite co removal after regulating the ph this tank had a diameter and height of 80 mm and 180 mm respectively containing the liquid volume of 0 8 l in addition to the shortcut deselenization effluent synthetic sulfide laden wastewater was imported as well controlled by a peristaltic pump two types of influents were mixed through magnetic stirring and the final effluent was discharged after reacting 30 minutes as mentioned above approximately 200 ml of the enriched culture from a selenate fed reactor was inoculated into the shortcut deselenization reactor as mentioned above due to the accumulation of selenite in the parent reactor the initial selenite concentration in the effluent was pretty high 0 9 mm the anoxic medium of ph 7 0 7 5 including 0 5 mm of selenate and 2 5 mm of formate was introduced at a rate of 1 25 ml min hrt 24h using a peristaltic pump the ph of the shortcut deselenization effluent was adjusted to 10 using naoh then the shortcut deselenization effluent at ph 10 was imported into the abiotic reaction tank at a rate of 17 6 ml min along with the sulfide containing water at a rate of 8 8 ml min together keeping the hrt at 30 min the s2 seo3 2 ratio was set at 4 by regulating the concentration of the influent sulfide a control setup was also performed using degassed medium same as described in section 2 1 with no selenite but sulfide containing wastewater following the above operation procedure because of the different hrts between two reactors the shortcut deselenization effluent when reaching the steady state from hour 300 onwards was first stored in a reservoir and transferred to the second reactor intermittently for the co removal with sulfide 2 4 chemical analysis soluble formate selenate selenite sulfate and sulfite were measured using ion chromatography ics 1500 thermofisher config d with as 11 column while thiosulfate was measured with as 19 column sulfide concentration was measured using n n diethyl p phenylenediamine spectrophotometry lin 2010 briefly the solution of n n diethyl p phenylenediamine 7 5 g l was mixed with ferric chloride 500 0 g l at a ratio of 20 1 to obtain the chromogenic reagent the mixture was added into sulfide containing standards and samples of which optical density was detected at 665 nm using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer the sulfide standards were purchased from institute of standard samples of the ministry of environmental protection the precipitates after washing were first digested using 1 ml of 69 hno3 at 100 c for 10 minutes and the total selenium in the supernatant was then measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms perkinelmer nexion 300x shi et al 2020a elemental sulfur was first extracted using methylbenzene for 24 h and then determined by ultra fast liquid chromatography prominence uflc shimadzu config d with eclipse xdb c18 column agilent findlay et al 2014 kamyshny et al 2009 the eluent is a mixture of 98 v v methanol and 2 v v water the wave length of ultraviolet detector is set at 264 nm 2 5 characterization of solid precipitates solid precipitates derived from both biological selenate reduction and abiotic sulfide oxidation were centrifuged washed and lyophilized for the downstream characterization the valence of selenium was determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi the crystal structure of precipitates was determined by x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d8 advance the components of precipitated products were determined by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds hitachi se3400n following the instrument manual 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility and benefit of the shortcut deselenization the effect of ratios of electron donor to acceptor here expressed as formate to selenate c se was first investigated as shown in fig s1 compared to the negligible selenate reduction with no carbon source the addition of formate at c se ratios ranging 1 15 obviously stimulated selenate reduction with average rates of 0 02 0 15 mm day intriguingly the selenite yields kept stable among 57 3 and 64 4 even when the formate or selenate was stoichiometrically limited fig s1 in theory the reduction of selenate to selenite yields more specific free energy per electron equivalent i e 125 4 kj mol e than the subsequent reduction to elemental selenium i e 96 7 kj mol e making microorganisms preferentially perform the former to maximize the energy advantage under electron donor limiting conditions during the similar interaction between nitrate and nitrite reduction rocher et al 2015 stable nitrite accumulation was also observed in both pure cultures and microbial consortia with a wide range of c n ratios mainly caused by its much lower reduction rate than that of nitrate chakravarthy et al 2011 sun et al 2009 the phenomenon discovered in nitrogen oxyanions resembled the above results in selenium species leading us to monitor a complete deselenization during the whole process the total produced elemental selenium was 0 37 0 05 mm accounting for 94 9 of the depleted soluble selenium 0 39 0 02 mm an indication of the complete transformation from the initial selenate to final elemental selenium fig 2 the reduction rate for selenate was 5 fold higher than that for selenite 8 1 µm h compared to 1 6 µm h respectively which thus well explained the constant selenite yield under the fluctuations of c se ratio the partial shortcut deselenization indicated in stage 1 took up only a third of the total operation time of 48 h for the complete deselenization fig 2 taking formate here as an example at least one third of the carbon source 0 64 0 08 mm in stage 2 could be saved if the reaction was stopped at the end of the shortcut deselenization and further selenite reduction was bypassed overall these results demonstrated not only the feasibility of shortcut deselenization but also its promising benefits on high conversion efficiency and low carbon source usage of which the effluent could be reacted with sulfide to remove the remaining selenite 3 2 optimization of sulfide oxidation given the hydrolysis of sulfide and selenite ions the effect of reaction ph on their co removal was explored as shown in fig 3 a at a s2 seo3 2 ratio of 3 sulfide removal efficiencies reached more than 99 0 at a wide ph range of 7 10 while the highest selenite removal efficiency was 89 0 at ph 10 only considering the different forms of sulfide and selenite under varying ph conditions the efficient co removal was probably due to interactions of hs with hseo3 and seo3 2 pettine et al 2012 when the reaction ph dropped to 4 or increased to 12 the removal efficiencies of both sulfide and selenite declined dramatically after 30 minutes suggesting that h2s and s2 the dominant sulfur species at phs 4 and 10 respectively were less reactive than hs holmer and hasler sheetal 2014 torres et al 2010 thus the ph of 10 was selected for the downstream setups neither selenite nor sulfide was consumed with themselves only suggesting that their eliminations were dependent on the other being present fig s2 with the optimum ph 10 as the s2 seo3 2 ratio was increased from 0 8 to 6 7 selenite removal efficiency was accordingly enhanced to 98 0 while sulfide removal slightly decreased to 88 9 fig 3b the increasing efficiencies of selenite removal with excess reactant were in line with the previous observation jung et al 2016 the slight decrease of sulfide removal was probably due to the lack of selenite as an oxidant despite that the excess sulfide might have been additionally consumed via reacting with elemental sulfur to generate polysulfides jung et al 2016 based on the results above a s2 seo3 2 ratio of 4 with an initial ph of 10 was the optimum condition for the co removal of sulfide and selenite 3 3 coupling of shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation to make the co removal of selenium and sulfide pollutions practical a continuous reaction system was constructed to couple the shortcut deselenization with sulfide oxidation fig 1 after being inoculated by the enrichment culture from a parent selenate fed bioreactor the effluent selenate concentration in the shortcut deselenization reactor decreased immediately from 0 52 mm to 0 36 mm or 30 8 removal at an hrt of 24 h fig 4 a the initial high concentration of effluent selenite 0 9 mm was originated from the inoculum which contained large amount of selenite in the parent reactor the effluent selenate concentration further dropped to below 0 01 mm after 300 hours and the removal efficiency remained stable over 98 accordingly effluent selenite reached 0 3 mm at steady state since 300 h fig 4a the selenite yield 57 7 was similar to batch results suggesting that less than half of the influent selenate was converted to elemental selenium the presence of se0 was confirmed by the eds and xps analyses with which together revealed the intense signal of elemental selenium in the precipitates fig s3 collectively shortcut deselenization was successfully achieved with the stable effluent consisted of almost all selenite and negligible selenate using the newly designed continuous reactor before leading the effluent from shortcut deselenization into the downstream abiotic tank a control setup using degassed mineral medium and sulfide containing wastewater demonstrated negligible consumption of sulfide indicating very little contribution of environmental factors e g air and components in the medium though in a continuous operation mode fig s4 then the effluent of shortcut deselenization in the preceding was coupled to the sulfide laden wastewater with the s2 seo3 2 ratio of 3 7 after regulating the ph at 10 fig 4b it is worth noting that the pump rate of selenite laden water was two folds as that of sulfide containing water see methods removal efficiencies of both sulfide and selenite in the abiotic tank reached above 95 with effluent concentrations of 0 1 and 0 01 mm respectively in a combination of reaction and dilution the total removal efficiency of soluble selenium in the whole system came up to more than 98 demonstrating a highly promising prospect in application to severe selenate contamination in addition the pollutant sulfide could serve as the electron donor for selenite reduction not only to substitute expensive carbon sources but also to remediate sulfide contaminated waters in summary this newly designed system successfully achieved multiple pollutants co removal and saved abundant carbon source usage 3 4 characterization of final products the reduction of selenite typically produces elemental selenium or selenide scheinost and charlet 2008 while the oxidation of sulfide may generate various forms of sulfur species including elemental sulfur polysulfide sulfite thiosulfate and sulfate obrien and birkner 1977 except for selenite selenate was undetectable in the final effluent while some precipitates were apparently observed in the abiotic reactor as indicated by the turbid solution the solid samples from the sulfide driven selenite reduction showed the diffraction pattern of elemental selenium crystallites same as those from biological selenate reduction and standard hexagonal selenium suggesting that the deposited products were comprised of elemental selenium fig s 5 a this was further confirmed by xps results which demonstrated an obvious se 3d peak of elemental selenium fig 5b in precipitates from both biotic and abiotic reactors collectively these analyses clearly indicated the final product of hexagonal elemental selenium during the sulfide driven selenite reduction in terms of sulfide oxidation sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate were detected and thiosulfate was the dominant species table 1 interestingly elemental sulfur was also extracted and measured at trace amounts this was validated by the more sensitive surface scanning eds analysis in which the signal of sulfur was indeed detected in the precipitates fig 5c though its intensity was much weaker than selenium possibly due to the poor settleability findlay et al 2014 the total concentration of sulfur in these four identified products was 2 04 0 10 mm please note that there is two mole sulfur per mole thiosulfate in line with the total decreased sulfide i e 1 86 0 03 mm this good recovery of sulfur mass excluded the possible production of other species such as polysulfide in selenite driven sulfide oxidation among the sulfur based products thiosulfate formation accounted

16647,selenate and sulfide are both contaminants which severely pollute water bodies respective bioremediation of selenate and sulfide contaminated wastewaters requires abundant electron donors and acceptors here we present a novel concept coupling biological selenate to selenite shortcut deselenization and chemical sulfide driven selenite reduction to remove multiple pollutants simultaneously vial tests showed that shortcut deselenization could save at least two thirds of operation time and one third of carbon source compared to the complete deselenization to elemental selenium subsequent co removal of sulfide and selenite was optimized at reaction ph of 10 and reactant molar ratio of 4 using a newly designed continuous flow system 95 removal of both selenate and sulfide was achieved by coupling shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation a series of characterization tools revealed that the final collected precipitates were comprised of high purity hexagonal selenium 97 4 wt and inconsiderable sulfur 2 6 wt superior over selenate reducing solutions generally producing selenium mixed with reagents or microorganisms the selenium products generated here were highly purified thus very favorable for further recovery and reuse overall this proof of concept study provided a promising technology not only for co removal of multiple pollutants but also for substantial costs saving as well as for valuable products recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shortcut deselenization sulfide oxidation selenite reduction elemental selenium 1 introduction selenium se pollution mainly in the form of selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 is associated with a variety of industries including production of photoelectric devices coal mining and combustion and flue gas desulfurization chung et al 2006 lemly 2004 these wastewaters always contain high se concentrations for example 170 4900 μg l of selenate in petrochemical effluent and up to 620 mg l in selenium mining drainage tan et al 2016 despite being an essential micronutrient excessive uptake of selenium can result in skin discoloration mental disorders and even death 5 mg day boyd 2011 making it necessary to remediate selenium laden waters before discharging to the environment reduction of selenate to elemental selenium se0 is considered a reliable strategy for removal of selenium pollution given that the product is insoluble and can be easily removed from wastewaters by filtration this process involves a two electron equivalent reduction of selenate to selenite step one and a subsequent four electron equivalent conversion to elemental selenium step two as shown in equations 1 and 2 respectively seby et al 2001 1 se o 4 2 h chooh hse o 3 c o 2 h 2 o g 0 125 4 kj mol e 2 hse o 3 h 2

microorganisms such as thauera selenatis and enterobacter cloacae sld1a 1 have been demonstrated to perform shortcut or complete deselenization when coupled to oxidation of energy sources fisher and hollibaugh 2008 hageman et al 2013 losi and frankenberger 1997 rech and macy 1992 shi et al 2021 in addition to bioremediation chemical reagents can efficiently reduce selenium oxyanions to elemental selenium as well such as fe ii rich minerals zero valent iron and sulfide ions geoffroy and demopoulos 2011 liang et al 2014 schellenger and larese casanova 2013 besides an active reductant sulfide s2 is also a toxicant present in various industrial waste streams at hundreds of mg per liter li and wei 2010 mahmood et al 2007 conventional tools for removing sulfide pollution include direct air

permanganate jayaraman and east 2012 similar to sulfite selenite has relatively high oxidation capacity able to react with sulfide thus eliminating both contaminants from wastewater as the following equation shows geoffroy and demopoulos 2011 3 2 h 2 s h 2 se o 3 s e 0 2 s 0 3 h 2 o however sulfide cannot reduce selenate directly requiring a pre transformation of selenate to selenite transient accumulation of selenite during selenate reduction to elemental selenium revealed that selenite reduction was the rate limiting step shi et al 2020c since the shortcut deselenization theoretically needs only one third of electron equivalents of the complete deselenization eqs 1 and 2 coupling the shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation would not only save substantial carbon source but also enable co removals of selenate and sulfide the present study aimed at optimizing conditions for maximizing selenite yield and for co removing selenite and sulfide and finally constructing a continuous flow reactor to simultaneously treat selenate and sulfide containing wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 shortcut deselenization in serum bottles approximately 10 ml of the enrichment culture was sampled from a parent selenate fed reactor and inoculated into 60 ml serum bottles shi et al 2020c along with 30 ml anoxic medium as previously described lv et al 2020 shi et al 2020b using formate and selenate as the sole electron donor and acceptor respectively briefly the basal medium contained nh4cl 0 02 g l cacl2 1 mg l nahco3 0 3 g l mgcl2 2 mg l mgso4 7h2o 0 2 mg l kh2po4 0 2 g l na2hpo4

1 ml l alkaline trace element solution consisted of naoh 100 mm na2wo4 2h2o 50 mg l na2moo4 2h2o 242 mg l seo2 67 mg l the medium was then autoclaved and degassed with argon for the downstream use we defined selenite yield according to the following equation 4 4 selenite yield produced selenite m m consumed selenate m m 100 to test the effect of carbon concentration on selenite yield we set a series of molar ratios of formate to selenate i e c se at 0 1 3 5 9 and 15 by varying formate concentration but keeping constant selenate concentration at 0 4 mm all the duplicate bottles were degassed with argon closed with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with crimped aluminum caps the liquid samples were taken every day using 1 ml syringes and filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters to monitor the concentrations of selenate and selenite to explore the stoichiometry of selenate and formate transformations about 5 3 mm of formate and 0 4 mm of selenate were incubated with the enriched culture in triplicate bottles one part of liquid samples i e 0 5 ml was filtered to measure the soluble formate selenate and selenite the other i e 1 0 ml was centrifuged and washed to obtain the precipitates for determining the content of elemental selenium 2 2 co removal of sulfide and selenite in batch vials to investigate the effect of ph the stock solutions of s2 and seo3 2 were first adjusted to certain ph values using hcl and naoh and then mixed in triplicate serum bottles at the initial concentrations of 1 5 mm for s2 and 0 5 mm for seo3 2 initial ph values were set as 4 7 9 10 and 12 according to the previous study 30 minutes is sufficient to allow the reaction to occur adequately jung et al 2016 therefore we filtered the liquid samples and measured the concentrations of s2 and seo3 2 immediately after 30 minutes of the reaction control setups with s2 only or seo3 2 only were also performed to evaluate the contribution of their interaction on the mutual removal to explore the effect of s2 seo3 2 ratio the stock solutions were adjusted to ph of 10 and mixed at a constant seo3 2 concentration of 0 5 mm in serum bottles the ratios of s2 to seo3 2 were set at 0 8 1 6 2 4 3 4 4 1 and 6 7 respectively by regulating the s2 concentrations other conditions including incubation and sampling were executed as described above and all the bottles were performed in triplicate 2 3 coupling of shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation a continuous reaction system was constructed to couple the shortcut deselenization with sulfide oxidation fig 1 this system includes two sections a biotic reactor for shortcut deselenization and an abiotic one for sulfide and selenite co removal the biotic reactor had a diameter of 120 mm and height of 200 mm of which the liquid volume was approximately 1 8 l a membrane module was included to prevent the loss of microbial culture the effluent was introduced into the abiotic tank for sulfide and selenite co removal after regulating the ph this tank had a diameter and height of 80 mm and 180 mm respectively containing the liquid volume of 0 8 l in addition to the shortcut deselenization effluent synthetic sulfide laden wastewater was imported as well controlled by a peristaltic pump two types of influents were mixed through magnetic stirring and the final effluent was discharged after reacting 30 minutes as mentioned above approximately 200 ml of the enriched culture from a selenate fed reactor was inoculated into the shortcut deselenization reactor as mentioned above due to the accumulation of selenite in the parent reactor the initial selenite concentration in the effluent was pretty high 0 9 mm the anoxic medium of ph 7 0 7 5 including 0 5 mm of selenate and 2 5 mm of formate was introduced at a rate of 1 25 ml min hrt 24h using a peristaltic pump the ph of the shortcut deselenization effluent was adjusted to 10 using naoh then the shortcut deselenization effluent at ph 10 was imported into the abiotic reaction tank at a rate of 17 6 ml min along with the sulfide containing water at a rate of 8 8 ml min together keeping the hrt at 30 min the s2 seo3 2 ratio was set at 4 by regulating the concentration of the influent sulfide a control setup was also performed using degassed medium same as described in section 2 1 with no selenite but sulfide containing wastewater following the above operation procedure because of the different hrts between two reactors the shortcut deselenization effluent when reaching the steady state from hour 300 onwards was first stored in a reservoir and transferred to the second reactor intermittently for the co removal with sulfide 2 4 chemical analysis soluble formate selenate selenite sulfate and sulfite were measured using ion chromatography ics 1500 thermofisher config d with as 11 column while thiosulfate was measured with as 19 column sulfide concentration was measured using n n diethyl p phenylenediamine spectrophotometry lin 2010 briefly the solution of n n diethyl p phenylenediamine 7 5 g l was mixed with ferric chloride 500 0 g l at a ratio of 20 1 to obtain the chromogenic reagent the mixture was added into sulfide containing standards and samples of which optical density was detected at 665 nm using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer the sulfide standards were purchased from institute of standard samples of the ministry of environmental protection the precipitates after washing were first digested using 1 ml of 69 hno3 at 100 c for 10 minutes and the total selenium in the supernatant was then measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms perkinelmer nexion 300x shi et al 2020a elemental sulfur was first extracted using methylbenzene for 24 h and then determined by ultra fast liquid chromatography prominence uflc shimadzu config d with eclipse xdb c18 column agilent findlay et al 2014 kamyshny et al 2009 the eluent is a mixture of 98 v v methanol and 2 v v water the wave length of ultraviolet detector is set at 264 nm 2 5 characterization of solid precipitates solid precipitates derived from both biological selenate reduction and abiotic sulfide oxidation were centrifuged washed and lyophilized for the downstream characterization the valence of selenium was determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi the crystal structure of precipitates was determined by x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d8 advance the components of precipitated products were determined by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds hitachi se3400n following the instrument manual 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility and benefit of the shortcut deselenization the effect of ratios of electron donor to acceptor here expressed as formate to selenate c se was first investigated as shown in fig s1 compared to the negligible selenate reduction with no carbon source the addition of formate at c se ratios ranging 1 15 obviously stimulated selenate reduction with average rates of 0 02 0 15 mm day intriguingly the selenite yields kept stable among 57 3 and 64 4 even when the formate or selenate was stoichiometrically limited fig s1 in theory the reduction of selenate to selenite yields more specific free energy per electron equivalent i e 125 4 kj mol e than the subsequent reduction to elemental selenium i e 96 7 kj mol e making microorganisms preferentially perform the former to maximize the energy advantage under electron donor limiting conditions during the similar interaction between nitrate and nitrite reduction rocher et al 2015 stable nitrite accumulation was also observed in both pure cultures and microbial consortia with a wide range of c n ratios mainly caused by its much lower reduction rate than that of nitrate chakravarthy et al 2011 sun et al 2009 the phenomenon discovered in nitrogen oxyanions resembled the above results in selenium species leading us to monitor a complete deselenization during the whole process the total produced elemental selenium was 0 37 0 05 mm accounting for 94 9 of the depleted soluble selenium 0 39 0 02 mm an indication of the complete transformation from the initial selenate to final elemental selenium fig 2 the reduction rate for selenate was 5 fold higher than that for selenite 8 1 µm h compared to 1 6 µm h respectively which thus well explained the constant selenite yield under the fluctuations of c se ratio the partial shortcut deselenization indicated in stage 1 took up only a third of the total operation time of 48 h for the complete deselenization fig 2 taking formate here as an example at least one third of the carbon source 0 64 0 08 mm in stage 2 could be saved if the reaction was stopped at the end of the shortcut deselenization and further selenite reduction was bypassed overall these results demonstrated not only the feasibility of shortcut deselenization but also its promising benefits on high conversion efficiency and low carbon source usage of which the effluent could be reacted with sulfide to remove the remaining selenite 3 2 optimization of sulfide oxidation given the hydrolysis of sulfide and selenite ions the effect of reaction ph on their co removal was explored as shown in fig 3 a at a s2 seo3 2 ratio of 3 sulfide removal efficiencies reached more than 99 0 at a wide ph range of 7 10 while the highest selenite removal efficiency was 89 0 at ph 10 only considering the different forms of sulfide and selenite under varying ph conditions the efficient co removal was probably due to interactions of hs with hseo3 and seo3 2 pettine et al 2012 when the reaction ph dropped to 4 or increased to 12 the removal efficiencies of both sulfide and selenite declined dramatically after 30 minutes suggesting that h2s and s2 the dominant sulfur species at phs 4 and 10 respectively were less reactive than hs holmer and hasler sheetal 2014 torres et al 2010 thus the ph of 10 was selected for the downstream setups neither selenite nor sulfide was consumed with themselves only suggesting that their eliminations were dependent on the other being present fig s2 with the optimum ph 10 as the s2 seo3 2 ratio was increased from 0 8 to 6 7 selenite removal efficiency was accordingly enhanced to 98 0 while sulfide removal slightly decreased to 88 9 fig 3b the increasing efficiencies of selenite removal with excess reactant were in line with the previous observation jung et al 2016 the slight decrease of sulfide removal was probably due to the lack of selenite as an oxidant despite that the excess sulfide might have been additionally consumed via reacting with elemental sulfur to generate polysulfides jung et al 2016 based on the results above a s2 seo3 2 ratio of 4 with an initial ph of 10 was the optimum condition for the co removal of sulfide and selenite 3 3 coupling of shortcut deselenization to sulfide oxidation to make the co removal of selenium and sulfide pollutions practical a continuous reaction system was constructed to couple the shortcut deselenization with sulfide oxidation fig 1 after being inoculated by the enrichment culture from a parent selenate fed bioreactor the effluent selenate concentration in the shortcut deselenization reactor decreased immediately from 0 52 mm to 0 36 mm or 30 8 removal at an hrt of 24 h fig 4 a the initial high concentration of effluent selenite 0 9 mm was originated from the inoculum which contained large amount of selenite in the parent reactor the effluent selenate concentration further dropped to below 0 01 mm after 300 hours and the removal efficiency remained stable over 98 accordingly effluent selenite reached 0 3 mm at steady state since 300 h fig 4a the selenite yield 57 7 was similar to batch results suggesting that less than half of the influent selenate was converted to elemental selenium the presence of se0 was confirmed by the eds and xps analyses with which together revealed the intense signal of elemental selenium in the precipitates fig s3 collectively shortcut deselenization was successfully achieved with the stable effluent consisted of almost all selenite and negligible selenate using the newly designed continuous reactor before leading the effluent from shortcut deselenization into the downstream abiotic tank a control setup using degassed mineral medium and sulfide containing wastewater demonstrated negligible consumption of sulfide indicating very little contribution of environmental factors e g air and components in the medium though in a continuous operation mode fig s4 then the effluent of shortcut deselenization in the preceding was coupled to the sulfide laden wastewater with the s2 seo3 2 ratio of 3 7 after regulating the ph at 10 fig 4b it is worth noting that the pump rate of selenite laden water was two folds as that of sulfide containing water see methods removal efficiencies of both sulfide and selenite in the abiotic tank reached above 95 with effluent concentrations of 0 1 and 0 01 mm respectively in a combination of reaction and dilution the total removal efficiency of soluble selenium in the whole system came up to more than 98 demonstrating a highly promising prospect in application to severe selenate contamination in addition the pollutant sulfide could serve as the electron donor for selenite reduction not only to substitute expensive carbon sources but also to remediate sulfide contaminated waters in summary this newly designed system successfully achieved multiple pollutants co removal and saved abundant carbon source usage 3 4 characterization of final products the reduction of selenite typically produces elemental selenium or selenide scheinost and charlet 2008 while the oxidation of sulfide may generate various forms of sulfur species including elemental sulfur polysulfide sulfite thiosulfate and sulfate obrien and birkner 1977 except for selenite selenate was undetectable in the final effluent while some precipitates were apparently observed in the abiotic reactor as indicated by the turbid solution the solid samples from the sulfide driven selenite reduction showed the diffraction pattern of elemental selenium crystallites same as those from biological selenate reduction and standard hexagonal selenium suggesting that the deposited products were comprised of elemental selenium fig s 5 a this was further confirmed by xps results which demonstrated an obvious se 3d peak of elemental selenium fig 5b in precipitates from both biotic and abiotic reactors collectively these analyses clearly indicated the final product of hexagonal elemental selenium during the sulfide driven selenite reduction in terms of sulfide oxidation sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate were detected and thiosulfate was the dominant species table 1 interestingly elemental sulfur was also extracted and measured at trace amounts this was validated by the more sensitive surface scanning eds analysis in which the signal of sulfur was indeed detected in the precipitates fig 5c though its intensity was much weaker than selenium possibly due to the poor settleability findlay et al 2014 the total concentration of sulfur in these four identified products was 2 04 0 10 mm please note that there is two mole sulfur per mole thiosulfate in line with the total decreased sulfide i e 1 86 0 03 mm this good recovery of sulfur mass excluded the possible production of other species such as polysulfide in selenite driven sulfide oxidation among the sulfur based products thiosulfate formation accounted for approximately 90 of the consumed sulfur mass while sulfate only occupied the least portion table 1 previous studies observed that about 60 of the total added sulfide could convert to thiosulfate during the oxygen limiting sulfide auto oxidation at ph of 8 and thiosulfate yield increased with reaction ph elevating janssen et al 1995 obrien and birkner 1977 this might be caused by the

suggesting that efom isolates can be used to determine the efficiency of uv chlorine process in real effluent efom serves as the main precursor of adsorbable organic chlorine in the uv chlorine treatment bioassays indicated that chlorine containing compounds could induce oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and increase the cell dna damage among evaluated treatment conditions the

refractory organic micropollutants e g ppcps and soluble microbial products o connor et al 2019 the presence of efom remarkably impacts the radical chemistry of uv chlorine process by scavenging radical species consuming fc and inducing uv light attenuation via the inner filter effect our recent study observed that efom isolate exerted a much stronger inhibition on the uv chlorine process compared with surface water dom fractions possibly due to its higher abundance in sulfur containing functional groups i e sink of oh cl radicals wang et al 2020 the scavenging effect of efom on clo is even more pronounced thereby significantly reducing degradation kinetics of ppcps dominated by clo oxidation guo et al 2017 formation of chlorinated byproducts e g dbps and the associated toxicity is another important issue of concern efom enriched in nitrogenous moieties serves as a major source of precursors for a wide range of dbps krasner et al 2009 le roux et al 2017 compared to chlorination the uv chlorine process alters the organic matter through synergistic mechanisms of uv photolysis chlorination and reactive radical species cl cl2 can induce the formation of chlorinated byproducts via direct addition to dom efom meanwhile rcs also enhances the yield of high molecular weight nitrogen containing dbps bulman and remucal 2020 increased formation of adsorbable organic halogen aox and cytotoxicity was observed in uv chlorine treatment of dom compared with that of chlorination alone wang et al 2017 therefore it is of great importance to assess the impact of efom on the efficacy and toxicity of uv chlorine process for ppcps removal past studies mainly focused on the occurrence of regulated or known dbps from uv chlorine treatment of a specific contaminant or dom fraction and individual toxicity assay the vast majority of unidentified chlorinated byproducts as indicated by analysis of aox i e a collective parameter of halogenated dbps and their contribution to toxicity remain unclear herein this study aimed to reveal the impact of efom on the radical chemistry and toxicity alteration of uv chlorine process for ppcps removal primidone prm and caffeine caf were selected as the model ppcps due to their wide occurrence in aquatic environment and well elucidated radical mechanisms in uv chlorine process under varying water scenarios which allow the comparison with our study sun et al 2016 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2020 experiments in ultrapure water real wwtp effluent and reconstituted effluent spiked with contaminants were conducted to elucidate the key factors affecting the treatment efficiency adsorbable organic chlorine aocl analysis in conjunction with multiple in vitro bioassays on hepg2 cells were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the

adsorb and isolate the organic matter present in the secondary wastewater effluent after reducing ph to 2 and prefiltering with 0 45 μm accordingly two efom fractions were obtained i e the hydrophobic hpo efom fraction retained by xad 8 resin and transphilic tpi efom fraction adsorbed by the xad 4 resin adsorbed organics were eluted from the xad resins by the acetonitrile water desorption method

discussion 3 1 kinetics of prm and caf degradation in buffered ultrapure water both prm and caf are characterized as resistant to uv irradiation and direct oxidation by fc or h2o2 guo et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 control experiments confirmed their negligible role in prm and caf degradation 7 fig 1 in contrast significant enhancement in contaminant elimination 84 for prm and 99 for caf in 10 min was obtained in the uv chlorine process due to the generation of reactive radical species meanwhile uv irradiation led to approximately 43 of fc consumption in the system the loss of prm by uv chlorine followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s2 however the loss of caf deviated from first order kinetics and accelerated with reaction progress as observed by previous studies sun et al 2016 cheng et al 2018 these differences might be associated with the highly selective characteristic of rcs whose reactivity toward aromatic ppcps strongly depends on the nature of substituents on aromatic ring and the core structures guo et al 2017 the electron donating 1 methylimidazole moiety in caf induced its high reactivity with clo related reactive species which was claimed as the reason for its unique kinetics sun et al 2016 it was reported that clo played a major role rather than oh and cl in degrading caf while contribution of oh to the decay of prm bearing an electron withdrawing amide group was more substantial compared with that of caf guo et al 2017 the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs of prm and caf degradation in the uv chlorine process determined from the first 5 min of reaction were 0 187 and 0 339 min 1 respectively our results are several times higher or comparable compared to those from previous studies guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020 while the difference among the k obs values could be attributed to the use of different experimental setup and conditions table s3 comparison using an equal molar dose of fc or h2o2 under uv exposure showed that uv chlorine exhibited a much higher removal efficacy for both contaminants the k obs values for prm and caf were 3 96 and 7 72 times of those obtained from the uv h2o2 process respectively higher performance of uv chlorine in caf degradation in buffered ultrapure water natural water and wastewater effluent has been reported owing to the formation of high clo content 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of oh in the uv chlorine process and its preferential attack toward caf yang et al 2016 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 our previous study also observed a better removal of prm in the uv chlorine process under similar experimental conditions at ph 7 where rcs species dominated 55 of prm decay kinetics wang et al 2020 conflicting result was obtained for prm decay by guo et al 2018 using a mixture of 28 ppcps at 1 µg l 1 with 2 mm pbs where uv h2o2 demonstrated a better performance this contradiction may be attributed to the different scavenging capacity of pbs exerted on the kinetics of contaminant degradation i e single contaminant of mg l 1 level vs mixture of µg l 1 level with a similar pbs in the uv chlorine process fc serves as the precursor and also major scavenger including cl from the fc stock of oh and cl meanwhile secondary clo and cl2 radicals were produced through the scavenging effect see reactions 38 40 41 65 and 68 in table s1 as fc increased from 10 to 35 μm the modelled steady state contents of oh and cl increased from 3 3 10 14 m to 8 8 10 14 m and from 1 6 10 14 m to 2 4 10 14 m and then maintained at 1 3 10 13 m and 2 6 10 14 m in the fc range of 70 210 μm figure s3 respectively in contrast continuous increase in clo 10 10 10 9 m and cl2 10 15 10 14 m concentration was observed at fc dose of 70 210 μm due to the conversion from oh and cl obviously variation in fc dose remarkably changed the speciation of radical species which in turn induced divergent degradation kinetics of ppcps based on their reactivity toward specific radical species as shown in fig 2 a k obs of prm exhibited a first increase and then reached a plateau similar to those of oh and cl with increasing fc dose while k obs of caf linearly increased by 8 9 fold with the increase of fc from 10 to 210 μm following a similar evolution profile of clo and cl2 increase in initial contaminant concentration resulted in a decrease in k obs as shown in fig 2b likely attributed to the enhanced demand for reactive radicals at higher contaminant concentration however k obs of prm just slightly decreased from 0 187 to 0 109 min 1 with the increase of initial concentration from 2 to 50 μm while k obs of caf exhibited an exponential decline from 1 022 to 0 041 min 1 kinetic modeling showed a decline in steady state concentrations of both oh and rcs figure s4 however clo content was more significantly affected than other radical species and was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing contaminant concentration from 2 to 50 μm consequently the degradation of caf dominated by clo oxidation was remarkably inhibited at higher initial contaminant concentration besides high concentration of caf solution induced a much higher uv absorbance at 254 nm 0 205 at 1 cm for 50 μm caf while it was negligible for prm 0 01 the enhanced inner filter effect at high caf concentration also contributed to its sharp decline in decay rate constants 3 2 elucidation of reactive species during uv chlorine treatment fig 3 depicts the specific k obs of uv light chlorination oh and rcs for prm and caf degradation in the ph range of 6 2 9 based on the loss of nb i e in situ oh probe figure s5 calculation detailed in si text s5 contributions of direct photolysis and chlorination to the decay of prm caf were negligible the uv chlorine treatment demonstrated a considerably higher decay kinetics in caf removal across ph 6 2 9 than that of prm which was rational considering the comparable rate constants of caf with oh but much higher reactivity toward the main rcs species compared to prm rate constants of contaminants with oh and rcs are provided in table s4 both prm and caf exhibited a decreasing trend in k obs with increasing solution ph consistent with previous literature sun et al 2016 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020 given that prm pka of 12 3 and caf pka of 6 1 and 10 4 occurred mainly as one speciation form under the investigated ph range the shift in chlorine speciation from hocl toward clo species with lower quantum yield and higher scavenging effect on oh and cl was the main reason accounting for the decreased efficiency at elevated ph watts and linden 2007 fang et al 2014 meanwhile ph variation exerted a negligible impact on the steady state concentration of clo wu et al 2017 for prm both oh and rcs were importantly involved in the decay process at ph 6 2 and contribution of oh i e 53 was even slightly higher than that of rcs figure s6 however as the ph increased from 6 2 to 9 k oh for prm significantly decreased by 80 whereas k rcs slightly increased from ph 6 2 to 7 and then kept constant at higher ph indicating the predominant role of clo and negligible role of cl in alkaline conditions for caf both k oh and k rcs decreased with increasing ph rcs dominated the degradation of caf across ph 6 2 9 contributing to 72 9 of k obs at ph 6 2 and 86 87 8 at neutral to alkaline conditions figure s6 these results confirmed that the degradation of caf was primarily attributable to rcs and particularly clo oxidation 3 3 effects of anions fig 4 illustrates the impact of cl hco3 and no3 on prm and caf degradation kinetics by the uv chlorine treatment at ph 7 the presence of cl induced a negligible inhibition on the k obs of both ppcps in agreement with sun et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 according to eqs 1 and 2 grebel et al 2010 wu et al 2016 formation of cl2 would be enhanced through the scavenging of cl by cl while oh was not significantly affected with the addition of cl due to the rapid reversible dissociation of hocl back into oh kinetic modeling demonstrates the role of cl where 3 orders of magnitude increase in cl2 concentration 36 53 decrease in cl and insignificant variation in oh and clo were obtained in the presence of 10 mm cl compared with the control given the above variations of main radical species in the system and the rate constants of two ppcps with oh and rcs see table s4 the negligible inhibition on prm caf degradation in the presence of cl was probably due to that the increased contributions of cl2 compensated for the decrease of cl 1 cl cl cl2 kfor 6 5 109 m 1s 1 kres 1 1 105 s 1 2 cl oh hocl kfor 4 3 109 m 1s 1 kres 6 1 109 m 1s 1 the ubiquitous hco3 present in aquatic systems serves as important sink of oh cl and cl2 through eqs 3 5 fang et al 2014 resulting in a decrease of these radical species as well as significant buildup of selective carbonate radical co3 modeling results showed that 10 mm hco3 scavenged approximately 57 oh 89 cl and 99 cl2 while clo remained almost unchanged due to its low reactivity with hco3 table s5 the steady state concentration of co3 was simulated at level of 10 9 m several orders of magnitude higher than those of oh and cl the role of co3 in the degradation of micropollutants is compound specific both prm and caf react with co3 at a low second order rate constants 10 6 m 1s 1 text s6 and figure s7 wu et al 2017 consequently hco3 induced an inhibitory effect on prm and caf degradation in the uv chlorine process as hco3 increased from 0 to 10 mm k obs of prm and caf decreased from 0 186 to 0 113 min 1 from 0 339 to 0 230 min 1 respectively 3 hco3 oh h2o co3 k 8 5 106 m 1s 1 4 hco3 cl h cl co3 k 2 2 108 m 1s 1 5 hco3 cl2 2cl h co3 k 8 0 107 m 1s 1 in contrast to cl and hco3 the presence of no3 promoted the loss of prm and caf this could be explained by the extra generation of oh and reactive nitrogen species rns e g no2 induced by photolysis of no3 mack and bolton 1999 experiments using nb as a oh probe confirmed the increasing contribution of oh to the decay kinetics of both ppcps with the increase of no3 figure s8 in the uv chlorine process the k rcs rns of caf significantly increased with increasing no3 while that of prm kept almost constant degradation of prm and caf in the uv no3 system see figure s8 showed that oh radical dominated the decay of contaminants followed by rns meanwhile k rns of caf increased from 0 07 to 0 11 min 1 with the increase of no3 from 50 to 100 mm while k rns of prm kept constant nevertheless experimental results suggest a negligible enhancement from no3 under common wwtp effluent condition where concentration of no3 is generally below 1 mm 3 4 radical chemistry in simulated efom containing water the degradation of prm and caf by uv chlorine decreased with an increase in efom concentration fig 5 a d both efom isolates inhibited the decay of caf to a substantial higher extent compared with that of prm meanwhile based on the same doc concentration hpo fraction has a stronger impact on the degradation kinetics of both contaminants than tpi fraction the k obs of prm reduced by 65 0 and 31 7 in the presence of 10 mg c l 1 hpo and tpi figure s9 respectively whereas that for caf was 95 7 and 90 1 respectively these experimental results indicate that the radical chemistry in the uv chlorine system varied in the presence of different efom isolates the two efom isolates bearing different physicochemical properties likely account for their different influence the suva values of hpo and tpi were determined as 3 10 and 1 96 l mg 1 m 1 respectively hpo with higher suva is more enriched in aromatic moieties than tpi considered as more hydrophilic in nature with a higher abundance of aliphatic carbon weishaar et al 2003 the good correlations linear for prm and exponential for caf obtained between uv absorbance at 254 nm and k obs for all hpo and tpi solutions fig 6 demonstrate that the larger the presence of aromatic moieties into the solution the stronger the inhibition of the degradation of targeted contaminants by the uv chlorine process fig 6 confirms that the presence of uv absorbing moieties has a stronger effect on caf degradation compared to prm fig 5e compares the impact of the two efom isolates at 5 mg c l 1 on the contribution of k oh and k rcs for prm and caf decay at ph 7 it can be seen that decay of contaminants due to rcs oxidation was significantly inhibited in comparison with the moderate decrease in k oh suggesting that rcs is more vulnerable to efom typically k rcs for caf dropped by 94 5 contributing to approximately 82 5 of the total loss in k obs since the decay of caf is primarily due to clo efom isolates preferentially scavenging clo could be the main reason causing the sharp decline of k rcs for caf the scavenging capacity of dom isolates on clo shows a strong dependency upon suva wang et al 2020 as a result at ph 7 where clo dominated the decay of ppcps hpo fraction induced a higher degree of inhibition on the uv chlorine process the reactivity of dom efom with cl2 was also found to be positively correlated with aromatic carbon content i e suva lei et al 2021 the role of physicochemical properties of efom in the reactivity toward oh and cl is complicated as some nonaromatic moieties e g thiols and sulfonate group of efom in addition to aromatic components exhibit high vulnerability to oh or cl attack westerhoff et al 2007 varanasi et al 2018 no correlation was found between suva and rate constants of dom with cl lei et al 2021 studies on the relationship of suva with oh rate constants of efom i e k oh efom remain inconsistent keen et al 2014 observed some correlation r2 0 75 between suva and k oh efom while westerhoff et al 2007 found no strong statistical relevant trend the presence of 5 mg c l 1 efom resulted in significantly faster consumption of fc in the uv chlorine process as shown in fig 5f the chlorine residual was barely detected in 10 min for hpo and tpi in the uv chlorine process in comparison photolysis of fc without efom only consumed 21 of fc while dark chlorination of the two efom isolates led to less than 46 decay of fc hpo with higher suva exhibits a higher chlorine demand in agreement with previous studies westerhoff et al 2004 wang et al 2020 besides suva of efom causes light absorption during the uv chlorine process the higher the suva the stronger the light attenuation the applied uv fluence was reduced by 21 3 and 14 2 in the presence of 5 0 mg c l 1 hpo and tpi respectively the above effects from efom play additional roles in lowering the steady state concentration of radicals therefore reducing the process efficiency and driving the different impact of efom with diverse properties 3 5 degradation in real and reconstituted wwtp effluent the degradation of prm and caf in real wwtp effluent and in reconstituted effluent by adding the major matrix components i e hpo and tpi efom isolates added in representative relative abundance cl hco3 and no3 based on the real wastewater effluent quality see table s6 was investigated preliminary experiments demonstrated an insignificant role of uv induced photolysis of prm and caf in wwtp effluent figure s10 as illustrated in fig 7 a and 7b the degradation of prm and caf was retarded when uv chlorine was applied to wwtp effluent showing a strong scavenging effect from the wastewater matrix compared to the control k obs of prm was reduced by 43 3 specifically the decay kinetics of caf was almost completely suppressed 90 in wwtp effluent additionally the relatively high efom content 6 07 mg c l 1 in wwtp effluent led to a rapid depletion 95 of 70 μm fc in 4 min figure s11 through the synergistic effects of directly reacting with fc and accelerating its photolysis as a result a rapid decay of prm in the first 4 min followed by a retardation decay stage was observed increasing fc dose can progressively offset the inhibitory effect by providing more chlorine residual figure s11 and s12 the removals obtained at chlorine dose of 210 μm for prm and caf were 79 4 and 75 0 respectively while they were 40 4 and 14 2 at 70 μm fc contributions of k oh and k rcs to prm caf decay both increased with the increase of fc dose fig 7c results obtained with reconstituted effluent are comparable to the ones obtained with real wwtp effluent suggesting that the major influencing factors inhibiting the ppcps removal were taken into account it is important to note that the reconstituted effluent was prepared by adding similar quantities of hpo and tpi same amounts of hpo and tpi were isolated from wwtp effluent to obtain the same uv254 absorbance as the real wwtp effluent i e 0 133 1 cm the strong inhibitory effect of the water matrix could be mainly attributed to the relatively high efom content doc 6 mg l 1 and alkalinity 3 6 mm as organics and hco3 both adversely lower the process efficiency the results obtained with the two waters fit well to the correlation between k obs and uv absorbance at 254 nm established in fig 6 this observation provides evidence that the presence of organic matter and more specifically uv absorbing organic moieties is likely the predominant factor affecting the uv chlorine process in this wwtp effluent these findings demonstrate that efom isolates can be used to determine the efficiency of the uv chlorine process in real effluent nevertheless we speculate that using hpo and tpi efom isolates which represent around 50 of the doc and more than 80 of uv absorbance to simulate the whole doc in real effluent may slightly magnify the reactive efom fraction as the xad resin protocol cannot effectively extract the hydrophilic or very polar nonaromatic organics which generally have less reactivity toward free chlorine and radicals compared with wwtp effluent decay of prm and caf was obviously enhanced in tap water leading to 66 0 and 75 6 of removal respectively it can be concluded that in waters with low levels of impurities after removing doc and alkalinity or even in complex wastewater effluent with sufficient chlorine residual supply uv chlorine is a promising alternative for ppcps elimination 3 6 toxicity assessment previous studies have drawn inconsistent findings on the association between aox concentration and toxicity chlorinated byproducts were reported to correlate with the variation in the toxicity during uv chlorine and chlorination treatment of trimethoprim wu et al 2016 the evolution of chlorine containing intermediates showed no relationship with toxicity changes in the degradation of gemfibrozil by uv chlorine kong et al 2018 wang et al 2017 found that cytotoxicity positively correlated with aox formation based on the comparison between uv chlorine and chlorination treatment of natural organic matter but weakly related to aox concentrations by comparing among different reaction times in our study attempt was also made to evaluate the aocl formation in the context of potential toxicity fig 8 presents the formation of aocl after 10 min of uv chlorine treatment significant formation of aocl was observed in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 efom isolate i e 7 51 and 5 94 μm from hpo and tpi respectively the addition of 5 μm contaminant induced negligible impact on the yield of aocl high resolution lc ms and gc ms analyses of the spe extracts did not provide any evidence of the presence of chlorinated by products for both prm and caf under the applied experimental conditions lists of identified transformation intermediates are provided in table s7 and s8 it should be noted that the applied analytical methods were not appropriate to analyze low molecular weight chlorinated by products that could account for the produced aocl considering the production of intermediates and chlorinated by products in the presence of efom isolate evaluation of the risk caused by the uv chlorine process is of great significance therefore different toxic effects of treated samples on hepg2 cells were investigated as shown in fig 9 a compared to experimental control pbs a significant increase in the cellular oxidative stress was observed for most experiments containing hpo the untreated hpo showed a 4 1 0 4 fold increase in ros signal over the negative control p 0 0001 which was much higher than the tpi fraction higher toxicity of hpo efom than tpi was also reported le roux et al 2017 both uv cl2 hpo prm 1 9 0 2 p 0 005 and uv cl2 hpo caf 2 97 0 6 p 0 0001 extracts showed a significantly increased ros production fold change for uv cl2 hpo was not statistically significant the induction of oxidative stress response pathway is an indicator of the presence of chemical and non chemical stresses in cells and for water samples it is believed that most oxidative stress response comes from unknown chemicals escher et al 2013 many dpbs have been implicated with the increase in adaptive stress responses following water disinfection toxicity is also highly dependent on treatment technique and disinfection mechanism lundqvist et al 2019 in our study uv chlorine treatment of the contaminants did not significantly alter the oxidative stress on the other hand the presence of prm and caf seems to hinder the reduction of hpo cellular ros production we believe that these compounds are consuming a significant part of the radicals produced which will not react with the ppcps or other unknown chemicals initially present in the hpo or tpi isolate the targeted 11 ppcps not necessarily considered as responsible for the toxicity of efom isolates were present in the untreated efom isolates and the uv chlorine treatment of efom isolate generally degrade these ppcps to a certain extent table s9 as an early and sensitive indicator ros plays critical roles in cell survival apoptosis and death franklin 2011 previous studies showed that the gene expression pathways of monohaloacetic acids treated cells would be modulated through the generation of ros causing dna damage atp depletion and mitochondrial stress dad et al 2013 oxidative stress is one of the main causes of genotoxic insults together with exposure to uv irradiation and chemicals induction of ph2ax a sensitive molecular marker of dna damage and repair mei et al 2015 is associated with double strand breaks dsbs and is among the most serious forms of dna damage that can lead to cellular death chromosomal aberrations mutations and cancer mah et al 2010 while exposure to hpo and tpi had no significant effect on cell dna damage as measured by ph2ax induction treatments with uv cl2 hpo fold change 2 2 0 5 p 0 0003 uv cl2 hpo prm fold change 3 0 0 7 p 0 0001 uv cl2 hpo caf fold change 4 1 0 8 p 0 0001 and uv cl2 tpi caf fold change 1 9 0 4 p 0 0081 all showed a significant fold change for ph2ax induction fig 9b similar effects were also observed for chlorination only samples with an increased role of hpo over tpi a ph2ax induction of cl2 hpo sample fold change of 2 2 0 3 versus cl2 tpi sample fold change of 1 7 0 5 and a ros induction of 2 1 0 3 versus 0 9 0 2 respectively data not shown in graph while oxidative stress results for uv treated samples showed similar patterns as those for ph2ax induction assay the lack of dna damage for hpo only sample suggests that cellular ros and oxidative stress are not the only factors responsible for the increase in ph2ax induction the induction of genotoxic effects by different mechanisms was demonstrated by different studies on drinking water treatment processes lundqvist et al 2019 and strands breaks have been shown to be caused by halogenated dbps such as trihalomethanes geter et al 2004 to confirm the induction of oxidative stress caused by the tested samples mitochondrial function assays were employed ros levels and mitochondrial function are closely related exogenous stimuli can induce mitochondrial ros production and oxidative stress causes the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in an increase in ros in a positive feedback loop ros induced ros release zorov et al 2000 hpo only uv cl2 hpo prm and uv cl2 hpo caf extracts have a generalized effect of mitochondrial dysfunction affecting different stages of the electron transport chain and reducing basal respiration maximal respiration and atp production levels fig 9c and figures s13 this effect is consistent with previously observed effects from induced oxidative stress zorov et al 2006 and different studies showed similarly related mitochondrial dependent toxicity through oxidative stress for different dbps zuo et al 2017 as a sum parameter of overall toxicity cytotoxicity serves as the overarching effect overlying each of the cellular toxicity pathways escher et al 2014 no significant cytotoxicity was observed at the concentration 20x used for oxidative stress mitochondrial function and dna damage assays general cell cytotoxicity was observed at higher exposure concentration 40x for uv cl2 hpo prm and uv cl2 hpo caf samples fig 9d possibly due to the increased dna damage mitochondrial and oxidative stress taken together the observations demonstrate that chlorinated byproducts could induce oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and increase dna damage the nature of efom present seems to be the predominant factor affecting toxicity and the presence of different model compounds such as prm and caf shows that the uv chlorine treatment can have preferential targets that also impact in the overall toxic effects although aocl results are consistent for all isolate samples the composition of aocl fraction can have a great impact on cellular toxicity du et al 2020 the mechanism of action observed in our study involving cytotoxicity oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and dna damage are also comparable to previous studies wang et al 2018 4 conclusion the uv chlorine process was efficient for degrading uv and chlorine resistant ppcps due to the generation of radical species the decay of prm and caf was maximized at ph 6 2 and decreased with increasing solution ph both oh and rcs dominated the decay of prm at acidic ph while contribution of rcs became more important at alkaline condition the loss of caf was mainly attributed to clo the variation of chlorine dose and initial concentration of contaminant significantly altered the content of clo thereby leading to a more pronounced influence on the decay of caf the k obs for prm and caf degradation was not apparently impacted by cl ions but suppressed with the increase of hco3 concentration while no3 enhanced the process efficiency through the extra generation of oh and rns degradation of prm and caf by uv chlorine decreased with an increase in efom concentration the hpo fraction with higher suva has a stronger impact than the tpi fraction the presence of efom has a stronger inhibition on caf degradation compared to that of prm by preferentially scavenging clo good correlations linear for prm and exponential for caf were obtained between k obs of contaminants and uv absorbance at 254 nm of all efom solutions including the real effluent and reconstituted effluent suggesting that the uv absorbing organic moieties in efom is likely the predominant factor affecting the uv chlorine process in wwtp effluent the presence of efom isolate serves as important precursor of aocl during uv chlorine treatment which induced significant effect on cellular dna damage a remarkable increase in intracellular oxidative stress was observed for most experiments containing hpo while uv chlorine treatment did not induce a significant increase in oxidative stress in our study suggesting the nature of efom has a significant impact on the cytotoxicity appendix a supplementary information the supplementary information is found in a separate microsoft word document supplementary information

16648,the uv chlorine process as a potential tertiary municipal wastewater treatment alternative for removing refractory ppcps has been widely investigated however the role of effluent organic matter efom on the radical chemistry and toxicity alteration is unclear the elimination of two model ppcps primidone prm and caffeine caf by the co exposure of uv and free chlorine was investigated to elucidate the impact of efom experimental results indicated that both oh and reactive chlorine species rcs were importantly involved in the decay of prm at acidic condition while clo played dominant role at alkaline ph the decay of caf was dominated by clo under all conditions chlorine dose initial contaminant concentration solution ph and water matrix affect the process efficiency at varying degree resulting from their specific effect on the radical speciation in the system presence of efom isolate remarkably inhibited the decay of prm and caf by preferentially scavenging rcs and particularly clo good correlations linear for prm and exponential for caf between uv absorbance at 254 nm and the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs for all efom solutions were obtained demonstrating the importance of aromatic moieties in inhibiting the degradation of targeted contaminants by uv chlorine process degradation of prm caf in reconstituted effluent spiked with the major effluent constituents i e efom isolates cl hco3 and no3 was comparable to the results obtained with the real wwtp effluent and fit well to the correlation between k obs and uv absorbance at 254 nm suggesting that efom isolates can be used to determine the efficiency of uv chlorine process in real effluent efom serves as the main precursor of adsorbable organic chlorine in the uv chlorine treatment bioassays indicated that chlorine containing compounds could induce oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and increase the cell dna damage among evaluated treatment conditions the nature of efom hydrophobic versus transphilic fraction is likely the predominant factor affecting the cytotoxicity meanwhile the uv chlorine treatment can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of efom isolates however adding high level of selected contaminants e g prm and caf can inhibit this phenomenon due to the competition with reactive radicals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords effluent organic matter primidone caffeine reactive chlorine species adsorbable organic chlorine 1 introduction the increasing occurrence of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in environmental matrix has raised great public concerns these complex compounds are frequently detected at ng l 1 to μg l 1 concentration levels in varied aquatic environments yang et al 2017 the presence of ppcps induces potential threat to aquatic organisms and human health hamid et al 2021 many ppcps cannot be effectively eliminated by conventional wastewater treatment processes leading to their continuous discharge into the environment yang et al 2017 it is of great importance to develop and incorporate advanced techniques to efficiently remove ppcps from wwtp effluent before their discharge recently the uv chlorine process has emerged as a promising alternative for ppcp removal uv irradiation of free chlorine fc hocl ocl can generate non selective hydroxyl radical oh and selective reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 and clo leading to the elimination of ppcps resistant to both uv photolysis and chlorination guo et al 2017 compared to h2o2 and persulfate chlorine species have relative higher molar absorbance coefficients i e hclo 59 m 1 cm 1 clo 66 m 1 cm 1 and higher quantum yields 1 0 m e 1 s 1 at uv254 wavelength feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 leading to a higher radical production particularly the simultaneous generation of diverse and more or less selective radical species with high redox potentials e0 1 8 2 7 2 4 and 2 0 v for oh cl and cl2 respectively buxton et al 1988 beitz et al 1998 provides the uv chlorine process complementary reactivities toward a broad spectrum of molecular structures cl preferentially reacts with organic compounds bearing electron rich moieties at comparable or higher reaction rate constants compared to oh while cl2 exhibits considerable reactivity toward olefinic compounds and molecules containing phenol alkoxy benzene and aniline groups lei et al 2019 additionally recent studies have demonstrated the predominant role of clo 1 5 1 8 v in degrading specific ppcps such as trimethoprim carbamazepine and caffeine with high rate constants ranging from 108 to 1010 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2018 however effluent organic matter efom contained in wwtp effluent is of significant concern for the application of uv chlorine process in practical conditions efom is a major component of effluent matrix and occurs at concentration mg l 1 several orders of magnitude higher than that of micropollutants ng l 1 crittenden et al 2005 efom is generally recognized as a heterogenous mixture of non biodegradable dissolved organic matter dom derived from drinking water trace levels of refractory organic micropollutants e g ppcps and soluble microbial products o connor et al 2019 the presence of efom remarkably impacts the radical chemistry of uv chlorine process by scavenging radical species consuming fc and inducing uv light attenuation via the inner filter effect our recent study observed that efom isolate exerted a much stronger inhibition on the uv chlorine process compared with surface water dom fractions possibly due to its higher abundance in sulfur containing functional groups i e sink of oh cl radicals wang et al 2020 the scavenging effect of efom on clo is even more pronounced thereby significantly reducing degradation kinetics of ppcps dominated by clo oxidation guo et al 2017 formation of chlorinated byproducts e g dbps and the associated toxicity is another important issue of concern efom enriched in nitrogenous moieties serves as a major source of precursors for a wide range of dbps krasner et al 2009 le roux et al 2017 compared to chlorination the uv chlorine process alters the organic matter through synergistic mechanisms of uv photolysis chlorination and reactive radical species cl cl2 can induce the formation of chlorinated byproducts via direct addition to dom efom meanwhile rcs also enhances the yield of high molecular weight nitrogen containing dbps bulman and remucal 2020 increased formation of adsorbable organic halogen aox and cytotoxicity was observed in uv chlorine treatment of dom compared with that of chlorination alone wang et al 2017 therefore it is of great importance to assess the impact of efom on the efficacy and toxicity of uv chlorine process for ppcps removal past studies mainly focused on the occurrence of regulated or known dbps from uv chlorine treatment of a specific contaminant or dom fraction and individual toxicity assay the vast majority of unidentified chlorinated byproducts as indicated by analysis of aox i e a collective parameter of halogenated dbps and their contribution to toxicity remain unclear herein this study aimed to reveal the impact of efom on the radical chemistry and toxicity alteration of uv chlorine process for ppcps removal primidone prm and caffeine caf were selected as the model ppcps due to their wide occurrence in aquatic environment and well elucidated radical mechanisms in uv chlorine process under varying water scenarios which allow the comparison with our study sun et al 2016 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2020 experiments in ultrapure water real wwtp effluent and reconstituted effluent spiked with contaminants were conducted to elucidate the key factors affecting the treatment efficiency adsorbable organic chlorine aocl analysis in conjunction with multiple in vitro bioassays on hepg2 cells were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the

adsorb and isolate the organic matter present in the secondary wastewater effluent after reducing ph to 2 and prefiltering with 0 45 μm accordingly two efom fractions were obtained i e the hydrophobic hpo efom fraction retained by xad 8 resin and transphilic tpi efom fraction adsorbed by the xad 4 resin adsorbed organics were eluted from the xad resins by the acetonitrile water desorption method

discussion 3 1 kinetics of prm and caf degradation in buffered ultrapure water both prm and caf are characterized as resistant to uv irradiation and direct oxidation by fc or h2o2 guo et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 control experiments confirmed their negligible role in prm and caf degradation 7 fig 1 in contrast significant enhancement in contaminant elimination 84 for prm and 99 for caf in 10 min was obtained in the uv chlorine process due to the generation of reactive radical species meanwhile uv irradiation led to approximately 43 of fc consumption in the system the loss of prm by uv chlorine followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s2 however the loss of caf deviated from first order kinetics and accelerated with reaction progress as observed by previous studies sun et al 2016 cheng et al 2018 these differences might be associated with the highly selective characteristic of rcs whose reactivity toward aromatic ppcps strongly depends on the nature of substituents on aromatic ring and the core structures guo et al 2017 the electron donating 1 methylimidazole moiety in caf induced its high reactivity with clo related reactive species which was claimed as the reason for its unique kinetics sun et al 2016 it was reported that clo played a major role rather than oh and cl in degrading caf while contribution of oh to the decay of prm bearing an electron withdrawing amide group was more substantial compared with that of caf guo et al 2017 the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs of prm and caf degradation in the uv chlorine process determined from the first 5 min of reaction were 0 187 and 0 339 min 1 respectively our results are several times higher or comparable compared to those from previous studies guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020 while the difference among the k obs values could be attributed to the use of different experimental setup and conditions table s3 comparison using an equal molar dose of fc or h2o2 under uv exposure showed that uv chlorine exhibited a much higher removal efficacy for both contaminants the k obs values for prm and caf were 3 96 and 7 72 times of those obtained from the uv h2o2 process respectively higher performance of uv chlorine in caf degradation in buffered ultrapure water natural water and wastewater effluent has been reported owing to the formation of high clo content 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of oh in the uv chlorine process and its preferential attack toward caf yang et al 2016 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 our previous study also observed a better removal of prm in the uv chlorine process under similar experimental conditions at ph 7 where rcs species dominated 55 of prm decay kinetics wang et al 2020 conflicting result was obtained for prm decay by guo et al 2018 using a mixture of 28 ppcps at 1 µg l 1 with 2 mm pbs where uv h2o2 demonstrated a better performance this contradiction may be attributed to the different scavenging capacity of pbs exerted on the kinetics of contaminant degradation i e single contaminant of mg l 1 level vs mixture of µg l 1 level with a similar pbs in the uv chlorine process fc serves as the precursor and also major scavenger including cl from the fc stock of oh and cl meanwhile secondary clo and cl2 radicals were produced through the scavenging effect see reactions 38 40 41 65 and 68 in table s1 as fc increased from 10 to 35 μm the modelled steady state contents of oh and cl increased from 3 3 10 14 m to 8 8 10 14 m and from 1 6 10 14 m to 2 4 10 14 m and then maintained at 1 3 10 13 m and 2 6 10 14 m in the fc range of 70 210 μm figure s3 respectively in contrast continuous increase in clo 10 10 10 9 m and cl2 10 15 10 14 m concentration was observed at fc dose of 70 210 μm due to the conversion from oh and cl obviously variation in fc dose remarkably changed the speciation of radical species which in turn induced divergent degradation kinetics of ppcps based on their reactivity toward specific radical species as shown in fig 2 a k obs of prm exhibited a first increase and then reached a plateau similar to those of oh and cl with increasing fc dose while k obs of caf linearly increased by 8 9 fold with the increase of fc from 10 to 210 μm following a similar evolution profile of clo and cl2 increase in initial contaminant concentration resulted in a decrease in k obs as shown in fig 2b likely attributed to the enhanced demand for reactive radicals at higher contaminant concentration however k obs of prm just slightly decreased from 0 187 to 0 109 min 1 with the increase of initial concentration from 2 to 50 μm while k obs of caf exhibited an exponential decline from 1 022 to 0 041 min 1 kinetic modeling showed a decline in steady state concentrations of both oh and rcs figure s4 however clo content was more significantly affected than other radical species and was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing contaminant concentration from 2 to 50 μm consequently the degradation of caf dominated by clo oxidation was remarkably inhibited at higher initial contaminant concentration besides high concentration of caf solution induced a much higher uv absorbance at 254 nm 0 205 at 1 cm for 50 μm caf while it was negligible for prm 0 01 the enhanced inner filter effect at high caf concentration also contributed to its sharp decline in decay rate constants 3 2 elucidation of reactive species during uv chlorine treatment fig 3 depicts the specific k obs of uv light chlorination oh and rcs for prm and caf degradation in the ph range of 6 2 9 based on the loss of nb i e in situ oh probe figure s5 calculation detailed in si text s5 contributions of direct photolysis and chlorination to the decay of prm caf were negligible the uv chlorine treatment demonstrated a considerably higher decay kinetics in caf removal across ph 6 2 9 than that of prm which was rational considering the comparable rate constants of caf with oh but much higher reactivity toward the main rcs species compared to prm rate constants of contaminants with oh and rcs are provided in table s4 both prm and caf exhibited a decreasing trend in k obs with increasing solution ph consistent with previous literature sun et al 2016 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020 given that prm pka of 12 3 and caf pka of 6 1 and 10 4 occurred mainly as one speciation form under the investigated ph range the shift in chlorine speciation from hocl toward clo species with lower quantum yield and higher scavenging effect on oh and cl was the main reason accounting for the decreased efficiency at elevated ph watts and linden 2007 fang et al 2014 meanwhile ph variation exerted a negligible impact on the steady state concentration of clo wu et al 2017 for prm both oh and rcs were importantly involved in the decay process at ph 6 2 and contribution of oh i e 53 was even slightly higher than that of rcs figure s6 however as the ph increased from 6 2 to 9 k oh for prm significantly decreased by 80 whereas k rcs slightly increased from ph 6 2 to 7 and then kept constant at higher ph indicating the predominant role of clo and negligible role of cl in alkaline conditions for caf both k oh and k rcs decreased with increasing ph rcs dominated the degradation of caf across ph 6 2 9 contributing to 72 9 of k obs at ph 6 2 and 86 87 8 at neutral to alkaline conditions figure s6 these results confirmed that the degradation of caf was primarily attributable to rcs and particularly clo oxidation 3 3 effects of anions fig 4 illustrates the impact of cl hco3 and no3 on prm and caf degradation kinetics by the uv chlorine treatment at ph 7 the presence of cl induced a negligible inhibition on the k obs of both ppcps in agreement with sun et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 according to eqs 1 and 2 grebel et al 2010 wu et al 2016 formation of cl2 would be enhanced through the scavenging of cl by cl while oh was not significantly affected with the addition of cl due to the rapid reversible dissociation of hocl back into oh kinetic modeling demonstrates the role of cl where 3 orders of magnitude increase in cl2 concentration 36 53 decrease in cl and insignificant variation in oh and clo were obtained in the presence of 10 mm cl compared with the control given the above variations of main radical species in the system and the rate constants of two ppcps with oh and rcs see table s4 the negligible inhibition on prm caf degradation in the presence of cl was probably due to that the increased contributions of cl2 compensated for the decrease of cl 1 cl cl cl2 kfor 6 5 109 m 1s 1 kres 1 1 105 s 1 2 cl oh hocl kfor 4 3 109 m 1s 1 kres 6 1 109 m 1s 1 the ubiquitous hco3 present in aquatic systems serves as important sink of oh cl and cl2 through eqs 3 5 fang et al 2014 resulting in a decrease of these radical species as well as significant buildup of selective carbonate radical co3 modeling results showed that 10 mm hco3 scavenged approximately 57 oh 89 cl and 99 cl2 while clo remained almost unchanged due to its low reactivity with hco3 table s5 the steady state concentration of co3 was simulated at level of 10 9 m several orders of magnitude higher than those of oh and cl the role of co3 in the degradation of micropollutants is compound specific both prm and caf react with co3 at a low second order rate constants 10 6 m 1s 1 text s6 and figure s7 wu et al 2017 consequently hco3 induced an inhibitory effect on prm and caf degradation in the uv chlorine process as hco3 increased from 0 to 10 mm k obs of prm and caf decreased from 0 186 to 0 113 min 1 from 0 339 to 0 230 min 1 respectively 3 hco3 oh h2o co3 k 8 5 106 m 1s 1 4 hco3 cl h cl co3 k 2 2 108 m 1s 1 5 hco3 cl2 2cl h co3 k 8 0 107 m 1s 1 in contrast to cl and hco3 the presence of no3 promoted the loss of prm and caf this could be explained by the extra generation of oh and reactive nitrogen species rns e g no2 induced by photolysis of no3 mack and bolton 1999 experiments using nb as a oh probe confirmed the increasing contribution of oh to the decay kinetics of both ppcps with the increase of no3 figure s8 in the uv chlorine process the k rcs rns of caf significantly increased with increasing no3 while that of prm kept almost constant degradation of prm and caf in the uv no3 system see figure s8 showed that oh radical dominated the decay of contaminants followed by rns meanwhile k rns of caf increased from 0 07 to 0 11 min 1 with the increase of no3 from 50 to 100 mm while k rns of prm kept constant nevertheless experimental results suggest a negligible enhancement from no3 under common wwtp effluent condition where concentration of no3 is generally below 1 mm 3 4 radical chemistry in simulated efom containing water the degradation of prm and caf by uv chlorine decreased with an increase in efom concentration fig 5 a d both efom isolates inhibited the decay of caf to a substantial higher extent compared with that of prm meanwhile based on the same doc concentration hpo fraction has a stronger impact on the degradation kinetics of both contaminants than tpi fraction the k obs of prm reduced by 65 0 and 31 7 in the presence of 10 mg c l 1 hpo and tpi figure s9 respectively whereas that for caf was 95 7 and 90 1 respectively these experimental results indicate that the radical chemistry in the uv chlorine system varied in the presence of different efom isolates the two efom isolates bearing different physicochemical properties likely account for their different influence the suva values of hpo and tpi were determined as 3 10 and 1 96 l mg 1 m 1 respectively hpo with higher suva is more enriched in aromatic moieties than tpi considered as more hydrophilic in nature with a higher abundance of aliphatic carbon weishaar et al 2003 the good correlations linear for prm and exponential for caf obtained between uv absorbance at 254 nm and k obs for all hpo and tpi solutions fig 6 demonstrate that the larger the presence of aromatic moieties into the solution the stronger the inhibition of the degradation of targeted contaminants by the uv chlorine process fig 6 confirms that the presence of uv absorbing moieties has a stronger effect on caf degradation compared to prm fig 5e compares the impact of the two efom isolates at 5 mg c l 1 on the contribution of k oh and k rcs for prm and caf decay at ph 7 it can be seen that decay of contaminants due to rcs oxidation was significantly inhibited in comparison with the moderate decrease in k oh suggesting that rcs is more vulnerable to efom typically k rcs for caf dropped by 94 5 contributing to approximately 82 5 of the total loss in k obs since the decay of caf is primarily due to clo efom isolates preferentially scavenging clo could be the main reason causing the sharp decline of k rcs for caf the scavenging capacity of dom isolates on clo shows a strong dependency upon suva wang et al 2020 as a result at ph 7 where clo dominated the decay of ppcps hpo fraction induced a higher degree of inhibition on the uv chlorine process the reactivity of dom efom with cl2 was also found to be positively correlated with aromatic carbon content i e suva lei et al 2021 the role of physicochemical properties of efom in the reactivity toward oh and cl is complicated as some nonaromatic moieties e g thiols and sulfonate group of efom in addition to aromatic components exhibit high vulnerability to oh or cl attack westerhoff et al 2007 varanasi et al 2018 no correlation was found between suva and rate constants of dom with cl lei et al 2021 studies on the relationship of suva with oh rate constants of efom i e k oh efom remain inconsistent keen et al 2014 observed some correlation r2 0 75 between suva and k oh efom while westerhoff et al 2007 found no strong statistical relevant trend the presence of 5 mg c l 1 efom resulted in significantly faster consumption of fc in the uv chlorine process as shown in fig 5f the chlorine residual was barely detected in 10 min for hpo and tpi in the uv chlorine process in comparison photolysis of fc without efom only consumed 21 of fc while dark chlorination of the two efom isolates led to less than 46 decay of fc hpo with higher suva exhibits a higher chlorine demand in agreement with previous studies westerhoff et al 2004 wang et al 2020 besides suva of efom causes light absorption during the uv chlorine process the higher the suva the stronger the light attenuation the applied uv fluence was reduced by 21 3 and 14 2 in the presence of 5 0 mg c l 1 hpo and tpi respectively the above effects from efom play additional roles in lowering the steady state concentration of radicals therefore reducing the process efficiency and driving the different impact of efom with diverse properties 3 5 degradation in real and reconstituted wwtp effluent the degradation of prm and caf in real wwtp effluent and in reconstituted effluent by adding the major matrix components i e hpo and tpi efom isolates added in representative relative abundance cl hco3 and no3 based on the real wastewater effluent quality see table s6 was investigated preliminary experiments demonstrated an insignificant role of uv induced photolysis of prm and caf in wwtp effluent figure s10 as illustrated in fig 7 a and 7b the degradation of prm and caf was retarded when uv chlorine was applied to wwtp effluent showing a strong scavenging effect from the wastewater matrix compared to the control k obs of prm was reduced by 43 3 specifically the decay kinetics of caf was almost completely suppressed 90 in wwtp effluent additionally the relatively high efom content 6 07 mg c l 1 in wwtp effluent led to a rapid depletion 95 of 70 μm fc in 4 min figure s11 through the synergistic effects of directly reacting with fc and accelerating its photolysis as a result a rapid decay of prm in the first 4 min followed by a retardation decay stage was observed increasing fc dose can progressively offset the inhibitory effect by providing more chlorine residual figure s11 and s12 the removals obtained at chlorine dose of 210 μm for prm and caf were 79 4 and 75 0 respectively while they were 40 4 and 14 2 at 70 μm fc contributions of k oh and k rcs to prm caf decay both increased with the increase of fc dose fig 7c results obtained with reconstituted effluent are comparable to the ones obtained with real wwtp effluent suggesting that the major influencing factors inhibiting the ppcps removal were taken into account it is important to note that the reconstituted effluent was prepared by adding similar quantities of hpo and tpi same amounts of hpo and tpi were isolated from wwtp effluent to obtain the same uv254 absorbance as the real wwtp effluent i e 0 133 1 cm the strong inhibitory effect of the water matrix could be mainly attributed to the relatively high efom content doc 6 mg l 1 and alkalinity 3 6 mm as organics and hco3 both adversely lower the process efficiency the results obtained with the two waters fit well to the correlation between k obs and uv absorbance at 254 nm established in fig 6 this observation provides evidence that the presence of organic matter and more specifically uv absorbing organic moieties is likely the predominant factor affecting the uv chlorine process in this wwtp effluent these findings demonstrate that efom isolates can be used to determine the efficiency of the uv chlorine process in real effluent nevertheless we speculate that using hpo and tpi efom isolates which represent around 50 of the doc and more than 80 of uv absorbance to simulate the whole doc in real effluent may slightly magnify the reactive efom fraction as the xad resin protocol cannot effectively extract the hydrophilic or very polar nonaromatic organics which generally have less reactivity toward free chlorine and radicals compared with wwtp effluent decay of prm and caf was obviously enhanced in tap water leading to 66 0 and 75 6 of removal respectively it can be concluded that in waters with low levels of impurities after removing doc and alkalinity or even in complex wastewater effluent with sufficient chlorine residual supply uv chlorine is a promising alternative for ppcps elimination 3 6 toxicity assessment previous studies have drawn inconsistent findings on the association between aox concentration and toxicity chlorinated byproducts were reported to correlate with the variation in the toxicity during uv chlorine and chlorination treatment of trimethoprim wu et al 2016 the evolution of chlorine containing intermediates showed no relationship with toxicity changes in the degradation of gemfibrozil by uv chlorine kong et al 2018 wang et al 2017 found that cytotoxicity positively correlated with aox formation based on the comparison between uv chlorine and chlorination treatment of natural organic matter but weakly related to aox concentrations by comparing among different reaction times in our study attempt was also made to evaluate the aocl formation in the context of potential toxicity fig 8 presents the formation of aocl after 10 min of uv chlorine treatment significant formation of aocl was observed in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 efom isolate i e 7 51 and 5 94 μm from hpo and tpi respectively the addition of 5 μm contaminant induced negligible impact on the yield of aocl high resolution lc ms and gc ms analyses of the spe extracts did not provide any evidence of the presence of chlorinated by products for both prm and caf under the applied experimental conditions lists of identified transformation intermediates are provided in table s7 and s8 it should be noted that the applied analytical methods were not appropriate to analyze low molecular weight chlorinated by products that could account for the produced aocl considering the production of intermediates and chlorinated by products in the presence of efom isolate evaluation of the risk caused by the uv chlorine process is of great significance therefore different toxic effects of treated samples on hepg2 cells were investigated as shown in fig 9 a compared to experimental control pbs a significant increase in the cellular oxidative stress was observed for most experiments containing hpo the untreated hpo showed a 4 1 0 4 fold increase in ros signal over the negative control p 0 0001 which was much higher than the tpi fraction higher toxicity of hpo efom than tpi was also reported le roux et al 2017 both uv cl2 hpo prm 1 9 0 2 p 0 005 and uv cl2 hpo caf 2 97 0 6 p 0 0001 extracts showed a significantly increased ros production fold change for uv cl2 hpo was not statistically significant the induction of oxidative stress response pathway is an indicator of the presence of chemical and non chemical stresses in cells and for water samples it is believed that most oxidative stress response comes from unknown chemicals escher et al 2013 many dpbs have been implicated with the increase in adaptive stress responses following water disinfection toxicity is also highly dependent on treatment technique and disinfection mechanism lundqvist et al 2019 in our study uv chlorine treatment of the contaminants did not significantly alter the oxidative stress on the other hand the presence of prm and caf seems to hinder the reduction of hpo cellular ros production we believe that these compounds are consuming a significant part of the radicals produced which will not react with the ppcps or other unknown chemicals initially present in the hpo or tpi isolate the targeted 11 ppcps not necessarily considered as responsible for the toxicity of efom isolates were present in the untreated efom isolates and the uv chlorine treatment of efom isolate generally degrade these ppcps to a certain extent table s9 as an early and sensitive indicator ros plays critical roles in cell survival apoptosis and death franklin 2011 previous studies showed that the gene expression pathways of monohaloacetic acids treated cells would be modulated through the generation of ros causing dna damage atp depletion and mitochondrial stress dad et al 2013 oxidative stress is one of the main causes of genotoxic insults together with exposure to uv irradiation and chemicals induction of ph2ax a sensitive molecular marker of dna damage and repair mei et al 2015 is associated with double strand breaks dsbs and is among the most serious forms of dna damage that can lead to cellular death chromosomal aberrations mutations and cancer mah et al 2010 while exposure to hpo and tpi had no significant effect on cell dna damage as measured by ph2ax induction treatments with uv cl2 hpo fold change 2 2 0 5 p 0 0003 uv cl2 hpo prm fold change 3 0 0 7 p 0 0001 uv cl2 hpo caf fold change 4 1 0 8 p 0 0001 and uv cl2 tpi caf fold change 1 9 0 4 p 0 0081 all showed a significant fold change for ph2ax induction fig 9b similar effects were also observed for chlorination only samples with an increased role of hpo over tpi a ph2ax induction of cl2 hpo sample fold change of 2 2 0 3 versus cl2 tpi sample fold change of 1 7 0 5 and a ros induction of 2 1 0 3 versus 0 9 0 2 respectively data not shown in graph while oxidative stress results for uv treated samples showed similar patterns as those for ph2ax induction assay the lack of dna damage for hpo only sample suggests that cellular ros and oxidative stress are not the only factors responsible for the increase in ph2ax induction the induction of genotoxic effects by different mechanisms was demonstrated by different studies on drinking water treatment processes lundqvist et al 2019 and strands breaks have been shown to be caused by halogenated dbps such as trihalomethanes geter et al 2004 to confirm the induction of oxidative stress caused by the tested samples mitochondrial function assays were employed ros levels and mitochondrial function are closely related exogenous stimuli can induce mitochondrial ros production and oxidative stress causes the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in an increase in ros in a positive feedback loop ros induced ros release zorov et al 2000 hpo only uv cl2 hpo prm and uv cl2 hpo caf extracts have a generalized effect of mitochondrial dysfunction affecting different stages of the electron transport chain and reducing basal respiration maximal respiration and atp production levels fig 9c and figures s13 this effect is consistent with previously observed effects from induced oxidative stress zorov et al 2006 and different studies showed similarly related mitochondrial dependent toxicity through oxidative stress for different dbps zuo et al 2017 as a sum parameter of overall toxicity cytotoxicity serves as the overarching effect overlying each of the cellular toxicity pathways escher et al 2014 no significant cytotoxicity was observed at the concentration 20x used for oxidative stress mitochondrial function and dna damage assays general cell cytotoxicity was observed at higher exposure concentration 40x for uv cl2 hpo prm and uv cl2 hpo caf samples fig 9d possibly due to the increased dna damage mitochondrial and oxidative stress taken together the observations demonstrate that chlorinated byproducts could induce oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and increase dna damage the nature of efom present seems to be the predominant factor affecting toxicity and the presence of different model compounds such as prm and caf shows that the uv chlorine treatment can have preferential targets that also impact in the overall toxic effects although aocl results are consistent for all isolate samples the composition of aocl fraction can have a great impact on cellular toxicity du et al 2020 the mechanism of action observed in our study involving cytotoxicity oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and dna damage are also comparable to previous studies wang et al 2018 4 conclusion the uv chlorine process was efficient for degrading uv and chlorine resistant ppcps due to the generation of radical species the decay of prm and caf was maximized at ph 6 2 and decreased with increasing solution ph both oh and rcs dominated the decay of prm at acidic ph while contribution of rcs became more important at alkaline condition the loss of caf was mainly attributed to clo the variation of chlorine dose and initial concentration of contaminant significantly altered the content of clo thereby leading to a more pronounced influence on the decay of caf the k obs for prm and caf degradation was not apparently impacted by cl ions but suppressed with the increase of hco3 concentration while no3 enhanced the process efficiency through the extra generation of oh and rns degradation of prm and caf by uv chlorine decreased with an increase in efom concentration the hpo fraction with higher suva has a stronger impact than the tpi fraction the presence of efom has a stronger inhibition on caf degradation compared to that of prm by preferentially scavenging clo good correlations linear for prm and exponential for caf were obtained between k obs of contaminants and uv absorbance at 254 nm of all efom solutions including the real effluent and reconstituted effluent suggesting that the uv absorbing organic moieties in efom is likely the predominant factor affecting the uv chlorine process in wwtp effluent the presence of efom isolate serves as important precursor of aocl during uv chlorine treatment which induced significant effect on cellular dna damage a remarkable increase in intracellular oxidative stress was observed for most experiments containing hpo while uv chlorine treatment did not induce a significant increase in oxidative stress in our study suggesting the nature of efom has a significant impact on the cytotoxicity appendix a supplementary information the supplementary information is found in a separate microsoft word document supplementary information

16649,in recent years great efforts have been made to understand the capacity of microplastics to adsorb environmental pollutants however relatively little is known about the ability of microplastics to release inherent additives into peripheral environments in this study we investigated the leaching behavior of phthalate plasticizer from polyvinyl chloride pvc microplastics in aqueous solutions relevant to aquatic and soil environments it was found that plastic properties such as particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics had a great effect on the leaching of dibutyl phthalate dnbp phthalate release was generally higher in smaller particles and particles with higher phthalate content whereas plastic aging caused by solar irradiation could either enhance phthalate release by increasing plastic hydrophilicity or decrease the leaching by reducing readily available fractions of phthalate regarding environmental factors solution ph 3 9 and ionic strength 0 0 2 m nacl were found to have minor effect on phthalate release while fulvic acid 0 200 mg l greatly promoted the release by improving phthalate solubility and solution plastic affinity interestingly we found that more dnbp was leached out when fulvic acid and nacl coexisted and the results from dissolved organic carbon doc and three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy analyzes suggested that the leaching of other fulvic acid like additives might have played a role these findings would be helpful for predicting the potential of microplastics to release toxic additives under different environmental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic chemical additive phthalate leaching aging fulvic acid 1 introduction since the concept of microplastics was proposed thompson et al 2004 microplastic pollution as a new environmental issue has become a global research hotspot microplastics are small particles 5 mm originated from the breakdown of large plastics and the release of abrasive items from personal care products rillig et al 2017 microplastics can easily migrate act as carrier of hazardous pollutants and be mistakenly swallowed by organisms making them a great public concern jiang et al 2020 a large number of studies have demonstrated that microplastics are widely distributed in both aquatic and terrestrial environments lebreton et al 2017 fuller and gautam 2016 pathan et al 2020 scheurer and bigalke 2018 and that microplastics may accumulate considerable amounts of environmental pollutants e g heavy metals organic compounds and pathogens due to their large surface areas alimi et al 2018 amelia et al 2021 holmes et al 2014 sarkar et al 2021 velzeboer et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 there are also studies showing that microplastics can transfer adsorbed pollutants into organisms and cause serious health risks browne et al 2013 deng et al 2020 indeed most plastics contain inherent additive chemicals which are added to meet processing and application requirements implying that microplastics can be an intrinsic source of toxic substances when they enter the environment jang et al 2017 suhrhoff and scholz bottcher 2016 zhang et al 2018 however we have known little about the leaching behavior of these additives from micro sized plastics in different environmental compartments plasticizers as important types of additives are mainly used to improve the flexibility of plastic products with an annual consumption of 7 5 million tons worldwide european plasticisers 2018 among all plasticizers phthalates are the most popular ones flexible polyvinyl chloride pvc products such as packaging greenhouse films toys medical infusion tubing wires cables and flooring materials may contain a significant amount of phthalates up to 60 by weight ihs markit 2021 like many other additives phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bounded to the polymer structure rendering them a high probability to be released into the environment engler 2012 net et al 2015 sajiki and yonekubo 2003 phthalate plasticizers are endocrine disruptors and could cause adverse developmental and reproductive effects in humans and animals mankidy et al 2013 sedha et al 2021 therefore their release into the environment may endanger the health of biota which merits urgent research previous studies mainly focused on the release of phthalates from plastic fragments into food and medical simulants to evaluate their risks during the service life of plastic commodities park et al 2016 simoneau et al 2012 takehisa et al 2005 while the release of phthalates as affected by plastic properties and environmental factors in aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems remains poorly understood paluselli et al 2019 in particular aging may affect the leaching of additives by altering additive contents and modifying plastic surfaces cheng et al 2020 luo et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and in the context of soil sediment or landfill environments the presence of dissolved organic matter dom may be able to accelerate the diffusion of additives into the aqueous phase zhou et al 2013 these aspects also require special attentions therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of plastic properties e g particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics and environmental factors e g ph ionic strength and dom on the release of phthalate plasticizer from pvc microplastics as well as the mechanisms involved in this study the release of dibutyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate dnbp a commonly used phthalate plasticizer was targeted the findings of this study would provide valuable information for evaluation of toxic chemicals and risks associated with microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics chemicals used in this study were given in the supporting information text s1 plastic materials used in this study included commercially available pvc tube and lab made pvc films the pvc tube that contained 24 2 of dnbp was obtained from a local plastic manufacturer while pvc films were prepared using the tetrahydrofuran dissolving method takehisa et al 2005 yan et al 2020 briefly dnbp and virgin pvc powder were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran then the mixture was transferred to a glass petri dish in the fume hood to allow the solvent to evaporate according to the above method we prepared pvc films containing 0 30 dnbp pvc films containing a mixture of dnbp and diethyl phthalate dep were prepared using the same method to obtain microplastics commercial and lab made plastics were rinsed with deionized water air dried and cut into smaller pieces using scissors which were then milled with a blender under liquid nitrogen conditions microplastics with a defined size range were obtained by passing through sieves with different meshes commercial pvc microplastics were granules with two sizes large 350 650 μm and small 150 μm lab made pvc microplastics were in large size 350 650 μm with a thickness of 50 μm if unspecified microplastics used in this study were all in large size microplastics derived from commercial pvc with plasticizer were named as cpvc p while the ones from lab made pvc containing 0 3 15 and 30 dnbp were named as pvc pvc 3 pvc 15 and pvc 30 respectively lab made microplastics containing 3 dep or a mixture of 3 dep and 15 dnbp were labelled as pvc 3 dep and pvc 3 dep 15 dnbp respectively details of microplastics used in the study were shown in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 release experiment prior to the experiment all glassware was cleaned with ultra pure water rinsed with acetone and heated at 500 c for 2 h to eliminate organic contamination the release experiments were carried out in 20 ml glass bottles sealed with teflon screw cap and each bottle contained 50 mg pvc microplastics and 10 ml aqueous solution a solid and liquid ratio of 1 200 was used to simulate serious microplastic pollution in water or microplastics present in soil solutions lee et al 2020 the glass bottles were placed in an orbital shaker with agitation speed of 150 rpm at 25 c all treatments were performed in triplicates and destructive sampling was performed at designed time points in order to obtain the equilibrium time for dnbp release we initially conducted a 28 d experiment 0 02 nan3 was added to inhibit microbial degradation dnbp concentration in water phase was analyzed on days 0 1 2 7 14 21 and 28 respectively it was found that dnbp release from microplastics reached equilibrium almost in one day when no significant change occurred as time proceeded therefore subsequent releasing experiments were carried out for 24 or 48 h to investigate whether pvc microplastics could act a continuous source of phthalate phthalate release in ten consecutive releasing cycles was also measured this was achieved according to the following steps after shaking for 48 h the aqueous solution pure water was gently removed with a pipette and replaced with 10 ml pure water then the glass bottles were put into the shaker and shaken for another 48 h this process was repeated for 10 times the effects of plastic properties particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics and water chemicals ph ion strength and dom on dnbp release were examined under conditions as described above if not specified pure water was used as the leaching solution and solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 with 0 1 m hcl and naoh to achieve the desired ion strength 2 0 m nacl stock solution was added fulvic acid which is abundant in rivers soils and sediments was used to study the effect of dissolved organic matter on phthalate release the concentration of dnbp leached into water was measured after 0 5 6 12 24 48 h or only after 24 h the effect of plastic aging on phthalate release was examined by comparing the release from pristine and naturally aged microplastics aged microplastics were obtained by exposing pristine microplastics to solar irradiation for 38 d in quartz glass dishes text s2 2 3 analytical methods the morphology size surface functional groups hydrophilicity contact angle crystallinity and phthalate adsorption capacity of microplastics were characterized which can be referred to the supporting information text s3 dnbp content in microplastics was determined by solvent extraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis yan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 details can be found in text s4 dnbp concentration in water phase was measured under the following procedures the aqueous solution in the glass bottle was filtered with a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane and stored in a glass vial to mitigate the effect of phthalate adsorption on the membrane the first 2 ml filtrate was discarded then dnbp was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters alliance 2695 milford usa equipped with an eclipse xdb c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm agilent technologies usa and a uv detector at 227 nm the injection volume was 20 μl the mobile phase was 80 20 v v of methanol and deionized water at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min dnbp concentration was calculated based on a calibration curve made from standard solutions the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were 0 02 and 0 05 mg l respectively according to the above method the recovery ratio of dnbp could reach more than 90 the doc leached from commercial microplastics into the aqueous solution was quantified using a toc analyzer elementar vario toc select germany after filtration with 0 45 μm ptfe membrane the compositional information of released doc was analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy horiba aqualog spectrophotometer japan at emission wavelength em of 240 550 nm and excitation wavelength ex of 220 500 nm 2 4 statistical analysis data were presented as means of triplicates with standard deviation student s t test was used to evaluate the significance of phthalate doc release concentration and adsorption capacity of microplastics at a p value threshold of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 the potential of pvc microplastics to release dnbp the 28 d releasing experiment showed that microplastics generated from commercial pvc product could release dnbp into pure water and the process reached equilibrium quickly as shown in fig 1 a fast release occurred during the first day and then the release did not change greatly as time proceeded dnbp release concentrations were 1 49 0 79 mg l on day 1 and 1 80 0 88 mg l on day 28 which were much lower than its reported solubility of 9 9 mg l net et al 2015 to examine whether the slow release after day 1 was caused by phthalate re adsorption or complete leaching of readily available fractions the ability of microplastics recycled from a former leaching experiment to release phthalate was determined the result showed that pvc microplastics still had a high potential to release dnbp even after 10 consecutive cycles fig 1b indicating that the slow release after day 1 in fig 1a was probably due to phthalate re adsorption by the plastic which could inhibit further leaching of dnbp this is not surprising given that most phthalates are hydrophobic with low solubility 10 mg l net et al 2015 and strong adsorption of phthalate on microplastics has been reported in a previous study liu et al 2019b in the present study high adsorption capacity of pvc microplastics for dnbp was confirmed by conducting adsorption experiments text s3 when dnbp isomer was added into the leaching solution pvc microplastics reduced its concentration from 7 8 to 0 1 mg l within 30 min fig 1c providing direct evidence for the occurrence of dnbp re adsorption moreover the continuous leaching of dnbp from recycled particles demonstrated that microplastics could act as a persistent source of phthalates the accumulative leached quantity after 10 cycles reached 2 56 mg g suggesting that at least 1 1 of phthalate in total 242 mg g in plastics was bioaccessible which could be easily leached out into the surrounding environment 3 2 effects of particle size plasticizer content and plastic aging on dnbp release plastic properties including particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics were all found to have great effects on the release of dnbp from pvc microplastics as indicated in fig 2 a dnbp release into water was a fast process most release occurred within the first 30 min and the release for smaller particles was generally significantly higher than that of the larger counterparts p 0 001 the result was consistent with the findings by guo et al 2019 and ye et al 2020 that finer particles leached more additives as smaller particles had larger specific surface areas and shorter diffusion paths koelmans et al 2013 rillig et al 2021 based on the purpose of usage plastic materials contain variable amounts of additives for instance the plasticizer content is usually below 10 in rigid pvc and over 30 for flexible pvc while moderate flexible pvc contains a moderate level of plasticizers huang and xu 2008 currently the effect of additive content on the leaching behavior of plasticizers from microplastics has not been well studied this may be related to the fact that commercial plastics often contain a cocktail of unknown additives which makes the comparison between samples difficult in this study we explored the influence of plasticizer content by using lab made pvc microplastics that contained different levels of dnbp the result showed that dnbp release into water increased with increasing phthalate content the equilibrium aqueous concentration of dnbp for pvc 3 pvc 15 and pvc 30 was 0 1 07 and 2 23 mg l respectively fig 2b the difference could be due to that the concentration gradient between plastic and water was higher for plastics with more plasticizer it was worth noting that the release capacity was not necessarily linearly correlated with additive content for instance the release of dnbp from pvc 3 was below detection limit 0 02 mg l not one tenth of that from pvc 30 the possible reason could be that in plastics with low phthalate contents the physical bond between pvc polymer and phthalate was stronger daniels 2009 and the channels for phthalate to migrate from inner part to plastic surface were narrower resulting in a slower migration of dnbp molecules pure pvc has few free volume regions while the addition of plasticizers can increase the distance between tightly packed polymer chains and creates free space regions when more plasticizer is added more and larger free space regions are created borek and osoba 1998 the free space regions provide better movement of polymer chains and plasticizers thus the pvc plastic with a lower plasticizer loading which is assumed to have fewer and smaller free space regions may generate a slower leaching rate of dnbp the influence of plastic aging on dnbp release was complex with either higher or lower release being observed depending on the properties of materials as shown in fig 2c dnbp concentrations in aqueous solution were 3 60 and 1 73 mg l for aged pvc 30 and cpvc p respectively at 48 h which were significantly higher than those from pristine pvc 30 2 23 mg l and cpvc p 1 36 mg l whereas dnbp release from pvc 15 decreased sharply from 1 07 to 0 30 mg l after aging and the release from pvc 3 was too low to be detected it has been reported that aging can cause modifications in surface roughness specific surface area hydrophilicity surface functional groups and crystallinity of plastics resulting in altered adsorption and leaching behavior of organic pollutants onto or from microplastics liu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 sun et al 2021 in this study aging led to the formation of cavity and nano sized 500 nm particles attached on plastic surface fig 3 a indicating an increase in surface roughness the hydrophilicity of plastics was examined using the static water contact angle method although the data for plastic granules derived from commercial pvc tube was not available due to difficulties in preparing samples for contact angle analysis the water contact angle of lab made microplastics all decreased considerably after aging from 88 9 ⁰ to 77 7 ⁰ for pvc 3 from 85 1 ⁰ to 75 2 ⁰ for pvc 15 and from 117 7 ⁰ to 94 5 ⁰ for pvc 30 fig 3b it indicated that aging caused an increase in hydrophilicity being consistent with many previous studies liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the increase in hydrophilicity was probably due to the incorporation of oxygen containing functional groups on plastic surface as well as the increase in surface roughness during the aging process fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis showed that aging of unplasticized pvc led to the formation of two new peaks at 1722 and 1772 cm 1 which represent c o groups fig s3 as for plasticized pvc the new peaks formed overlapped with the peak of phthalate plasticizer making it difficult to identify changes in the intensity of carbonyl groups but it could be seen that after aging the peak of 1772 cm 1 was slightly higher and the phthalate peak became wider for all plasticized particles examined fig s3 indicating the formation of new c o groups other than the phthalate carboxyl o c o groups chen et al 2007 this observation was in accordance with the increase in plastic hydrophilicity crystallinity represents the proportion of crystalline regions with low adsorption efficiency which is known to affect the adsorption properties of polymers sun et al 2021 in this study x ray diffraction xrd was applied to the assess the changes in pvc crystallinity no sharp peaks were observed fig s4 indicating that pvc was an amorphous polymer with low crystallinity the intensity of the two peaks at around 20 ⁰ 2θ decreased slightly indicating that aged microplastics had a lower crystallinity than the pristine ones in a previous study the crystallinity of pvc microplastics increased slightly after aging for 96 h at uv254 nm liu et al 2019a the decrease of crystallinity in this work might be ascribed to a higher degree of aging solar irradiation and 25 50 c for 38 d which caused the degradation of crystalline regions of the above factors an increase in surface roughness and decrease in crystallinity may lead to improved adsorption capacity while the increase in hydrophilicity and oxygen containing functional groups may cause a decline in the adsorption capacity of plastics for hydrophobic organic compounds in this study dnbp adsorption capacity partition coefficient k d decreased significantly for all microplastics after aging fig 3c demonstrating that crystallinity and surface roughness played a minor role in controlling the sorption behavior of phthalate on pvc microplastics this was inconsistent with the finding by sun et al 2021 that crystallinity was the dominant factor for bisphenol a adsorption on aged low density polyethylene and was consistent with the finding by liu et al 2019b that the adsorption of phthalates by various polymers was governed by partition and hydrophobic interaction not crystallinity the difference may be related to the fact that pvc typically has low crystallinity 10 borek and osoba 1998 which contributes less to the adsorption capacity compared to other polymers with high crystallinity e g polyethylene up to 90 yao et al 2021 for polystyrene which has a low crystallinity its adsorption capacity for organic compound was also found not correlated with crystalline regions liu et al 2020 a decrease in adsorption capacity and an increase in surface roughness contact surface area with leaching solution is supposed to cause an increase in additive release from plastics luo et al 2020 this was true for aged pvc 30 and aged cpvc p in this work however the leaching of dnbp from pvc 15 decreased markedly after aging fig 2c this might be explained by the loss of dnbp in plastics via volatilization and degradation during the aging process wang et al 2021 therefore the content of dnbp in plastics before and after aging was measured as shown in fig 3d after 38 d of aging dnbp content dropped from 29 5 to 18 0 for pvc 30 and from 13 7 to 11 8 for pvc 15 potentially because phthalates were less exposed to uv light in plastics with high polymer content and aging of commercial plastics with stabilizers occurred more slowly liu et al 2018 phthalate contents in pvc 3 and cpvc p remained relatively stable over the same time period interestingly although phthalate loss was higher for pvc 30 compared to pvc 15 39 1 vs 13 8 of total dnbp phthalate release from pvc 30 increased while the release by pvc 15 greatly decreased considering that a larger proportion of additives was reported to be released from finer particles due to shorter diffusion channels guo et al 2019 we speculated that a larger percentage of phthalate could be leached out from plastics with higher phthalate content due to wider diffusion channels larger free volume regions in other words pvc 15 had a lower proportion of readily available phthalate owing to the tight contact of phthalate with polymer matrix when the readily available fractions e g the phthalate molecules near plastic inner surface were leached out or lost due to aging the release entered a slow stage resulting in low phthalate concentration in the water phase an illustration of the proposed release scheme of phthalates from pvc microplastics can be found in fig 4 a and b 3 3 effects of solution ph ionic strength and dom on dnbp release solution ph ionic strength and dom have been reported to be important factors affecting the interaction of organic pollutants and solid phase liu et al 2019c zhou et al 2013 therefore their effect on phthalate release from pvc microplastics were examined in this study it was found that solution ph and ionic strength under environmentally relevant conditions had limited effects on dnbp release when solution ph dropped from 7 0 to 3 0 or rose from 7 0 to 9 0 the variation in dnbp release was within 15 while when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 0 2 m the release variation was also 15 fig 5 this can be explained by the fact that phthalates are non ionic compounds and pvc polymers are resistant to acid alkaline salt solutions kumagai et al 2018 liu et al 2019b thus the interaction between phthalate and plastic is less affected by ph and salt ions for example solution ph and ionic strength were recently reported to have minor effect on the capacity of pvc microplastics to adsorb phthalates liu et al 2019b herein our results demonstrated that the ability of microplastics to release phthalates was also not sensitive to the changes of ph and ionic strength in contrast fulvic acid a representative natural dom component showed a remarkable effect on dnbp release from pvc microplastics when fa concentration increased from 0 to 5 20 and 50 mg l dnbp release concentration increased by 22 2 56 3 and 110 respectively fig 6 a when fa concentration further increased to 100 and 200 mg l dnbp release concentration increased to 8 98 and 17 52 mg l 13 folds that in pure water respectively moreover when the leaching solution volume was expanded from 10 to 200 ml the promoting effect of fulvic acid on dnbp release was even more obvious fig s5 the results clearly demonstrated that the presence of fulvic acid could accelerate the release of dnbp from pvc microplastics two reasons might be responsible for that 1 dom had a solubilization effect on hydrophobic organic compounds chiou et al 1986 which would facilitate the diffusion of phthalate into water in this study fulvic acid did show a beneficial effect on the dissolvation of dnbp in water as illustrated in fig 6a dnbp solubility increased with increasing fa concentrations it was noted that dnbp release concentration 17 52 mg l in the fa200 cpvc p system was even higher than its solubility in fa200 solution 11 36 mg l this could be a result of the leaching of dissolved organic carbon doc from plastics romera castillo et al 2018 lee et al 2020 which further increased the solubilization of phthalates 2 fulvic acid solution might have a stronger affinity for plastics than pure water which meant that fa solution could penetrate the plastic matrix better to extract phthalate the high affinity of fulvic acid solution for plastics was evidenced by measuring the contact angle of pvc and leaching solution microplastics originated from lab made films were used in this test as those from commercial pvc product had difficulties in preparing samples for contact angle analysis the result showed that when fa concentration in water increased from 0 to 50 mg l the contact angle between microplastic pvc 15 and aqueous solution decreased from 85 1 to 71 6 fig s6 indicating a higher affinity and infiltration capacity of fa50 solution to plastics therefore we concluded that fa could enhance the release of dnbp from pvc microplastics via increasing the solubility of phthalate and the infiltration capacity of aqueous solution to plastics since it is very common for plastic products to contain more than one phthalate plasticizer to achieve optimized properties the effect of fulvic acid on phthalate release from microplastics with a mixture of dep and dnbp was also examined as shown in fig s7a and b 50 mg l fulvic acid exhibited a comparable and even slightly higher ability to promote dnbp release from microplastics containing two plasticizers pvc 3 dep 15 dnbp compared to those containing single plasticizer pvc 15 dnbp the observation that fulvic acid had little effect on dep release from microplastics containing either single or double plasticizers could be attributed to the inability of fulvic acid to enhance the dissolution diffusion of dep into water phase fig s7c in the study by chiou et al 1986 dissolved humic and fulvic acids were found to be more efficient in enhancing the solubility of organic pollutants with low water solubility because the dom functioned as a large intramolecular nonpolar organic environment for promoting the partitioning like interaction with relatively nonpolar organic molecules compared to dnbp dep with a shorter alkyl chain was more water soluble solubility 591 mg l net et al 2015 and less nonpolar thus the interaction of dep and fulvic acid was assumed to be weaker collectively the results demonstrated that the presence of another phthalate plasticizer in plastics did not compromise the beneficial effect of fulvic acid on dnbp release and the increase of pollutant solubility played a more significant role in the enhanced dnbp release than the increased affinity of leaching solution for microplastics in addition it was noted that after 24 h the released concentration of dep from pvc 3 dep was 0 14 mg l while it was 9 29 mg l for pvc 3 dep 15 dnbp the large increase in dep release could attributed to the slightly lower dep adsorption on microplastics in the presence of dnbp data not shown and the increase in plastic free volume due to the incorporation of 15 dnbp interestingly we found that the co existence of fa and nacl could further promote the release of dnbp from cpvc p microplastics compared to fa alone in fa50 nacl 0 01 0 1 m solution dnbp release concentration at 24 h was 4 0 5 1 folds of that in fa0 while the release in fa50 was only 2 1 times higher than that in fa0 fig 6b the releasing kinetics over a period of 48 h also clearly showed a greater promotion effect of fa nacl on phthalate release than fa alone fig 6b the influence of the co occurrence of dom and salt ions has been rarely reported in previous studies and the underlying mechanism is still unclear since the promoting effect of fa nacl was not observed for lab made plastics and fa nacl did not further enhance dnbp solubility or plastic leaching solution affinity fig s6 it was proposed that other components present in commercial plastics might have played a significant role more detailed discussion is provided in the following paragraph when the ionic strength increased to 0 2 m the promoting effect of fa nacl was less obvious probably because ionic strength could change the aggregation state of the microplastic and make the microplastic easy to agglomerate liu et al 2019b consequently the channels through which chemical additives migrate from particles to the water phase were blocked resulting in a decrease in phthalate release in order to elucidate the mechanism that might be responsible for the higher release of phthalate in fulvic acid nacl solution we measured the changes in phthalate adsorption capacity and doc leaching of commercial plastics in the presence of fa50 the kd value of phthalate adsorption on cpvc p decreased by 22 compared to the control fa0 while the decrease reached 44 for fa50 0 01m nacl fig s8 the result demonstrated that in fa50 nacl solution phthalate had a higher potential to diffuse into the aqueous phase which was consistent with the superior release capacity under fulvic acid nacl conditions moreover doc analysis showed that a higher amount of dissolved organic matter net leaching carbon total carbon fulvic acid carbon phthalate carbon was leached out from commercial plastics under fa50 nacl 9 5 1 5 mg c l condition than that under fa50 4 6 0 6 mg c l condition further three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied for characterization of the composition of leached doc from fig s9 we could see that 0 01 m nacl did not affect the spectrum of fulvic acid 50 mg l but it showed a profound effect on the spectrum of doc leached from cpvc p in fa50 0 01m nacl solution more fulvic acid like and soluble microbial byproduct like substances were leached out from plastics which might have facilitated the diffusion of dnbp into the water phase thus the leaching of organic matter with surface active properties was presumably the primary reason for the observed decrease in dnbp adsorption and increase in dnbp release to explore if the promoting effect of fa nacl on phthalate release was common for microplastics generated from commercial products microplastics derived from a white pvc tube cpvc white purchased online with unknown origin were used for phthalate release experiment as observed for cpvc p cpvc white also released more dnbp under fa50 0 01m nacl condition 10 74 mg l than those under fa50 6 00 mg l and fa0 2 73 mg l conditions fig s10 doc analysis showed that net doc leaching was also the highest under fa50 0 01m nacl conditions and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis indicated that more soluble microbial byproduct like substances were present fig s10 the microbial byproduct like substances refer to a wide range of dissolved organic matter which show peak fluorescence intensity at ex em 250 280 380 nm they can be hydroxy acids amino acids and proteins etc chen et al 2003 the results suggested that it might be common for plastics to contain surface active components whose leaching could accelerate the release of phthalate plasticizers it is well reported that surfactants can be used as additives in plastics to enhance compatibility hydrophilicity and antifog properties camani et al 2021 irusta et al 2009 nerin et al 2018 recently putative surfactant molecules were detected in the leachate of disposable plastic masks sullivan et al 2021 hence it was possible that the leached organic matter was the surfactants which were incorporated during the manufacturing of plastics the exact mechanism for the effect of fa nacl on surfactant and dnbp leaching was not clear but might be related to the fact that surface active agents contained both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups this amphiphilic nature likely led to an affinity with both aromatic fa molecules and nacl song et al 2018 which increased the dissolution of surfactant in aqueous solution in addition sodium salts have been reported to be able to reduce the surface tension and critical micelle concentration of ionic surfactants to enhance the solubilization of organic pollutants huang et al 2015 the mechanism putatively involved in fa nacl mediated doc and phthalate leaching was illustrated in fig 4c although the actual functioning components could not be identified based on current data the results regarding the co occurrence of dom and nacl are of great significance since salt ions are commonly found in water bodies soil solutions and commercial plastics usually contain a variety of additive chemicals 4 conclusion in this study the release behavior of phthalate plasticizer from pvc microplastics in aqueous solutions was comprehensively studied we found that particle size plasticizer content aging of plastics and dom presence had great effects on phthalate release while solution ph and ionic strength showed minor effect in general smaller particles higher plasticizer content aging of flexible pvc and the presence of fulvic acid would lead to higher leaching of phthalate dnbp in aqueous solutions differences in diffusion paths surface roughness hydrophilicity phthalate solubility and adsorption capacity were probably the underlying mechanisms for the observed changes in dnbp release moreover the co existence of fulvic acid and nacl was found to have a superior promoting effect on dnbp release possibly because fulvic acid nacl could induce the leaching of other additive chemicals with surfactant like properties the results demonstrate that in future studies it may be necessary to include the leaching of additives under dom and salt ions co existing conditions and pay more attentions on the plastics with surfactant like components as these chemicals may significantly accelerate the release of other toxic compounds overall this study represents a preliminary investigation of the leaching of phthalate plasticizers from microplastics into the surrounding environment the release of plasticizers in real aquatic or soil environments

16649,in recent years great efforts have been made to understand the capacity of microplastics to adsorb environmental pollutants however relatively little is known about the ability of microplastics to release inherent additives into peripheral environments in this study we investigated the leaching behavior of phthalate plasticizer from polyvinyl chloride pvc microplastics in aqueous solutions relevant to aquatic and soil environments it was found that plastic properties such as particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics had a great effect on the leaching of dibutyl phthalate dnbp phthalate release was generally higher in smaller particles and particles with higher phthalate content whereas plastic aging caused by solar irradiation could either enhance phthalate release by increasing plastic hydrophilicity or decrease the leaching by reducing readily available fractions of phthalate regarding environmental factors solution ph 3 9 and ionic strength 0 0 2 m nacl were found to have minor effect on phthalate release while fulvic acid 0 200 mg l greatly promoted the release by improving phthalate solubility and solution plastic affinity interestingly we found that more dnbp was leached out when fulvic acid and nacl coexisted and the results from dissolved organic carbon doc and three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy analyzes suggested that the leaching of other fulvic acid like additives might have played a role these findings would be helpful for predicting the potential of microplastics to release toxic additives under different environmental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic chemical additive phthalate leaching aging fulvic acid 1 introduction since the concept of microplastics was proposed thompson et al 2004 microplastic pollution as a new environmental issue has become a global research hotspot microplastics are small particles 5 mm originated from the breakdown of large plastics and the release of abrasive items from personal care products rillig et al 2017 microplastics can easily migrate act as carrier of hazardous pollutants and be mistakenly swallowed by organisms making them a great public concern jiang et al 2020 a large number of studies have demonstrated that microplastics are widely distributed in both aquatic and terrestrial environments lebreton et al 2017 fuller and gautam 2016 pathan et al 2020 scheurer and bigalke 2018 and that microplastics may accumulate considerable amounts of environmental pollutants e g heavy metals organic compounds and pathogens due to their large surface areas alimi et al 2018 amelia et al 2021 holmes et al 2014 sarkar et al 2021 velzeboer et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 there are also studies showing that microplastics can transfer adsorbed pollutants into organisms and cause serious health risks browne et al 2013 deng et al 2020 indeed most plastics contain inherent additive chemicals which are added to meet processing and application requirements implying that microplastics can be an intrinsic source of toxic substances when they enter the environment jang et al 2017 suhrhoff and scholz bottcher 2016 zhang et al 2018 however we have known little about the leaching behavior of these additives from micro sized plastics in different environmental compartments plasticizers as important types of additives are mainly used to improve the flexibility of plastic products with an annual consumption of 7 5 million tons worldwide european plasticisers 2018 among all plasticizers phthalates are the most popular ones flexible polyvinyl chloride pvc products such as packaging greenhouse films toys medical infusion tubing wires cables and flooring materials may contain a significant amount of phthalates up to 60 by weight ihs markit 2021 like many other additives phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bounded to the polymer structure rendering them a high probability to be released into the environment engler 2012 net et al 2015 sajiki and yonekubo 2003 phthalate plasticizers are endocrine disruptors and could cause adverse developmental and reproductive effects in humans and animals mankidy et al 2013 sedha et al 2021 therefore their release into the environment may endanger the health of biota which merits urgent research previous studies mainly focused on the release of phthalates from plastic fragments into food and medical simulants to evaluate their risks during the service life of plastic commodities park et al 2016 simoneau et al 2012 takehisa et al 2005 while the release of phthalates as affected by plastic properties and environmental factors in aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems remains poorly understood paluselli et al 2019 in particular aging may affect the leaching of additives by altering additive contents and modifying plastic surfaces cheng et al 2020 luo et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and in the context of soil sediment or landfill environments the presence of dissolved organic matter dom may be able to accelerate the diffusion of additives into the aqueous phase zhou et al 2013 these aspects also require special attentions therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of plastic properties e g particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics and environmental factors e g ph ionic strength and dom on the release of phthalate plasticizer from pvc microplastics as well as the mechanisms involved in this study the release of dibutyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate dnbp a commonly used phthalate plasticizer was targeted the findings of this study would provide valuable information for evaluation of toxic chemicals and risks associated with microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics chemicals used in this study were given in the supporting information text s1 plastic materials used in this study included commercially available pvc tube and lab made pvc films the pvc tube that contained 24 2 of dnbp was obtained from a local plastic manufacturer while pvc films were prepared using the tetrahydrofuran dissolving method takehisa et al 2005 yan et al 2020 briefly dnbp and virgin pvc powder were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran then the mixture was transferred to a glass petri dish in the fume hood to allow the solvent to evaporate according to the above method we prepared pvc films containing 0 30 dnbp pvc films containing a mixture of dnbp and diethyl phthalate dep were prepared using the same method to obtain microplastics commercial and lab made plastics were rinsed with deionized water air dried and cut into smaller pieces using scissors which were then milled with a blender under liquid nitrogen conditions microplastics with a defined size range were obtained by passing through sieves with different meshes commercial pvc microplastics were granules with two sizes large 350 650 μm and small 150 μm lab made pvc microplastics were in large size 350 650 μm with a thickness of 50 μm if unspecified microplastics used in this study were all in large size microplastics derived from commercial pvc with plasticizer were named as cpvc p while the ones from lab made pvc containing 0 3 15 and 30 dnbp were named as pvc pvc 3 pvc 15 and pvc 30 respectively lab made microplastics containing 3 dep or a mixture of 3 dep and 15 dnbp were labelled as pvc 3 dep and pvc 3 dep 15 dnbp respectively details of microplastics used in the study were shown in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 release experiment prior to the experiment all glassware was cleaned with ultra pure water rinsed with acetone and heated at 500 c for 2 h to eliminate organic contamination the release experiments were carried out in 20 ml glass bottles sealed with teflon screw cap and each bottle contained 50 mg pvc microplastics and 10 ml aqueous solution a solid and liquid ratio of 1 200 was used to simulate serious microplastic pollution in water or microplastics present in soil solutions lee et al 2020 the glass bottles were placed in an orbital shaker with agitation speed of 150 rpm at 25 c all treatments were performed in triplicates and destructive sampling was performed at designed time points in order to obtain the equilibrium time for dnbp release we initially conducted a 28 d experiment 0 02 nan3 was added to inhibit microbial degradation dnbp concentration in water phase was analyzed on days 0 1 2 7 14 21 and 28 respectively it was found that dnbp release from microplastics reached equilibrium almost in one day when no significant change occurred as time proceeded therefore subsequent releasing experiments were carried out for 24 or 48 h to investigate whether pvc microplastics could act a continuous source of phthalate phthalate release in ten consecutive releasing cycles was also measured this was achieved according to the following steps after shaking for 48 h the aqueous solution pure water was gently removed with a pipette and replaced with 10 ml pure water then the glass bottles were put into the shaker and shaken for another 48 h this process was repeated for 10 times the effects of plastic properties particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics and water chemicals ph ion strength and dom on dnbp release were examined under conditions as described above if not specified pure water was used as the leaching solution and solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 with 0 1 m hcl and naoh to achieve the desired ion strength 2 0 m nacl stock solution was added fulvic acid which is abundant in rivers soils and sediments was used to study the effect of dissolved organic matter on phthalate release the concentration of dnbp leached into water was measured after 0 5 6 12 24 48 h or only after 24 h the effect of plastic aging on phthalate release was examined by comparing the release from pristine and naturally aged microplastics aged microplastics were obtained by exposing pristine microplastics to solar irradiation for 38 d in quartz glass dishes text s2 2 3 analytical methods the morphology size surface functional groups hydrophilicity contact angle crystallinity and phthalate adsorption capacity of microplastics were characterized which can be referred to the supporting information text s3 dnbp content in microplastics was determined by solvent extraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis yan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 details can be found in text s4 dnbp concentration in water phase was measured under the following procedures the aqueous solution in the glass bottle was filtered with a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane and stored in a glass vial to mitigate the effect of phthalate adsorption on the membrane the first 2 ml filtrate was discarded then dnbp was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters alliance 2695 milford usa equipped with an eclipse xdb c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm agilent technologies usa and a uv detector at 227 nm the injection volume was 20 μl the mobile phase was 80 20 v v of methanol and deionized water at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min dnbp concentration was calculated based on a calibration curve made from standard solutions the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were 0 02 and 0 05 mg l respectively according to the above method the recovery ratio of dnbp could reach more than 90 the doc leached from commercial microplastics into the aqueous solution was quantified using a toc analyzer elementar vario toc select germany after filtration with 0 45 μm ptfe membrane the compositional information of released doc was analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy horiba aqualog spectrophotometer japan at emission wavelength em of 240 550 nm and excitation wavelength ex of 220 500 nm 2 4 statistical analysis data were presented as means of triplicates with standard deviation student s t test was used to evaluate the significance of phthalate doc release concentration and adsorption capacity of microplastics at a p value threshold of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 the potential of pvc microplastics to release dnbp the 28 d releasing experiment showed that microplastics generated from commercial pvc product could release dnbp into pure water and the process reached equilibrium quickly as shown in fig 1 a fast release occurred during the first day and then the release did not change greatly as time proceeded dnbp release concentrations were 1 49 0 79 mg l on day 1 and 1 80 0 88 mg l on day 28 which were much lower than its reported solubility of 9 9 mg l net et al 2015 to examine whether the slow release after day 1 was caused by phthalate re adsorption or complete leaching of readily available fractions the ability of microplastics recycled from a former leaching experiment to release phthalate was determined the result showed that pvc microplastics still had a high potential to release dnbp even after 10 consecutive cycles fig 1b indicating that the slow release after day 1 in fig 1a was probably due to phthalate re adsorption by the plastic which could inhibit further leaching of dnbp this is not surprising given that most phthalates are hydrophobic with low solubility 10 mg l net et al 2015 and strong adsorption of phthalate on microplastics has been reported in a previous study liu et al 2019b in the present study high adsorption capacity of pvc microplastics for dnbp was confirmed by conducting adsorption experiments text s3 when dnbp isomer was added into the leaching solution pvc microplastics reduced its concentration from 7 8 to 0 1 mg l within 30 min fig 1c providing direct evidence for the occurrence of dnbp re adsorption moreover the continuous leaching of dnbp from recycled particles demonstrated that microplastics could act as a persistent source of phthalates the accumulative leached quantity after 10 cycles reached 2 56 mg g suggesting that at least 1 1 of phthalate in total 242 mg g in plastics was bioaccessible which could be easily leached out into the surrounding environment 3 2 effects of particle size plasticizer content and plastic aging on dnbp release plastic properties including particle size plasticizer content and aging of plastics were all found to have great effects on the release of dnbp from pvc microplastics as indicated in fig 2 a dnbp release into water was a fast process most release occurred within the first 30 min and the release for smaller particles was generally significantly higher than that of the larger counterparts p 0 001 the result was consistent with the findings by guo et al 2019 and ye et al 2020 that finer particles leached more additives as smaller particles had larger specific surface areas and shorter diffusion paths koelmans et al 2013 rillig et al 2021 based on the purpose of usage plastic materials contain variable amounts of additives for instance the plasticizer content is usually below 10 in rigid pvc and over 30 for flexible pvc while moderate flexible pvc contains a moderate level of plasticizers huang and xu 2008 currently the effect of additive content on the leaching behavior of plasticizers from microplastics has not been well studied this may be related to the fact that commercial plastics often contain a cocktail of unknown additives which makes the comparison between samples difficult in this study we explored the influence of plasticizer content by using lab made pvc microplastics that contained different levels of dnbp the result showed that dnbp release into water increased with increasing phthalate content the equilibrium aqueous concentration of dnbp for pvc 3 pvc 15 and pvc 30 was 0 1 07 and 2 23 mg l respectively fig 2b the difference could be due to that the concentration gradient between plastic and water was higher for plastics with more plasticizer it was worth noting that the release capacity was not necessarily linearly correlated with additive content for instance the release of dnbp from pvc 3 was below detection limit 0 02 mg l not one tenth of that from pvc 30 the possible reason could be that in plastics with low phthalate contents the physical bond between pvc polymer and phthalate was stronger daniels 2009 and the channels for phthalate to migrate from inner part to plastic surface were narrower resulting in a slower migration of dnbp molecules pure pvc has few free volume regions while the addition of plasticizers can increase the distance between tightly packed polymer chains and creates free space regions when more plasticizer is added more and larger free space regions are created borek and osoba 1998 the free space regions provide better movement of polymer chains and plasticizers thus the pvc plastic with a lower plasticizer loading which is assumed to have fewer and smaller free space regions may generate a slower leaching rate of dnbp the influence of plastic aging on dnbp release was complex with either higher or lower release being observed depending on the properties of materials as shown in fig 2c dnbp concentrations in aqueous solution were 3 60 and 1 73 mg l for aged pvc 30 and cpvc p respectively at 48 h which were significantly higher than those from pristine pvc 30 2 23 mg l and cpvc p 1 36 mg l whereas dnbp release from pvc 15 decreased sharply from 1 07 to 0 30 mg l after aging and the release from pvc 3 was too low to be detected it has been reported that aging can cause modifications in surface roughness specific surface area hydrophilicity surface functional groups and crystallinity of plastics resulting in altered adsorption and leaching behavior of organic pollutants onto or from microplastics liu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 sun et al 2021 in this study aging led to the formation of cavity and nano sized 500 nm particles attached on plastic surface fig 3 a indicating an increase in surface roughness the hydrophilicity of plastics was examined using the static water contact angle method although the data for plastic granules derived from commercial pvc tube was not available due to difficulties in preparing samples for contact angle analysis the water contact angle of lab made microplastics all decreased considerably after aging from 88 9 ⁰ to 77 7 ⁰ for pvc 3 from 85 1 ⁰ to 75 2 ⁰ for pvc 15 and from 117 7 ⁰ to 94 5 ⁰ for pvc 30 fig 3b it indicated that aging caused an increase in hydrophilicity being consistent with many previous studies liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the increase in hydrophilicity was probably due to the incorporation of oxygen containing functional groups on plastic surface as well as the increase in surface roughness during the aging process fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis showed that aging of unplasticized pvc led to the formation of two new peaks at 1722 and 1772 cm 1 which represent c o groups fig s3 as for plasticized pvc the new peaks formed overlapped with the peak of phthalate plasticizer making it difficult to identify changes in the intensity of carbonyl groups but it could be seen that after aging the peak of 1772 cm 1 was slightly higher and the phthalate peak became wider for all plasticized particles examined fig s3 indicating the formation of new c o groups other than the phthalate carboxyl o c o groups chen et al 2007 this observation was in accordance with the increase in plastic hydrophilicity crystallinity represents the proportion of crystalline regions with low adsorption efficiency which is known to affect the adsorption properties of polymers sun et al 2021 in this study x ray diffraction xrd was applied to the assess the changes in pvc crystallinity no sharp peaks were observed fig s4 indicating that pvc was an amorphous polymer with low crystallinity the intensity of the two peaks at around 20 ⁰ 2θ decreased slightly indicating that aged microplastics had a lower crystallinity than the pristine ones in a previous study the crystallinity of pvc microplastics increased slightly after aging for 96 h at uv254 nm liu et al 2019a the decrease of crystallinity in this work might be ascribed to a higher degree of aging solar irradiation and 25 50 c for 38 d which caused the degradation of crystalline regions of the above factors an increase in surface roughness and decrease in crystallinity may lead to improved adsorption capacity while the increase in hydrophilicity and oxygen containing functional groups may cause a decline in the adsorption capacity of plastics for hydrophobic organic compounds in this study dnbp adsorption capacity partition coefficient k d decreased significantly for all microplastics after aging fig 3c demonstrating that crystallinity and surface roughness played a minor role in controlling the sorption behavior of phthalate on pvc microplastics this was inconsistent with the finding by sun et al 2021 that crystallinity was the dominant factor for bisphenol a adsorption on aged low density polyethylene and was consistent with the finding by liu et al 2019b that the adsorption of phthalates by various polymers was governed by partition and hydrophobic interaction not crystallinity the difference may be related to the fact that pvc typically has low crystallinity 10 borek and osoba 1998 which contributes less to the adsorption capacity compared to other polymers with high crystallinity e g polyethylene up to 90 yao et al 2021 for polystyrene which has a low crystallinity its adsorption capacity for organic compound was also found not correlated with crystalline regions liu et al 2020 a decrease in adsorption capacity and an increase in surface roughness contact surface area with leaching solution is supposed to cause an increase in additive release from plastics luo et al 2020 this was true for aged pvc 30 and aged cpvc p in this work however the leaching of dnbp from pvc 15 decreased markedly after aging fig 2c this might be explained by the loss of dnbp in plastics via volatilization and degradation during the aging process wang et al 2021 therefore the content of dnbp in plastics before and after aging was measured as shown in fig 3d after 38 d of aging dnbp content dropped from 29 5 to 18 0 for pvc 30 and from 13 7 to 11 8 for pvc 15 potentially because phthalates were less exposed to uv light in plastics with high polymer content and aging of commercial plastics with stabilizers occurred more slowly liu et al 2018 phthalate contents in pvc 3 and cpvc p remained relatively stable over the same time period interestingly although phthalate loss was higher for pvc 30 compared to pvc 15 39 1 vs 13 8 of total dnbp phthalate release from pvc 30 increased while the release by pvc 15 greatly decreased considering that a larger proportion of additives was reported to be released from finer particles due to shorter diffusion channels guo et al 2019 we speculated that a larger percentage of phthalate could be leached out from plastics with higher phthalate content due to wider diffusion channels larger free volume regions in other words pvc 15 had a lower proportion of readily available phthalate owing to the tight contact of phthalate with polymer matrix when the readily available fractions e g the phthalate molecules near plastic inner surface were leached out or lost due to aging the release entered a slow stage resulting in low phthalate concentration in the water phase an illustration of the proposed release scheme of phthalates from pvc microplastics can be found in fig 4 a and b 3 3 effects of solution ph ionic strength and dom on dnbp release solution ph ionic strength and dom have been reported to be important factors affecting the interaction of organic pollutants and solid phase liu et al 2019c zhou et al 2013 therefore their effect on phthalate release from pvc microplastics were examined in this study it was found that solution ph and ionic strength under environmentally relevant conditions had limited effects on dnbp release when solution ph dropped from 7 0 to 3 0 or rose from 7 0 to 9 0 the variation in dnbp release was within 15 while when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 0 2 m the release variation was also 15 fig 5 this can be explained by the fact that phthalates are non ionic compounds and pvc polymers are resistant to acid alkaline salt solutions kumagai et al 2018 liu et al 2019b thus the interaction between phthalate and plastic is less affected by ph and salt ions for example solution ph and ionic strength were recently reported to have minor effect on the capacity of pvc microplastics to adsorb phthalates liu et al 2019b herein our results demonstrated that the ability of microplastics to release phthalates was also not sensitive to the changes of ph and ionic strength in contrast fulvic acid a representative natural dom component showed a remarkable effect on dnbp release from pvc microplastics when fa concentration increased from 0 to 5 20 and 50 mg l dnbp release concentration increased by 22 2 56 3 and 110 respectively fig 6 a when fa concentration further increased to 100 and 200 mg l dnbp release concentration increased to 8 98 and 17 52 mg l 13 folds that in pure water respectively moreover when the leaching solution volume was expanded from 10 to 200 ml the promoting effect of fulvic acid on dnbp release was even more obvious fig s5 the results clearly demonstrated that the presence of fulvic acid could accelerate the release of dnbp from pvc microplastics two reasons might be responsible for that 1 dom had a solubilization effect on hydrophobic organic compounds chiou et al 1986 which would facilitate the diffusion of phthalate into water in this study fulvic acid did show a beneficial effect on the dissolvation of dnbp in water as illustrated in fig 6a dnbp solubility increased with increasing fa concentrations it was noted that dnbp release concentration 17 52 mg l in the fa200 cpvc p system was even higher than its solubility in fa200 solution 11 36 mg l this could be a result of the leaching of dissolved organic carbon doc from plastics romera castillo et al 2018 lee et al 2020 which further increased the solubilization of phthalates 2 fulvic acid solution might have a stronger affinity for plastics than pure water which meant that fa solution could penetrate the plastic matrix better to extract phthalate the high affinity of fulvic acid solution for plastics was evidenced by measuring the contact angle of pvc and leaching solution microplastics originated from lab made films were used in this test as those from commercial pvc product had difficulties in preparing samples for contact angle analysis the result showed that when fa concentration in water increased from 0 to 50 mg l the contact angle between microplastic pvc 15 and aqueous solution decreased from 85 1 to 71 6 fig s6 indicating a higher affinity and infiltration capacity of fa50 solution to plastics therefore we concluded that fa could enhance the release of dnbp from pvc microplastics via increasing the solubility of phthalate and the infiltration capacity of aqueous solution to plastics since it is very common for plastic products to contain more than one phthalate plasticizer to achieve optimized properties the effect of fulvic acid on phthalate release from microplastics with a mixture of dep and dnbp was also examined as shown in fig s7a and b 50 mg l fulvic acid exhibited a comparable and even slightly higher ability to promote dnbp release from microplastics containing two plasticizers pvc 3 dep 15 dnbp compared to those containing single plasticizer pvc 15 dnbp the observation that fulvic acid had little effect on dep release from microplastics containing either single or double plasticizers could be attributed to the inability of fulvic acid to enhance the dissolution diffusion of dep into water phase fig s7c in the study by chiou et al 1986 dissolved humic and fulvic acids were found to be more efficient in enhancing the solubility of organic pollutants with low water solubility because the dom functioned as a large intramolecular nonpolar organic environment for promoting the partitioning like interaction with relatively nonpolar organic molecules compared to dnbp dep with a shorter alkyl chain was more water soluble solubility 591 mg l net et al 2015 and less nonpolar thus the interaction of dep and fulvic acid was assumed to be weaker collectively the results demonstrated that the presence of another phthalate plasticizer in plastics did not compromise the beneficial effect of fulvic acid on dnbp release and the increase of pollutant solubility played a more significant role in the enhanced dnbp release than the increased affinity of leaching solution for microplastics in addition it was noted that after 24 h the released concentration of dep from pvc 3 dep was 0 14 mg l while it was 9 29 mg l for pvc 3 dep 15 dnbp the large increase in dep release could attributed to the slightly lower dep adsorption on microplastics in the presence of dnbp data not shown and the increase in plastic free volume due to the incorporation of 15 dnbp interestingly we found that the co existence of fa and nacl could further promote the release of dnbp from cpvc p microplastics compared to fa alone in fa50 nacl 0 01 0 1 m solution dnbp release concentration at 24 h was 4 0 5 1 folds of that in fa0 while the release in fa50 was only 2 1 times higher than that in fa0 fig 6b the releasing kinetics over a period of 48 h also clearly showed a greater promotion effect of fa nacl on phthalate release than fa alone fig 6b the influence of the co occurrence of dom and salt ions has been rarely reported in previous studies and the underlying mechanism is still unclear since the promoting effect of fa nacl was not observed for lab made plastics and fa nacl did not further enhance dnbp solubility or plastic leaching solution affinity fig s6 it was proposed that other components present in commercial plastics might have played a significant role more detailed discussion is provided in the following paragraph when the ionic strength increased to 0 2 m the promoting effect of fa nacl was less obvious probably because ionic strength could change the aggregation state of the microplastic and make the microplastic easy to agglomerate liu et al 2019b consequently the channels through which chemical additives migrate from particles to the water phase were blocked resulting in a decrease in phthalate release in order to elucidate the mechanism that might be responsible for the higher release of phthalate in fulvic acid nacl solution we measured the changes in phthalate adsorption capacity and doc leaching of commercial plastics in the presence of fa50 the kd value of phthalate adsorption on cpvc p decreased by 22 compared to the control fa0 while the decrease reached 44 for fa50 0 01m nacl fig s8 the result demonstrated that in fa50 nacl solution phthalate had a higher potential to diffuse into the aqueous phase which was consistent with the superior release capacity under fulvic acid nacl conditions moreover doc analysis showed that a higher amount of dissolved organic matter net leaching carbon total carbon fulvic acid carbon phthalate carbon was leached out from commercial plastics under fa50 nacl 9 5 1 5 mg c l condition than that under fa50 4 6 0 6 mg c l condition further three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied for characterization of the composition of leached doc from fig s9 we could see that 0 01 m nacl did not affect the spectrum of fulvic acid 50 mg l but it showed a profound effect on the spectrum of doc leached from cpvc p in fa50 0 01m nacl solution more fulvic acid like and soluble microbial byproduct like substances were leached out from plastics which might have facilitated the diffusion of dnbp into the water phase thus the leaching of organic matter with surface active properties was presumably the primary reason for the observed decrease in dnbp adsorption and increase in dnbp release to explore if the promoting effect of fa nacl on phthalate release was common for microplastics generated from commercial products microplastics derived from a white pvc tube cpvc white purchased online with unknown origin were used for phthalate release experiment as observed for cpvc p cpvc white also released more dnbp under fa50 0 01m nacl condition 10 74 mg l than those under fa50 6 00 mg l and fa0 2 73 mg l conditions fig s10 doc analysis showed that net doc leaching was also the highest under fa50 0 01m nacl conditions and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis indicated that more soluble microbial byproduct like substances were present fig s10 the microbial byproduct like substances refer to a wide range of dissolved organic matter which show peak fluorescence intensity at ex em 250 280 380 nm they can be hydroxy acids amino acids and proteins etc chen et al 2003 the results suggested that it might be common for plastics to contain surface active components whose leaching could accelerate the release of phthalate plasticizers it is well reported that surfactants can be used as additives in plastics to enhance compatibility hydrophilicity and antifog properties camani et al 2021 irusta et al 2009 nerin et al 2018 recently putative surfactant molecules were detected in the leachate of disposable plastic masks sullivan et al 2021 hence it was possible that the leached organic matter was the surfactants which were incorporated during the manufacturing of plastics the exact mechanism for the effect of fa nacl on surfactant and dnbp leaching was not clear but might be related to the fact that surface active agents contained both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups this amphiphilic nature likely led to an affinity with both aromatic fa molecules and nacl song et al 2018 which increased the dissolution of surfactant in aqueous solution in addition sodium salts have been reported to be able to reduce the surface tension and critical micelle concentration of ionic surfactants to enhance the solubilization of organic pollutants huang et al 2015 the mechanism putatively involved in fa nacl mediated doc and phthalate leaching was illustrated in fig 4c although the actual functioning components could not be identified based on current data the results regarding the co occurrence of dom and nacl are of great significance since salt ions are commonly found in water bodies soil solutions and commercial plastics usually contain a variety of additive chemicals 4 conclusion in this study the release behavior of phthalate plasticizer from pvc microplastics in aqueous solutions was comprehensively studied we found that particle size plasticizer content aging of plastics and dom presence had great effects on phthalate release while solution ph and ionic strength showed minor effect in general smaller particles higher plasticizer content aging of flexible pvc and the presence of fulvic acid would lead to higher leaching of phthalate dnbp in aqueous solutions differences in diffusion paths surface roughness hydrophilicity phthalate solubility and adsorption capacity were probably the underlying mechanisms for the observed changes in dnbp release moreover the co existence of fulvic acid and nacl was found to have a superior promoting effect on dnbp release possibly because fulvic acid nacl could induce the leaching of other additive chemicals with surfactant like properties the results demonstrate that in future studies it may be necessary to include the leaching of additives under dom and salt ions co existing conditions and pay more attentions on the plastics with surfactant like components as these chemicals may significantly accelerate the release of other toxic compounds overall this study represents a preliminary investigation of the leaching of phthalate plasticizers from microplastics into the surrounding environment the release of plasticizers in real aquatic or soil environments and even animal digestive systems merits further investigation to accurately evaluate the risks associated with microplastics supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this
