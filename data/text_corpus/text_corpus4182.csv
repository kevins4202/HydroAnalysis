20910,two compact hybrid mooring concepts adopting top synthetic fibre rope polyester or nylon submerged buoy and bottom chain design are studied in addition to these two mooring concepts another concept that adds two clumped weights on the bottom segment of the hybrid mooring with nylon rope is also studied the mooring tension raos are obtained from seventeen regular wave tests to a point absorber moored by these three mooring configurations five spectral methods including dirlik tovo benasciutti zhao baker wirsching light and Î±0 75 methods are applied to study mooring fatigue damage five irregular wave model tests are performed the rainflow counting method in conjunction with measured mooring tension time series is applied to calculate mooring fatigue damage and the values are used to calibrate the spectral methods the spectral methods are then used to evaluate the long term fatigue damage of these three moorings in the application in the west portuguese coast the rainflow counting method is applied to the mooring tension series generated from estimated mooring tension spectra to analysis fatigue damage and the results are acted as the reference values for checking the accuracy of spectral methods then the performance of spectral methods is evaluated based on the akaike s information criterion keywords mooring fatigue damage synthetic fibre rope hydrodynamic model tests spectral fatigue analysis rainflow counting method akaike s information criterion 1 introduction the main role of mooring system is to keep floating structure on station which is strongly associated to the safety and performance of floating system chain and wire are two generally used materials for mooring ropes recently the synthetic fibre ropes are getting more and more attention in the application for the moorings of deepwater offshore platforms and shallow water marine renewable energy devices polyester is considered as the most popular synthetic fibre mooring rope for application to deepwater and ultra deepwater offshore structures and it has been successfully applied in several projects such as the mad dog spar bugg et al 2004 red hawk spar haslum et al 2005 the polyester rope is superior to wire rope in deepwater mooring applications it is much cheaper and has lighter weight and higher durability flory et al 2007 kota et al 1999 furthermore it was claimed that the polyester rope shows better station keeping performance than the wire ropes flory et al 2007 in recent years numerous studies focus on developing wave energy converters wecs due to the growing problem of global warming and air pollution among the variety of wec concepts floating devices attract great attention because the wave energy density in open sea is much larger than in nearshore guedes soares et al 2012 the cost of the mooring system is one of the concerned issues of the wec project and it can be approximated to 10 of the total wec structural cost and can be as large as 30 castro santos et al 2018 2020 thomsen et al 2017 furthermore the mooring system for motion dependent wecs which take advantage of motion responses to harvest energy should be compliant enough to avoid interference with the energy harvesting activities xu et al 2019 in view of this the low modulus synthetic fibre ropes such as polyester and nylon are recommended to be applied in the marine renewable energy devices wang et al 2019 2021 weller et al 2015 the performance of hybrid mooring system using polyester rope for a point absorber was experimentally studied xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a in the previous study the nylon rope was adopted for keeping a floating oscillating water column on station and the performance of the mooring system was extensively evaluated by hydrodynamic model tests xu et al 2020b in addition to the mooring material the mooring configuration also has significant influence on the dynamics of floating systems the slack taut and catenary are three commonly seen mooring concepts a novel mooring concept that combines the merits of catenary and taut mooring systems for the deepwater application was proposed by ji et al 2011 based on fully coupled dynamic analysis it was found that this novel design can reduce floating structure motion responses and mooring dynamic tensions this concept was further developed by adding a submerged buoy on top segment and clumped weights on bottom segment of taut mooring ropes yuan et al 2014 it was concluded that attached buoy has significant influence on the mooring dynamic tensions however in the deepwater application the clumped weights and buoy have limited influence on motion responses of top floating platforms according to the experimental studies ji and yuan 2015 xu et al 2018a 2018b recently it was experimentally verified that the hybrid mooring concepts show good performance in the application for wecs which helps to reduce the snap load events xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a the fatigue limit state fls design is one of the crucial steps during the mooring system design and the essential point during the fls design is to estimate the mooring fatigue damage precisely generally the fatigue damage is calculated based on linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the rainflow counting rfc algorithm in conjunction with s n or t n curve is a widely used approach to study mooring fatigue damage huang et al 2011 xu et al 2020a yang et al 2016 2017 the experimental study is considered as the most reliable method to obtain mooring tension time series in specified sea state for mooring fatigue damage analysis however it is unrealistic to apply only the experimental method to study long term mooring fatigue damage since numerous sea conditions need to be considered and it is extremely expensive and time consuming to perform model tests for all possible sea cases the fully coupled dynamic analysis which takes the coupled effect between mooring system and top floating structure into consideration provides an alternative good solution to analysis mooring dynamics however it still needs countless efforts to implement fully coupled dynamic simulations in long term mooring fatigue damage analysis in view of this low 2011a developed a hybrid time frequency method to increase analysis efficiency unfortunately the current numerical tools are not able to fully capture the dynamics of synthetic fibre mooring ropes due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties applying the dynamic stiffness in floating structure synthetic fibre mooring system coupled dynamic analysis is an alternative solution to get mooring tension time series huang et al 2011 pham et al 2019 however it is a simplified approach the time dependent mechanical properties are neglected in addition to the time domain and hybrid time frequency methods efficient spectral methods which are able to present reasonable results are very popular in structural fatigue damage analysis the mooring rope suffers complex environmental loads generally the mooring tension shows both the low frequency and wave frequency characteristics in view of this jiao and moan 1990 developed a method to deal with bimodal fatigue damage and this method is recommend by design codes api 2005 dnvgl 2015 the jiao moan method was further improved by fixing two assumptions about load amplitude low 2010 the modified bimodal method presents more accurate estimation to structural fatigue damage however it is difficult to implement consequently a simple and accurate practical formula for fatigue damage analysis due to a bimodal gaussian process was developed low 2014 the narrow band method wide band methods and bimodal methods were applied to study the fatigue damage of mooring chain and the results were compared between each other xue and chen 2018 however there is still no research to compare the performance of different spectral methods for synthetic fibre rope fatigue damage analysis it is known that synthetic fibre ropes are widely used in mooring systems of offshore platforms as well as marine energy capturing devices however there is still no reliable method available to predict the long term fatigue damage of synthetic fibre mooring rope accurately and efficiently in this work the feasibility study of combining the measured mooring tension raos and spectral methods to predict the fatigue damage of synthetic fibre mooring ropes for wecs is carried out the analysis procedure is organised as follows step 1 carry out the regular wave tests to measure mooring tension raos of three mooring concepts step 2 carry out the irregular wave tests to measure mooring tension time series under operational and survival wave conditions step 3 the measured mooring tension raos step 1 are used to predict the mooring tension spectra under the wave conditions in step 2 once the mooring tension spectra are estimated by the measured mooring tension raos the indirect rainflow counting method estimate mooring fatigue damage from the generated mooring tension time series by inverse fast fourier transform ifft algorithm as well as spectral methods are applied to predict the mooring fatigue damage under the wave conditions of step 2 the accuracy of these methods are calibrated by the fatigue damage which is estimated by applying the rainflow counting method directly to the measured mooring time series step 4 the calibrated spectral methods in conjunction with the predicted mooring tension spectra are applied to calculate the long term mooring fatigue damage the fatigue damage estimated by the indirect rainflow counting method is acted as the reference value to rank the performance of spectral methods according to akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1973 the feasibility of spectral methods in long term mooring fatigue damage analysis is investigated and the most suitable spectral method is suggested based on the results of this study 2 mooring fatigue analysis the t n approach is a popular method to study synthetic fibre mooring rope fatigue damage under complicated sea conditions xu and guedes soares 2020a and it is recommended by design codes api 2014 dnvgl 2015 prior to applying the t n method the mooring tension range needs to be normalized i e using the ratio between mooring tension range to the minimum breaking load mbl based on laboratory tests an equation can be regressed to express the relation between normalized tension range u and the corresponding number of load cycles n causes to cumulative fatigue failure 1 n k u m where k is the intercept parameter and m is the slope of t n curve respectively u is the ratio between mooring tension range to the minimum breaking load mbl based on the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the accumulated structural fatigue damage is given as 2 d i 1 n c n i n i where n i is the number of cycle range u i during the loading process n i is number of cycle range u i leads to structural failure which is determined according to eq 1 n c is the total number of all load cycles 2 1 time domain analysis the load cycles can be counted directly from mooring tension time series which is the most precise method to obtain the number of load cycles several counting approaches have been developed although the rainflow counting method developed by matsuishi and endo 1968 is generally considered as the preferable approach to get the structural load cycles dowling 1971 in this work the rainflow counting method is adopted to obtain the mooring load cycles for estimating fatigue damage brodtkorb et al 2000 2 2 spectral methods the spectral method is another solution to evaluate mooring fatigue damage and it is much more efficient than the time domain analysis furthermore the spectral method is able to present accurate enough estimations of the structural fatigue damage when the loading process is not complicated the details of the implementation of spectral method for calculating mooring fatigue damage can be found in related design codes api 2005 dnvgl 2015 by combining eqs 1 and 2 the expected damage rate can be calculated as 3 d 1 k e i 1 n c u i m n 0 k 0 u m f u u d u where n 0 is mean number of tension cycles which is calculated as n 0 Î½ x 0 Ï for an idealized narrowband gaussian

Î» n is the nth order spectral moment of stationary stochastic process x t which is calculated as 5 Î» n 0 Ï n s x Ï d Ï where Ï is the frequency unit rad s s x Ï is the one side spectrum assuming the load process x t is narrow band then the probability density function of tension amplitude r can be depicted by the rayleigh distribution 6 f r r r Ï x 2 exp r 2 2 Ï x 2 the bandwidth

amplitude is known the structural expected damage rate can be calculated in closed form 8 d n b v x 0 k 0 2 r m f r r d r v x 0 k 2 2 Ï x m Î³ m 2 1 however the statistics of mooring tension amplitude seldom satisfy the narrow band assumption the mooring cables are subjected to combined wave frequency and low frequency loads due to first order and second order wave forces as well as low frequency current and wind forces api 2005 gao and moan 2007 xu and guedes soares 2020a consequently many researchers applied more sophisticated spectral methods to estimate mooring fatigue damage such as combined spectral method gao and moan 2008 jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 2011b in this work the performance of different wide band spectral methods in the analysis of wec mooring fatigue damage is studied 2 2 1 dirlik method dirlik 1985 proposed an empirical expression to predict structural fatigue damage under wide band loading the probabilistic density function of structural load amplitude

2 2 4 wirsching light method wirsching and light 1980 proposed an empirical coefficient to correct the narrow band fatigue damage the correction factor is derived by applying monto carlo simulations

this approach has been verified to present good estimations to structural fatigue damage benasciutti and tovo 2006 despite lacking any theoretical proof 2 3 long term fatigue damage generally the long term wave conditions in the concerned site are discretized into a series of equivalent sea states i e the wave scatter diagram the long term mooring fatigue damage is then evaluated by adding the fatigue damage in each sea state api 2005 the accumulated annual fatigue damage in ith individual sea state is calculated as 28 d i 3 1536 e 7 p i d i where d i is the expected or average damage rate in ith sea state p i is the occurrence probability of sea state i and 3 1536e 07 corresponds to the 1 year time period in seconds then the total annual fatigue damage is calculated as 29 d d i i 3 1536 e 7 p i d i 3 model descriptions 3 1 point absorber a cylindrical point absorber with conical bottom is studied in this work fig 1 shows the 1 40 model of wec the height of conical bottom is 7 5 cm the total height of wec model is 50 cm the main parameters of wec are listed in table 1 where Ï is the diameter d is the free draft of wec without mooring lines being installed rxx ryy rzz are the gyration radius about x y and z axis respectively the height of the centre of gravity is 16 3 cm where the base line is located on the bottom of model 3 2 hybrid mooring systems and pto as seen in fig 2 the mooring system consists of three mooring legs with the azimuth angle between each two mooring legs equal to 120 the 2m and 3m are symmetrically arranged and the 1m is the most loaded one in head sea condition the pto system is an essential component of a wec which plays the role to convert wave energy into electric power in the model tests the pto system is usually discarded due to the complexity to be scaled down pto in model scale moura paredes et al 2016 sheng et al 2014 unfortunately the pto system could affect wec hydrodynamic responses due to its damping and stiffness to simulate the effect of pto system and simplify testing procedure yang et al 2020 2018 used a heave plate and a linear spring to simulate the damping and stiffness of pto system in this study a similar design was adopted as seen in fig 1 a square steel plate was used as the heave plate during the model tests the length and width of heave plate is 10 cm and the thickness is 1 mm the heave plate was rigidly fixed to a connection bar to ensure that the movement of heave plate follows the motion of the wec the connection bar was made of steel rod which was 50 cm in length the heave plate was fixed 80 cm underwater when the wec was free floating to reduce the influence of wave motion on heave plate as can be seen in fig 3 a wire with a length of 92 86 cm including the clamps on both ends was used to connect heave plate and spring the diameter of wire is 3 5 mm and the mass per unit length in air is 0 108 kg with the clamps considered the stiffness of spring is 29 22 n m which is used to simulate the stiffness of pto the top synthetic fibre rope bottom chain and submerged buoy attached on the joint point between these two segments constitute the hybrid mooring legs fig 3 shows the sketch of hybrid mooring systems a total of two different synthetic fibre ropes are studied including polyester and nylon hereafter the mooring system with the polyester rope is named as hyb while the one with nylon rope is called as hnb in addition to these two concepts as seen in fig 3 b another configuration with two clumped weights attached on the end of the hnb chain is designed and it is denoted as hnbw the mass of the buoy is 0 436 kg and its buoyancy is 10 n the length of synthetic fibre rope and chain is 1 23 m and 1 7 m respectively the masses of clumped weights increase from top to the end of mooring and the mass in air is 0 511 kg and 1 229 kg respectively the distance between these two clumped weights is 10 cm and the distance of cm2 to the anchor point is 10 cm the main parameters of the mooring rope are given in table 2 where w is the mass per unit length in air lr denotes mooring radius l e is the effective length of mooring rope two clamps were used to connect top synthetic top to the hook on the wec and mooring chain to the floor the length of clamp is 55 mm the length of the clamp used to connect the chain to the anchor point is 22 mm in other words the total length of the mooring leg is 3 062 m both the nylon and polyester are braided 16 strand ropes and the nominal diameter is 3 mm the model tests were designed to set the pretension of each different mooring lines to be identical in order to exclude the differences of system dynamics due to mooring pretension however it is difficult to implement due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties of synthetic fibre ropes besides the length of the synthetic ropes keeps changing slightly due to the water absorbing phenomenon the details of each mooring tensions are listed in table 3 4 validation of accuracy of spectral methods for mooring fatigue damage analysis 4 1 regular wave tests to obtain mooring tension raos the model scale was determined as 1 40 by considering the dimensions of wave flume and the quality of experimental results a series of hydrodynamic model tests were conducted in the towing tank of etsin universidad politÃ©cnica de madrid which with the width and length equal to 3 8 m and 96 m respectively and the depth is 2 107 m the model tests were conducted according to the froude similitude rule and all the experimental data are converted to full scale seventeen regular wave model tests were conducted to obtain motion responses and mooring tension raos the incident wave period in model tests varies in the range between 0 7 s and 2 s and the wave height is equal to 0 05 m i e the wave height in full scale is 2 m the three main motion response raos are given in fig 4 it is seen that the heave motion raos curve has one peak that occurs near the corresponding natural heave period as for the surge and pitch motion raos two peaks can be found the second peak of pitch motion raos is caused by the pitch resonance which also has significant influence on the surge motion responses fig 5 shows mooring tension raos since the 2m and 3m are symmetrically arranged only the results of 2m are plotted it is seen that the 1m mooring dynamics of nylon and nylon with clumped weights are similar which indicates that the influence of clumped weights on mooring dynamics is small under small wave height tests compared to 1m the difference of 2m dynamics between these two systems is great the main reason is that the difference of 2m pretension is greater than that of 1m which can be verified in table 3 in most cases the dynamics of polyester rope are similar to that of the other two systems the major difference is found when the incident wave period ranges from 9 s to 11 s where the dynamics of polyester are greater than that of nylon ropes two peaks can be found in mooring tension raos curves the first one is caused by the first peak responses of surge and pitch as seen in fig 4 while the heave resonance gives rise to the second peak tension the 1m suffers the largest load in the head sea wave condition the dynamics of 1m are much greater than that of 2m however the difference between them reduces with the increase of incident wave period to check the uncertainties of measured mooring tension raos the regular wave test with t 9 25s for hnb system was repeated five times and the mooring tension results are shown in fig 6 it is clearly seen that the measured mooring tension raos are similar in these five tests the variance of 1m and 2m tension raos is equal to 2 5 and 0 1 respectively it demonstrates that the measured data are reliable the mooring dynamic is nonlinear due to the influence of the drag force xu and guedes soares 2020b furthermore the material nonlinearity of synthetic fibre rope could increase the nonlinearity of mooring dynamics as a consequence the influence of incident wave height on mooring tension raos need to be studied in this work four regular wave tests with the same period t 7 39s but different incident wave height are conducted the results are plotted in fig 7 the effect of incident wave height on mooring dynamics is considerable it is found that the mooring tension rao decreases with the increase of wave height for all discussed mooring cases it is found that the difference between tension rao is greater than 20 when wave height is equal to 0 4m and 1m 4 2 irregular wave tests to check spectral methods for mooring fatigue damage analysis once the mooring tension raos have been obtained the mooring tension spectrum can be efficiently calculated in any given sea condition 30 s t e n Ï t r a o 2 s w Ï where s ten Ï is the estimated mooring tension spectrum in the given wave spectrum s w Ï t rao is the measured mooring tension raos under the wave conditions with wave height equal to 2 m as given in fig 5 theoretically after the estimation of mooring tension spectrum the expected mooring fatigue in the concerned wave state can be then predicted by the spectral methods however the spectral methods are based on the gaussian assumption while the statistical characteristic of mooring tension is very complicated especially for wec mooring which is easy to trigger snap loads in harsh sea condition xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a the gaussian may fail to predict the expected number of load cycles furthermore eq 30 estimates the mooring tension spectrum based on the linear assumption however the mooring tension is nonlinear the accuracy of estimated of mooring tension spectrum needs to be checked another problem is that the influence of wave height on measured mooring tension raos cannot be neglected as shown in fig 7 it is reasonable to carry out the regular wave model tests to obtain mooring tension raos by setting the regular wave height to be identical to the significant wave height of random wave conditions unfortunately the significant wave height of long term wave condition of target site varies in a wide range as a consequence it is necessary to check the feasibility of spectral methods in mooring fatigue damage analysis in this study five irregular wave tests including three operational op one heave resonance hr and one survival sv sea states were conducted to calibrate the accuracy of spectral methods the random waves were simulated by joswap spectrum the main parameters are summarized in table 4 where t p is the peak period h s is the significant wave height Î³ is the peak enhancement factor the duration of each irregular wave mode test is 30 min which is longer than 3 h in full scale the flowchart of calibration of the accuracy of estimated tension spectrum and spectral methods in mooring fatigue damage analysis is shown in fig 8 a total of three approaches are applied to study mooring fatigue damage while the results estimated by applying the rainflow counting algorithm to the measured mooring time series are considered as the reference values generally the loading time series can be obtained from the load spectrum by applying the inverse fast fourier transform ifft algorithm then the rainflow counting algorithm in conjunction with the converted load time series is applied to study structural fatigue damage and this method is usually applied to calibrate the accuracy of spectral methods if the load spectrum is given in this work this approach is adopted to study mooring fatigue damage in order to check the accuracy of estimated mooring spectra as well as converted mooring tension time series in addition to these two kinds of time domain methods five spectral methods are also used to study mooring fatigue damage and their accuracies are checked by the reference values the mooring tensions of 1m and 2m in 5000 s are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively here only the results in op1 and survival wave conditions are plotted it is seen that the mooring dynamics of these three systems are similar the dynamic tension of 1m is greater than 2m and the difference increases with the wave height the scenarios that the zero tensions followed by spike tensions are observed in the 1m tension time series when the wec operates in survival wave condition this is understood that the mooring rope changes from slack to taut suddenly which gives rise to snap events however this phenomenon is not found in the 2m tension time series the rainflow counting technique is applied to extract load cycles from measured mooring tension time series in random wave tests figs 11 and 12 show rainflow tension cycle histograms of 1m and 2m in op1 wave condition where rfc denotes the rainflow counting it is seen that rainflow tension cycle amplitude of 1m concentrated on the range between 50 and 150 kn for all mooring concepts despite the difference between mean load as shown in fig 12 the most frequent load amplitude of 2m ranges between 40 and 100 kn for all mooring concepts by comparing the results of fig 11 with 12 it can be easily identified that the 1m suffers much greater fatigue damage than 2m the 1m has similar number of small load amplitude to that of 2m furthermore the number of load amplitude which is greater than 200 kn is considerable in 1m however it is rarely seen in 2m besides it is seen the load amplitude probability density of different mooring systems is similar and it can be easily described by suitable probability models the mooring tension histograms in survival wave conditions are shown in figs 13 and 14 where it can be clearly seen that the probability densities of load amplitude are rather discrete due to the snap events for all mooring concepts it is difficult to describe them accurately by general probability models the amplitude centre is between 100 and 600 kn for 1m where the major component of 2m ranges from 50 to 200 kn it indicates that the fatigue damage of 1m is much greater than that of 2m the mooring tension spectral densities estimated by eq 30 in different wave conditions are then compared with the corresponding measured ones here in this work only the results in two representative test cases are given as seen in figs 15 17 in the op1 wave condition it is seen that the measured 1m tension spectra are well predicted by the linear equation for all mooring cases however a considerable component which locates between 1 4 and 2 rad s is discarded by eq 30 and a spectral peak occurs in 0 2 rad s due to surge resonance is also not considered because the regular wave tests were conducted in the wave frequency between 0 5 and 1 4 rad s this may introduce error in fatigue damage analysis in order to take most energies into account during the mooring fatigue damage analysis it is suggested that the tested wave period for measuring mooring tension raos should be as wide as possible the measured tension spectral densities of 2m in op1 wave condition are also in good agreement with the results calculated by mooring tension raos as for the survival wave condition it is observed that all the predicted 1m tension spectra are in good agreement with the measured ones for all these three mooring concepts the tension spectral densities of 2m are overestimated eq 30 in survival wave condition especially for the case of nylon with weights overall the method that applies linear tension raos to obtain mooring tension spectrum is reasonable in this study during the application of spectral methods the mooring fatigue damage is determined by the spectral parameters as a consequence to study the feasibility of predicted mooring tension spectra in fatigue damage analysis it is necessary to check these spectral parameters carefully the mooring tension spectral parameters in op1 and survival wave conditions are summarized in tables 5 and 6 where predicted denotes the mooring tension spectra predicted by tension raos measured means the measured mooring tension spectra the standard deviation is defined as Î» 0 and the Î´ is the bandwidth factor which is calculated as 31 Î´ 1 Î» 1 2 Î» 0 Î» 2 for an ideal narrow band process Î´ approaches zero it is seen that mooring tensions are wide band process in the operational wave condition the predicted spectral parameters are in good agreement with the measured ones as for the survival wave condition it is found that standard deviations and upcrossing rate of peaks are not well estimated by predicted spectra this difference would introduce the estimation errors if the predicted spectra is adopted for mooring fatigue damage analysis since the fatigue damage is proportional to the Ï m v p the mooring tension time series can be obtained from the tension spectrum by applying the ifft technique 32 x t i 1 n 2 s t e n Ï i Î´ Ï i cos Ï i t Î¸ i where x t is the mooring tension in time t s ten Ï is the estimated mooring tension spectral density by using measured tension raos Î¸ is a random phase angle n is the number of frequencies the quality of the generated tension time series depends on the frequency interval time step and simulation duration it is recommended that the n should be greater than 1000 dnv gl 2017 and n 20 000 was used in the study of park et al 2014 in this work n 10 000 is adopted by applying the interpolation method the time duration is 3 h and time step is 0 02s fig 18 shows generated 1m tension time series of nylon rope in survival wave condition the spectral methods and indirect rainflow counting method apply the rainflow counting to the mooring tension time series generated by ifft are based on the gaussian assumption prior to applying these methods to mooring fatigue damage analysis it is necessary to check whether the gaussian assumption is satisfied by noticing that the kurtosis and skewness are useful to identify gaussian property kurtosis is equal to 3 and the skewness is 0 for a gaussian process these two values in different wave conditions are summarized in tables 7 and 8 it can be clearly seen that most of the mooring tensions are close to gaussian and the most different case from gaussian is the 2m tension of polyester mooring hyb under survival wave condition then different methods introduced above are applied to estimate the expected mooring fatigue damage rate in these five cases for the polyester rope k and m is recommended as 7 5 and 9 respectively api 2014 while k and m for the nylon rope are 10 6 and 3 5 which are determined by fitting the experimental data of ridge et al 2010 the minimum breaking strength of polyester and nylon rope in full scale are estimated by empirical equations barltrop 1998 johanning et al 2006 xu et al 2019 as described in fig 8 the accuracy of spectral methods and generated time series are checked by the results of measured mooring time series figs 19 and 20 show the relative errors between fatigue damage estimated by spectral method and direct rainflow counting method apply rainflow counting method to the measured mooring tension time series where tb denotes tovo benasciutti method zb is the zhao baker method wl means wirsching light method besides the accuracy of estimated mooring tension spectra and the quality of generated time series are checked by comparing the fatigue damage estimated by the indirect rainflow counting method rfc s apply rainflow counting method to the generated mooring tension time series with ifft technique with the results of direct rainflow counting method figs 19 and 20 are double y axis the left one is the relative errors of expected fatigue rate estimated by different methods to the results of direct rainflow counting algorithm while the right axis is the expected fatigue rate calculated by direct rainflow counting method logarithm to the base 10 the relative error is calculated as 33 e log d rfc log d log d rfc 100 where d r f c is the expected fatigue damage rate calculated from measured mooring tension time series by the rainflow counting method d is the expected fatigue damage rate calculated by the current method it is clearly seen that all the spectral methods are able to present good estimations to mooring fatigue damage in most cases since most of mooring tensions are close to gaussian and the spectral parameters are well presented by the predicted mooring tension spectra the empirical Î±0 75 method provides the most accurate estimation to fatigue damage of nylon ropes among all spectral methods for most mooring cases on the contrary the errors of wl method are the greatest except for the case of 2m polyester rope it is found that all spectral methods fail to present good estimations of fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope in survival wave condition the relative errors between spectral methods and rfc are greater than 11 it should be noticed that the comparison is given in form of expected fatigue damage rate in other words the errors of 3 h fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope estimated by spectral methods are significant according to the results in table 6 it is found that for the 2m polyester tension in survival wave condition the standard deviation and expected rate of occurrence of peaks are not well represented by the predicted mooring tension spectra as for the polyester rope these differences will be amplified significantly in fatigue damage analysis since the m value of t n curve of polyester rope is great and the fatigue damage is proportional to the Ï m v p furthermore the non gaussian property of 2m polyester tension in survival wave condition cannot be neglected according to the results in table 8 these factors lead to the poor performance of spectral methods in estimating fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope in survival wave condition furthermore it is seen that the spectral methods show better performance in estimating fatigue damage of 1m than in the application of 2m the reason can be found in tables 7 and 8 where it is found that the 2m mooring tensions show greater non gaussian property than the 1m mooring tensions in addition to the installation position the mooring material also affects the accuracy of spectral methods since the fatigue damage strongly associated to the parameters of t n curve it is seen that the spectral methods present more accurate estimation for fatigue damage of nylon ropes than that of polyester rope because the spectral fatigue damage is proportional to the Ï m in other words for the mooring material with the great m value the error of estimated mooring fatigue damage due to the difference of standard deviation of mooring tension would be amplified significantly it is noticed that the m value of polyester rope is greater than that of the nylon rope the indirect rainflow counting method presents good estimations of mooring fatigue damage for all studied cases especially for the 2m polyester where it is seen that the errors are smaller than that of spectral methods in all tested wave conditions it indicates that it is reasonable to use the estimated fatigue damage of indirect rainflow counting method as the reference value to study the performance of spectral methods in long term mooring fatigue damage analysis by checking the right axis of figs 19 and 20 it is observed that the nylon rope suffers much greater damage than the polyester rope the reason is that both the mbl and m of polyester rope is greater than that of nylon rope if compare the mooring fatigue damage in operational wave conditions i e h s 2m it is seen that the fatigue damage increases with wave peak period for most mooring cases the influence of significant wave height on fatigue damage is significant it is found that the mooring fatigue in survival wave condition is much greater than that in op1 wave condition to discuss the influence of attached clumped weights on mooring fatigue damage the fatigue damage of nylon mooring ropes estimated by the direct rainflow counting algorithm in these five wave conditions are compared with the results of nylon mooring ropes with clumped weights and fig 21 shows the comparisons as seen in fig 21 the effect of clumped weights on mooring fatigue damage is limited in most operational wave conditions however the mooring fatigue is slightly reduced in the survival wave condition with clumped weights attached this is explained that the attached clumped weights help to reduce the amplitude of snap loads xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a 5 long term fatigue damage analysis 5 1 long term wave statistics in the target site a specified location that is located off the west portuguese coast is assumed as the target site and the latitude and longitude of the selected location is 39n and 9 5w respectively the wave hindcast analysis is a popular numerical method to study long term wave conditions and extensive results are available for the portuguese coast silva et al 2015 2018 the wave scatter diagram in the target site for the period between 1979 and 2007 is shown in fig 22 5 2 long term fatigue damage the mooring tension spectrum in each wave state of the target site can then be estimated by applying eq 30 in head sea condition and the random wave is modelled by the jonswap spectrum after calculating the mooring tension spectrum in each sea state the mooring fatigue damage can be estimated by spectra methods and indirect rainflow counting approach and the result of indirect rainflow counting method is acted as the reference value then the total annual fatigue damage can be estimated by eq 29 to discuss the composition of long term mooring fatigue damage the ratios of mooring fatigue damage estimated by indirect rfc method in operational wave conditions to that in survival wave conditions are plotted in fig 23 the sea state with h s 8m is considered as the survival wave condition and the fatigue damage ratio d r is calculated as 34 d r i 1 n o d o i j 1 n s d s j where d o is the mooring fatigue in operational wave conditions d s is the mooring fatigue in survival wave conditions n o and n s is the number of operational and survival wave conditions respectively according to the results in fig 23 it is seen that the nylon ropes suffer the most damage in operational sea states i e the nylon fatigue damage in operational wave conditions is more than 5 times to that in survival wave conditions however as for the polyester rope the fatigue damage under survival wave conditions is comparable to that in operational wave conditions despite of the fact that the survival sea state is rare it can be explained that in the survival wave conditions a considerable number of large amplitude load cycle will occur as seen in figs 13 and 14 even the snap events can be found in the 1m as seen in figs 9 and 13 which give rise to significant load amplitude and the number of snap events are considerable furthermore the slope of t n curve m of polyester rope is great which indicates that the influence of large amplitude load cycles on fatigue damage of polyester rope is more significant than that of nylon rope and the total fatigue damage of polyester rope in survival wave conditions accounts for a considerable proportion of long term fatigue damage the fatigue life of different mooring concepts in the specified target are summarized in table 9 and the fatigue life of synthetic fibre mooring rope is calculated as api 2014 35 l 1 10 d it is seen that the spectral methods present good estimations of the fatigue damage of nylon ropes as the estimated nylon rope fatigue life both for the nylon and nylon with clumped weights by spectral methods are in good agreement with the ones predicted by rainflow counting approach in the head sea condition the 1m is the most loaded one among the mooring system it is seen that the 1m suffers much greater damage than the 2m which indicates that it is necessary to take great care to the maintenance of 1m during its service life furthermore by comparing the results of spectral methods with that of rainflow counting algorithm it is concluded that the dirlik and empirical Î±0 75 methods provide the most accurate estimation to the fatigue damage of nylon mooring ropes while the wl shows the worst performance the influence of attached clumped weights on mooring fatigue damage can be evaluated by checking the results of nylon and nylon with clumped weights systems it is found that the fatigue life of these two systems are similar which implies that the effect of clumped weights on mooring long term fatigue damage is negligible in consistency with the experimental results the performance of spectral methods for estimating polyester rope fatigue damage is inferior to its application in nylon rope fatigue analysis it is observed that the spectral methods fail to present accurate estimation of long term fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope the reason is that the fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope in survival wave condition has great contribution to its long term fatigue damage as given in fig 23 unfortunately according to the results of fig 20 b the spectral methods introduce great errors in calculating fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope under survival wave condition however the spectral methods can still present acceptable fatigue damage estimation to the 1m polyester rope in different from the nylon rope it is seen that the tb is the preferable method in estimating polyester rope fatigue damage furthermore it is seen that the nylon rope suffers much greater fatigue damage than polyester rope 5 3 evaluation the performance of fatigue damage model in frequency domain in order to evaluate the performance of each spectral method carefully the aic is used to select the best model in predicting long term mooring fatigue damage akaike 1973 36 a i c n ln rss n 2 k where n is the number of observations number of short term sea states in this study k is the number of parameters of each spectral model the parameters needed for mooring damage

and tsai 1989 38 a i c c a i c 2 k k 1 n k 1 aic is a powerful tool for comparing models the model with the minimum aicc value is considered as the best model furthermore other parameters are also important to compare model the aic difference is calculated as 39 Î´ a i c c i a i c c i a i c c min where aicc min is the minimum aicc score of tested modes the akaike weight is calculated as 40 w i exp 1 2 Î´ a i c c i i 1 r exp 1 2 Î´ a i c c i where r is the number of models i is the current model being discussed the evidence ratio is the relative likelihood of a pair of models representing the evidence about fitted models as to the best model snipes and taylor 2014 the evidence ratio and its logarithm to the base 10 are determined as 41 e r i w b e s t w i l e r i log 10 e r i the terms minimal substantial strong and decisive are used when the ler between model probabilities of greater than 0 0 5 1 and 2 respectively the aic results of different spectral models for long term fatigue damage of nylon polyester and nylon with weights are summarized in tables 10 14 the results of 2m polyester mooring are not presented since the spectral methods fail to present precise estimation to its long term fatigue damage it is seen that both the installation location and material could affect the performance of spectral methods in mooring fatigue analysis for the 1m nylon rope the dirlik model owns the lowest aicc score indicating that this model is the most suitable one for estimating fatigue damage of the 1m nylon rope in addition to the dirlik model it is seen that the Î±0 75 model also exhibits good performance according the results in table 10 the Î±0 75 model receives 42 of the total weight of all models there is minimal evidence in favour of dirlik model relative to Î±0 75 model however there is decisive evidence in favour of dirlik model relative to the other models the results in table 10 indicate that the Î±0 75 method is preferable to any other methods for 2m nylon long term fatigue analysis there is decisive evidence in favour of Î±0 75 method relative to the other models except to dirlik model the evidence of Î±0 75 method relative to dirlik model is minimal similar results are seen in the case of nylon rope with clumped weights according to the aic data in tables 13 and 14 it is concluded that the dirlk model is the optimal one as it receives 93 and 87 of the total weight of models for estimating 1m and 2m fatigue damage of nylon with clumped weights besides the Î±0 75 method also shows good performance different from the nylon rope it is seen that both the dirlik and Î±0 75 models are not the best option for predicting polyester fatigue damage there is decisive evidence in favour of the tb model relative to other models in the application for 1m polyester rope fatigue analysis it receives 99 of the total weight 6 conclusions overall applying mooring tension raos in conjunction with wave spectrum to predict mooring tension spectrum is reasonable in these certain cases the 1m tension spectrum is better predicted than that of 2m the 2m tension spectrum is overestimated by the equation using mooring tension raos in the survival wave conditions five spectral methods are applied to study mooring fatigue damage the spectral methods that use the estimated mooring tension spectrum calculated by mooring tension raos and wave spectrum is able to present accurate estimation to mooring fatigue damage except for the case 2m polyester mooring under survival wave condition on the other hand the indirect rainflow counting method shows very good performance in mooring fatigue damage analysis in this study the estimated fatigue damage of nylon rope by the spectral methods is more accurate than that of polyester rope the long term fatigue damage of the studied mooring configurations in a west portuguese coast site are estimated by spectral methods and their accuracy are calibrated by the indirect rainflow counting approach the 1m suffers much greater damage than the 2m in the head sea condition the durability of nylon rope needs to take great attention as it suffers the fatigue damage problem especially for the mooring installed on the upwind location on the contrary the influence of fatigue damage on polyester mooring is small it is concluded that the dirlik model holds the highest ranking in nylon rope fatigue damage analysis the Î±0 75 method is also a good option to analyse nylon mooring fatigue damage which is much easier to implement than other sophisticated spectral methods furthermore it provides accurate enough estimation the tb method is the preferable model to analyse fatigue damage of the most loaded polyester rope while all the spectral methods are not able to give precise estimation of long term fatigue damage of 2m polyester mooring rope it should be emphasized that the accuracy of spectral methods in mooring fatigue damage analysis still needs to be examined in the further study for several reasons the mechanical properties of full scale synthetic fibre mooring ropes are not well scaled down by scaling the nominal diameter in this study the low frequency component of mooring tension is ignorable because the natural surge periods are close to 30s xu et al 2021 however the low frequency tension is significant even the dominant part for the mooring of deepwater offshore structures and the mooring tension spectrum is bi modal the mooring tension times series are close to gaussian in most sea states in this study however the non gaussian property of mooring tension time series is notable in some cases credit authorship contribution statement sheng xu methodology formal analysis visualization writing original draft c guedes soares conceptualization supervision

20910,two compact hybrid mooring concepts adopting top synthetic fibre rope polyester or nylon submerged buoy and bottom chain design are studied in addition to these two mooring concepts another concept that adds two clumped weights on the bottom segment of the hybrid mooring with nylon rope is also studied the mooring tension raos are obtained from seventeen regular wave tests to a point absorber moored by these three mooring configurations five spectral methods including dirlik tovo benasciutti zhao baker wirsching light and Î±0 75 methods are applied to study mooring fatigue damage five irregular wave model tests are performed the rainflow counting method in conjunction with measured mooring tension time series is applied to calculate mooring fatigue damage and the values are used to calibrate the spectral methods the spectral methods are then used to evaluate the long term fatigue damage of these three moorings in the application in the west portuguese coast the rainflow counting method is applied to the mooring tension series generated from estimated mooring tension spectra to analysis fatigue damage and the results are acted as the reference values for checking the accuracy of spectral methods then the performance of spectral methods is evaluated based on the akaike s information criterion keywords mooring fatigue damage synthetic fibre rope hydrodynamic model tests spectral fatigue analysis rainflow counting method akaike s information criterion 1 introduction the main role of mooring system is to keep floating structure on station which is strongly associated to the safety and performance of floating system chain and wire are two generally used materials for mooring ropes recently the synthetic fibre ropes are getting more and more attention in the application for the moorings of deepwater offshore platforms and shallow water marine renewable energy devices polyester is considered as the most popular synthetic fibre mooring rope for application to deepwater and ultra deepwater offshore structures and it has been successfully applied in several projects such as the mad dog spar bugg et al 2004 red hawk spar haslum et al 2005 the polyester rope is superior to wire rope in deepwater mooring applications it is much cheaper and has lighter weight and higher durability flory et al 2007 kota et al 1999 furthermore it was claimed that the polyester rope shows better station keeping performance than the wire ropes flory et al 2007 in recent years numerous studies focus on developing wave energy converters wecs due to the growing problem of global warming and air pollution among the variety of wec concepts floating devices attract great attention because the wave energy density in open sea is much larger than in nearshore guedes soares et al 2012 the cost of the mooring system is one of the concerned issues of the wec project and it can be approximated to 10 of the total wec structural cost and can be as large as 30 castro santos et al 2018 2020 thomsen et al 2017 furthermore the mooring system for motion dependent wecs which take advantage of motion responses to harvest energy should be compliant enough to avoid interference with the energy harvesting activities xu et al 2019 in view of this the low modulus synthetic fibre ropes such as polyester and nylon are recommended to be applied in the marine renewable energy devices wang et al 2019 2021 weller et al 2015 the performance of hybrid mooring system using polyester rope for a point absorber was experimentally studied xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a in the previous study the nylon rope was adopted for keeping a floating oscillating water column on station and the performance of the mooring system was extensively evaluated by hydrodynamic model tests xu et al 2020b in addition to the mooring material the mooring configuration also has significant influence on the dynamics of floating systems the slack taut and catenary are three commonly seen mooring concepts a novel mooring concept that combines the merits of catenary and taut mooring systems for the deepwater application was proposed by ji et al 2011 based on fully coupled dynamic analysis it was found that this novel design can reduce floating structure motion responses and mooring dynamic tensions this concept was further developed by adding a submerged buoy on top segment and clumped weights on bottom segment of taut mooring ropes yuan et al 2014 it was concluded that attached buoy has significant influence on the mooring dynamic tensions however in the deepwater application the clumped weights and buoy have limited influence on motion responses of top floating platforms according to the experimental studies ji and yuan 2015 xu et al 2018a 2018b recently it was experimentally verified that the hybrid mooring concepts show good performance in the application for wecs which helps to reduce the snap load events xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a the fatigue limit state fls design is one of the crucial steps during the mooring system design and the essential point during the fls design is to estimate the mooring fatigue damage precisely generally the fatigue damage is calculated based on linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the rainflow counting rfc algorithm in conjunction with s n or t n curve is a widely used approach to study mooring fatigue damage huang et al 2011 xu et al 2020a yang et al 2016 2017 the experimental study is considered as the most reliable method to obtain mooring tension time series in specified sea state for mooring fatigue damage analysis however it is unrealistic to apply only the experimental method to study long term mooring fatigue damage since numerous sea conditions need to be considered and it is extremely expensive and time consuming to perform model tests for all possible sea cases the fully coupled dynamic analysis which takes the coupled effect between mooring system and top floating structure into consideration provides an alternative good solution to analysis mooring dynamics however it still needs countless efforts to implement fully coupled dynamic simulations in long term mooring fatigue damage analysis in view of this low 2011a developed a hybrid time frequency method to increase analysis efficiency unfortunately the current numerical tools are not able to fully capture the dynamics of synthetic fibre mooring ropes due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties applying the dynamic stiffness in floating structure synthetic fibre mooring system coupled dynamic analysis is an alternative solution to get mooring tension time series huang et al 2011 pham et al 2019 however it is a simplified approach the time dependent mechanical properties are neglected in addition to the time domain and hybrid time frequency methods efficient spectral methods which are able to present reasonable results are very popular in structural fatigue damage analysis the mooring rope suffers complex environmental loads generally the mooring tension shows both the low frequency and wave frequency characteristics in view of this jiao and moan 1990 developed a method to deal with bimodal fatigue damage and this method is recommend by design codes api 2005 dnvgl 2015 the jiao moan method was further improved by fixing two assumptions about load amplitude low 2010 the modified bimodal method presents more accurate estimation to structural fatigue damage however it is difficult to implement consequently a simple and accurate practical formula for fatigue damage analysis due to a bimodal gaussian process was developed low 2014 the narrow band method wide band methods and bimodal methods were applied to study the fatigue damage of mooring chain and the results were compared between each other xue and chen 2018 however there is still no research to compare the performance of different spectral methods for synthetic fibre rope fatigue damage analysis it is known that synthetic fibre ropes are widely used in mooring systems of offshore platforms as well as marine energy capturing devices however there is still no reliable method available to predict the long term fatigue damage of synthetic fibre mooring rope accurately and efficiently in this work the feasibility study of combining the measured mooring tension raos and spectral methods to predict the fatigue damage of synthetic fibre mooring ropes for wecs is carried out the analysis procedure is organised as follows step 1 carry out the regular wave tests to measure mooring tension raos of three mooring concepts step 2 carry out the irregular wave tests to measure mooring tension time series under operational and survival wave conditions step 3 the measured mooring tension raos step 1 are used to predict the mooring tension spectra under the wave conditions in step 2 once the mooring tension spectra are estimated by the measured mooring tension raos the indirect rainflow counting method estimate mooring fatigue damage from the generated mooring tension time series by inverse fast fourier transform ifft algorithm as well as spectral methods are applied to predict the mooring fatigue damage under the wave conditions of step 2 the accuracy of these methods are calibrated by the fatigue damage which is estimated by applying the rainflow counting method directly to the measured mooring time series step 4 the calibrated spectral methods in conjunction with the predicted mooring tension spectra are applied to calculate the long term mooring fatigue damage the fatigue damage estimated by the indirect rainflow counting method is acted as the reference value to rank the performance of spectral methods according to akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1973 the feasibility of spectral methods in long term mooring fatigue damage analysis is investigated and the most suitable spectral method is suggested based on the results of this study 2 mooring fatigue analysis the t n approach is a popular method to study synthetic fibre mooring rope fatigue damage under complicated sea conditions xu and guedes soares 2020a and it is recommended by design codes api 2014 dnvgl 2015 prior to applying the t n method the mooring tension range needs to be normalized i e using the ratio between mooring tension range to the minimum breaking load mbl based on laboratory tests an equation can be regressed to express the relation between normalized tension range u and the corresponding number of load cycles n causes to cumulative fatigue failure 1 n k u m where k is the intercept parameter and m is the slope of t n curve respectively u is the ratio between mooring tension range to the minimum breaking load mbl based on the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the accumulated structural fatigue damage is given as 2 d i 1 n c n i n i where n i is the number of cycle range u i during the loading process n i is number of cycle range u i leads to structural failure which is determined according to eq 1 n c is the total number of all load cycles 2 1 time domain analysis the load cycles can be counted directly from mooring tension time series which is the most precise method to obtain the number of load cycles several counting approaches have been developed although the rainflow counting method developed by matsuishi and endo 1968 is generally considered as the preferable approach to get the structural load cycles dowling 1971 in this work the rainflow counting method is adopted to obtain the mooring load cycles for estimating fatigue damage brodtkorb et al 2000 2 2 spectral methods the spectral method is another solution to evaluate mooring fatigue damage and it is much more efficient than the time domain analysis furthermore the spectral method is able to present accurate enough estimations of the structural fatigue damage when the loading process is not complicated the details of the implementation of spectral method for calculating mooring fatigue damage can be found in related design codes api 2005 dnvgl 2015 by combining eqs 1 and 2 the expected damage rate can be calculated as 3 d 1 k e i 1 n c u i m n 0 k 0 u m f u u d u where n 0 is mean number of tension cycles which is calculated as n 0 Î½ x 0 Ï for an idealized narrowband gaussian

amplitude seldom satisfy the narrow band assumption the mooring cables are subjected to combined wave frequency and low frequency loads due to first order and second order wave forces as well as low frequency current and wind forces api 2005 gao and moan 2007 xu and guedes soares 2020a consequently many researchers applied more sophisticated spectral methods to estimate mooring fatigue damage such as combined spectral method gao and moan 2008 jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 2011b in this work the performance of different wide band spectral methods in the analysis of wec mooring fatigue damage is studied 2 2 1 dirlik method dirlik 1985 proposed an empirical expression to predict structural fatigue damage under wide band loading the probabilistic density function of structural load amplitude

term wave conditions in the concerned site are discretized into a series of equivalent sea states i e the wave scatter diagram the long term mooring fatigue damage is then evaluated by adding the fatigue damage in each sea state api 2005 the accumulated annual fatigue damage in ith individual sea state is calculated as 28 d i 3 1536 e 7 p i d i where d i is the expected or average damage rate in ith sea state p i is the occurrence probability of sea state i and 3 1536e 07 corresponds to the 1 year time period in seconds then the total annual fatigue damage is calculated as 29 d d i i 3 1536 e 7 p i d i 3 model descriptions 3 1 point absorber a cylindrical point absorber with conical bottom is studied in this work fig 1 shows the 1 40 model of wec the height of conical bottom is 7 5 cm the total height of wec model is 50 cm the main parameters of wec are listed in table 1 where Ï is the diameter d is the free draft of wec without mooring lines being installed rxx ryy rzz are the gyration radius about x y and z axis respectively the height of the centre of gravity is 16 3 cm where the base line is located on the bottom of model 3 2 hybrid mooring systems and pto as seen in fig 2 the mooring system consists of three mooring legs with the azimuth angle between each two mooring legs equal to 120 the 2m and 3m are symmetrically arranged and the 1m is the most loaded one in head sea condition the pto system is an essential component of a wec which plays the role to convert wave energy into electric power in the model tests the pto system is usually discarded due to the complexity to be scaled down pto in model scale moura paredes et al 2016 sheng et al 2014 unfortunately the pto system could affect wec hydrodynamic responses due to its damping and stiffness to simulate the effect of pto system and simplify testing procedure yang et al 2020 2018 used a heave plate and a linear spring to simulate the damping and stiffness of pto system in this study a similar design was adopted as seen in fig 1 a square steel plate was used as the heave plate during the model tests the length and width of heave plate is 10 cm and the thickness is 1 mm the heave plate was rigidly fixed to a connection bar to ensure that the movement of heave plate follows the motion of the wec the connection bar was made of steel rod which was 50 cm in length the heave plate was fixed 80 cm underwater when the wec was free floating to reduce the influence of wave motion on heave plate as can be seen in fig 3 a wire with a length of 92 86 cm including the clamps on both ends was used to connect heave plate and spring the diameter of wire is 3 5 mm and the mass per unit length in air is 0 108 kg with the clamps considered the stiffness of spring is 29 22 n m which is used to simulate the stiffness of pto the top synthetic fibre rope bottom chain and submerged buoy attached on the joint point between these two segments constitute the hybrid mooring legs fig 3 shows the sketch of hybrid mooring systems a total of two different synthetic fibre ropes are studied including polyester and nylon hereafter the mooring system with the polyester rope is named as hyb while the one with nylon rope is called as hnb in addition to these two concepts as seen in fig 3 b another configuration with two clumped weights attached on the end of the hnb chain is designed and it is denoted as hnbw the mass of the buoy is 0 436 kg and its buoyancy is 10 n the length of synthetic fibre rope and chain is 1 23 m and 1 7 m respectively the masses of clumped weights increase from top to the end of mooring and the mass in air is 0 511 kg and 1 229 kg respectively the distance between these two clumped weights is 10 cm and the distance of cm2 to the anchor point is 10 cm the main parameters of the mooring rope are given in table 2 where w is the mass per unit length in air lr denotes mooring radius l e is the effective length of mooring rope two clamps were used to connect top synthetic top to the hook on the wec and mooring chain to the floor the length of clamp is 55 mm the length of the clamp used to connect the chain to the anchor point is 22 mm in other words the total length of the mooring leg is 3 062 m both the nylon and polyester are braided 16 strand ropes and the nominal diameter is 3 mm the model tests were designed to set the pretension of each different mooring lines to be identical in order to exclude the differences of system dynamics due to mooring pretension however it is difficult to implement due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties of synthetic fibre ropes besides the length of the synthetic ropes keeps changing slightly due to the water absorbing phenomenon the details of each mooring tensions are listed in table 3 4 validation of accuracy of spectral methods for mooring fatigue damage analysis 4 1 regular wave tests to obtain mooring tension raos the model scale was determined as 1 40 by considering the dimensions of wave flume and the quality of experimental results a series of hydrodynamic model tests were conducted in the towing tank of etsin universidad politÃ©cnica de madrid which with the width and length equal to 3 8 m and 96 m respectively and the depth is 2 107 m the model tests were conducted according to the froude similitude rule and all the experimental data are converted to full scale seventeen regular wave model tests were conducted to obtain motion responses and mooring tension raos the incident wave period in model tests varies in the range between 0 7 s and 2 s and the wave height is equal to 0 05 m i e the wave height in full scale is 2 m the three main motion response raos are given in fig 4 it is seen that the heave motion raos curve has one peak that occurs near the corresponding natural heave period as for the surge and pitch motion raos two peaks can be found the second peak of pitch motion raos is caused by the pitch resonance which also has significant influence on the surge motion responses fig 5 shows mooring tension raos since the 2m and 3m are symmetrically arranged only the results of 2m are plotted it is seen that the 1m mooring dynamics of nylon and nylon with clumped weights are similar which indicates that the influence of clumped weights on mooring dynamics is small under small wave height tests compared to 1m the difference of 2m dynamics between these two systems is great the main reason is that the difference of 2m pretension is greater than that of 1m which can be verified in table 3 in most cases the dynamics of polyester rope are similar to that of the other two systems the major difference is found when the incident wave period ranges from 9 s to 11 s where the dynamics of polyester are greater than that of nylon ropes two peaks can be found in mooring tension raos curves the first one is caused by the first peak responses of surge and pitch as seen in fig 4 while the heave resonance gives rise to the second peak tension the 1m suffers the largest load in the head sea wave condition the dynamics of 1m are much greater than that of 2m however the difference between them reduces with the increase of incident wave period to check the uncertainties of measured mooring tension raos the regular wave test with t 9 25s for hnb system was repeated five times and the mooring tension results are shown in fig 6 it is clearly seen that the measured mooring tension raos are similar in these five tests the variance of 1m and 2m tension raos is equal to 2 5 and 0 1 respectively it demonstrates that the measured data are reliable the mooring dynamic is nonlinear due to the influence of the drag force xu and guedes soares 2020b furthermore the material nonlinearity of synthetic fibre rope could increase the nonlinearity of mooring dynamics as a consequence the influence of incident wave height on mooring tension raos need to be studied in this work four regular wave tests with the same period t 7 39s but different incident wave height are conducted the results are plotted in fig 7 the effect of incident wave height on mooring dynamics is considerable it is found that the mooring tension rao decreases with the increase of wave height for all discussed mooring cases it is found that the difference between tension rao is greater than 20 when wave height is equal to 0 4m and 1m 4 2 irregular wave tests to check spectral methods for mooring fatigue damage analysis once the mooring tension raos have been obtained the mooring tension spectrum can be efficiently calculated in any given sea condition 30 s t e n Ï t r a o 2 s w Ï where s ten Ï is the estimated mooring tension spectrum in the given wave spectrum s w Ï t rao is the measured mooring tension raos under the wave conditions with wave height equal to 2 m as given in fig 5 theoretically after the estimation of mooring tension spectrum the expected mooring fatigue in the concerned wave state can be then predicted by the spectral methods however the spectral methods are based on the gaussian assumption while the statistical characteristic of mooring tension is very complicated especially for wec mooring which is easy to trigger snap loads in harsh sea condition xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a the gaussian may fail to predict the expected number of load cycles furthermore eq 30 estimates the mooring tension spectrum based on the linear assumption however the mooring tension is nonlinear the accuracy of estimated of mooring tension spectrum needs to be checked another problem is that the influence of wave height on measured mooring tension raos cannot be neglected as shown in fig 7 it is reasonable to carry out the regular wave model tests to obtain mooring tension raos by setting the regular wave height to be identical to the significant wave height of random wave conditions unfortunately the significant wave height of long term wave condition of target site varies in a wide range as a consequence it is necessary to check the feasibility of spectral methods in mooring fatigue damage analysis in this study five irregular wave tests including three operational op one heave resonance hr and one survival sv sea states were conducted to calibrate the accuracy of spectral methods the random waves were simulated by joswap spectrum the main parameters are summarized in table 4 where t p is the peak period h s is the significant wave height Î³ is the peak enhancement factor the duration of each irregular wave mode test is 30 min which is longer than 3 h in full scale the flowchart of calibration of the accuracy of estimated tension spectrum and spectral methods in mooring fatigue damage analysis is shown in fig 8 a total of three approaches are applied to study mooring fatigue damage while the results estimated by applying the rainflow counting algorithm to the measured mooring time series are considered as the reference values generally the loading time series can be obtained from the load spectrum by applying the inverse fast fourier transform ifft algorithm then the rainflow counting algorithm in conjunction with the converted load time series is applied to study structural fatigue damage and this method is usually applied to calibrate the accuracy of spectral methods if the load spectrum is given in this work this approach is adopted to study mooring fatigue damage in order to check the accuracy of estimated mooring spectra as well as converted mooring tension time series in addition to these two kinds of time domain methods five spectral methods are also used to study mooring fatigue damage and their accuracies are checked by the reference values the mooring tensions of 1m and 2m in 5000 s are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively here only the results in op1 and survival wave conditions are plotted it is seen that the mooring dynamics of these three systems are similar the dynamic tension of 1m is greater than 2m and the difference increases with the wave height the scenarios that the zero tensions followed by spike tensions are observed in the 1m tension time series when the wec operates in survival wave condition this is understood that the mooring rope changes from slack to taut suddenly which gives rise to snap events however this phenomenon is not found in the 2m tension time series the rainflow counting technique is applied to extract load cycles from measured mooring tension time series in random wave tests figs 11 and 12 show rainflow tension cycle histograms of 1m and 2m in op1 wave condition where rfc denotes the rainflow counting it is seen that rainflow tension cycle amplitude of 1m concentrated on the range between 50 and 150 kn for all mooring concepts despite the difference between mean load as shown in fig 12 the most frequent load amplitude of 2m ranges between 40 and 100 kn for all mooring concepts by comparing the results of fig 11 with 12 it can be easily identified that the 1m suffers much greater fatigue damage than 2m the 1m has similar number of small load amplitude to that of 2m furthermore the number of load amplitude which is greater than 200 kn is considerable in 1m however it is rarely seen in 2m besides it is seen the load amplitude probability density of different mooring systems is similar and it can be easily described by suitable probability models the mooring tension histograms in survival wave conditions are shown in figs 13 and 14 where it can be clearly seen that the probability densities of load amplitude are rather discrete due to the snap events for all mooring concepts it is difficult to describe them accurately by general probability models the amplitude centre is between 100 and 600 kn for 1m where the major component of 2m ranges from 50 to 200 kn it indicates that the fatigue damage of 1m is much greater than that of 2m the mooring tension spectral densities estimated by eq 30 in different wave conditions are then compared with the corresponding measured ones here in this work only the results in two representative test cases are given as seen in figs 15 17 in the op1 wave condition it is seen that the measured 1m tension spectra are well predicted by the linear equation for all mooring cases however a considerable component which locates between 1 4 and 2 rad s is discarded by eq 30 and a spectral peak occurs in 0 2 rad s due to surge resonance is also not considered because the regular wave tests were conducted in the wave frequency between 0 5 and 1 4 rad s this may introduce error in fatigue damage analysis in order to take most energies into account during the mooring fatigue damage analysis it is suggested that the tested wave period for measuring mooring tension raos should be as wide as possible the measured tension spectral densities of 2m in op1 wave condition are also in good agreement with the results calculated by mooring tension raos as for the survival wave condition it is observed that all the predicted 1m tension spectra are in good agreement with the measured ones for all these three mooring concepts the tension spectral densities of 2m are overestimated eq 30 in survival wave condition especially for the case of nylon with weights overall the method that applies linear tension raos to obtain mooring tension spectrum is reasonable in this study during the application of spectral methods the mooring fatigue damage is determined by the spectral parameters as a consequence to study the feasibility of predicted mooring tension spectra in fatigue damage analysis it is necessary to check these spectral parameters carefully the mooring tension spectral parameters in op1 and survival wave conditions are summarized in tables 5 and 6 where predicted denotes the mooring tension spectra predicted by tension raos measured means the measured mooring tension spectra the standard deviation is defined as Î» 0 and the Î´ is the bandwidth factor which is calculated as 31 Î´ 1 Î» 1 2 Î» 0 Î» 2 for an ideal narrow band process Î´ approaches zero it is seen that mooring tensions are wide band process in the operational wave condition the predicted spectral parameters are in good agreement with the measured ones as for the survival wave condition it is found that standard deviations and upcrossing rate of peaks are not well estimated by predicted spectra this difference would introduce the estimation errors if the predicted spectra is adopted for mooring fatigue damage analysis since the fatigue damage is proportional to the Ï m v p the mooring tension time series can be obtained from the tension spectrum by applying the ifft technique 32 x t i 1 n 2 s t e n Ï i Î´ Ï i cos Ï i t Î¸ i where x t is the mooring tension in time t s ten Ï is the estimated mooring tension spectral density by using measured tension raos Î¸ is a random phase angle n is the number of frequencies the quality of the generated tension time series depends on the frequency interval time step and simulation duration it is recommended that the n should be greater than 1000 dnv gl 2017 and n 20 000 was used in the study of park et al 2014 in this work n 10 000 is adopted by applying the interpolation method the time duration is 3 h and time step is 0 02s fig 18 shows generated 1m tension time series of nylon rope in survival wave condition the spectral methods and indirect rainflow counting method apply the rainflow counting to the mooring tension time series generated by ifft are based on the gaussian assumption prior to applying these methods to mooring fatigue damage analysis it is necessary to check whether the gaussian assumption is satisfied by noticing that the kurtosis and skewness are useful to identify gaussian property kurtosis is equal to 3 and the skewness is 0 for a gaussian process these two values in different wave conditions are summarized in tables 7 and 8 it can be clearly seen that most of the mooring tensions are close to gaussian and the most different case from gaussian is the 2m tension of polyester mooring hyb under survival wave condition then different methods introduced above are applied to estimate the expected mooring fatigue damage rate in these five cases for the polyester rope k and m is recommended as 7 5 and 9 respectively api 2014 while k and m for the nylon rope are 10 6 and 3 5 which are determined by fitting the experimental data of ridge et al 2010 the minimum breaking strength of polyester and nylon rope in full scale are estimated by empirical equations barltrop 1998 johanning et al 2006 xu et al 2019 as described in fig 8 the accuracy of spectral methods and generated time series are checked by the results of measured mooring time series figs 19 and 20 show the relative errors between fatigue damage estimated by spectral method and direct rainflow counting method apply rainflow counting method to the measured mooring tension time series where tb denotes tovo benasciutti method zb is the zhao baker method wl means wirsching light method besides the accuracy of estimated mooring tension spectra and the quality of generated time series are checked by comparing the fatigue damage estimated by the indirect rainflow counting method rfc s apply rainflow counting method to the generated mooring tension time series with ifft technique with the results of direct rainflow counting method figs 19 and 20 are double y axis the left one is the relative errors of expected fatigue rate estimated by different methods to the results of direct rainflow counting algorithm while the right axis is the expected fatigue rate calculated by direct rainflow counting method logarithm to the base 10 the relative error is calculated as 33 e log d rfc log d log d rfc 100 where d r f c is the expected fatigue damage rate calculated from measured mooring tension time series by the rainflow counting method d is the expected fatigue damage rate calculated by the current method it is clearly seen that all the spectral methods are able to present good estimations to mooring fatigue damage in most cases since most of mooring tensions are close to gaussian and the spectral parameters are well presented by the predicted mooring tension spectra the empirical Î±0 75 method provides the most accurate estimation to fatigue damage of nylon ropes among all spectral methods for most mooring cases on the contrary the errors of wl method are the greatest except for the case of 2m polyester rope it is found that all spectral methods fail to present good estimations of fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope in survival wave condition the relative errors between spectral methods and rfc are greater than 11 it should be noticed that the comparison is given in form of expected fatigue damage rate in other words the errors of 3 h fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope estimated by spectral methods are significant according to the results in table 6 it is found that for the 2m polyester tension in survival wave condition the standard deviation and expected rate of occurrence of peaks are not well represented by the predicted mooring tension spectra as for the polyester rope these differences will be amplified significantly in fatigue damage analysis since the m value of t n curve of polyester rope is great and the fatigue damage is proportional to the Ï m v p furthermore the non gaussian property of 2m polyester tension in survival wave condition cannot be neglected according to the results in table 8 these factors lead to the poor performance of spectral methods in estimating fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope in survival wave condition furthermore it is seen that the spectral methods show better performance in estimating fatigue damage of 1m than in the application of 2m the reason can be found in tables 7 and 8 where it is found that the 2m mooring tensions show greater non gaussian property than the 1m mooring tensions in addition to the installation position the mooring material also affects the accuracy of spectral methods since the fatigue damage strongly associated to the parameters of t n curve it is seen that the spectral methods present more accurate estimation for fatigue damage of nylon ropes than that of polyester rope because the spectral fatigue damage is proportional to the Ï m in other words for the mooring material with the great m value the error of estimated mooring fatigue damage due to the difference of standard deviation of mooring tension would be amplified significantly it is noticed that the m value of polyester rope is greater than that of the nylon rope the indirect rainflow counting method presents good estimations of mooring fatigue damage for all studied cases especially for the 2m polyester where it is seen that the errors are smaller than that of spectral methods in all tested wave conditions it indicates that it is reasonable to use the estimated fatigue damage of indirect rainflow counting method as the reference value to study the performance of spectral methods in long term mooring fatigue damage analysis by checking the right axis of figs 19 and 20 it is observed that the nylon rope suffers much greater damage than the polyester rope the reason is that both the mbl and m of polyester rope is greater than that of nylon rope if compare the mooring fatigue damage in operational wave conditions i e h s 2m it is seen that the fatigue damage increases with wave peak period for most mooring cases the influence of significant wave height on fatigue damage is significant it is found that the mooring fatigue in survival wave condition is much greater than that in op1 wave condition to discuss the influence of attached clumped weights on mooring fatigue damage the fatigue damage of nylon mooring ropes estimated by the direct rainflow counting algorithm in these five wave conditions are compared with the results of nylon mooring ropes with clumped weights and fig 21 shows the comparisons as seen in fig 21 the effect of clumped weights on mooring fatigue damage is limited in most operational wave conditions however the mooring fatigue is slightly reduced in the survival wave condition with clumped weights attached this is explained that the attached clumped weights help to reduce the amplitude of snap loads xu et al 2018c 2020c xu and guedes soares 2020a 5 long term fatigue damage analysis 5 1 long term wave statistics in the target site a specified location that is located off the west portuguese coast is assumed as the target site and the latitude and longitude of the selected location is 39n and 9 5w respectively the wave hindcast analysis is a popular numerical method to study long term wave conditions and extensive results are available for the portuguese coast silva et al 2015 2018 the wave scatter diagram in the target site for the period between 1979 and 2007 is shown in fig 22 5 2 long term fatigue damage the mooring tension spectrum in each wave state of the target site can then be estimated by applying eq 30 in head sea condition and the random wave is modelled by the jonswap spectrum after calculating the mooring tension spectrum in each sea state the mooring fatigue damage can be estimated by spectra methods and indirect rainflow counting approach and the result of indirect rainflow counting method is acted as the reference value then the total annual fatigue damage can be estimated by eq 29 to discuss the composition of long term mooring fatigue damage the ratios of mooring fatigue damage estimated by indirect rfc method in operational wave conditions to that in survival wave conditions are plotted in fig 23 the sea state with h s 8m is considered as the survival wave condition and the fatigue damage ratio d r is calculated as 34 d r i 1 n o d o i j 1 n s d s j where d o is the mooring fatigue in operational wave conditions d s is the mooring fatigue in survival wave conditions n o and n s is the number of operational and survival wave conditions respectively according to the results in fig 23 it is seen that the nylon ropes suffer the most damage in operational sea states i e the nylon fatigue damage in operational wave conditions is more than 5 times to that in survival wave conditions however as for the polyester rope the fatigue damage under survival wave conditions is comparable to that in operational wave conditions despite of the fact that the survival sea state is rare it can be explained that in the survival wave conditions a considerable number of large amplitude load cycle will occur as seen in figs 13 and 14 even the snap events can be found in the 1m as seen in figs 9 and 13 which give rise to significant load amplitude and the number of snap events are considerable furthermore the slope of t n curve m of polyester rope is great which indicates that the influence of large amplitude load cycles on fatigue damage of polyester rope is more significant than that of nylon rope and the total fatigue damage of polyester rope in survival wave conditions accounts for a considerable proportion of long term fatigue damage the fatigue life of different mooring concepts in the specified target are summarized in table 9 and the fatigue life of synthetic fibre mooring rope is calculated as api 2014 35 l 1 10 d it is seen that the spectral methods present good estimations of the fatigue damage of nylon ropes as the estimated nylon rope fatigue life both for the nylon and nylon with clumped weights by spectral methods are in good agreement with the ones predicted by rainflow counting approach in the head sea condition the 1m is the most loaded one among the mooring system it is seen that the 1m suffers much greater damage than the 2m which indicates that it is necessary to take great care to the maintenance of 1m during its service life furthermore by comparing the results of spectral methods with that of rainflow counting algorithm it is concluded that the dirlik and empirical Î±0 75 methods provide the most accurate estimation to the fatigue damage of nylon mooring ropes while the wl shows the worst performance the influence of attached clumped weights on mooring fatigue damage can be evaluated by checking the results of nylon and nylon with clumped weights systems it is found that the fatigue life of these two systems are similar which implies that the effect of clumped weights on mooring long term fatigue damage is negligible in consistency with the experimental results the performance of spectral methods for estimating polyester rope fatigue damage is inferior to its application in nylon rope fatigue analysis it is observed that the spectral methods fail to present accurate estimation of long term fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope the reason is that the fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope in survival wave condition has great contribution to its long term fatigue damage as given in fig 23 unfortunately according to the results of fig 20 b the spectral methods introduce great errors in calculating fatigue damage of 2m polyester rope under survival wave condition however the spectral methods can still present acceptable fatigue damage estimation to the 1m polyester rope in different from the nylon rope it is seen that the tb is the preferable method in estimating polyester rope fatigue damage furthermore it is seen that the nylon rope suffers much greater fatigue damage than polyester rope 5 3 evaluation the performance of fatigue damage

important to compare model the aic difference is calculated as 39 Î´ a i c c i a i c c i a i c c min where aicc min is the minimum aicc score of tested modes the akaike weight is calculated as 40 w i

minimal substantial strong and decisive are used when the ler between model probabilities of greater than 0 0 5 1 and 2 respectively the aic results of different spectral models for long term fatigue damage of nylon polyester and nylon with weights are summarized in tables 10 14 the results of 2m polyester mooring are not presented since the spectral methods fail to present precise estimation to its long term fatigue damage it is seen that both the installation location and material could affect the performance of spectral methods in mooring fatigue analysis for the 1m nylon rope the dirlik model owns the lowest aicc score indicating that this model is the most suitable one for estimating fatigue damage of the 1m nylon rope in addition to the dirlik model it is seen that the Î±0 75 model also exhibits good performance according the results in table 10 the Î±0 75 model receives 42 of the total weight of all models there is minimal evidence in favour of dirlik model relative to Î±0 75 model however there is decisive evidence in favour of dirlik model relative to the other models the results in table 10 indicate that the Î±0 75 method is preferable to any other methods for 2m nylon long term fatigue analysis there is decisive evidence in favour of Î±0 75 method relative to the other models except to dirlik model the evidence of Î±0 75 method relative to dirlik model is minimal similar results are seen in the case of nylon rope with clumped weights according to the aic data in tables 13 and 14 it is concluded that the dirlk model is the optimal one as it receives 93 and 87 of the total weight of models for estimating 1m and 2m fatigue damage of nylon with clumped weights besides the Î±0 75 method also shows good performance different from the nylon rope it is seen that both the dirlik and Î±0 75 models are not the best option for predicting polyester fatigue damage there is decisive evidence in favour of the tb model relative to other models in the application for 1m polyester rope fatigue analysis it receives 99 of the total weight 6 conclusions overall applying mooring tension raos in conjunction with wave spectrum to predict mooring tension spectrum is reasonable in these certain cases the 1m tension spectrum is better predicted than that of 2m the 2m tension spectrum is overestimated by the equation using mooring tension raos in the survival wave conditions five spectral methods are applied to study mooring fatigue damage the spectral methods that use the estimated mooring tension spectrum calculated by mooring tension raos and wave spectrum is able to present accurate estimation to mooring fatigue damage except for the case 2m polyester mooring under survival wave condition on the other hand the indirect rainflow counting method shows very good performance in mooring fatigue damage analysis in this study the estimated fatigue damage of nylon rope by the spectral methods is more accurate than that of polyester rope the long term fatigue damage of the studied mooring configurations in a west portuguese coast site are estimated by spectral methods and their accuracy are calibrated by the indirect rainflow counting approach the 1m suffers much greater damage than the 2m in the head sea condition the durability of nylon rope needs to take great attention as it suffers the fatigue damage problem especially for the mooring installed on the upwind location on the contrary the influence of fatigue damage on polyester mooring is small it is concluded that the dirlik model holds the highest ranking in nylon rope fatigue damage analysis the Î±0 75 method is also a good option to analyse nylon mooring fatigue damage which is much easier to implement than other sophisticated spectral methods furthermore it provides accurate enough estimation the tb method is the preferable model to analyse fatigue damage of the most loaded polyester rope while all the spectral methods are not able to give precise estimation of long term fatigue damage of 2m polyester mooring rope it should be emphasized that the accuracy of spectral methods in mooring fatigue damage analysis still needs to be examined in the further study for several reasons the mechanical properties of full scale synthetic fibre mooring ropes are not well scaled down by scaling the nominal diameter in this study the low frequency component of mooring tension is ignorable because the natural surge periods are close to 30s xu et al 2021 however the low frequency tension is significant even the dominant part for the mooring of deepwater offshore structures and the mooring tension spectrum is bi modal the mooring tension times series are close to gaussian in most sea states in this study however the non gaussian property of mooring tension time series is notable in some cases credit authorship contribution statement sheng xu methodology formal analysis visualization writing original draft c guedes soares conceptualization supervision

20911,an oscillating water column owc wave energy device can use a bidirectional flow impulse turbine for energy extraction the airflow velocity profiles during inhalation and exhalation of the owc are asymmetric and the flowrate at exhalation is higher hence this article presents an optimized turbine to work for asymmetrical airflow conditions the rotor blade setting angle Î³ was made asymmetric with a non zero setting angle and the guide vane shape was optimized the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans were solved to get the objective function values for the latin hypercube sampling lhs generated design space a pseudo sinusoidal velocity profile replicating the flow inside the owc device was used for the transient simulations a weighted average surrogate model generated the initial population for a hybrid genetic algorithm to produce optimum designs the effect of turbine induced damping and starting characteristics were analyzed under irregular flow conditions obtained from the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum the optimized turbine resulted in better starting and running characteristics also the mean efficiency of the optimized turbine was increased relatively by 9 5 index terms surrogate based optimization oscillating water column bi directional impulse turbine unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations 1 introduction the oscillating water column owc device is the most notable wave energy conversion device an owc plant converts the wave motion to a reciprocating airflow which drives a self rectifying air turbine a bidirectional impulse turbine can be employed as a power take off system for the owc device falcÃ£o and henriques 2016 the magnitudes of the tangential and axial forces vary during the wave cycle the tangential force direction is independent of the flow direction torresi et al 2009 the turbine rotational speed changes in accordance with the sea state thereby affecting the pressure drop and flowrate across the turbine turbine induced damping affects the compressibility of air inside the owc chamber and suppresses the motion of the water entrained in the chamber this causes a change in the hydrodynamic performance of the owc system kim et al 2001 impulse turbines operate at lower rotational speed compared to their counterpart wells turbine kim et al 2001 thus it is less affected by the compressibility effects and centrifugal stresses predominantly during high energetic wave climate impulse turbines also have a broader operating range compared to the wells turbines the aerodynamic losses in an impulse turbine due to an excessive incidence flow angle at the entry to the second row of guide vanes is considered as a major problem falcÃ£o and henriques 2016 thakker et al a thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 reported that 21 of average pressure is lost at the downstream guide vanes gv several works reported the performance enhancement of the turbine by modifying the design parameters such as blade thickness camber line and stacking etc gomes et al 2012 the 3d gvs enhances the recovery of exit kinetic energy from the rotor ajit thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 the volumetric flow rate profiles are asymmetric in the owc air chamber dixon and hall 2014 setoguchi et al 2003 the exhalation flow rate chamber to atmosphere is relatively higher to perform better in such asymmetric airflow conditions a twin unidirectional impulse turbine configuration was proposed jayashankar et al 2009 mala et al 2011 a similar turbine was numerically analyzed pereiras et al 2014 and the observations show that one third of the flow energy is lost during the inhalation process due to incidence losses moreover if both the turbines are connected to the same shaft the negative torque generated in the inhalation process deteriorates the overall torque steady state simulations were performed liu et al 2016 on a bidirectional flow impulse turbine with a non zero setting angle to make it adaptable for pseudo sinusoidal airflow the rotor blade shape was kept fixed and the modifications were implemented on the blade setting angle Î³ it was observed that Î³ 5 with corresponding variations in gvs produced better mean efficiency compared to the non zero setting angle rotor the average pressure loss in the exit gvs is higher than that of the upstream gvs and rotor passage a thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 gv shape optimization according to the rotor setting angle is required to recover the rotor exit swirl energy systematic optimization of the rotor setting angle and the gv shape for a pseudo sinusoidal airflow was not studied yet there is a noticeable difference in the performance of the turbine between acceleration and deceleration ghisu et al 2016 a transient analysis is required to study the development of vortical structures and their interactions occurring during acceleration and deceleration these structures affect the performance of the turbine during both phases of the flow thus an unsteady simulation was performed pereiras et al 2011 for a radial impulse turbine multiple surrogate methods were widely used in multidisciplinary optimizations due to its reliability and cost effectiveness to find the global optima viana et al 2014 the surrogate models are problem dependent and a single surrogate might perform poorly in the design space samad et al 2008 the weighted average surrogate was model was proposed goel et al 2007 by combining basic surrogates such as response surface approximation rsa kriging krg and radial basis function rbf to overcome such issue the proposed was model was validated with test functions like the branin hoo function camelback function hartman function and goldstein price function finally the was model yielded lower rms errors than the best press model for all these test functions the turbomachinery problems are usually associated with complicated flow features and multiple local optima samad et al 2008 unlike the first order or second order optimization methods that have straightforward solutions the optimum in genetic algorithms is found after a large number of trials considering this in the case of large scale turbomachinery problems we can expect a better solution with a genetic algorithm ga than first or second order optimization methods however the ga do not necessarily give an optimal solution as they are meta heuristics which usually converge to local optimum places which are locally best in the chromosome space which cannot be left in a single generation in a multi dimensional space at times thus a ga sequential quadratic programming sqp hybrid algorithm search method is used to handle these local optima as well as global optima and has faster convergence alsumait et al 2010 than other metaheuristic algorithms shape optimization using multiple surrogate methods are successfully applied in many turbomachinery optimizations ezhilsabareesh et al 2018 lee and kim 2010 samad et al 2008 in this work a bidirectional impulse turbine maeda et al 1999 is taken as the reference turbine and optimization was performed the reference and the optimized turbines were compared numerically the objectives of this paper are outlined as to find the effect of blade setting angle on the aerodynamic performance through transient simulations optimization of the blade setting angle of the rotor hub and tip gv angles according to setting angle through a surrogate model based hybrid genetic algorithm hga the effect of the rotor blade setting angle hub and tip gv angles are analyzed for the starting characteristics of the turbine under irregular flow conditions the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 reports the numerical model and problem statement section 3 describes the optimization procedure the results are discussed in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are made in section 5 2 numerical model and problem description the reference turbine geometry maeda et al 1999 the detailed specifications of the rotor and the gv are given in table 1 the modified turbine with a positive setting angle suitable for asymmetric airflow is given in fig 1 subscripts e and i represent exhalation and inhalation respectively the rotor blade pitch setting angle Î³ was made asymmetric the gv setting angles Î¸ and Î´ were changed according to the rotor setting angle so that the flow leaving the gv will be axial this enlarges the pressure side area for the exhalation airflow and shifts the minimum pressure point which leads to a delayed separation that occurs on the suction side to improve the mean efficiency of the turbine the idealized pseudo sinusoidal flow condition liu et al 2016 was used as an inlet condition for transient simulation and to evaluate the turbine performance for the asymmetrical flow fig 2 researchers setoguchi et al 2003 reported a lower peak axial velocity during inhalation v i than exhalation v e the ratio is v i v e 0 6 the exhalation period is t 1 v i t v e v i and the inhalation period is t 2 v e t v e v i the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation was solved for an incompressible ideal gas using a commercial code ansys cfx the k Ï sst was used for turbulence closure with the Î³ Î¸ transition model the low reynolds number method was applied to resolve the boundary layer profile and y 1 with the wall normal expansion ratio of 1 1 were maintained on all blade surfaces the second order backward euler scheme was used for time discretization the high resolution schemes for advection terms and the transient rotor stator interface ansys cfx solver theory guide n d were used to simulate the transient interaction of the flow between stator and rotor passage for the interface treatment the dynamically adaptive unstructured grids allow the grids to deform only at the interface as the geometry changes its position such a method can be applied to the structured grid however requires additional complex measures to avoid degradation of grid quality whereas the grid deformation in the unstructured meshes can be accounted for by moving only the nodes lying on the interface while the interior nodes and grid connectivity are unaltered blades and marcum 2007 mathur 1994 as the viscous region demands high aspect ratio grid cells the unstructured grid generates triangular stretched elements leading to truncation error which is due to large grid angles sayma et al 2000 sharov and nakahashi 1998 to tackle this problem prismatic grids were generated near the blade surface for a stretched grid and tetrahedral grids were generated in the rest of the computational domain the hybrid grid at the leading edge of the rotor is shown in fig 3 for transient calculations frozen rotor simulations were used as an initial condition residuals were in the order of 10 5 for all simulations a typical convergence history of the mass momentum turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation Ï is illustrated in fig 4 a the number of sub iterations for each physical time step is fixed to 20 a single passage with periodic boundary conditions was simulated a pseudo sinusoidal velocity profile as shown in fig 2 with a turbulent intensity of 5 was given as inlet condition and an opening boundary condition was imposed at the exit allowing the bidirectional flow the rotational speed was set to 600 rpm and the frequency of the pseudo sinusoidal wave was 0 1 hz for transient analysis the time step of 0 0349 radians rotation of the turbine was considered hence the time step is 5 10 4 seconds during experiments setoguchi et al 2001 the frequency of the oscillating flow was considered as 0 1 hz and the same was adapted for present transient simulations hence the total computational time is 10 s the simulations are run for three pseudo sinusoidal flow period to exclude the initial transient and to attain a periodically stable state a time step independent study is shown in fig 4 b the higher harmonic components are captured with an increase in time resolution for Î´t 0 01 s the pressure drop is lower when compared to higher time steps because the higher order unsteadiness is not captured in lower time steps the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions was computed by the following non dimensional parameters maeda et

as 6 Ï v e v i 2 u r to study the grid independency three grid sizes of ratio 2 1 were compared the mass averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke profiles at different streamwise locations were compared the tke is considered more sensitive to the grid resolution than mean flow quantities cui and tucker 2016 fig 5 shows the indistinctive comparison of tke between 2 and 4 million elements the transient simulation results were compared with the experimental results of maeda et al 1999 under sinusoidally oscillating flow conditions fig 6 shows the comparison of mean efficiency between numerical and experimental data over prediction of mean efficiency occurs at a higher flow coefficient and the maximum deviation from the experimental data is 8 the measured uncertainty in the experiments maeda et al 1999 for efficiency is about 2 this shows that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data this uncertainty is calculated from the dispersion of the measured physical quantities such as differential pressure airflow rate turbine torque and angular velocity which are considered for the calculation of efficiency 3 single objective optimization procedure a high fidelity model based analysis and optimization requires a huge number of designs to be evaluated and thus requires high computation time the surrogate based optimization methodology which mimics the high fidelity model and approximates the responses helps to reduce such computational burden shan and wang 2010 the search algorithm to find the optimal points was a hybrid genetic algorithm hga urans equations were solved numerically to find the mean efficiency of the design space and surrogate functions were generated the design space was filled with latin hypercube sampling technique to combine different surrogates the weights are selected based on the global measure of goodness and they are fixed in design space w i x c i x the global weights are selected using a generalized mean square cross validation error gmse or press in rsm terminology the weights are selected in such a way that it filters out adverse effects of the model which represents the data well however performs poorly in unexplored regions goel et al 2007 the surrogate models and weight selection strategies are explained in detail in appendix i halder et al 2018 to validate the surrogate models a k fold cross validation strategy is used in this method the learning sample containing p test points is divided into k folds a single fold is retained for validation and the remaining k 1 folds are trained to obtain the cross validation error this procedure is repeated k times to obtain the press vector e iooss 2009 viana et al 2009 the root mean square error rmse obtained from the press vector can be given as 7 p r e s s r m s 1 p e e t one of the important factors in the optimization procedure is the parameterization of blade shape it includes the selection of design variables and design space since a large number of design variables increases the design space and computational time only important parameters are considered for optimization the design variables used were the stagger angle Î³ hub gv deflection Î´ Î¸ h and tip gv deflection Î´ Î¸ t using these variables a design space was created table 2 and the sample points fig 7 were selected the number of variables k is 3 and the sample size m is 18 based on the suggestions the value of m k ratio is maintained below 10 stein 1987 since the number of variables is less the sample size is adequate the maximum number of generations is 50 the population size is 50 and the population is uniformly generated the stopping criterion is defined as the average cumulative change in values of the fitness function and constraints over generations are less than 1 10 6 a gaussian operator is used for mutation and the scattered and stochastic uniform method is used for crossover and selection function respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 design optimization results numerical simulations were performed for the samples and the surrogates were constructed the weights for the was were computed tabulated in table 3 the formulation of the was is given as 8 f w a s 0 3042 f r b n n 0 2012 f r s a 0 4945 f k r g the optimization results in table 4 show that the relative error f s u r r o g a t e f u r a n s f s u r r o g a t e is around 1 58 the optimal turbine optt and the reference turbine reft have the objective function values of 0 445 and 0 405 both urans predicted respectively hence a mean efficiency increment of 9 87 was achieved the design variable sensitivity within a limit of 10 from their optimum values is presented fig 8 with the optimal objective function values f opt the objective function is highly sensitive to the stagger angle Î³ the sensitivity is sequenced as Î³ Î´ Î¸ t Î´ Î¸ h the optimal parameters are given in table 5 4 2 transient simulation results turbine characteristics the reft and the optt were simulated for the transient condition and the comparison is given in figs 9 and 10 the optt has a lower pressure drop during exhalation fig 9 the inlet gv is more convergent in the optimized case thus the flow is well guided and the incidence losses are reduced moreover the throat section is shifted and the diffusion region in the suction side ss of the rotor is reduced in the optt case which accelerates the boundary layer on the ss and reduces the profile losses the spanwise pressure gradient is significant in the reft it drives the crossflow and endwall secondary flow regions towards the mid span direction the low ss pressure indicates that the blade loading is high in optt the higher cp around the ss of reft indicates the high influence of secondary flows during the inhalation the pressure drop is higher in optt because of high incidence at the rotor le and formation of separation region near the le however the turbine is optimized for asymmetric flow conditions the exhalation flow rates are higher and the mean efficiency of the turbine is improved the torque output of the reft and optt for the pseudo sinusoidal wave is given in fig 10 during exhalation the optt has a higher power output and the difference is imperceptible in inhalation the loss in swirl energy per unit mass c3u 2 2 at the rotor exit is minimized thus output power increases fig 11 shows the instantaneous efficiency for inhalation and exhalation phases the peak efficiency during acceleration of exhalation cycles at Ï 1 25 is 55 5 and 39 5 for optt and reft respectively whereas the improvement in efficiency by varying only the rotor setting angle as reported in the literature liu et al 2016 is only 52 during inhalation the efficiency in optt is low compared to the reft since there is a higher pressure drop in the optt the efficiency difference between exhalation and inhalation is perceptible the mean efficiency table 6 over a pseudo sinusoidal cycle is calculated using simpson s rule the mean efficiency of the optt is 9 5 higher than reft in the optt the pressure drop across the turbine is decreased by 2 97 and the power is increased by 6 65 for a complete wave cycle during exhalation the streamwise vorticity is non dimensionalized using the rotor chord length and the mass averaged velocity at the rotor exit fig 12 a the streamwise vorticity is 9 Ï s Ï s l r v e x i t the circular arrows show the passage vortices near the casing and the hub pv c and pv h these vortices move the endwall boundary layer flow from the ps to the ss of the rotor streamwise vortices contiguous to the passage vortex with a direction of rotation opposite to the passage vortex are called trailing shed vortices hawthorne 1955 near the endwalls the trailing shed vortices roll up into distinct vortices and behave like shear layers thus these structures represent the trailing shed shear layers tssl schneider et al 2013 the passage vortex causes the entrainment of the boundary layer fluids from the endwall to the mid span fig 12 a and b the strength of the passage vortex and tssl diminishes in optt and the entrainment of the secondary flow structures towards the mid span reduces the incidence angle varies from hub to tip and influences the formation of both pv c and pv h the gv generated wake and secondary vortices interact with the rotor flow field generates the spanwise pressure gradients inside the blade passage the optimized gv reduces the gv secondary flow and wakes at the rotor inlet fig 13 shows the streamwise vorticity contours at different axial locations within the rotor blade passage the pv h transports the boundary layer fluid and mainstream towards its center it gradually grows larger in size and lifts above the endwall as it approaches the suction side to the passage exit this is primarily because of the spanwise pressure gradient the endwall boundary layer fluid is wrapped around the pv and it becomes skewed and thicker towards the suction side this lifts the endwall boundary layer and causes a vortex rotating in the counter clockwise direction which is termed as wall vortex a strong wall vortex is observed at the rotor exit in reft the strength of the pv and wall vortex was reduced in the optt however the large pitch wise pressure gradient in the optt leads to the strong interaction between the pv c and tip leakage flow the rotor exit vortices are associated with the regions of underturning and overturning the spanwise distributions of the flow angle at the rotor exit for exhalation are given in fig 14 the flow angle at the rotor exit for optt is adjusted to the reft exit flow angle 60 for comparison the casing pv c and hub pv h passage vortex cause a strong overturning which appears in reft at 20 and 80 span for both the acceleration and deceleration the highest deviation of the turning angle due to the tip leakage vortex is found in optt at a 90 span fig 15 shows the total pressure loss at the rotor exit the local total pressure loss coefficient is defined as cui and tucker 2016 10 c l o s s p 0 i n p 0 p 0 i n p e x i t where p 0in is the total pressure at the rotor inlet p 0 is the local total pressure and p exit is the static pressure at the rotor exit the 30 of the span is occupied by the hub passage vortex pv h and tssl h loss cores in the reft the optt has lower losses in the mid span region compared to the reft the total pressure loss in the tip region is higher than the other spans for both cases this is due to the tip leakage flow and its interaction with the casing passage vortex tip leakage flow losses occupy a 10 span and the peak tip leakage loss is found in optt this implies that the optt is more liable to tip leakage flow however the total pressure loss is reduced up to 80 span the trailing shed shear layer loss passage vortex loss cores at the casing and the hub was significantly reduced in the optt fig 16 shows the total pressure loss development along the rotor blade passage from fig 16 a 25 more loss is observed at the exit for the reft since the passage vortex and tssl develops axially along the blade passage the total pressure losses increase gradually from le to te in other words the losses are generated in the reft due to the development of pv tssl and interaction of the pv c with the tip leakage flow inside the rotor passage the viscous dissipation Î´ from eq 11 is employed to compute the loss generation zones in the blade passage and it is non dimensionalized by the area averaged viscous dissipation at the rotor exit cui and tucker 2016 11 Î´ Î¼ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 Î´ i j u i x i u i x j the viscous dissipation at different axial locations within the rotor passage is shown in fig 17 at x 0 5c h the pv loss core starts developing from the ps as the pv loss core moves towards downstream to x 0 65c h it entrains into the midspan by the radial pressure gradient in the boundary layer on the ss at x 0 8c h the tip clearance loss cores start to develop and the pv moves towards the ss at the exit high loss generation rates near the casing are observed due to the interaction between pv c and tip leakage vortex the redesigned gv has controlled the rotor losses in optt the optt has higher tip leakage losses however the pv loss cores inside the rotor were minimized 4 3 starting characteristics of the turbine under irregular flow conditions since the ocean waves are random in nature it is necessary to analyze the turbine performance under irregular flow conditions the irregular wave conditions used for the simulations are based on the actual sea data obtained from a wave rider buoy of the indian national centre for ocean information services incois the significant wave height h s and the peak time period t p for the year 2016 in the east coast of india are given in fig 18 for the test irregular wave the peak time period t p 5 15 s and h s 1 24 m the test irregular wave is based on pierson moskowitz pm spectrum for the fully developed sea the spectrum is given as chakrabarti 1987 12 s f 5 Ï 2 2 Ï 4 g 2 t p 4 g 2 2 Ï 4 1 f 5 e 1 25 t p 4 f 4 where Ï h s 4 the spectral density obtained from the above empirical relationship is shown in fig 19 the resultant wave elevation is given by the eq 13 chakrabarti 1987 dean and dalrymple 1989 13 h t i 1 n a i cos f i t Ï i 14 a i 2 s f i Î´ f the frequency f i and phase Ï i are generated as random inputs in matlab and the wave amplitude is obtained from eq 14 the dimensionless wave surface elevation is obtained as in fig 20 using the above pm spectrum a linear water wave theory approximation is used to formulate the heave motion of the water surface elevation inside the chamber assuming a small cylinder radius compared with the wavelength for a fixed owc wec fig 21 with a single degree of freedom the relation between the incident wave height h and the wave height inside the chamber h can be written as kim et al 2001 thakker et al 2004 15 h d 2 h d t 2 d h d t 2 b a Ï s a c d h d t Î´ p Ï s 2 g h g h h 0 where b a Î´ p a c 2 a t v a the above equation is analogous to a mechanical mass spring damper with a single degree of freedom the force to velocity ratio b a is the turbine induced damping and it influences the motion of the water entrained inside the chamber curran et al 2000 the second term d h d t 2 is proportional to Î´ p Ï as the relationship between Î´ p and dh dt is obtained from the characteristics of the turbine c a hence Î´ p Ï s f dh dt kim et al 2001 the last term g h h is the excitation force found from the hydrodynamic pressure of the incident and scattered waves the diameter of the chamber is smaller than the wave length l the wave scattering in the chamber are neglected by small body approximation falnes 2002 only the turbine damping was considered while the compressibility and viscous effects inside the chamber are excluded the eq 15 was solved using runge kutta method and the time series of wave height inside the air chamber h is plotted in fig 22 a the inlet axial velocity v a is directly proportional to the variation of wave height in the air chamber by assuming the flow as incompressible in the chamber kim et al 2001 the time series of v a is shown in fig 22 b and the relation can be written as 16 v a 1 m d h d t where m a t a c 0 0234 the unsteady turbine characteristics obtained from the simulations of oscillating flow conditions are used to evaluate turbine starting characteristics under irregular flow conditions the governing equation for the rotation of the turbine in the irregular flow can be written in a non dimensional form as kim et al 2001 17 k 2 x i d Ï d t x l c t Ï k Ï 2 v a 2 2 Ï r r 4 1 Î½ 1 Î½ where k is the dimensionless period x i is the non dimensional moment of inertia and x l 0 is the non dimensional loading torque from fig 23 it can be observed that the optt tends to start in a short period it is to be noted that both the optt and reft have the same moment of inertia it shows a steady running condition with a lower rotational speed fig 23 because of the higher torque coefficient for the same flow coefficient the optt enables us to design a better turbine with a low operating rotational speed which dwindles noise the dimensionless loading coefficient is defined as Ï Î´ c u u r Î´ c u is the change in blade tangential velocity the low rotational speed indicates that the blade loading in the optt is high due to large flow turning in the blade passage moreover the abrupt deceleration of n r at low flow rates is reduced the ripples in the rotating speed during high amplitude variation in waves are reduced drastically because of the higher flow coefficient in the case of reft the speed decelerates abruptly at two regions during t 8 and 16 and the turbine rotates due to its inertia the turbine spends energy on its rotation until a new wave of considerable wave height strikes the chamber whereas for the same irregular test wave the optt does not show sudden deceleration throughout its operation and can operate even at a low wave climate for some considerable time thus the optt can be preferable for the frequent low energetic wave climate regions fig 24 shows the variation of differential pressure versus flow rate the closed curve depicts the damping of the turbine to the airflow through the chamber the turbine aerodynamic efficiency and wave energy absorption are closely related through the turbine rotational speed the broader loop symbolizes the loss of energy in the work of compression sarmento et al 1990 the optt gives a lower compression work and delivers higher average efficiency in impulse turbines the flow rate is approximately proportional to the square root of the pressure head falcÃ£o 2002 5 conclusion in this work a bidirectional impulse turbine was optimized using the was model and simulated using urans under pseudo sinusoidal and irregular flow conditions the irregular flow condition was obtained using the pm wave spectrum the stagger angle of the rotor was found to be a sensitive parameter and that was optimized with the objective function to improve the mean efficiency the major conclusion are given below 1 the optimum mean efficiency predicted by the was model was compared with the mean efficiency of urans simulations for the optimized design optt with an error of 1 58 the mean efficiency and the shaft power of the turbine were improved by 9 5 and 6 65 respectively relative to the reference turbine reft 2 in the simulations it was observed that a passage vortex was generated near the hub and the tip of the rotor due to the interaction between the rotor flow field and upstream gv secondary flow structures these vortices transported the end wall boundary layer fluid to the mid span for the optimized turbine the adverse pressure gradient was reduced and the vortices were weakened near the hub and casing compared to the reference turbine 3 the loading coefficient is also observed to be high compared to the reference turbine due to the large flow turning in the blade passage the exit flow angle deviation was observed to be lower for the optimized turbine compared to the reference turbine thus due to the above stated behaviors the optimized turbine operated with minimized losses in the rotor exit the optimized turbine also operated with an improvement in efficiency compared to the reference turbine 4 the characteristic curves obtained by urans for both the turbines were tested for starting and running characteristics it was observed that the optimized turbine showed better starting and running characteristics with lower work of compression and turbine induced damping compared

20911,an oscillating water column owc wave energy device can use a bidirectional flow impulse turbine for energy extraction the airflow velocity profiles during inhalation and exhalation of the owc are asymmetric and the flowrate at exhalation is higher hence this article presents an optimized turbine to work for asymmetrical airflow conditions the rotor blade setting angle Î³ was made asymmetric with a non zero setting angle and the guide vane shape was optimized the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans were solved to get the objective function values for the latin hypercube sampling lhs generated design space a pseudo sinusoidal velocity profile replicating the flow inside the owc device was used for the transient simulations a weighted average surrogate model generated the initial population for a hybrid genetic algorithm to produce optimum designs the effect of turbine induced damping and starting characteristics were analyzed under irregular flow conditions obtained from the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum the optimized turbine resulted in better starting and running characteristics also the mean efficiency of the optimized turbine was increased relatively by 9 5 index terms surrogate based optimization oscillating water column bi directional impulse turbine unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations 1 introduction the oscillating water column owc device is the most notable wave energy conversion device an owc plant converts the wave motion to a reciprocating airflow which drives a self rectifying air turbine a bidirectional impulse turbine can be employed as a power take off system for the owc device falcÃ£o and henriques 2016 the magnitudes of the tangential and axial forces vary during the wave cycle the tangential force direction is independent of the flow direction torresi et al 2009 the turbine rotational speed changes in accordance with the sea state thereby affecting the pressure drop and flowrate across the turbine turbine induced damping affects the compressibility of air inside the owc chamber and suppresses the motion of the water entrained in the chamber this causes a change in the hydrodynamic performance of the owc system kim et al 2001 impulse turbines operate at lower rotational speed compared to their counterpart wells turbine kim et al 2001 thus it is less affected by the compressibility effects and centrifugal stresses predominantly during high energetic wave climate impulse turbines also have a broader operating range compared to the wells turbines the aerodynamic losses in an impulse turbine due to an excessive incidence flow angle at the entry to the second row of guide vanes is considered as a major problem falcÃ£o and henriques 2016 thakker et al a thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 reported that 21 of average pressure is lost at the downstream guide vanes gv several works reported the performance enhancement of the turbine by modifying the design parameters such as blade thickness camber line and stacking etc gomes et al 2012 the 3d gvs enhances the recovery of exit kinetic energy from the rotor ajit thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 the volumetric flow rate profiles are asymmetric in the owc air chamber dixon and hall 2014 setoguchi et al 2003 the exhalation flow rate chamber to atmosphere is relatively higher to perform better in such asymmetric airflow conditions a twin unidirectional impulse turbine configuration was proposed jayashankar et al 2009 mala et al 2011 a similar turbine was numerically analyzed pereiras et al 2014 and the observations show that one third of the flow energy is lost during the inhalation process due to incidence losses moreover if both the turbines are connected to the same shaft the negative torque generated in the inhalation process deteriorates the overall torque steady state simulations were performed liu et al 2016 on a bidirectional flow impulse turbine with a non zero setting angle to make it adaptable for pseudo sinusoidal airflow the rotor blade shape was kept fixed and the modifications were implemented on the blade setting angle Î³ it was observed that Î³ 5 with corresponding variations in gvs produced better mean efficiency compared to the non zero setting angle rotor the average pressure loss in the exit gvs is higher than that of the upstream gvs and rotor passage a thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 gv shape optimization according to the rotor setting angle is required to recover the rotor exit swirl energy systematic optimization of the rotor setting angle and the gv shape for a pseudo sinusoidal airflow was not studied yet there is a noticeable difference in the performance of the turbine between acceleration and deceleration ghisu et al 2016 a transient analysis is required to study the development of vortical structures and their interactions occurring during acceleration and deceleration these structures affect the performance of the turbine during both phases of the flow thus an unsteady simulation was performed pereiras et al 2011 for a radial impulse turbine multiple surrogate methods were widely used in multidisciplinary optimizations due to its reliability and cost effectiveness to find the global optima viana et al 2014 the surrogate models are problem dependent and a single surrogate might perform poorly in the design space samad et al 2008 the weighted average surrogate was model was proposed goel et al 2007 by combining basic surrogates such as response surface approximation rsa kriging krg and radial basis function rbf to overcome such issue the proposed was model was validated with test functions like the branin hoo function camelback function hartman function and goldstein price function finally the was model yielded lower rms errors than the best press model for all these test functions the turbomachinery problems are usually associated with complicated flow features and multiple local optima samad et al 2008 unlike the first order or second order optimization methods that have straightforward solutions the optimum in genetic algorithms is found after a large number of trials considering this in the case of large scale turbomachinery problems we can expect a better solution with a genetic algorithm ga than first or second order optimization methods however the ga do not necessarily give an optimal solution as they are meta heuristics which usually converge to local optimum places which are locally best in the chromosome space which cannot be left in a single generation in a multi dimensional space at times thus a ga sequential quadratic programming sqp hybrid algorithm search method is used to handle these local optima as well as global optima and has faster convergence alsumait et al 2010 than other metaheuristic algorithms shape optimization using multiple surrogate methods are successfully applied in many turbomachinery optimizations ezhilsabareesh et al 2018 lee and kim 2010 samad et al 2008 in this work a bidirectional impulse turbine maeda et al 1999 is taken as the reference turbine and optimization was performed the reference and the optimized turbines were compared numerically the objectives of this paper are outlined as to find the effect of blade setting angle on the aerodynamic performance through transient simulations optimization of the blade setting angle of the rotor hub and tip gv angles according to setting angle through a surrogate model based hybrid genetic algorithm hga the effect of the rotor blade setting angle hub and tip gv angles are analyzed for the starting characteristics of the turbine under irregular flow conditions the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 reports the numerical model and problem statement section 3 describes the optimization procedure the results are discussed in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are made in section 5 2 numerical model and problem description the reference turbine geometry maeda et al 1999 the detailed specifications of the rotor and the gv are given in table 1 the modified turbine with a positive setting angle suitable for asymmetric airflow is given in fig 1 subscripts e and i represent exhalation and inhalation respectively the rotor blade pitch setting angle Î³ was made asymmetric the gv setting angles Î¸ and Î´ were changed according to the rotor setting angle so that the flow leaving the gv will be axial this enlarges the pressure side area for the exhalation airflow and shifts the minimum pressure point which leads to a delayed separation that occurs on the suction side to improve the mean efficiency of the turbine the idealized pseudo sinusoidal flow condition liu et al 2016 was used as an inlet condition for transient simulation and to evaluate the turbine performance for the asymmetrical flow fig 2 researchers setoguchi et al 2003 reported a lower peak axial velocity during inhalation v i than exhalation v e the ratio is v i v e 0 6 the exhalation period is t 1 v i t v e v i and the inhalation period is t 2 v e t v e v i the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation was solved for an incompressible ideal gas using a commercial code ansys cfx the k Ï sst was used for turbulence closure with the Î³ Î¸ transition model the low reynolds number method was applied to resolve the boundary layer profile and y 1 with the wall normal expansion ratio of 1 1 were maintained on all blade surfaces the second order backward euler scheme was used for time discretization the high resolution schemes for advection terms and the transient rotor stator interface ansys cfx solver theory guide n d were used to simulate the transient interaction of the flow between stator and rotor passage for the interface treatment the dynamically adaptive unstructured grids allow the grids to deform only at the interface as the geometry changes its position such a method can be applied to the structured grid however requires additional complex measures to avoid degradation of grid quality whereas the grid deformation in the unstructured meshes can be accounted for by moving only the nodes lying on the interface while the interior nodes and grid connectivity are unaltered blades and marcum 2007 mathur 1994 as the viscous region demands high aspect ratio grid cells the unstructured grid generates triangular stretched elements leading to truncation error which is due to large grid angles sayma et al 2000 sharov and nakahashi 1998 to tackle this problem prismatic grids were generated near the blade surface for a stretched grid and tetrahedral grids were generated in the rest of the computational domain the hybrid grid at the leading edge of the rotor is shown in fig 3 for transient calculations frozen rotor simulations were used as an initial condition residuals were in the order of 10 5 for all simulations a typical convergence history of the mass momentum turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation Ï is illustrated in fig 4 a the number of sub iterations for each physical time step is fixed to 20 a single passage with periodic boundary conditions was simulated a pseudo sinusoidal velocity profile as shown in fig 2 with a turbulent intensity of 5 was given as inlet condition and an opening boundary condition was imposed at the exit allowing the bidirectional flow the rotational speed was set to 600 rpm and the frequency of the pseudo sinusoidal wave was 0 1 hz for transient analysis the time step of 0 0349 radians rotation of the turbine was considered hence the time step is 5 10 4 seconds during experiments setoguchi et al 2001 the frequency of the oscillating flow was considered as 0 1 hz and the same was adapted for present transient simulations hence the total computational time is 10 s the simulations are run for three pseudo sinusoidal flow period to exclude the initial transient and to attain a periodically stable state a time step independent study is shown in fig 4 b the higher harmonic components are captured with an increase in time resolution for Î´t 0 01 s the pressure drop is lower when compared to higher time steps because the higher order unsteadiness is not captured in lower time steps the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions was computed by the following non dimensional parameters maeda et

the tke is considered more sensitive to the grid resolution than mean flow quantities cui and tucker 2016 fig 5 shows the indistinctive comparison of tke between 2 and 4 million elements the transient simulation results were compared with the experimental results of maeda et al 1999 under sinusoidally oscillating flow conditions fig 6 shows the comparison of mean efficiency between numerical and experimental data over prediction of mean efficiency occurs at a higher flow coefficient and the maximum deviation from the experimental data is 8 the measured uncertainty in the experiments maeda et al 1999 for efficiency is about 2 this shows that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data this uncertainty is calculated from the dispersion of the measured physical quantities such as differential pressure airflow rate turbine torque and angular velocity which are considered for the calculation of efficiency 3 single objective optimization procedure a high fidelity model based analysis and optimization requires a huge number of designs to be evaluated and thus requires high computation time the surrogate based optimization methodology which mimics the high fidelity model and approximates the responses helps to reduce such computational burden shan and wang 2010 the search algorithm to find the optimal points was a hybrid genetic algorithm hga urans equations were solved numerically to find the mean efficiency of the design space and surrogate functions were generated the design space was filled with latin hypercube sampling technique to combine different surrogates the weights are selected based on the global measure of goodness and they are fixed in design space w i x c i x the global weights are selected using a generalized mean square cross validation error gmse or press in rsm terminology the weights are selected in such a way that it filters out adverse effects of the model which represents the data well however performs poorly in unexplored regions goel et al 2007 the surrogate models and weight selection strategies are explained in detail in appendix i halder et al 2018 to validate the surrogate models a k fold cross validation strategy is used in this method the learning sample containing p test points is divided into k folds a single fold is retained for validation and the remaining k 1 folds are trained to obtain the cross validation error this procedure is repeated k times to obtain the press vector e iooss 2009 viana et al 2009 the root mean square error rmse obtained from the press vector can be given as 7 p r e s s r m s 1 p e e t one of the important factors in the optimization procedure is the parameterization of blade shape it includes the selection of design variables and design space since a large number of design variables increases the design space and computational time only important parameters are considered for optimization the design variables used were the stagger angle Î³ hub gv deflection Î´ Î¸ h and tip gv deflection Î´ Î¸ t using these variables a design space was created table 2 and the sample points fig 7 were selected the number of variables k is 3 and the sample size m is 18 based on the suggestions the value of m k ratio is maintained below 10 stein 1987 since the number of variables is less the sample size is adequate the maximum number of generations is 50 the population size is 50 and the population is uniformly generated the stopping criterion is defined as the average cumulative change in values of the fitness function and constraints over generations are less than 1 10 6 a gaussian operator is used for mutation and the scattered and stochastic uniform method is used for crossover and selection function respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 design optimization results numerical simulations were performed for the samples and the surrogates were constructed the weights for the was were computed tabulated in table 3 the formulation of the was is given as 8 f w a s 0 3042 f r b n n 0 2012 f r s a 0 4945 f k r g the optimization results in table 4 show that the relative error f s u r r o g a t e f u r a n s f s u r r o g a t e is around 1 58 the optimal turbine optt and the reference turbine reft have the objective function values of 0 445 and 0 405 both urans predicted respectively hence a mean efficiency increment of 9 87 was achieved the design variable sensitivity within a limit of 10 from their optimum values is presented fig 8 with the optimal objective function values f opt the objective function is highly sensitive to the stagger angle Î³ the sensitivity is sequenced as Î³ Î´ Î¸ t Î´ Î¸ h the optimal parameters are given in table 5 4 2 transient simulation results turbine characteristics the reft and the optt were simulated for the transient condition and the comparison is given in figs 9 and 10 the optt has a lower pressure drop during exhalation fig 9 the inlet gv is more convergent in the optimized case thus the flow is well guided and the incidence losses are reduced moreover the throat section is shifted and the diffusion region in the suction side ss of the rotor is reduced in the optt case which accelerates the boundary layer on the ss and reduces the profile losses the spanwise pressure gradient is significant in the reft it drives the crossflow and endwall secondary flow regions towards the mid span direction the low ss pressure indicates that the blade loading is high in optt the higher cp around the ss of reft indicates the high influence of secondary flows during the inhalation the pressure drop is higher in optt because of high incidence at the rotor le and formation of separation region near the le however the turbine is optimized for asymmetric flow conditions the exhalation flow rates are higher and the mean efficiency of the turbine is improved the torque output of the reft and optt for the pseudo sinusoidal wave is given in fig 10 during exhalation the optt has a higher power output and the difference is imperceptible in inhalation the loss in swirl energy per unit mass c3u 2 2 at the rotor exit is minimized thus output power increases fig 11 shows the instantaneous efficiency for inhalation and exhalation phases the peak efficiency during acceleration of exhalation cycles at Ï 1 25 is 55 5 and 39 5 for optt and reft respectively whereas the improvement in efficiency by varying only the rotor setting angle as reported in the literature liu et al 2016 is only 52 during inhalation the efficiency in optt is low compared to the reft since there is a higher pressure drop in the optt the efficiency difference between exhalation and inhalation is perceptible the mean efficiency table 6 over a pseudo sinusoidal cycle is calculated using simpson s rule the mean efficiency of the optt is 9 5 higher than reft in the optt the pressure drop across the turbine is decreased by 2 97 and the power is increased by 6 65 for a complete wave cycle during exhalation the streamwise vorticity is non dimensionalized using the rotor chord length and the mass averaged velocity at the rotor exit fig 12 a the streamwise vorticity is 9 Ï s Ï s l r v e x i t the circular arrows show the passage vortices near the casing and the hub pv c and pv h these vortices move the endwall boundary layer flow from the ps to the ss of the rotor streamwise vortices contiguous to the passage vortex with a direction of rotation opposite to the passage vortex are called trailing shed vortices hawthorne 1955 near the endwalls the trailing shed vortices roll up into distinct vortices and behave like shear layers thus these structures represent the trailing shed shear layers tssl schneider et al 2013 the passage vortex causes the entrainment of the boundary layer fluids from the endwall to the mid span fig 12 a and b the strength of the passage vortex and tssl diminishes in optt and the entrainment of the secondary flow structures towards the mid span reduces the incidence angle varies from hub to tip and influences the formation of both pv c and pv h the gv generated wake and secondary vortices interact with the rotor flow field generates the spanwise pressure gradients inside the blade passage the optimized gv reduces the gv secondary flow and wakes at the rotor inlet fig 13 shows the streamwise vorticity contours at different axial locations within the rotor blade passage the pv h transports the boundary layer fluid and mainstream towards its center it gradually grows larger in size and lifts above the endwall as it approaches the suction side to the passage exit this is primarily because of the spanwise pressure gradient the endwall boundary layer fluid is wrapped around the pv and it becomes skewed and thicker towards the suction side this lifts the endwall boundary layer and causes a vortex rotating in the counter clockwise direction which is termed as wall vortex a strong wall vortex is observed at the rotor exit in reft the strength of the pv and wall vortex was reduced in the optt however the large pitch wise pressure gradient in the optt leads to the strong interaction between the pv c and tip leakage flow the rotor exit vortices are associated with the regions of underturning and overturning the spanwise distributions of the flow angle at the rotor exit for exhalation are given in fig 14 the flow angle at the rotor exit for optt is adjusted to the reft exit flow angle 60 for comparison the casing pv c and hub pv h passage vortex cause a strong overturning which appears in reft at 20 and 80 span for both the acceleration and deceleration the highest deviation of the turning angle due to the tip leakage vortex is found in optt at a 90 span fig 15 shows the total pressure loss at the rotor exit the local total pressure loss coefficient is defined as cui and tucker 2016 10 c l o s s p 0 i n p 0 p 0 i n p e x i t where p 0in is the total pressure at the rotor inlet p 0 is the local total pressure and p exit is the static pressure at the rotor exit the 30 of the span is occupied by the hub passage vortex pv h and tssl h loss cores in the reft the optt has lower losses in the mid span region compared to the reft the total pressure loss in the tip region is higher than the other spans for both cases this is due to the tip leakage flow and its interaction with the casing passage vortex tip leakage flow losses occupy a 10 span and the peak tip leakage loss is found in optt this implies that the optt is more liable to tip leakage flow however the total pressure loss is reduced up to 80 span the trailing shed shear layer loss passage vortex loss cores at the casing and the hub was significantly reduced in the optt fig 16 shows the total pressure loss development along the rotor blade passage from fig 16 a 25 more loss is observed at the exit for the reft since the passage vortex and tssl develops axially along the blade passage the total pressure losses increase gradually from le to te in other words the losses are generated in the reft due to the development of pv tssl and interaction of the pv c with the tip leakage flow inside the rotor passage the viscous dissipation Î´ from eq 11 is employed to compute the loss generation zones in the blade passage and it is non dimensionalized by the area averaged viscous dissipation at the rotor exit cui and tucker 2016 11 Î´ Î¼ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 Î´ i j u i x i u i x j the viscous dissipation at different axial locations within the rotor passage is shown in fig 17 at x 0 5c h the pv loss core starts developing from the ps as the pv loss core moves towards downstream to x 0 65c h it entrains into the midspan by the radial pressure gradient in the boundary layer on the ss at x 0 8c h the tip clearance loss cores start to develop and the pv moves towards the ss at the exit high loss generation rates near the casing are observed due to the interaction between pv c and tip leakage vortex the redesigned gv has controlled the rotor losses in optt the optt has higher tip leakage losses however the pv loss cores inside the rotor were minimized 4 3 starting characteristics of the turbine under irregular flow conditions since the ocean waves are random in nature it is necessary to analyze the turbine performance under irregular flow conditions the irregular wave conditions used for the simulations are based on the actual sea data obtained from a wave rider buoy of the indian national centre for ocean information services incois the significant wave height h s and the peak time period t p for the year 2016 in the east coast of india are given in fig 18 for the test irregular wave the peak time period t p 5 15 s and h s 1 24 m the test irregular wave is based on pierson moskowitz pm spectrum for the fully developed sea the spectrum is given as chakrabarti 1987 12 s f 5 Ï 2 2 Ï 4 g 2 t p 4 g 2 2 Ï 4 1 f 5 e 1 25 t p 4 f 4 where Ï h s 4 the spectral density obtained from the above empirical relationship is shown in fig 19 the resultant wave elevation is given by the eq 13 chakrabarti 1987 dean and dalrymple 1989 13 h t i 1 n a i cos f i t Ï i 14 a i 2 s f i Î´ f the frequency f i and phase Ï i are generated as random inputs in matlab and the wave amplitude is obtained from eq 14 the dimensionless wave surface elevation is obtained as in fig 20 using the above pm spectrum a linear water wave theory approximation is used to formulate the heave motion of the water surface elevation inside the chamber assuming a small cylinder radius compared with the wavelength for a fixed owc wec fig 21 with a single degree of freedom the relation between the incident wave height h and the wave height inside the chamber h can be written as kim et al 2001 thakker et al 2004 15 h d 2 h d t 2 d h d t 2 b a Ï s a c d h d t Î´ p Ï s 2 g h g h h 0 where b a Î´ p a c 2 a t v a the above equation is analogous to a mechanical mass spring damper with a single degree of freedom the force to velocity ratio b a is the turbine induced damping and it influences the motion of the water entrained inside the chamber curran et al 2000 the second term d h d t 2 is proportional to Î´ p Ï as the relationship between Î´ p and dh dt is obtained from the characteristics of the turbine c a hence Î´ p Ï s f dh dt kim et al 2001 the last term g h h is the excitation force found from the hydrodynamic pressure of the incident and scattered waves the diameter of the chamber is smaller than the wave length l the wave scattering in the chamber are neglected by small body approximation falnes 2002 only the turbine damping was considered while the compressibility and viscous effects inside the chamber are excluded the eq 15 was solved using runge kutta method and the time series of wave height inside the air chamber h is plotted in fig 22 a the inlet axial velocity v a is directly proportional to the variation of wave height in the air chamber by assuming the flow as incompressible in the chamber kim et al 2001 the time series of v a is shown in fig 22 b and the relation can be written as 16 v a 1 m d h d t where m a t a c 0 0234 the unsteady turbine characteristics obtained from the simulations of oscillating flow conditions are used to evaluate turbine starting characteristics under irregular flow conditions the governing equation for the rotation of the turbine in the irregular flow can be written in a non dimensional form as kim et al 2001 17 k 2 x i d Ï d t x l c t Ï k Ï 2 v a 2 2 Ï r r 4 1 Î½ 1 Î½ where k is the dimensionless period x i is the non dimensional moment of inertia and x l 0 is the non dimensional loading torque from fig 23 it can be observed that the optt tends to start in a short period it is to be noted that both the optt and reft have the same moment of inertia it shows a steady running condition with a lower rotational speed fig 23 because of the higher torque coefficient for the same flow coefficient the optt enables us to design a better turbine with a low operating rotational speed which dwindles noise the dimensionless loading coefficient is defined as Ï Î´ c u u r Î´ c u is the change in blade tangential velocity the low rotational speed indicates that the blade loading in the optt is high due to large flow turning in the blade passage moreover the abrupt deceleration of n r at low flow rates is reduced the ripples in the rotating speed during high amplitude variation in waves are reduced drastically because of the higher flow coefficient in the case of reft the speed decelerates abruptly at two regions during t 8 and 16 and the turbine rotates due to its inertia the turbine spends energy on its rotation until a new wave of considerable wave height strikes the chamber whereas for the same irregular test wave the optt does not show sudden deceleration throughout its operation and can operate even at a low wave climate for some considerable time thus the optt can be preferable for the frequent low energetic wave climate regions fig 24 shows the variation of differential pressure versus flow rate the closed curve depicts the damping of the turbine to the airflow through the chamber the turbine aerodynamic efficiency and wave energy absorption are closely related through the turbine rotational speed the broader loop symbolizes the loss of energy in the work of compression sarmento et al 1990 the optt gives a lower compression work and delivers higher average efficiency in impulse turbines the flow rate is approximately proportional to the square root of the pressure head falcÃ£o 2002 5 conclusion in this work a bidirectional impulse turbine was optimized using the was model and simulated using urans under pseudo sinusoidal and irregular flow conditions the irregular flow condition was obtained using the pm wave spectrum the stagger angle of the rotor was found to be a sensitive parameter and that was optimized with the objective function to improve the mean efficiency the major conclusion are given below 1 the optimum mean efficiency predicted by the was model was compared with the mean efficiency of urans simulations for the optimized design optt with an error of 1 58 the mean efficiency and the shaft power of the turbine were improved by 9 5 and 6 65 respectively relative to the reference turbine reft 2 in the simulations it was observed that a passage vortex was generated near the hub and the tip of the rotor due to the interaction between the rotor flow field and upstream gv secondary flow structures these vortices transported the end wall boundary layer fluid to the mid span for the optimized turbine the adverse pressure gradient was reduced and the vortices were weakened near the hub and casing compared to the reference turbine 3 the loading coefficient is also observed to be high compared to the reference turbine due to the large flow turning in the blade passage the exit flow angle deviation was observed to be lower for the optimized turbine compared to the reference turbine thus due to the above stated behaviors the optimized turbine operated with minimized losses in the rotor exit the optimized turbine also operated with an improvement in efficiency compared to the reference turbine 4 the characteristic curves obtained by urans for both the turbines were tested for starting and running characteristics it was observed that the optimized turbine showed better starting and running characteristics with lower work of compression and turbine induced damping compared

20912,an analysis of the ultimate strength of a cracked stiffened panel repaired by carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp under axial compression is presented the analysis method adopts the nonlinear mechanics of adhesives in the interaction of cfrp with the steel structure the numerical model is validated by tests of cracked plates repaired by cfrp the collapse of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp revealed that the debonding of cfrp happens after buckling the cfrp repair can recover the ultimate strength of the cracked structure to the one of the intact panel a series of analysis is performed with the validated numerical model to investigate the effects of geometry configuration of cfrp and crack length on the ultimate strength crack treatment with stop holes is also studied and the results show that the repair of the cfrp can recover the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel with the occurrence of the stop holes at the same time as it may reduce the stress levels significantly keywords ultimate strength carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp cracked stiffened panels axial compression repair 1 introduction the occurrence of cracks in steel stiffened plates will reduce their ultimate strength under compression bayatfar et al 2014 shi et al 2017 2019 xu et al 2014 as the damage will induce an earlier collapse traditionally plates with cracks are replaced by new steel plates wang et al 2012 and the repair is done in dock however it will cost much if a fpso or other offshore platform would need to be out of operation welding offshore is considered to be of high risk if performed at sea thus it is desired to find an alternative repair method for the offshore oil industry which does not require welding carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp is a composite material consisting of high strength continuous carbon fibres arranged with certain rules and impregnated or pultruded with resin it is widely accepted as an excellent strengthening material for steel or concrete structures due to its high strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance advantages it represents a good option for the no welding repair cfrp has demonstrated to strengthen or repair effectively steel structures with defects or damages closed section profile repairs or strengthening have been shown to be an efficient method by experiments and numerical methods cfrp wrapping method is an effective technology to enhance the axial compression behaviour of a damaged circular hollow section steel column with a reduced thickness locally the steel stub failed as the local buckling happens in the weakened section while the cfrp ruptures in the fibre orientation huang et al 2017 square and rectangular hollow section steel columns with partially strengthened by cfrp under compression will buckle afterwards where buckling tends to be formed at the non strengthened part between two consecutive strengthened zones abu sena et al 2019 cfrp repair of severely corroded steel circular pipes under loading in the mid section with corrosion shows no cfrp failure elchalakani et al 2017a beams with steel channels and with their section strengthened by cfrp subjected to three point bending were studied in six sets of different configurations selvaraj and madhavan 2016 as well as the stainless steel hollow square and rectangular sections strengthened by cfrp under web crippling loading configurations islam et al 2019 it was found that the closed warp will induce different failure modes of the cfrp by comparing with the open section strengthening configuration closed repair or strengthening can restrain the debonding of the fibre layers along the longitudinal direction a k joints tubular structure with circular hollow section were strengthened by cfrp with compression loading the brace pipe the failure happened as the steel crack in the tension side and fibre breakage crush debonding and slippage in the edge due to the complicated stress state fu et al 2016 tong et al 2019 in these loading process the cfrp will be in tension to enhance the structure using the closed section repair or strengthening with the main failure of the cfrp as fiber rupture or breakage addressing now the numerical models used to analyse this type of structures simplified models have been adopted due to the dominant effect of the strength of the fibres the numerical model may be simplified using membrane elements m3d4r in abaqus irrespective of the bending stiffness in an equivalent composite model whose properties were treated as linear chen et al 2014 another simplified model is using structural solid elements solid185 to represent the cfrp contacting the steel structure with the contact element conta174 of ansys sundarraja et al 2014 the behaviour of the contact surface was chosen to be bonded while the separation between bonded surfaces was also allowed some studies were also performed to investigate the cfrp strengthening or repair effect on structures under tension loading as patches in an open profile the tensile behaviour of steel plates with a centre hole strengthened by cfrp plates under marine environment were experimentally studied by wang et al 2018 a series of tests have been performed to study the compression loading capacity of a steel plate strengthened by cfrp ardalani et al 2017 and gfrp patches in one or two sides elchalakani et al 2017b nateghi alahi and khazaei poul 2012 the open section strengthening type can affect significantly the ultimate strength the failure of the cfrp strengthened plate may be caused by a combination of several modes with the first one debonding in the interface of the steel and adhesive some other failure modes also happen in the compression loading process as the fibre ruptures in the direction perpendicular to the main direction of the composite laminate and the main direction of cfrp layers steel plate buckling a number of studies on the tensile and compressive characteristics of cfrp strengthened by composite patches have been carried out in the past in the work of soutis et al 1999 the compressive behaviour of patched cfrp laminates has been investigated liu and wang 2007 repaired a composite plate using external bonded patches the tensile behaviour of repairs was studied as a function of patch lay up and patch size it was found that the failure of the repairs is mainly caused by the debonding of patches cheng et al 2014 2011 investigated the tensile behaviour of patch repaired cfrp laminates experimentally and numerically and proposed related optimization of bonded patch repairs accordingly the failure happens as the cfrp plate buckles and the adhesive debonds compared with the closed section profile type cfrp the open one has different failure modes as the debonding in the interface happens first the dominant factor is the adhesive strength some researches are focused on the mechanics of the adhesive by tests and numerical methods akbar et al 2010 al mosawe and al mahaidi 2019 wu et al 2012 due to nonlinear and complex properties of the adhesive it is better to simulate the adhesive layer by the energy method amraei et al 2020 li et al 2019 tie et al 2018 a simplified model of the shell element s4r was used to simulate the steel tubes and the open profile cfrp with a complete bound to simulate the interaction between the steel and cfrp nabati and ghanbari ghazijahani 2020 however it is difficult to simulate the debonding failure in marine environment steel ships will always have the potential to have fatigue cracks the existence of the crack can have a significant reduction in the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened plates for fatigue crack repair in steel structures bonded cfrp approach appears as an attractive option fatigue performance of steel structures strengthened with cfrp has been widely studied deng and lee 2007 yu et al 2014 results indicated that cfrp overlays could effectively slow down of crack growth and extend fatigue life yu et al 2014 the cfrp composite patches have been used to repair cracks in a royal australian navy frigate to inhibit the recurrence of superstructure fatigue crack propagation this composite material repair have been in service for 15 years grabovac and whittaker 2009 the results indicate that the carbon patch was effective in restoring the strength and function of the damaged structure fatigue performance when the cfrp overlays were applied over the initial crack was obtained in terms of crack growth life ratios as reported in a finite element model study wang et al 2014 it is found that the cfrp will strengthen the tension and fatigue effectively however the buckling collapse will be the main failure type of the ships or platform structures under compression for the thin walled structures as stiffened panels the benefit in improving the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel under compression has not been extensively evaluated notches or holes have been applied to simulate the steel damage deng et al 2016 the fatigue behaviour of cfrp strengthened open hole steel plates was studied by experimental and finite element method wang et al 2017 typical failure modes local strain evolution and stiffness degradation behaviour of the test open hole details were reported the results show that the use of single and triple layered cfrp strengthening results in fatigue life enhancement of nearly 20 and 60 respectively in contrast to bare steel open hole plates it is indicated the cfrp will strengthen plates with holes as the stop holes can be used to slow down the fatigue crack propagation it may be attractive to study the collapse of cracked stiffened panels repaired by cfrp and stop holes this paper presents a method and a series of numerical analysis on cracked stiffened plates strengthened by open profile type cfrp the failure mode of the adhesive layer on the stiffened panel are investigated some other features as cutting holes near the crack are also studied to assess the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panels strengthened by cfrp useful suggestions for understanding the ultimate strength of cfrp repaired steel plates with a crack under compression will be provided 2 description of the repaired model a stiffened panel with a crack in the middle plate repaired by cfrp is shown in fig 1 the adhesive is used to glue the steel structure and cfrp the plate length width and thickness are denoted by a b and t respectively the web height and thickness are denoted by h w and t w the material is hot rolled structural steel ah32 with yield stress Ï y 315 mpa and young s modulus e 205 8 gpa the plate slenderness ratio is denoted by Î² b t Ï y e column slenderness is denoted by Î» a r Ï y e the radius of gyration is r i a where i and a are the section modulus and area of the stiffened plate the dimensions of the repaired model are shown in table 1 a cfrp laminate is used to repair the cracked stiffened panel connecting the steel and the cfrp with adhesive to cover the crack area some surplus cfrp is included a square cfrp is cut firstly with length l 90 mm and width w 100 mm while the crack length is 50 mm and width 2 mm as shown in fig 1 b the effect of the size of cfrp may be determined by the strength of the adhesive ultimate strength of the plate and the crack the cfrp laminate may consist of several plies with different angles between each pair of plies five plies of cfrp with the stacking sequence 0 0 0 0 0 are chosen to strengthen the cracked stiffened panel as the cracked stiffened panel under the axial compression in this paper the 0 is the direction of the compression force adhesives play an important role in the interfacial stress transfer which is the key component of the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panel because epoxy resin has good durability and excellent physical and mechanical properties it is widely applied as an adhesive in construction adhesive is used to glue the cfrp laminates to steel plates together the physical and mechanical properties of the adhesive of sikadur 330 was provided by the manufacturer sikadur 330 2014 as shown in table 2 3 numerical method for collapse of repaired stiffened plates the collapse under compression is a complicated process due to the combined action of the multiple type of materials including the isotropic orthotropic and the adhesive ones the great difference of the mechanical strength of the 3 type of materials will make the process more complex as the yielding strength of steel 315 mpa tensile strength more than 2000 mpa for cfrp and shear strength 15 mpa for the adhesive the repaired structure will deform in different manner because of the great difference in the elastic modulus it is very important to use suitable calculation models and the failure model for the adhesive 3 1 cfrp model cfrp laminates are a composite material consisting of high strength continuous carbon fibres arranged in certain rules and impregnated or pultruded with resin based on the laminate theory internal force f and moment m on the width of the laminate can be expressed as 1 f m c Îµ 0 Îº 0 a b b d Îµ 0 Îº 0 where Îµ 0 and Îº 0 are the strain and curvature of middle surface

the lower and the upper surfaces of the k th ply of the laminate shown in fig 2 the internal force in the laminated plate will cause bending deformation while the bending internal force will also cause in plane deformation as the coupling matrix b is included the tensile bending coupling effect is calculated the vector q in the stiffness matrix in eq 2 is represented as 3 q q 11 q 12 q 16 q 12

as a cohesive zone this model is applied to predict damage generation and extension along the interface area of the two adjacent layers as shown in fig 4 it is composed of upper and lower surfaces connecting two adjacent single layers the movement of these two surfaces along the thickness direction represents the opening and closing of cohesive elements the tension stress and separation displacement of the nodes on the surfaces are used in the calculation the transverse shear behaviour of cohesive element is characterized by the movement along the thickness direction three component stress are included as one normal stress Ï n and two shear stress Ï s and Ï t the elastic relationship between stress and strain while the damage does not happen can be written as 6 Ï n Ï s Ï t k n n k n s k n t k n s k s s k s t k n t k s t k t t Îµ n Îµ s Îµ t where Îµ n Îµ s and Îµ t are the normal and shear strain respectively k i j is the stiffness as the thickness of the adhesive is too small the normal deformation can be ignored and eq 6 can be simplified as 7 Ï n Ï s Ï t k n n 0 0 0 k s s 0 0 0 k t t Îµ n Îµ s Îµ t a bilinear constitutive model is used to simulate the adhesive mechanics as shown in fig 5 the stress strain relationship of the cohesive model can be divided into two steps 1 Î´ Î´ 0 linear elastic relationship between the deformation Î´ and stress Ï before appearance of the interface debonding Î´ Î´ 0 2 Î´ Î´ 0 the cohesive stiffness degrades linearly once the damage criteria is satisfied Î´ Î´ max the complete failure of the material will happen as Î´ 0 Î´ Î´ max the damage growth will begin 8 Ï n 1 d Ï n Ï n Ï n 0 Ï n 0 Ï s 1 d Ï s Ï t 1 d Ï t where Ï n Ï s Ï t represent the stress components in three directions of the interface element after failure respectively when Ï n Ï s Ï t are the stress components before failure the damage factor is d and no failure occurrs when d 0 the material will be completely failed when d 1

and Ï t 0 denote the peak values of the contact separation when the separation is either purely along the contact normal or purely in the first or the second shear direction respectively Ï n indicates the damage of the material under tension and shear expressed as 11 Ï n Ï n 0 Ï n 0 Ï n 0 the damage growth is simulated using benzeggagh kenane b k law considering the crack growth by

normal and shear separations occur at the same time g n c g s c and g t c are critical values of fracture energy required to cause failure in the normal the first and the second shear directions and Î· denotes a cohesive property parameter 3 3 validation of the numerical simulation a numerical analysis of the tests conducted by zhang et al 2017 has been performed to validate the model and method of analysis the cfrp and adhesive model are used as shown in fig 6 a plate with a centre crack is loaded axially the crack length is 15 mm the steel plate is repaired by cfrp and gfrp laminates on two sides using adhesive to connect the steel plate and the composite material the cfrp laminate is an orthotropic material with the elastic modulus e 1 142gpa e 2 10 3 gpa the shear modulus g 12 7 2gpa g 23 3 96gpa poison s ratio Î½ 12 0 27 and tensile strength 2900 mpa respectively the yield stress of the steel is 294 5 mpa there is a gfrp laminate between the steel and cfrp with elastic modulus e 1 39gpa e 2 8 6 gpa the shear modulus g 12 3 8gpa g 23 3 3gpa poison s ratio Î½ 12 0 28 one plie of gfrp with thickness 0 2 mm and four plies of cfrp with thickness 0 8 mm have been used in the test the laying sequence is 0 0 0 0 0 fig 7 shows the stress distribution of the repaired plate with a crack it can be seen that stress concentration occurs in the location of the crack and there is no obvious opening displacement in the cracks on the steel plate after concealed with cfrp while the adhesive layer experiences debonding failure in the loading process as shown in fig 7 c fig 8 shows the force displacement relation of the repaired plate the loading process is divided into three stages in the first stage the bearing capability of the model keeps rising and then the load remains unchanged as displacement increases at this stage the cfrp can withstand the load passing through the adhesive layer when the adhesive fails the carrying load of the structure starts to decrease the ultimate strength of the experimental results in the literature and the numerical results are 70 1 kn and 71 2 kn respectively this comparison revealed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental result 3 4 ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened plate with a crack 3 4 1 numerical model as described in fig 1 the numerical model of cfrp repaired stiffened panel is introduced to investigate the ultimate strength behaviour under axial compression of different configurations based on the mesh sensitivity study the refined mesh with the minimum size of 2 mm is made within the edge of the crack to properly capture the local stress concentration and the collapse state of the cracked stiffened panels shi et al 2019 fig 9 shows the fe model of the repaired cracked stiffened panels cfrp and adhesive the shell element s4r is selected to simulate the steel stiffened plate while the rigid perfectly plastic constitutive is used to perform the collapse mechanics it is suitable for ultimate strength study of the thin walled structure in ships and offshores considering the geometric and material nonlinear the nonlinear layered structural solid element c3d8r defined by 8 nodes having three degrees of freedom per node was utilized in modelling of the cfrp laminates as the linear elastic constitutive is used due to the tensile strength is much more than the steel and the mechanics is the same as the test in zhang et al 2017 the structural adhesive between the cfrp laminates and stiffened plate is also modelled using bilinear constitutive model described in eqs 8 12 the cohesive element is used to simulate the adhesive the interface between the adhesive face and steel face is connected by tie constraints where the connection of adhesive and cfrp by the same nodes 3 4 2 boundary condition in actual marine structures stiffened panels are supported by strong members such as transverse frames and the restraints at the panel boundary are somehow between simply support condition and fixed condition i e the end of stiffened panels can rotate but only to a certain extent xu and guedes soares 2012 2013 2021 the edges ab and cd are simple supported when a displacement load along x axis is applied on the edge cd the symmetry boundary condition is used for the transversal edges as ac and bd in fig 9 where the rotation rx and displacement uy are restrained 3 4 3 some results cfrp patches will strengthen significantly the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panels as shown in table 3 and fig 10 the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp is close to the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with that of stiffened panel with initial imperfections it is clear that the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel improved by cfrp strengthening although showing a small loss comparing with the strength of the intact stiffened panel with initial deformation fig 11 a b d show the failure deformation of the intact stiffened panel with initial imperfections cracked stiffened panel and repaired crack stiffened panel it demonstrates that the stress distribution is symmetric along the width direction in the intact stiffened plate but asymmetric for cracked stiffened panel due to existence of the crack the cfrp patch will correct the asymmetric stress and deformation distribution the repaired stiffened panel with a crack reaches the ultimate state while the cfrp is not debonding as shown in fig 11 c the stress of the cfrp laminate is rising up to 480 mpa meanwhile buckling deformation occurs in the stiffened panel the adhesive layer will start to debond with the progressive loading and large deformation after debonding of the cfrp the strengthening effect would be weakned the stress of the cfrp will decrease to small values illustrated in fig 11 d the debonding is also observed through the discontinuous deformation on the interface between cfrp and the stiffened panel as shown in fig 11 e 3 4 4 effect of two side patch the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel strengthened by one side and two sides are listed in table 4 it is observed that the ultimate strength of the repaired cracked stiffened panel with one side is smaller than that of two sides double sided repair shows significant superiority than single sided 3 4 5 relieve of the stress near crack the existence of a crack will result in a stress concentration near the crack during the progressive loading the stress near the crack of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp are listed in table 5 fig 12 shows the stress distribution of the cracked stiffened panel and the repaired one by cfrp under the same loading compared to models before repaired by cfrp the stress near the crack of the stiffened panel decreases significantly after cfrp repair the cfrp patch will relieve the stress near crack 3 5 debonding of the adhesive layer 3 5 1 stress in adhesive layers the adhesive interface is a key connection between the cfrp and steel the role is to provide durable adhesion transmit loads and provide barrier preventing direct contact corrosion when the stress is larger than adhesive strength the interface failure between the steel plate and the adhesive may take place resulting in the debonding at the local steel plate fig 13 shows the stress distribution of the adhesive it is indicated that the maximum shear stress occurs in the edge of the crack and cfrp the maximum von mises stress is located at the edges of the cfrp layers and the value is smaller than that of maximum shear stress so a typical debonding failure is dominated by the shear stress the displacement shear stress of the adhesive of different distance from crack is presented in fig 14 a where 0 mm is located in the crack tip and 1 5 mm 3 0 mm 4 5 mm express the longitudinal length of the locations from the crack the displacement shear stress curves can be divided into three stages elastic stage and degeneration of the stiffness after the damage of the adhesive layers and adhesive debonding the shear stress of the adhesive at the edge of the crack firstly reaches the shear strength then the adhesive locates in the distance of 45 mm reaches the shear strength it is indicated that the adhesive locates in the edge of crack and cfrp damage firstly the adhesive is debonding when the shear stress reaches zero the shear stress located at the edge of the crack reaches zero first when the distance to the crack is 1 93 mm it is demonstrated that the debonding of the adhesive layers begins at the edge of the crack the displacement normal stress of the adhesive at different distance from crack is presented in fig 14 b it is shown that the maximum normal stress occurs at the distance of 45 mm from the crack and the value did not reach the tensile compress strength 20 mpa so normal stress is not the main reason of the debonding of the adhesive 3 5 2 damage process of adhesive layer the damage process of adhesive layers of cfrp repaired cracked stiffened panel is shown in fig 15 where displacement is the applied displacement on the longitudinal of the stiffened panel it can be seen that damage does not happen in the adhesive layers when the displacement is 1 59 mm the stiffness degeneration is shown in fig 15 b where 1 0 means failure as described in eq 8 however the debonding of the adhesive does not happen until the ultimate state of the stiffened panel achieves the force 1126 kn it is feasible to use cfrp to repair cracked stiffened plates to improve ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened panels adhesive located in the edge of the crack fail firstly when the displacement is 1 93 mm and the bearing load 935 kn as illustrated in fig 15 a and b the stiffness degeneration near the crack area achieves 1 the failure elements have been deleted after that much of the adhesive interface is debonding as the displacement increase to 1 96 mm as the transmission interface fails the strengthening effect of the cfrp will be weaker as shown in fig 11 d the cfrp have no effect to the stiffened plate at the low stress level 4 influential factors a series of parametric studies were also performed to investigate the effect of some important parameters including cfrp length cfrp width number of cfrp layers and angle of cfrp layers 4 1 cfrp size the length of the bond along the axial compression direction is defined as the cfrp length the normal length as the cfrp width denoted by l and w shown in fig 1 respectively cfrp width need to cover all the crack length of 50 mm double size of 100 mm selected firstly due to effect of the double side patch the cracked stiffened panel investigated is bonded by five layers of cfrp laminates with laying sequence 0 0 0 0 0 on two sides the ultimate strength increases as the cfrp length increases fig 16 a shows the ultimate strength of the repaired cracked stiffened panel with the cfrp length from 10 to 90 mm the ultimate strength is not improved significantly when the cfrp length is 10 50 mm the cfrp length of 60 mm leads to a better repair performance as the cfrp length increases from 80 mm to 90 mm the ultimate strength increased only 0 08 in this situation 60 mm maybe the critical value for the cfrp length if exceeding the critical value the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panels is around a certain value little smaller than the value of the intact structure the cfrp width will have a small effect on the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panel as shown in fig 16 b the ultimate strength increases from 269 5 mpa to 271 2 mpa with the cfrp width increased from 60 mm to 100 mm this is mainly due to the fact that the axial compression load is along the cfrp and the interfacial shear stress generated in the direction of cfrp width is relatively small compared to the increase the of the cfrp length the cfrp width has little effect on the ultimate strength of repaired models 4 2 crack length different crack length may need different cfrp size to achieve the best strengthening improvement on the ultimate strength crack lengths of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm are included listed in table 6 the cfrp patch property is described in fig 1 table 6 shows the ultimate strength of cfrp layer strengthened cracked stiffened panels and stiffened panels without repair the smallest cfrp sizes are also listed in table 6 by a series of calculations which can strengthen the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel bringing it close to the value of the intact model the contributions of cfrp on the different crack length stiffened panel vary due to the different reductions of the ultimate strength with cracks this is mainly due to the fact that the reduced cross section area of the stiffened panels is increasing as the crack length increases the cfrp size may not increase linearly with the crack length comparing the crack length 10 mm and cfrp width 40 mm with the crack length 40 mm and cfrp size 80 mm it is complicated due to the coupling effect of the strength of the cfrp adhesive crack length and others 4 3 effect of the number of cfrp layers the number of cfrp layers may also influence the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened plate as the debonding of the adhesive happens before buckling as shown in fig 11 c the von mises stress of the cfrp patch is about 480 mpa when the stiffened plate achieves ultimate strength it is indicated that the cfrp mechanics will affect the buckling and post buckling strength of the cracked stiffened plate the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panel with different number of cfrp layer is presented in fig 17 generally the ultimate strength increases with the number of cfrp layers as the number of cfrp layer increases to more than 5 the strengthening of the number of layer on the ultimate strength becomes not obvious however the strengthened ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with a crack is close to but less than the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with initial deformation 4 4 laying sequence of the laminates the laying sequence of 0 0 0 0 0 is assumed to investigate the strengthening effect on the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened under axial compression to afford the multi direction loading different laying angle sequence may be used in the actual application the following cases are studied as 90 0 90 0 90 30 30 30 30 30 45 45 45 45 45 with double side patch of 5 layers thickness of cfrp laminate 0 2 mm this is illustrated in fig 18 table 7 summarises the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel repaired by the four laying sequence cfrps the laying sequence of 0 0 0 0 0 is the best strengthening method for the ultimate strength of structure under axial compression however different laying angles will have small influence on the ultimate strength as the maximum decrease ratio is 1 9 the small angle of 30 cfrp patch will strengthen the cracked stiffened panel better comparing with the other angles 5 repairs by stop holes and cfrp to avoid the development of the crack under tension loading some measures may be taken to reduce the stress concentration near the crack tip drilling holes at the crack tip is an effective method however the holes will reduce the cross section area of the structure it is important to investigate the effect of cfrp patch strengthening on ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel with stop holes under axial compression as shown in fig 19 the basic geometry and dimensions of models are shown in fig 19 with the crack length 15 mm in the centre of the stiffened panel the dimension of the holes at the crack tip is 5 mm the cfrp length and width are determined as 45 mm and 45 mm respectively by a series calculations the stiffened panel is bonded by double side cfrp patch with laying sequence 0 0 0 0 0 the fe models of the repaired cracked stiffened panels are shown in fig 20 due to the existence of crack and stop holes the meshing may have effect on the results a convergence analysis has been performed with 3 models with different meshing including 1 fine meshing around crack and stop holes but coarse meshing in other area shown in fig 20 2 improving meshing based on 1 shown in fig 21 a 3 fine meshing in all the model shown in fig 21 b the comparison of the results in fig 22 shows the meshing convergence the ultimate strength of the crack stiffened panel repaired crack stiffened panel by cfrp by stop holes only and repaired crack stiffened panel by stop holes and cfrp are listed in table 8 it is observed that the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel with only stop holes decreases comparing with that of cracked stiffened panel the reason is the additional damage induced by the stop holes resulting in the reduction of the ultimate strength repaired crack stiffened panel by cfrp and by stop holes and cfrp can strengthen the ultimate strength of the damaged stiffened panel effectively as shown in fig 23 there is little difference in the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel repaired with cfrp and cracked stiffened panel repaired with stop holes and cfrp fig 24 shows the stress distribution of cracked stiffened panel crack stiffened panel repaired by cfrp crack stiffened panel repaired by stop holes and crack stiffened panel repaired stop holes and cfrp the debonding failure occurred mainly in the stiffened panel interface after buckling as shown in fig 24 b and d there is an obvious change for the failure modes of the models repaired by cfrp it is indicated that drilling a hole at the crack tip decreases the effective section area but the existence of stop hole changes the section shape of the crack tip and eliminates the singularity of the stress field at the crack tip it can also relieve the stress concentration at the crack tip and improve the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel 6 cracked stiffened panels repaired by centre hole and cfrp 6 1 repaired model for small cracks it is not feasible to drill holes at the crack tips in practice instead of stop holes cutting the crack length with a centre hole is easy to achieve with the cfrp patch covering the centre hole as shown in fig 25 it can eliminate the crack and reduce the stress concentration the basic geometry and dimensions of models are shown in fig 25 which has a centre hole with a diameter of 20 mm formed by cutting a 15 mm length crack double side patch is used with cfrp length and width 60 mm 60 mm by a series of calculations the models are cracked stiffened panel bonded by cfrp with laying sequence 0 0 0 0 0 fig 26 shows the fe model of the repaired cracked stiffened panels with fine mesh 6 2 ultimate strength analysis the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and cfrp are tabulated in table 9 it is seen from tables 8 and 9 that the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with a centre hole decreases comparing with the cracked stiffened panel while the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with centre hole is larger than that of stiffened panel with stop holes the reason is that the loss of cross section of the stiffened panel with centre hole is larger than that of the cracked structure but smaller than that of the one with stop holes the existence of a centre hole replacing the crack may effectively alleviate the phenomenon of stress concentration at the crack and improves the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel as listed in table 9 it is indicated that the ultimate strength strengthening is more efficient for cracked stiffened panel with centre hole compared to stiffened panel with stop holes comparing the strengthening effects between stop hole repair and centre hole repair significant increase is observed for the ultimate strength of the centre hole and cfrp repair with the length 60 mm and the width 60 mm using central hole and cfrp repair larger cfrp is needed to achieve the same ultimate strength strengthening effect by stop holes and cfrp fig 27 shows the stress distribution of a cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and by centre hole and cfrp the buckling deformation occurs in the plate and stiffener cfrp can not continue to support the load after debonding with small stress 6 3 stress in adhesive layers fig 28 shows the stress distribution in the adhesive for centre hole and cfrp it is indicated that the maximum shear stress occurs in the edge of the centre hole and cfrp the maximum normal stress is small the typical debonding failure is dominated by the shear stress the displacement shear stress of the adhesive of different distance from crack are presented in fig 29 a where 0 mm is located in the centre of centre hole while 10 mm and 20 mm represents distance from the centre of the circle along compression loading direction respectively the shear stress of adhesive at the edge of the centre hole firstly reaches the shear strength in table 2 then the stiffness of the adhesive begins to degenerate the adhesive located in the edge of cfrp and at a distance of 10 mm to the hole centre reaches the shear strength later as the stiffness of adhesive layer degenerates successively when the applied displacement reaches 2 4 mm the shear stress of the edge of the centre hole of adhesive layer reaches to 0 mpa firstly it can be seen that adhesive initiates debonding from the edge of the centre hole then the adhesive fails in the distance 10 mm from the centre hole and edge of the cfrp the displacement normal stress of adhesive of different distances from centre hole is presented in fig 29 b it is shown that the maximum normal stress occurs at the edge of cfrp demonstrated in fig 28 b did not reach the tensile compress strength 20 mpa so normal stress is not the main reason of the debonding of the adhesive 6 4 damage process of adhesive layer the damage process and failure of adhesive layers of cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and cfrp is shown in fig 30 it can be seen that damage does not occur in the adhesive layers as the displacement is 1 61 mm adhesive did not fail and the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel is 1132 kn the adhesive is not debonding when the stiffened panel reaches the ultimate bearing capacity as shown in fig 30 b with the stiffness degeneration less than 1 so it is feasible to use centre hole and cfrp to repair cracked stiffened plates to improve ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened panels adhesive located at the edge of the centre hole have failure firstly when the displacement is 2 42 mm as shown in fig 30 c the stiffness degeneration achieves 1 and some elements have been deleted for the further calculation process adhesive interface is debonding as the displacement increase to 2 75 mm while more elements in the centre occurs failure and are deleted 7 conclusions the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panels repaired by cfrp has been analysed by modelling the adhesive and cfrp repair using stop holes with cfrp patch are also studied it has been demonstrated that cfrp repair may be feasible the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 a method is introduced to calculate the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp with the interaction of the cfrp and steel plate included using an accurate adhesive model it is validated by the experimental results 2 the analyses reveal that the debonding of the adhesive will happen after the buckling of the structure and that cfrp strengthening improves the ultimate strength through the effective loading transfer of the adhesive the adhesive is mainly induced by the shear stress as the failure happens near the crack or the edge of cfrp in the form of stiffness debonding 3 to avoid the development of the crack stop holes and centre hole measures are introduced the buckling and ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with crack treatment and cfrp are performed to study the influence of the holes and cfrp the results show that the ultimate strength will decrease with the holes but increase to almost the strength of the intact structure as the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp patch and stop holes 4 stop holes are effective in alleviating stress concentration while the cfrp reduces the stress level significantly credit authorship contribution statement xing hua shi conceptualization methodology writing original draft zhongqian hu software

20912,an analysis of the ultimate strength of a cracked stiffened panel repaired by carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp under axial compression is presented the analysis method adopts the nonlinear mechanics of adhesives in the interaction of cfrp with the steel structure the numerical model is validated by tests of cracked plates repaired by cfrp the collapse of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp revealed that the debonding of cfrp happens after buckling the cfrp repair can recover the ultimate strength of the cracked structure to the one of the intact panel a series of analysis is performed with the validated numerical model to investigate the effects of geometry configuration of cfrp and crack length on the ultimate strength crack treatment with stop holes is also studied and the results show that the repair of the cfrp can recover the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel with the occurrence of the stop holes at the same time as it may reduce the stress levels significantly keywords ultimate strength carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp cracked stiffened panels axial compression repair 1 introduction the occurrence of cracks in steel stiffened plates will reduce their ultimate strength under compression bayatfar et al 2014 shi et al 2017 2019 xu et al 2014 as the damage will induce an earlier collapse traditionally plates with cracks are replaced by new steel plates wang et al 2012 and the repair is done in dock however it will cost much if a fpso or other offshore platform would need to be out of operation welding offshore is considered to be of high risk if performed at sea thus it is desired to find an alternative repair method for the offshore oil industry which does not require welding carbon fibre reinforced polymer cfrp is a composite material consisting of high strength continuous carbon fibres arranged with certain rules and impregnated or pultruded with resin it is widely accepted as an excellent strengthening material for steel or concrete structures due to its high strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance advantages it represents a good option for the no welding repair cfrp has demonstrated to strengthen or repair effectively steel structures with defects or damages closed section profile repairs or strengthening have been shown to be an efficient method by experiments and numerical methods cfrp wrapping method is an effective technology to enhance the axial compression behaviour of a damaged circular hollow section steel column with a reduced thickness locally the steel stub failed as the local buckling happens in the weakened section while the cfrp ruptures in the fibre orientation huang et al 2017 square and rectangular hollow section steel columns with partially strengthened by cfrp under compression will buckle afterwards where buckling tends to be formed at the non strengthened part between two consecutive strengthened zones abu sena et al 2019 cfrp repair of severely corroded steel circular pipes under loading in the mid section with corrosion shows no cfrp failure elchalakani et al 2017a beams with steel channels and with their section strengthened by cfrp subjected to three point bending were studied in six sets of different configurations selvaraj and madhavan 2016 as well as the stainless steel hollow square and rectangular sections strengthened by cfrp under web crippling loading configurations islam et al 2019 it was found that the closed warp will induce different failure modes of the cfrp by comparing with the open section strengthening configuration closed repair or strengthening can restrain the debonding of the fibre layers along the longitudinal direction a k joints tubular structure with circular hollow section were strengthened by cfrp with compression loading the brace pipe the failure happened as the steel crack in the tension side and fibre breakage crush debonding and slippage in the edge due to the complicated stress state fu et al 2016 tong et al 2019 in these loading process the cfrp will be in tension to enhance the structure using the closed section repair or strengthening with the main failure of the cfrp as fiber rupture or breakage addressing now the numerical models used to analyse this type of structures simplified models have been adopted due to the dominant effect of the strength of the fibres the numerical model may be simplified using membrane elements m3d4r in abaqus irrespective of the bending stiffness in an equivalent composite model whose properties were treated as linear chen et al 2014 another simplified model is using structural solid elements solid185 to represent the cfrp contacting the steel structure with the contact element conta174 of ansys sundarraja et al 2014 the behaviour of the contact surface was chosen to be bonded while the separation between bonded surfaces was also allowed some studies were also performed to investigate the cfrp strengthening or repair effect on structures under tension loading as patches in an open profile the tensile behaviour of steel plates with a centre hole strengthened by cfrp plates under marine environment were experimentally studied by wang et al 2018 a series of tests have been performed to study the compression loading capacity of a steel plate strengthened by cfrp ardalani et al 2017 and gfrp patches in one or two sides elchalakani et al 2017b nateghi alahi and khazaei poul 2012 the open section strengthening type can affect significantly the ultimate strength the failure of the cfrp strengthened plate may be caused by a combination of several modes with the first one debonding in the interface of the steel and adhesive some other failure modes also happen in the compression loading process as the fibre ruptures in the direction perpendicular to the main direction of the composite laminate and the main direction of cfrp layers steel plate buckling a number of studies on the tensile and compressive characteristics of cfrp strengthened by composite patches have been carried out in the past in the work of soutis et al 1999 the compressive behaviour of patched cfrp laminates has been investigated liu and wang 2007 repaired a composite plate using external bonded patches the tensile behaviour of repairs was studied as a function of patch lay up and patch size it was found that the failure of the repairs is mainly caused by the debonding of patches cheng et al 2014 2011 investigated the tensile behaviour of patch repaired cfrp laminates experimentally and numerically and proposed related optimization of bonded patch repairs accordingly the failure happens as the cfrp plate buckles and the adhesive debonds compared with the closed section profile type cfrp the open one has different failure modes as the debonding in the interface happens first the dominant factor is the adhesive strength some researches are focused on the mechanics of the adhesive by tests and numerical methods akbar et al 2010 al mosawe and al mahaidi 2019 wu et al 2012 due to nonlinear and complex properties of the adhesive it is better to simulate the adhesive layer by the energy method amraei et al 2020 li et al 2019 tie et al 2018 a simplified model of the shell element s4r was used to simulate the steel tubes and the open profile cfrp with a complete bound to simulate the interaction between the steel and cfrp nabati and ghanbari ghazijahani 2020 however it is difficult to simulate the debonding failure in marine environment steel ships will always have the potential to have fatigue cracks the existence of the crack can have a significant reduction in the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened plates for fatigue crack repair in steel structures bonded cfrp approach appears as an attractive option fatigue performance of steel structures strengthened with cfrp has been widely studied deng and lee 2007 yu et al 2014 results indicated that cfrp overlays could effectively slow down of crack growth and extend fatigue life yu et al 2014 the cfrp composite patches have been used to repair cracks in a royal australian navy frigate to inhibit the recurrence of superstructure fatigue crack propagation this composite material repair have been in service for 15 years grabovac and whittaker 2009 the results indicate that the carbon patch was effective in restoring the strength and function of the damaged structure fatigue performance when the cfrp overlays were applied over the initial crack was obtained in terms of crack growth life ratios as reported in a finite element model study wang et al 2014 it is found that the cfrp will strengthen the tension and fatigue effectively however the buckling collapse will be the main failure type of the ships or platform structures under compression for the thin walled structures as stiffened panels the benefit in improving the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel under compression has not been extensively evaluated notches or holes have been applied to simulate the steel damage deng et al 2016 the fatigue behaviour of cfrp strengthened open hole steel plates was studied by experimental and finite element method wang et al 2017 typical failure modes local strain evolution and stiffness degradation behaviour of the test open hole details were reported the results show that the use of single and triple layered cfrp strengthening results in fatigue life enhancement of nearly 20 and 60 respectively in contrast to bare steel open hole plates it is indicated the cfrp will strengthen plates with holes as the stop holes can be used to slow down the fatigue crack propagation it may be attractive to study the collapse of cracked stiffened panels repaired by cfrp and stop holes this paper presents a method and a series of numerical analysis on cracked stiffened plates strengthened by open profile type cfrp the failure mode of the adhesive layer on the stiffened panel are investigated some other features as cutting holes near the crack are also studied to assess the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panels strengthened by cfrp useful suggestions for understanding the ultimate strength of cfrp repaired steel plates with a crack under compression will be provided 2 description of the repaired model a stiffened panel with a crack in the middle plate repaired by cfrp is shown in fig 1 the adhesive is used to glue the steel structure and cfrp the plate length width and thickness are denoted by a b and t respectively the web height and thickness are denoted by h w and t w the material is hot rolled structural steel ah32 with yield stress Ï y 315 mpa and young s modulus e 205 8 gpa the plate slenderness ratio is denoted by Î² b t Ï y e column slenderness is denoted by Î» a r Ï y e the radius of gyration is r i a where i and a are the section modulus and area of the stiffened plate the dimensions of the repaired model are shown in table 1 a cfrp laminate is used to repair the cracked stiffened panel connecting the steel and the cfrp with adhesive to cover the crack area some surplus cfrp is included a square cfrp is cut firstly with length l 90 mm and width w 100 mm while the crack length is 50 mm and width 2 mm as shown in fig 1 b the effect of the size of cfrp may be determined by the strength of the adhesive ultimate strength of the plate and the crack the cfrp laminate may consist of several plies with different angles between each pair of plies five plies of cfrp with the stacking sequence 0 0 0 0 0 are chosen to strengthen the cracked stiffened panel as the cracked stiffened panel under the axial compression in this paper the 0 is the direction of the compression force adhesives play an important role in the interfacial stress transfer which is the key component of the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panel because epoxy resin has good durability and excellent physical and mechanical properties it is widely applied as an adhesive in construction adhesive is used to glue the cfrp laminates to steel plates together the physical and mechanical properties of the adhesive of sikadur 330 was provided by the manufacturer sikadur 330 2014 as shown in table 2 3 numerical method for collapse of repaired stiffened plates the collapse under compression is a complicated process due to the combined action of the multiple type of materials including the isotropic orthotropic and the adhesive ones the great difference of the mechanical strength of the 3 type of materials will make the process more complex as the yielding strength of steel 315 mpa tensile strength more than 2000 mpa for cfrp and shear strength 15 mpa for the adhesive the repaired structure will deform in different manner because of the great difference in the elastic modulus it is very important to use suitable calculation models and the failure model for the adhesive 3 1 cfrp model cfrp laminates are a composite material consisting of high strength continuous carbon fibres arranged in certain rules and impregnated or pultruded with resin based on the laminate theory internal force f and moment m on the width of the laminate can be expressed as 1 f m c Îµ 0 Îº 0 a b b d Îµ 0 Îº 0 where Îµ 0 and Îº 0 are the strain and curvature of middle surface

the lower and the upper surfaces of the k th ply of the laminate shown in fig 2 the internal force in the laminated plate will cause bending deformation while the bending internal force will also cause in plane deformation as the coupling matrix b is included the tensile bending coupling effect is calculated the vector q in the stiffness matrix in eq 2 is represented as 3 q q 11 q 12 q 16 q 12

as a cohesive zone this model is applied to predict damage generation and extension along the interface area of the two adjacent layers as shown in fig 4 it is composed of upper and lower surfaces connecting two adjacent single layers the movement of these two surfaces along the thickness direction represents the opening and closing of cohesive elements the tension stress and separation displacement of the nodes on the surfaces are used in the calculation the transverse shear behaviour of cohesive element is characterized by the movement along the thickness direction three component stress are included as one normal stress Ï n and two shear stress Ï s and Ï t the elastic relationship between stress and strain while the damage does not happen can be written as 6 Ï n Ï s Ï t k n n k n s k n t k n s k s s k s t k n t k s t k t t Îµ n Îµ s Îµ t where Îµ n Îµ s and Îµ t are the normal and shear strain respectively k i j is the stiffness as the thickness of the adhesive is too small the normal deformation can be ignored and eq 6 can be simplified as 7 Ï n Ï s Ï t k n n 0 0 0 k s s 0 0 0 k t t Îµ n Îµ s Îµ t a bilinear constitutive model is used to simulate the adhesive mechanics as shown in fig 5 the stress strain relationship of the cohesive model can be divided into two steps 1 Î´ Î´ 0 linear elastic relationship between the deformation Î´ and stress Ï

normal and shear separations occur at the same time g n c g s c and g t c are critical values of fracture energy required to cause failure in the normal the first and the second shear directions and Î· denotes a cohesive property parameter 3 3 validation of the numerical simulation a numerical analysis of the tests conducted by zhang et al 2017 has been performed to validate the model and method of analysis the cfrp and adhesive model are used as shown in fig 6 a plate with a centre crack is loaded axially the crack length is 15 mm the steel plate is repaired by cfrp and gfrp laminates on two sides using adhesive to connect the steel plate and the composite material the cfrp laminate is an orthotropic material with the elastic modulus e 1 142gpa e 2 10 3 gpa the shear modulus g 12 7 2gpa g 23 3 96gpa poison s ratio Î½ 12 0 27 and tensile strength 2900 mpa respectively the yield stress of the steel is 294 5 mpa there is a gfrp laminate between the steel and cfrp with elastic modulus e 1 39gpa e 2 8 6 gpa the shear modulus g 12 3 8gpa g 23 3 3gpa poison s ratio Î½ 12 0 28 one plie of gfrp with thickness 0 2 mm and four plies of cfrp with thickness 0 8 mm have been used in the test the laying sequence is 0 0 0 0 0 fig 7 shows the stress distribution of the repaired plate with a crack it can be seen that stress concentration occurs in the location of the crack and there is no obvious opening displacement in the cracks on the steel plate after concealed with cfrp while the adhesive layer experiences debonding failure in the loading process as shown in fig 7 c fig 8 shows the force displacement relation of the repaired plate the loading process is divided into three stages in the first stage the bearing capability of the model keeps rising and then the load remains unchanged as displacement increases at this stage the cfrp can withstand the load passing through the adhesive layer when the adhesive fails the carrying load of the structure starts to decrease the ultimate strength of the experimental results in the literature and the numerical results are 70 1 kn and 71 2 kn respectively this comparison revealed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental result 3 4 ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened plate with a crack 3 4 1 numerical model as described in fig 1 the numerical model of cfrp repaired stiffened panel is introduced to investigate the ultimate strength behaviour under axial compression of different configurations based on the mesh sensitivity study the refined mesh with the minimum size of 2 mm is made within the edge of the crack to properly capture the local stress concentration and the collapse state of the cracked stiffened panels shi et al 2019 fig 9 shows the fe model of the repaired cracked stiffened panels cfrp and adhesive the shell element s4r is selected to simulate the steel stiffened plate while the rigid perfectly plastic constitutive is used to perform the collapse mechanics it is suitable for ultimate strength study of the thin walled structure in ships and offshores considering the geometric and material nonlinear the nonlinear layered structural solid element c3d8r defined by 8 nodes having three degrees of freedom per node was utilized in modelling of the cfrp laminates as the linear elastic constitutive is used due to the tensile strength is much more than the steel and the mechanics is the same as the test in zhang et al 2017 the structural adhesive between the cfrp laminates and stiffened plate is also modelled using bilinear constitutive model described in eqs 8 12 the cohesive element is used to simulate the adhesive the interface between the adhesive face and steel face is connected by tie constraints where the connection of adhesive and cfrp by the same nodes 3 4 2 boundary condition in actual marine structures stiffened panels are supported by strong members such as transverse frames and the restraints at the panel boundary are somehow between simply support condition and fixed condition i e the end of stiffened panels can rotate but only to a certain extent xu and guedes soares 2012 2013 2021 the edges ab and cd are simple supported when a displacement load along x axis is applied on the edge cd the symmetry boundary condition is used for the transversal edges as ac and bd in fig 9 where the rotation rx and displacement uy are restrained 3 4 3 some results cfrp patches will strengthen significantly the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panels as shown in table 3 and fig 10 the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp is close to the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with that of stiffened panel with initial imperfections it is clear that the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel improved by cfrp strengthening although showing a small loss comparing with the strength of the intact stiffened panel with initial deformation fig 11 a b d show the failure deformation of the intact stiffened panel with initial imperfections cracked stiffened panel and repaired crack stiffened panel it demonstrates that the stress distribution is symmetric along the width direction in the intact stiffened plate but asymmetric for cracked stiffened panel due to existence of the crack the cfrp patch will correct the asymmetric stress and deformation distribution the repaired stiffened panel with a crack reaches the ultimate state while the cfrp is not debonding as shown in fig 11 c the stress of the cfrp laminate is rising up to 480 mpa meanwhile buckling deformation occurs in the stiffened panel the adhesive layer will start to debond with the progressive loading and large deformation after debonding of the cfrp the strengthening effect would be weakned the stress of the cfrp will decrease to small values illustrated in fig 11 d the debonding is also observed through the discontinuous deformation on the interface between cfrp and the stiffened panel as shown in fig 11 e 3 4 4 effect of two side patch the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel strengthened by one side and two sides are listed in table 4 it is observed that the ultimate strength of the repaired cracked stiffened panel with one side is smaller than that of two sides double sided repair shows significant superiority than single sided 3 4 5 relieve of the stress near crack the existence of a crack will result in a stress concentration near the crack during the progressive loading the stress near the crack of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp are listed in table 5 fig 12 shows the stress distribution of the cracked stiffened panel and the repaired one by cfrp under the same loading compared to models before repaired by cfrp the stress near the crack of the stiffened panel decreases significantly after cfrp repair the cfrp patch will relieve the stress near crack 3 5 debonding of the adhesive layer 3 5 1 stress in adhesive layers the adhesive interface is a key connection between the cfrp and steel the role is to provide durable adhesion transmit loads and provide barrier preventing direct contact corrosion when the stress is larger than adhesive strength the interface failure between the steel plate and the adhesive may take place resulting in the debonding at the local steel plate fig 13 shows the stress distribution of the adhesive it is indicated that the maximum shear stress occurs in the edge of the crack and cfrp the maximum von mises stress is located at the edges of the cfrp layers and the value is smaller than that of maximum shear stress so a typical debonding failure is dominated by the shear stress the displacement shear stress of the adhesive of different distance from crack is presented in fig 14 a where 0 mm is located in the crack tip and 1 5 mm 3 0 mm 4 5 mm express the longitudinal length of the locations from the crack the displacement shear stress curves can be divided into three stages elastic stage and degeneration of the stiffness after the damage of the adhesive layers and adhesive debonding the shear stress of the adhesive at the edge of the crack firstly reaches the shear strength then the adhesive locates in the distance of 45 mm reaches the shear strength it is indicated that the adhesive locates in the edge of crack and cfrp damage firstly the adhesive is debonding when the shear stress reaches zero the shear stress located at the edge of the crack reaches zero first when the distance to the crack is 1 93 mm it is demonstrated that the debonding of the adhesive layers begins at the edge of the crack the displacement normal stress of the adhesive at different distance from crack is presented in fig 14 b it is shown that the maximum normal stress occurs at the distance of 45 mm from the crack and the value did not reach the tensile compress strength 20 mpa so normal stress is not the main reason of the debonding of the adhesive 3 5 2 damage process of adhesive layer the damage process of adhesive layers of cfrp repaired cracked stiffened panel is shown in fig 15 where displacement is the applied displacement on the longitudinal of the stiffened panel it can be seen that damage does not happen in the adhesive layers when the displacement is 1 59 mm the stiffness degeneration is shown in fig 15 b where 1 0 means failure as described in eq 8 however the debonding of the adhesive does not happen until the ultimate state of the stiffened panel achieves the force 1126 kn it is feasible to use cfrp to repair cracked stiffened plates to improve ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened panels adhesive located in the edge of the crack fail firstly when the displacement is 1 93 mm and the bearing load 935 kn as illustrated in fig 15 a and b the stiffness degeneration near the crack area achieves 1 the failure elements have been deleted after that much of the adhesive interface is debonding as the displacement increase to 1 96 mm as the transmission interface fails the strengthening effect of the cfrp will be weaker as shown in fig 11 d the cfrp have no effect to the stiffened plate at the low stress level 4 influential factors a series of parametric studies were also performed to investigate the effect of some important parameters including cfrp length cfrp width number of cfrp layers and angle of cfrp layers 4 1 cfrp size the length of the bond along the axial compression direction is defined as the cfrp length the normal length as the cfrp width denoted by l and w shown in fig 1 respectively cfrp width need to cover all the crack length of 50 mm double size of 100 mm selected firstly due to effect of the double side patch the cracked stiffened panel investigated is bonded by five layers of cfrp laminates with laying sequence 0 0 0 0 0 on two sides the ultimate strength increases as the cfrp length increases fig 16 a shows the ultimate strength of the repaired cracked stiffened panel with the cfrp length from 10 to 90 mm the ultimate strength is not improved significantly when the cfrp length is 10 50 mm the cfrp length of 60 mm leads to a better repair performance as the cfrp length increases from 80 mm to 90 mm the ultimate strength increased only 0 08 in this situation 60 mm maybe the critical value for the cfrp length if exceeding the critical value the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panels is around a certain value little smaller than the value of the intact structure the cfrp width will have a small effect on the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panel as shown in fig 16 b the ultimate strength increases from 269 5 mpa to 271 2 mpa with the cfrp width increased from 60 mm to 100 mm this is mainly due to the fact that the axial compression load is along the cfrp and the interfacial shear stress generated in the direction of cfrp width is relatively small compared to the increase the of the cfrp length the cfrp width has little effect on the ultimate strength of repaired models 4 2 crack length different crack length may need different cfrp size to achieve the best strengthening improvement on the ultimate strength crack lengths of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm are included listed in table 6 the cfrp patch property is described in fig 1 table 6 shows the ultimate strength of cfrp layer strengthened cracked stiffened panels and stiffened panels without repair the smallest cfrp sizes are also listed in table 6 by a series of calculations which can strengthen the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel bringing it close to the value of the intact model the contributions of cfrp on the different crack length stiffened panel vary due to the different reductions of the ultimate strength with cracks this is mainly due to the fact that the reduced cross section area of the stiffened panels is increasing as the crack length increases the cfrp size may not increase linearly with the crack length comparing the crack length 10 mm and cfrp width 40 mm with the crack length 40 mm and cfrp size 80 mm it is complicated due to the coupling effect of the strength of the cfrp adhesive crack length and others 4 3 effect of the number of cfrp layers the number of cfrp layers may also influence the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened plate as the debonding of the adhesive happens before buckling as shown in fig 11 c the von mises stress of the cfrp patch is about 480 mpa when the stiffened plate achieves ultimate strength it is indicated that the cfrp mechanics will affect the buckling and post buckling strength of the cracked stiffened plate the ultimate strength of the repaired stiffened panel with different number of cfrp layer is presented in fig 17 generally the ultimate strength increases with the number of cfrp layers as the number of cfrp layer increases to more than 5 the strengthening of the number of layer on the ultimate strength becomes not obvious however the strengthened ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with a crack is close to but less than the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with initial deformation 4 4 laying sequence of the laminates the laying sequence of 0 0 0 0 0 is assumed to investigate the strengthening effect on the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened under axial compression to afford the multi direction loading different laying angle sequence may be used in the actual application the following cases are studied as 90 0 90 0 90 30 30 30 30 30 45 45 45 45 45 with double side patch of 5 layers thickness of cfrp laminate 0 2 mm this is illustrated in fig 18 table 7 summarises the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel repaired by the four laying sequence cfrps the laying sequence of 0 0 0 0 0 is the best strengthening method for the ultimate strength of structure under axial compression however different laying angles will have small influence on the ultimate strength as the maximum decrease ratio is 1 9 the small angle of 30 cfrp patch will strengthen the cracked stiffened panel better comparing with the other angles 5 repairs by stop holes and cfrp to avoid the development of the crack under tension loading some measures may be taken to reduce the stress concentration near the crack tip drilling holes at the crack tip is an effective method however the holes will reduce the cross section area of the structure it is important to investigate the effect of cfrp patch strengthening on ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel with stop holes under axial compression as shown in fig 19 the basic geometry and dimensions of models are shown in fig 19 with the crack length 15 mm in the centre of the stiffened panel the dimension of the holes at the crack tip is 5 mm the cfrp length and width are determined as 45 mm and 45 mm respectively by a series calculations the stiffened panel is bonded by double side cfrp patch with laying sequence 0 0 0 0 0 the fe models of the repaired cracked stiffened panels are shown in fig 20 due to the existence of crack and stop holes the meshing may have effect on the results a convergence analysis has been performed with 3 models with different meshing including 1 fine meshing around crack and stop holes but coarse meshing in other area shown in fig 20 2 improving meshing based on 1 shown in fig 21 a 3 fine meshing in all the model shown in fig 21 b the comparison of the results in fig 22 shows the meshing convergence the ultimate strength of the crack stiffened panel repaired crack stiffened panel by cfrp by stop holes only and repaired crack stiffened panel by stop holes and cfrp are listed in table 8 it is observed that the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel with only stop holes decreases comparing with that of cracked stiffened panel the reason is the additional damage induced by the stop holes resulting in the reduction of the ultimate strength repaired crack stiffened panel by cfrp and by stop holes and cfrp can strengthen the ultimate strength of the damaged stiffened panel effectively as shown in fig 23 there is little difference in the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel repaired with cfrp and cracked stiffened panel repaired with stop holes and cfrp fig 24 shows the stress distribution of cracked stiffened panel crack stiffened panel repaired by cfrp crack stiffened panel repaired by stop holes and crack stiffened panel repaired stop holes and cfrp the debonding failure occurred mainly in the stiffened panel interface after buckling as shown in fig 24 b and d there is an obvious change for the failure modes of the models repaired by cfrp it is indicated that drilling a hole at the crack tip decreases the effective section area but the existence of stop hole changes the section shape of the crack tip and eliminates the singularity of the stress field at the crack tip it can also relieve the stress concentration at the crack tip and improve the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel 6 cracked stiffened panels repaired by centre hole and cfrp 6 1 repaired model for small cracks it is not feasible to drill holes at the crack tips in practice instead of stop holes cutting the crack length with a centre hole is easy to achieve with the cfrp patch covering the centre hole as shown in fig 25 it can eliminate the crack and reduce the stress concentration the basic geometry and dimensions of models are shown in fig 25 which has a centre hole with a diameter of 20 mm formed by cutting a 15 mm length crack double side patch is used with cfrp length and width 60 mm 60 mm by a series of calculations the models are cracked stiffened panel bonded by cfrp with laying sequence 0 0 0 0 0 fig 26 shows the fe model of the repaired cracked stiffened panels with fine mesh 6 2 ultimate strength analysis the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and cfrp are tabulated in table 9 it is seen from tables 8 and 9 that the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with a centre hole decreases comparing with the cracked stiffened panel while the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with centre hole is larger than that of stiffened panel with stop holes the reason is that the loss of cross section of the stiffened panel with centre hole is larger than that of the cracked structure but smaller than that of the one with stop holes the existence of a centre hole replacing the crack may effectively alleviate the phenomenon of stress concentration at the crack and improves the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel as listed in table 9 it is indicated that the ultimate strength strengthening is more efficient for cracked stiffened panel with centre hole compared to stiffened panel with stop holes comparing the strengthening effects between stop hole repair and centre hole repair significant increase is observed for the ultimate strength of the centre hole and cfrp repair with the length 60 mm and the width 60 mm using central hole and cfrp repair larger cfrp is needed to achieve the same ultimate strength strengthening effect by stop holes and cfrp fig 27 shows the stress distribution of a cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and by centre hole and cfrp the buckling deformation occurs in the plate and stiffener cfrp can not continue to support the load after debonding with small stress 6 3 stress in adhesive layers fig 28 shows the stress distribution in the adhesive for centre hole and cfrp it is indicated that the maximum shear stress occurs in the edge of the centre hole and cfrp the maximum normal stress is small the typical debonding failure is dominated by the shear stress the displacement shear stress of the adhesive of different distance from crack are presented in fig 29 a where 0 mm is located in the centre of centre hole while 10 mm and 20 mm represents distance from the centre of the circle along compression loading direction respectively the shear stress of adhesive at the edge of the centre hole firstly reaches the shear strength in table 2 then the stiffness of the adhesive begins to degenerate the adhesive located in the edge of cfrp and at a distance of 10 mm to the hole centre reaches the shear strength later as the stiffness of adhesive layer degenerates successively when the applied displacement reaches 2 4 mm the shear stress of the edge of the centre hole of adhesive layer reaches to 0 mpa firstly it can be seen that adhesive initiates debonding from the edge of the centre hole then the adhesive fails in the distance 10 mm from the centre hole and edge of the cfrp the displacement normal stress of adhesive of different distances from centre hole is presented in fig 29 b it is shown that the maximum normal stress occurs at the edge of cfrp demonstrated in fig 28 b did not reach the tensile compress strength 20 mpa so normal stress is not the main reason of the debonding of the adhesive 6 4 damage process of adhesive layer the damage process and failure of adhesive layers of cracked stiffened panel repaired by centre hole and cfrp is shown in fig 30 it can be seen that damage does not occur in the adhesive layers as the displacement is 1 61 mm adhesive did not fail and the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel is 1132 kn the adhesive is not debonding when the stiffened panel reaches the ultimate bearing capacity as shown in fig 30 b with the stiffness degeneration less than 1 so it is feasible to use centre hole and cfrp to repair cracked stiffened plates to improve ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened panels adhesive located at the edge of the centre hole have failure firstly when the displacement is 2 42 mm as shown in fig 30 c the stiffness degeneration achieves 1 and some elements have been deleted for the further calculation process adhesive interface is debonding as the displacement increase to 2 75 mm while more elements in the centre occurs failure and are deleted 7 conclusions the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panels repaired by cfrp has been analysed by modelling the adhesive and cfrp repair using stop holes with cfrp patch are also studied it has been demonstrated that cfrp repair may be feasible the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 a method is introduced to calculate the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp with the interaction of the cfrp and steel plate included using an accurate adhesive model it is validated by the experimental results 2 the analyses reveal that the debonding of the adhesive will happen after the buckling of the structure and that cfrp strengthening improves the ultimate strength through the effective loading transfer of the adhesive the adhesive is mainly induced by the shear stress as the failure happens near the crack or the edge of cfrp in the form of stiffness debonding 3 to avoid the development of the crack stop holes and centre hole measures are introduced the buckling and ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with crack treatment and cfrp are performed to study the influence of the holes and cfrp the results show that the ultimate strength will decrease with the holes but increase to almost the strength of the intact structure as the cracked stiffened panel repaired by cfrp patch and stop holes 4 stop holes are effective in alleviating stress concentration while the cfrp reduces the stress level significantly credit authorship contribution statement xing hua shi conceptualization methodology writing original draft zhongqian hu software

20913,this paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation into the role of infragravity motions in reef hydrodynamics over different reef systems laboratory experiments are performed with reef profiles of a platform reef and a fringing reef under irregular wave conditions the propagation and the distribution of the infragravity wave are different over these two reef systems analysis of the measured time histories of water surface elevation shows that shorter sea swell ss waves longer infragravity ig wave and mean water level on the reef flat are significantly larger in the fringing reef system the ig wave height is much larger on the fringing reef than that on the platform reef this marked increase of the ig wave is considered to be due to 1 the superposition of incoming ig wave and reflected ig wave from shoreline 2 more violent wave breaking in the surf zone that may enhance the transfer of wave energy from the frequency band of the shorter wave to ig wave in this experiment the wave breaking mechanism controls the relationship between ig wave height and water depth keywords infragravity wave fringing reef platform reef shoreline wave set up 1 introduction million people worldwide live in coastal areas near coral reefs many of which form natural barriers protecting shorelines against waves storms and floods reef lined coasts however are becoming increasingly vulnerable to wave driven flooding as a result of climate change and the reef degradation caused by coastal developments for residents and the growing tourism industry it is essential to understand the dynamic processes of the reef system either in the natural or built states hydrodynamic interaction of waves with coral reefs is complex and has been studied over decades the wave energy propagation on reefs can be very different from normal coastal beaches primarily because of the complex coastal configurations at various scales and the roughness of the substrate a typical platform reef is often idealized to consist of a seaward sloping reef face and a shallow reef flat for the fringing reef the inshore reef flat extends toward the shoreline the reef flat in shallow water is commonly exposed at low tide cabioch et al 2010 wave breaking induced by the shallow water significantly reduces most of the sea swell wave energy f 0 04 hz gourlay 1994 and the rough surface of the reef also causes a further dissipation of wave energy lowe et al 2005 buckley et al 2016 baldock et al 2020 in field observations coral reefs can provide defense against huge wave attack by reducing overall wave energy up to an average of 97 ferrario et al 2014 however infragravity wave 0 004 0 04 hz and wave set up are found to be enhanced on the reef flat relative to mild coastlines becker et al 2014 2016 bukley et al 2018 as a consequence infragravity wave ig wave is seen to play a significant role on the reef flat and in the lagoon pÃ©quignet et al 2009 pomeroy et al 2012b van dongeren et al 2013 with ig wave becoming a dominant component to the wave run up on the reef fringed shoreline buckley et al 2018 wave set up which is the rise of the mean water level induced by the depth limited wave breaking has been widely studied by field observations on coral line coasts munk and sargent 1948 vetter et al 2010 becker et al 2014 laboratory experiments gerritsen 1980 gourlay 1996a yao et al 2018 and theoretical analysis tait 1972 gourlay 1996b yao et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 the wave set up on natural reefs is influenced by the incident wave height water depth on the reef flat and the roughness of the reef franklin 2013 buckley et al 2016 wave set up on the reef flat increases with the increase of the incident wave height and the decrease of the water depth on the reef flat gourlay 1996a becker et al 2014 the roughness of the reef has two opposite effects on the wave set up the frictional dissipation of wave energy seaward of the breakpoint results in a decrease of the wave set up the onshore directed bottom stress induced by the offshore directed near bottom velocity may lead to the increase of the wave set up franklin et al 2013 bukley et al 2016 ig wave recognized as the low frequency 0 004 0 04 hz set up down oscillation is generated by two widely accepted mechanisms the first mechanism is the release of the bound ig waves the radiation stress gradient generates the bound ig wave in the incident wave groups longuet higgins and stewart 1962 when the water depth decreases and waves break the bound ig waves are released and propagate as free waves in the other mechanism the ig waves are generated as dynamic set up down oscillations as a result of the spatially fluctuating breakpoints of different sized wave groups symonds et al 1982 along with the generation of the ig waves the groupiness of the incident wave decreases due to the wave breaking liu and li 2018 poate et al 2020 bound wave release is considered to be a more important source of ig wave on the gentle slope list 1992 janssen et al 2003 while for the steep slope the time varying breakpoint mechanism is considered to be the dominant mechanism for the generation of the ig wave battjes et al 2004 baldock et al 2012 many reefs have very steep slopes with some reef faces even being close to vertical gourlay 1996b therefore in many field observations pomeroy et al 2012a becker et al 2016 and experiments buckley et al 2018 ig waves on the reef flat are linked to the time variation of the wave breakpoint in the surf zone the wave breakpoint mechanism is also found working against the incident bound ig wave pequignet el al 2014 although the ig wave on the reef flat is also damped by the roughness of the reef the bottom friction has a much greater effect on the short waves than the ig waves pomeroy et al 2012a the ig wave has a bore like wave shape gawehn et al 2016 due to the high propagation speed the huge inertial forces at the front of the ig wave can cause extensive damage to coastal structures for example in the okinawa islands of southern japan seawall roads and houses sheltered by reef were found damaged by bore like floods with 10 min intervals nakaza et al 1991 during typhoon haiyan in 2013 video footage captured serious destruction to a philippine town by fast moving bore roeber and bricker 2015 when the frequencies of the ig wave are close to the natural frequencies of the water body on the reef flat resonant amplification is possible and the coastal flooding potential increases cheriton et al 2016 gawehn et al 2016 the ig wave can also lead to moored ship motions van dongeren et al 2016 and large resonance gao et al 2019 for the reef fringed harbors besides the wave breaking the infragravity wave is also influenced by the reef fringed shoreline on the platform reef wave and current can escape to the sea through the end of the reef flat or lagoon however on the fringing reef infragravity wave will be reflected by the shoreline and then propagate to the open sea or trapped on the reef flat in order to assess the influence of the shoreline comparison on the reef hydrodynamics between fringing reef and platform reef is needed based on which an engineering solution that meets specific engineering ecological criteria may be developed to ameliorate the coastal erosion and flooding this paper presents a two dimensional laboratory experiment to investigate the hydrodynamic processes on an idealized reef under irregular wave conditions two different reef profiles are considered a platform reef and a fringing reef the generation and propagation of the ig wave on the reef flat are analyzed based on measurements of water surface elevation and flow velocity at 15 locations along the wave flume and the changes in the wave conditions on the reef flat caused by the shoreline are discussed the paper is organized as below the experiment setup is introduced in section 2 the wave propagation and the generation of the ig wave are presented in section 3 the influences of reef fringed shoreline are discussed in sections 4 and 5 followed by conclusions in section 6 2 experiment setup laboratory experiments were carried out in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian the flume is 60 m long 4 m wide and 2 5 m depth zhu et al 2018 detailed the set of wave flume and the scaled physical models of the reef in regular wave tests here these physical models were further used under the irregular wave conditions the reef model consisted of a steep reef face with a slope of 1 1 and a horizontal reef flat of 8 6 m long the reef face and reef flat were built by smooth sand cement grout a relatively smooth and impervious surface the process of wave run up on the shoreline is not taken into account therefore the reef fringed shoreline is adopted as a vertical structure which is 7 2 m away from the reef edge without the shoreline the reef model is corresponding to a platform reef fig 1 shows the sketch of reef profile and measuring instrument arrangement fifteen capacitance wave gauges twg 600 and four high resolution acoustic velocity meters vectrino were installed to measure the wave surface elevation and velocity locations of wave gauges g1 g15 and velocity meters v1 v4 are shown in fig 1 the measuring accuracy of the wave gauge is 0 1 mm the measuring accuracy of the velocity meter is 0 5 of the measured value the sampling rate of 50 hz was used for all wave gauges and velocity meters incident irregular waves were generated using the jonwsap spectrum the model test scale is taken as 1 25 the submergence water depths on the reef flat h r and incident wave conditions tested in the experiments are listed in table 1 in total 24 different wave conditions were tested in the experiment each test was repeated at least 3 times 3 generation and propagation of ig wave the frequency of infragravity wave is commonly taken as from 0 004hz to 0 04hz in the experiment the model test scale is 1 25 so the corresponding frequency range of ig wave is 0 02 0 2 hz the wave surface elevation measured by the wave gauge is Î· the average wave set up Î· the rise of water level averaged on the whole acquisition time the ig component Î· ig and ss component Î· ss were filtered based on their frequency ranges the wave envelope Î· env of the incident wave group was calculated based on the hilbert transform janssen et al 2003 1 Î· env Î· ss i Î³ Î· ss where Î³ denotes the hilbert transform

the reef edge g7 the maximum of the ig wave height may occur at the reef edge as shown in fig 6 d and e then the ig wave height decreases rapidly at g8 and increases gradually along the reef flat for the platform reef the wave propagation over the reef edge under different water depths is shown in fig 7 when the water depth is small the wave overtopping on the reef edge generates an obvious increase of the water level it leads to the large wave set up and ig wave at g7 as shown in fig 7 a c the high water level at reef edge accelerates the flow propagating landwards and the water level decreases quickly around g8 for the platform reef the time series of wave surface elevation Î· and ig wave component Î· ig at g7 and g8 are shown in fig 8 the time series also show a decrease of water level from g7 to g8 therefore the wave set up and ig wave have a rapid decrease around the reef edge in our experiment the outer reef flat g8 g13 is the surf zone the wave breaking in the surf zone brings the increase of wave set up and ig wave height g8 g13 then the wave set up and ig wave height tend to be stable g13 g15 when the water depth increases there is no obvious wave overtopping over the reef edge as shown in fig 7 d f therefore the wave set up and ig wave height increase along the reef flat due to the wave breaking for the fringing reef the reef flat is blocked by the shoreline wave overtopping over the reef edge can not generate flow propagating shoreward therefore the rapid decreases of wave set up and ig wave height cease to occur at the reef edge the suppression of the wave induced flow leads to a further rise of the mean water level as shown in fig 6 a c the scatters in fig 6 d f are the separated incoming and outgoing ig wave heights the vertical shoreline in this experiment leads to a complete reflection of the incoming ig wave the ig wave is larger than that for the platform reef for example as shown in fig 6 d f the relative ig wave height h ig h in is about 0 2 on the platform reef for the fringing reef the relative ig wave height h ig h in in front of the shoreline is about 0 6 increases by a factor of 3 the scatters in fig 6 d f are the separated ig wave heights of the incoming and outgoing ig waves it can be seen that the vertical shoreline in this experiment leads to a complete reflection of the incoming ig wave as shown in fig 6 g i the ss wave height decreases rapidly in the surf zone outside the surf zone the ss wave height is almost constant as a result of the smooth reef surface in the experiment for the fringing reef the submergence depth Î· r h r increases which leads to a small increase of the ss wave height 5 wave heights in front of the shoreline the wave heights in front of the shoreline are shown in fig 9 the horizontal axis is the non dimensional submergence depth on the reef flat Î· r h r h in where Î· r is the wave set up at g15 fig 9 a shows the relative ss wave height h ss h in in front of the shoreline g15 it can be seen that the ss wave height is proportional to the water depth as a result of the ss wave heights being limited by the submergence depth on the reef flat for the platform reef the ratio Î³ of the ss wave height h ss and submergence depth Î· r h r in the inner surf zone ranges from 0 50 to 0 67 for the fringing reef the wave reflection and slamming on the vertical shoreline generate larger Î³ ranged from 0 56 to 0 75 fig 9 b shows the relative ig wave height h ig h in in front of the shoreline at g15 for the fringing reef the ig wave height has significant increase by a factor of 2 3 therefore the ig wave heights in front of the shoreline remain quite high as the relative ig wave height is from 0 49 to 0 68 under different wave conditions the obvious reason for the significant increase of the ig wave height is the perfect wave reflection from the shoreline with a gentle shoreline the ig wave height will decrease due to the decrease of the wave reflection for the fringing reef the wave heights of the separated incoming ig wave at g15 are shown in fig 9 b it can be seen that the incoming ig wave heights are also larger than the ig wave heights for the platform reef fig 9 c shows the relative ig wave heights h ig h in at g6 the ig waves at g6 are considered as the outgoing ig waves generated in the surf zone path 2 in fig 5 for the fringing reef the outgoing ig wave heights at g6 also increase as shown in fig 9 c these phenomena indicate that with the shoreline the wave breaking in the surf zone may generate larger outgoing path 2 and incoming path 1 ig waves fig 10 shows the photos of the wave breaking around the reef edge at the same moment for the platform reef and fringing reef it can be seen that with the shoreline the wave generated flow can t flow out of the reef flat and the high water level on the reef flat generates strong backflow zhu et al 2018 which in turn induces a more violent wave breaking as a consequence for the fringing reef the outgoing path 2 and incoming path 1 ig waves generated in the surf zone may increase the ratio of the ig wave height and ss wave height h ig h ss at g15 are shown in fig 9 d when submergence depth decreases ig wave plays a more important role on the reef flat for the fringing reef the values of h ig h ss are more than 1 in general which indicates ig wave dominance under all submergence depth in the case of the real reef the bottom friction has a much greater effect on damping the short waves compared to the ig waves pomeroy et al 2012a and the ss wave in front of the shoreline may become even smaller for the fringing reef comparisons of ig wave height between our experiment and previous studies are shown in table a1 due to the steep reef face the vertical shoreline and smooth surface our experiment have the largest relative ig wave heights 0 49 0 68 the field observations have smaller ig wave height on the reef flat than the laboratory experiments with smooth surface in field observations pomeroy et al 2012a gawehn et al 2016 the ig wave was found to increase notably with the increase of the submergence depth they attribute this to the bottom friction or reef resonance when the water depth increases the wave energy dissipation induced by the bottom friction decreases pomeroy et al 2012a larger water depth on the reef flat also increases the probability of resonance gawehn et al 2016 when water depth increases the resonance and the decrease of the wave energy dissipation lead to a large ig wave heights on the reef flat however when the bottom friction is small this proportional relationship will disappear for example in beetham et al s 2015 field observation the ig wave height is minimally affected by the water depth nwogu and demirbilek s 2010 and yao et al s 2020 laboratory experiment results are reanalyzed in dimensionless forms as shown in fig 11 different from field observations the ig wave height decreases with the increase of the submergence depth in our experiment and yao et al s 2020 experiment the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism decreasing as the water depth over the reef increases which results in a decrease generation of ig wave in the surf zone when the bottom friction is small enough to be neglected the wave breaking mechanism will control an opposite relationship between ig wave height and water depth noticeably nwogu and demirbilek s 2010 experiments show a different trend due to the obvious reef resonance at large water depth therefore when water depth increases the ig wave height is influenced by these three factors which act counter to each other however the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism seems to be a less important factor than bottom friction and resonance 6 conclusions in order to investigate the hydrodynamic processes on an idealized reef under irregular wave conditions a two dimensional experiment is carried out strong ig waves are generated on the reef flat by the time varying breakpoint mechanism the ig wave height on the reef flat is proportional to the standard deviations Ïenv of the incident wave envelope Î·env the larger significant period ts of the incident wave leads to a larger ig wave height on the reef flat different with the field observations the ig wave height is found to decrease slightly with the increase of the submergence depth the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism decreasing as the water depth over the reef increases which results in a reduction of ig wave generated inside the surf zone in the case of the real reef bottom stress reef resonance and wave breaking all have influence on the ig wave height however the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism seems to be a less important factor for the fringing reef the wave set up ss wave height and ig wave height on the reef flat all show varying degrees of increase ig wave height can be even three times larger in the presence of the vertical shoreline two reasons are responsible for this increase of the ig wave 1 the superposition of incoming ig wave and reflected ig wave and 2 more violent wave breaking in the surf zone because that the ss wave height is more strongly limited by the shallow water depth on the reef flat the ss wave in front of the shoreline plays a much less important role than the ig wave does the ig wave should be considered as the most important factor especially in the fringing reef system the relative large size of the ig wave heights on the fringing reef and on the platform reef is observed under the specific setup of the experiment such as a vertical wall smooth surface and steep reef face must more tests will also be required to assess fully the effects of the distance and front slope on ig wave propagation to develop a more general

20913,this paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation into the role of infragravity motions in reef hydrodynamics over different reef systems laboratory experiments are performed with reef profiles of a platform reef and a fringing reef under irregular wave conditions the propagation and the distribution of the infragravity wave are different over these two reef systems analysis of the measured time histories of water surface elevation shows that shorter sea swell ss waves longer infragravity ig wave and mean water level on the reef flat are significantly larger in the fringing reef system the ig wave height is much larger on the fringing reef than that on the platform reef this marked increase of the ig wave is considered to be due to 1 the superposition of incoming ig wave and reflected ig wave from shoreline 2 more violent wave breaking in the surf zone that may enhance the transfer of wave energy from the frequency band of the shorter wave to ig wave in this experiment the wave breaking mechanism controls the relationship between ig wave height and water depth keywords infragravity wave fringing reef platform reef shoreline wave set up 1 introduction million people worldwide live in coastal areas near coral reefs many of which form natural barriers protecting shorelines against waves storms and floods reef lined coasts however are becoming increasingly vulnerable to wave driven flooding as a result of climate change and the reef degradation caused by coastal developments for residents and the growing tourism industry it is essential to understand the dynamic processes of the reef system either in the natural or built states hydrodynamic interaction of waves with coral reefs is complex and has been studied over decades the wave energy propagation on reefs can be very different from normal coastal beaches primarily because of the complex coastal configurations at various scales and the roughness of the substrate a typical platform reef is often idealized to consist of a seaward sloping reef face and a shallow reef flat for the fringing reef the inshore reef flat extends toward the shoreline the reef flat in shallow water is commonly exposed at low tide cabioch et al 2010 wave breaking induced by the shallow water significantly reduces most of the sea swell wave energy f 0 04 hz gourlay 1994 and the rough surface of the reef also causes a further dissipation of wave energy lowe et al 2005 buckley et al 2016 baldock et al 2020 in field observations coral reefs can provide defense against huge wave attack by reducing overall wave energy up to an average of 97 ferrario et al 2014 however infragravity wave 0 004 0 04 hz and wave set up are found to be enhanced on the reef flat relative to mild coastlines becker et al 2014 2016 bukley et al 2018 as a consequence infragravity wave ig wave is seen to play a significant role on the reef flat and in the lagoon pÃ©quignet et al 2009 pomeroy et al 2012b van dongeren et al 2013 with ig wave becoming a dominant component to the wave run up on the reef fringed shoreline buckley et al 2018 wave set up which is the rise of the mean water level induced by the depth limited wave breaking has been widely studied by field observations on coral line coasts munk and sargent 1948 vetter et al 2010 becker et al 2014 laboratory experiments gerritsen 1980 gourlay 1996a yao et al 2018 and theoretical analysis tait 1972 gourlay 1996b yao et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 the wave set up on natural reefs is influenced by the incident wave height water depth on the reef flat and the roughness of the reef franklin 2013 buckley et al 2016 wave set up on the reef flat increases with the increase of the incident wave height and the decrease of the water depth on the reef flat gourlay 1996a becker et al 2014 the roughness of the reef has two opposite effects on the wave set up the frictional dissipation of wave energy seaward of the breakpoint results in a decrease of the wave set up the onshore directed bottom stress induced by the offshore directed near bottom velocity may lead to the increase of the wave set up franklin et al 2013 bukley et al 2016 ig wave recognized as the low frequency 0 004 0 04 hz set up down oscillation is generated by two widely accepted mechanisms the first mechanism is the release of the bound ig waves the radiation stress gradient generates the bound ig wave in the incident wave groups longuet higgins and stewart 1962 when the water depth decreases and waves break the bound ig waves are released and propagate as free waves in the other mechanism the ig waves are generated as dynamic set up down oscillations as a result of the spatially fluctuating breakpoints of different sized wave groups symonds et al 1982 along with the generation of the ig waves the groupiness of the incident wave decreases due to the wave breaking liu and li 2018 poate et al 2020 bound wave release is considered to be a more important source of ig wave on the gentle slope list 1992 janssen et al 2003 while for the steep slope the time varying breakpoint mechanism is considered to be the dominant mechanism for the generation of the ig wave battjes et al 2004 baldock et al 2012 many reefs have very steep slopes with some reef faces even being close to vertical gourlay 1996b therefore in many field observations pomeroy et al 2012a becker et al 2016 and experiments buckley et al 2018 ig waves on the reef flat are linked to the time variation of the wave breakpoint in the surf zone the wave breakpoint mechanism is also found working against the incident bound ig wave pequignet el al 2014 although the ig wave on the reef flat is also damped by the roughness of the reef the bottom friction has a much greater effect on the short waves than the ig waves pomeroy et al 2012a the ig wave has a bore like wave shape gawehn et al 2016 due to the high propagation speed the huge inertial forces at the front of the ig wave can cause extensive damage to coastal structures for example in the okinawa islands of southern japan seawall roads and houses sheltered by reef were found damaged by bore like floods with 10 min intervals nakaza et al 1991 during typhoon haiyan in 2013 video footage captured serious destruction to a philippine town by fast moving bore roeber and bricker 2015 when the frequencies of the ig wave are close to the natural frequencies of the water body on the reef flat resonant amplification is possible and the coastal flooding potential increases cheriton et al 2016 gawehn et al 2016 the ig wave can also lead to moored ship motions van dongeren et al 2016 and large resonance gao et al 2019 for the reef fringed harbors besides the wave breaking the infragravity wave is also influenced by the reef fringed shoreline on the platform reef wave and current can escape to the sea through the end of the reef flat or lagoon however on the fringing reef infragravity wave will be reflected by the shoreline and then propagate to the open sea or trapped on the reef flat in order to assess the influence of the shoreline comparison on the reef hydrodynamics between fringing reef and platform reef is needed based on which an engineering solution that meets specific engineering ecological criteria may be developed to ameliorate the coastal erosion and flooding this paper presents a two dimensional laboratory experiment to investigate the hydrodynamic processes on an idealized reef under irregular wave conditions two different reef profiles are considered a platform reef and a fringing reef the generation and propagation of the ig wave on the reef flat are analyzed based on measurements of water surface elevation and flow velocity at 15 locations along the wave flume and the changes in the wave conditions on the reef flat caused by the shoreline are discussed the paper is organized as below the experiment setup is introduced in section 2 the wave propagation and the

detailed the set of wave flume and the scaled physical models of the reef in regular wave tests here these physical models were further used under the irregular wave conditions the reef model consisted of a steep reef face with a slope of 1 1 and a horizontal reef flat of 8 6 m long the reef face and reef flat were built by smooth sand cement grout a relatively smooth and impervious surface the process of wave run up on the shoreline is not taken into account therefore the reef fringed shoreline is adopted as a vertical structure which is 7 2 m away from the reef edge without the shoreline the reef model is corresponding to a platform reef fig 1 shows the sketch of reef profile and measuring instrument arrangement fifteen capacitance wave gauges twg 600 and four high

submergence depth Î· r h r increases which leads to a small increase of the ss wave height 5 wave heights in front of the shoreline the wave heights in front of the shoreline are shown in fig 9 the horizontal axis is the non dimensional submergence depth on the reef flat Î· r h r h in where Î· r is the wave set up at g15 fig 9 a shows the relative ss wave height h ss h in in front of the shoreline g15 it can be seen that the ss wave height is proportional to the water depth as a result of the ss wave heights being limited by the submergence depth on the reef flat for the platform reef the ratio Î³ of the ss wave height h ss and submergence depth Î· r h r in the inner surf zone ranges from 0 50 to 0 67 for the fringing reef the wave reflection and slamming on the vertical shoreline generate larger Î³ ranged from 0 56 to 0 75 fig 9 b shows the relative ig wave height h ig h in in front of the shoreline at g15 for the fringing reef the ig wave height has significant increase by a factor of 2 3 therefore the ig wave heights in front of the shoreline remain quite high as the relative ig wave height is from 0 49 to 0 68 under different wave conditions the obvious reason for the significant increase of the ig wave height is the perfect wave reflection from the shoreline with a gentle shoreline the ig wave height will decrease due to the decrease of the wave reflection for the fringing reef the wave heights of the separated incoming ig wave at g15 are shown in fig 9 b it can be seen that the incoming ig wave heights are also larger than the ig wave heights for the platform reef fig 9 c shows the relative ig wave heights h ig h in at g6 the ig waves at g6 are considered as the outgoing ig waves generated in the surf zone path 2 in fig 5 for the fringing reef the outgoing ig wave heights at g6 also increase as shown in fig 9 c these phenomena indicate that with the shoreline the wave breaking in the surf zone may generate larger outgoing path 2 and incoming path 1 ig waves fig 10 shows the photos of the wave breaking around the reef edge at the same moment for the platform reef and fringing reef it can be seen that with the shoreline the wave generated flow can t flow out of the reef flat and the high water level on the reef flat generates strong backflow zhu et al 2018 which in turn induces a more violent wave breaking as a consequence for the fringing reef the outgoing path 2 and incoming path 1 ig waves generated in the surf zone may increase the ratio of the ig wave height and ss wave height h ig h ss at g15 are shown in fig 9 d when submergence depth decreases ig wave plays a more important role on the reef flat for the fringing reef the values of h ig h ss are more than 1 in general which indicates ig wave dominance under all submergence depth in the case of the real reef the bottom friction has a much greater effect on damping the short waves compared to the ig waves pomeroy et al 2012a and the ss wave in front of the shoreline may become even smaller for the fringing reef comparisons of ig wave height between our experiment and previous studies are shown in table a1 due to the steep reef face the vertical shoreline and smooth surface our experiment have the largest relative ig wave heights 0 49 0 68 the field observations have smaller ig wave height on the reef flat than the laboratory experiments with smooth surface in field observations pomeroy et al 2012a gawehn et al 2016 the ig wave was found to increase notably with the increase of the submergence depth they attribute this to the bottom friction or reef resonance when the water depth increases the wave energy dissipation induced by the bottom friction decreases pomeroy et al 2012a larger water depth on the reef flat also increases the probability of resonance gawehn et al 2016 when water depth increases the resonance and the decrease of the wave energy dissipation lead to a large ig wave heights on the reef flat however when the bottom friction is small this proportional relationship will disappear for example in beetham et al s 2015 field observation the ig wave height is minimally affected by the water depth nwogu and demirbilek s 2010 and yao et al s 2020 laboratory experiment results are reanalyzed in dimensionless forms as shown in fig 11 different from field observations the ig wave height decreases with the increase of the submergence depth in our experiment and yao et al s 2020 experiment the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism decreasing as the water depth over the reef increases which results in a decrease generation of ig wave in the surf zone when the bottom friction is small enough to be neglected the wave breaking mechanism will control an opposite relationship between ig wave height and water depth noticeably nwogu and demirbilek s 2010 experiments show a different trend due to the obvious reef resonance at large water depth therefore when water depth increases the ig wave height is influenced by these three factors which act counter to each other however the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism seems to be a less important factor than bottom friction and resonance 6 conclusions in order to investigate the hydrodynamic processes on an idealized reef under irregular wave conditions a two dimensional experiment is carried out strong ig waves are generated on the reef flat by the time varying breakpoint mechanism the ig wave height on the reef flat is proportional to the standard deviations Ïenv of the incident wave envelope Î·env the larger significant period ts of the incident wave leads to a larger ig wave height on the reef flat different with the field observations the ig wave height is found to decrease slightly with the increase of the submergence depth the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism decreasing as the water depth over the reef increases which results in a reduction of ig wave generated inside the surf zone in the case of the real reef bottom stress reef resonance and wave breaking all have influence on the ig wave height however the efficiency of the breakpoint mechanism seems to be a less important factor for the fringing reef the wave set up ss wave height and ig wave height on the reef flat all show varying degrees of increase ig wave height can be even three times larger in the presence of the vertical shoreline two reasons are responsible for this increase of the ig wave 1 the superposition of incoming ig wave and reflected ig wave and 2 more violent wave breaking in the surf zone because that the ss wave height is more strongly limited by the shallow water depth on the reef flat the ss wave in front of the shoreline plays a much less important role than the ig wave does the ig wave should be considered as the most important factor especially in the fringing reef system the relative large size of the ig wave heights on the fringing reef and on the platform reef is observed under the specific setup of the experiment such as a vertical wall smooth surface and steep reef face must more tests will also be required to assess fully the effects of the distance and front slope on ig wave propagation to develop a more general

occurs when a microbial community is involved in the degradation of an asset e g pipelines it is widely recognized as a significant cause of hazardous hydrocarbon release and subsequently fires explosions and economic and environmental impacts this paper presents a new mic management methodology the proposed methodology assists in accurately monitoring mic activity and accordingly develop strategies to manage it the mic monitoring and management activities are achieved using continuous bayesian network cbn technique with hierarchical bayesian analysis hba the integration of hba and cbn helps overcome the bayesian network s discrete value limitations bn and source to source uncertainty for each node in the network the methodology can provide the precise value of parameters such as failure probability and mic occurrence rate which are verified using observed data the application of the methodology is demonstrated on a subsea pipeline the study provides a better understanding of the influencing factors of mic rate and failure probability this assists in developing effective mic management strategies keywords safety management subsea pipeline uncertainty pipeline markov chain monte carlo method bayesian analysis 1 introduction microbiologically influenced corrosion mic also known as biocorrosion is a significant threat to asset integrity in most industries especially in oil and gas industrial sectors taleb berrouane et al 2018 technol and gu 2012 xu et al 2016 because of their activities based on metabolites mic is caused by microbial biofilms where their activities reflect in reservoir souring and asset deterioration gu et al 2019 ibrahim et al 2018 as industrial assets age mic becomes a common risk factor leading to an accident e g fluid flooding leakage rupture etc besides mic has been extensively reported as annually causing the loss of billions of dollars in the us walsh et al 1993 mic has been attributed to approximately 10 of corrosion cases in the uk romero et al 2000 the largest prudhoe bay s oil spill occurred due to mic in 2006 ibrahim et al 2018 and alaskan pipeline leakage was caused by microbial activities staying with the aforementioned introduction performing mic management is therefore vital whereby operators can use quantitative semi quantitative and qualitative models to support decision making to manage corrosion mic management underlying the idea of corrosion management approaches should employ the key factors of recently introduced corrosion management systems cms morshed 2011 to make sure that all required mic preventives control and mitigative actions are performed in a sustainable well established and effective manner lund et al 2017 skovhus et al 2018 three main steps need to be considered in any corrosion management approach i understanding the mic threat mechanism and how it affects the assets ii recognizing and performing an appropriate management practice and iii monitoring the management practices to examine whether the practices are effective or need further modifications lund et al 2017 skovhus et al 2016 these steps are taken into account based on cms procedures on a daily weekly monthly and annual basis thus corrosion management in general and mic specifically can be viewed as a supporting program in which management practice is presented and facilitated it should be highlighted that mic management in an ongoing and continuous process since mic is known as an asset integrity threat which further increases the operational risk therefore mic management has to follow the iso 31000 iso 31000 risk management 2009 framework on risk management there are a considerable number of corrosion management programs based on the reliability availability of assets proposed by both the academic and industrial sectors over the past few decades these management programs are typically categorized into different classes namely i calculating the failure probability of asset pipeline over a period before and after launching in line inspection and cleaning tools ii repairing the defect if required iii optimizing the periodic schedule of in line inspection tools to determine the defects and corresponding sizes of the defects iv manipulating operational parameters v using chemical compounds e g inhibitors and biocides vi applying coating and cathodic protection and combination of the classes gomes et al 2013 gomes and beck 2014 javaherdashti and alasvand 2019a teixeira et al 2008 zhang and zhou 2014 zhao et al 2009 zhou 2010 2011 the pit depth growth models play an important role in proposing a corrosion management practice to approximate the failure probability of the pipeline as a function of time predicting the remaining strength of the pipeline as well as examining the defect s location and determining the efficiency of each management practice this is why utilizing the data collected from pipeline history over time is essential for the industry to develop a pit depth growth model in a much more realistic way in literature pit depth growth models can be developed by using conservative and non conservative techniques the latter may lead to critical defects being overlooked by the management practice and increase the occurrence of serious consequences on the other hand the conservative pit depth growth models will increase the uncertainty of management practice zhang et al 2014 developing a mechanistic model for pit depth growth models is an intrinsically complex process as it may include two types of variables namely temporal and spatial the temporal variables are defined as the pit depth growth path of a defect that varies over time while the spatial variables are defined as the pit depth growth path of more than one defect however all variables may be correlated the probabilistic pit depth growth model is widely used in the literature as random variables and stochastic based models it simply means that the pit depth growth is considered to follow a linear or power law function of time ahammed 1998 ahammed and melchers 1996 teixeira et al 2008 zhang and zhou 2014 zhou 2010 2011 as an example the growth of a corrosion defect is characterized by utilizing the markov process and a gamma distribution with a shape and scale parameter as time variant and time invariant respectively noortwijk 2009 noortwijk et al 2007 pandey et al 2009 a gamma process is employed to characterize corrosion growth of the multiple defect maes and dann 2007 a non homogenous markov process is used for pit growth according to the experimental data for aluminum maes and dann 2007 a non homogenous markov process is also used by caleyo et al 2009 valor and caleyo 2007 to characterize the pitting corrosion in which weibull distribution is assumed for corrosion initiation time a power law function of time is considered to model the parameters in transition probability in another study the time dependent transition intensities were examined by collecting the pipeline defect information with in line inspection tools hong 1999 however there are significant challenges associated with modeling the pit growth by adopting markov process based models i selecting a transition probability function and the sufficient numbers of damage state ii using data from in line inspection tools introduces the uncertainties as well as errors and iii facing the spatial correlation between the defects this is why the bayesian based methodologies are robust and powerful tools utilizing data for pit depth growth modeling as an example hierarchical bayesian methodology and dynamic bayesian networks by incorporating new data have been used to analyze the deterioration mechanistic model of corrosion and updating the parameters in the model palencia et al 2019 teixeira et al 2019 xiang and zhou 2018 zhang and weng 2020 the hierarchical bayesian analysis hba is utilized to model the pit growth in the pipeline zhang et al 2014 researchers used a non homogenous gamma process to derive the probability distribution for the parameters within multiple defects in another study al amin et al 2014 developed a pit depth growth model for a specific defect using hba based on the data obtained from the in line inspection tools a hierarchical bayesian framework was developed by qin et al 2015 to model defect generation and growth of metal deterioration in oil and gas steel pipelines pesinis and tee 2018 proposed a framework to estimate corrosion based failure probabilities of underground natural gas pipelines and corrosion growth defects by using a hierarchical bayesian model a hierarchical bayesian model based on a non homogeneous gamma process is proposed considering the operational conditions of a pipeline over a period of time groth 2019 zhang and wang zhang and weng 2020 used a bayesian network bn to construct a knowledge based model by analyzing the failure probability and leakage size of corrosion for an underground gas pipeline however in all aforementioned studies there is a lack of comprehensive pit depth growth modelling considering both model and data uncertainties which further helps on site operators to make decisions by proposing a management practice therefore to deal with the lack of previous studies cbn along with hba can be used cbn which can be considered as an extension of typical bn song et al 2017 is a powerful tool and can handle model uncertainty using adaptive models in addition cbn by utilizing continuous nodes can better reflect those variables that change continuously in nature cbn and its extensions have been broadly used such as but not limited to the field of safety reliability and risk management hossain et al 2019 kabir et al 2018 2020 khakzad et al 2013 misuri et al 2018 hba is also a robust technique to deal with different sources of information known as data uncertainty in safety reliability and risk management domains the existing data is generally inadequate to conduct analysis especially modeling the pit depth growth where improper modeling causes pipeline failure thus to obtain acceptable results to support decision making hba utilizes and then aggregates a wide range of information in addition in recent years the availability of markov chain monte carlo mcmc using a sampling application can help decision makers to fully track performing hba kelly and smith 2009 khakzad et al 2014b siu and kelly 1998 yang et al 2012 the contribution of this study is threefold the first contribution is in providing cbn along with hba in one methodology framework for mic management thus the proposed framework takes into account both model and data uncertainty second is in developing a new mechanistic model for pit depth growth under the influence of mic and third is using the bayesian based model over a period of time to propose the optimum and best management practices the organization of the paper is presented as follows in sections 2 and 3 the preliminaries of cbn and hba are explained respectively in section 4 a framework is proposed to manage mic considering both types of model and data uncertainties in section 5 a corroded pipeline is studied as a case study to demonstrate the application of the developed methodology in the final section a conclusion challenges of the current study and direction for upcoming research are provided 1 1 continuous bayesian network the bn has enough capacity to analyze the behavior of each node over time given new data making it one of the most powerful and robust tools common bn based approaches have been widely used in different engineering domains such as but not limited to abimbola et al 2016 adesina et al 2020 arzaghi et al 2018 noroozi et al 2013 taleb berrouane et al 2020 yazdi et al 2020 zarei et al 2019 zinetullina et al 2019 bn based approaches can employ different types of input data objective or subjective to estimate the probability centered event by reducing the model uncertainty with consideration of interdependency between all the participating nodes however the common bn based models ignore the preciseness and modeling flexibility since the discrete nodes are used in the models in other words the common bn based approaches consider the continuous nature of causal factors in the network as discrete variables therefore these types of estimations provides uncertainty during the analysis process adumene et al 2020a 2020b 2020c bhandari et al 2015 xia et al 2018 yazdi et al 2019 zarei et al 2020 in real world applications there are often variables that continuously change over time and therefore cannot be modeled using common bn based models with discrete variables such is the case for mic to deal with the abovementioned drawbacks the common bn based approaches can be further developed as a cbn considering the continuous causal factors in cbn the nodes of the models can be represented as a combination of discrete and continuous variables to see how cbn can be constructed from a common bn based model guozheng et al song et al 2017 proposed a framework to convert bn into the cbn according to this study two significant changes are required so that the parental nodes can quantitatively signify the child nodes first of all all nodes with a continuous nature in bn based modes must be defined by employing measurable variables next the child nodes value in cbn needs to be represented as a function of the parental nodes value this simply means that the conditional probability tables cpts in the common bn based models are transferred into the conditional probability distributions or mathematical functions that represent the relationships between the value of the child and parental nodes in cbn the computation of posterior distribution becomes much more complex and therefore the analytical methods or monto carlo simulations cannot compute the posterior distributions markov chain monto carlo mcmc is a robust tool and has high level capacity to compute the complicated posterior distribution with high dimensions to elaborate mcmc has two main parts i monto carlo and ii markov chain monto carlo refers to a method that relies on the generation of random numbers and markov chain refers to a sequence of numbers in which each number depends on the previous number in the sequence however monto carlo simulations fail to sample from the complicated distribution which has different types of dependent variables to handle this issue markov chain is used to assist monto carlo and therefore mcmc is utilized to obtain more details about mcmc and its algorithms one can refer to gilks 1996 1 2 hierarchical bayesian analysis simply put bayesian analysis is one of the main elements of the bayesian methods that deal with the unknown parameters of a mechanistic process as random variables instead of using deterministic values the bayesian analysis makes use of prior knowledge about the mechanistic process parameters which may be derived from expert opinion past experience and information from previous research studies subsequently the prior knowledge is adjusted based on the newly observed data to update the opinions about the parameters of a mechanistic model furthermore the updated belief can then be considered as the prior distribution for updating in the future as the new data becomes obtainable thus by repeating this process the data uncertainty about the parameters of the mechanistic model is reduced hierarchical bayesian analysis hba banerjee et al 2014 is a unique case of the bayesian methods in which the prior distribution is disjointed into the conditional distribution sequentially robert 2007 hba is a powerful tool for making statistical inferences about the parameters of the mechanistic model in which there are complicated interactions between the parameters in addition hba is principally appropriate for population where the model s parameters described as a sample in the population are measured to be associated with the parameters for another sample from the same population al amin et al 2014 demichelis et al 2006 let it be assumed that there is a population of n random variable y i 1 1 2 3 n which can describe similar mechanistic processes consider that there is a set of unknown parameters where Î¸ i denotes the probability distribution of a random variable y i the prior distribution p Î¸ i Ï can be assigned to Î¸ i in which p Î¸ i Ï signifies the pdf of Î¸ i and is conditioned on the known parameters Ï and are considered to be common to the population of y i moreover let it be us assumed that y i denotes a set of observed data for y i the updated opinion of Î¸ i can be obtained using bayes theorem fenton and neil 2013 by combining the prior distribution and the observed data in the following equation 1 p Î¸ i y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï p y i l y i Î¸ i is the known likelihood function is based on the information provided by the data which is conditional on Î¸ i besides the entity p Î¸ i Ï is called the posterior distribution which reflects the combination information of prior information and obtained new data the quantity p y i is the normalizing constant which confirms that the left hand side of equation 1 is a probability distribution the p Î¸ i y i integrates to be unity and is known as the marginal likelihood which can further be determined by integrating the numerator on the right hand side of equation 1 regarded as Î¸ i therefore the following equation can be derived 2 p y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï d Î¸ i keeping the normalization constant in mind using proportionality symbol equation 1 can be rewritten as 3 p Î¸ i y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï the abovementioned explanations are based on standard bayesian formulations where it is assigned a prior distribution into the parameter Î¸ i by controlling the distribution y i however the standard bayesian formulations can be further developed by considering that the parameter Ï which controls the distribution of Î¸ i is a random variable as well by assigning the prior distribution p Ï Ï into the Ï according to this extension the p Ï Ï is named as hyper prior and Ï in named as hyper parameter banerjee et al 2014 robert 2007 in addition the hyper parameter can be known and can present the prior belief about Ï in practice Ï can be also be treated as random variables and proceed to the next level of hierarchy as can be seen from fig 1 modified after banerjee et al 2014 the simple graphical structure of a common hbn of extended bayesian model is provided therefore the extended bayesian model can be summarized as follows i likelihood of data l y i Î¸ i ii first stage of prior p Î¸ i Ï iii second stage of prior p Ï Ï iv posterior distribution of Î¸ i p Î¸ i y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï v posterior distribution of Ï p Ï Î¸ i l Î¸ 1 Î¸ 2 Î¸ n Ï p Ï Ï in such cases hba can be defined in four levels due to the fact that level one is based on inspection data i e the defect depths described by inspections which are connected to measurement uncertainties level two highlights the auxiliary variables including the actual depths at the times of inspections and increments of the actual depths between two consecutive inspections level two also makes the likelihood function for the measured depth mathematically tractable and facilitates the bayesian updating in level three the parameters for level two are provided e g the parameters in gamma distributions and finally in level four hyperparameters assist in finding out the parameters in level three it should be added that based on the type of decision making problem the level can be increased or shortened by studying the literature and with the support of decision makers such as but not limited to al amin et al 2014 el gheriani et al 2016 el gheriani et al 2017 khakzad et al 2014a 2014b and to the best of the authors understanding some of the merits of hba compared to other statistical models can be highlighted as following i hba enables one to deal with the source to source uncertainties by utilizing the hierarchical prior assignment thus the feature of hba makes a robust estimation of the parameters in which the posterior results are based on the average from different possible prior options robert 2007 ii hba using the conditional hierarchical priors can better describe the spatiotemporally space time correlated data congdon 2020 iii the computations of the bayesian model are commonly simplified by the hierarchical structure within posterior distribution simplification this results from priors decomposition thus different sampling algorithms can be employed to update the parameters banerjee et al 2014 congdon 2020 robert 2007 iv in hba a specific group or singular parameter can derive information from the equivalent of the parameters ntzoufras 2011 thus the level of singular inference can be obtained as precisely as possible and shows its merits when the observed data and sample size are small to characterize the pit depth for a single mic defect of a subsea pipeline hba using inferences is practically advantageous since the information that is linked to give defect is commonly limited the mean standard deviation and other probabilistic characteristics of random variables which are entered in hba can be determined by integrating and combining the posterior distribution however there is a lack of close form solutions to obtain the posterior distribution when the bayesian network has high dimensions and is complex therefore similar to the cbn mentioned in preliminary 2 the difficulties can be handled using mcmc techniques in the mcmc methods a markov chain is initially constructed to consider the start values of the parameters and subsequently converges to the posterior distribution which is actual target density it should be added that the sample is dependent on the start value therefore the influence of the start value needs to be reduced by ignoring the first part of the sample this period is referred to as the burning in period the burning in period is the time it takes the chains to be stabilized which means therefore that there is not up and down drifting over time by ignoring the sample in the burning in period afterward the sample can be used for bayesian inference of the parameters there are some important algorithms that are commonly utilized to perform an mcmc such as but not limited to metropolis random walk hastings slice sampling and gibbs s sampling to get more details about mcmc methods and corresponding algorithms one can refer to the following references banerjee et al 2014 congdon 2020 ntzoufras 2011 robert 2007 2 methodology it is important to predict the rate of mic as well as pit depth growth in the early stage of subsea pipeline development to provide appropriate management practice s which can prevent mitigate and control the occurrence of pipeline failure caused by mic however mic management is a challenging task for decision makers due to a lack of information in probabilistic risk analysis the rate of mic and pit depth growth can be estimated by utilizing modeling techniques such as bayesian network such bayesian network modeling techniques have a number of shortfalls which result from some degree of uncertainty as can be seen from fig 2 the proposed six step methodology enables consideration of both types of data and model uncertainties by modeling cbn and hba in the proposed methodology cbn and hba can deal with the model and data uncertainties respectively step 1 constructing the mechanistic model of mic in this step mechanistic modelling of individual pit initiation influenced by mic is developed the mechanistic model considers the type of corrosion which in our case is mic chemical material type alloy composition mechanic characteristics of the system e g subsea onshore and effective environmental and operational conditions this can further lead but is not limited to the rate of corrosion material strength properties depth and width of the pits and remaining age of the pipeline once all potential factors impacting on the mic are identified the bn tool is further developed to consider the relationship between different parameters in the mic mechanistic model step 2 collecting all the required information the related data for each node in developed bn are obtained from different sources including different industrial sectors operational conditions various regions or subjective opinions from experts in the field because the nodes in bn can be defined by combination of both discrete and continuous variables cbn is therefore used instead of bn collecting data is the key step in any kind of statistical inference data can be defined as an observation value in a stochastic domain which may have different sources of uncertainty however assessing evaluating manipulating and organizing any form of data is referred as information knowledge in its general form is assembled from the information the inference is referred to as the process of obtaining a conclusion according to what is known for us kelly and smith 2009 in addition once all required data information is collected they are further processed into the intervals to approximate their probabilities for identified ranges therefore the predicted probabilities can be used as input data for the cbn model the cbn similarly to the bn can deal with model uncertainty step 3 utilizing hierarchical bayesian analysis to deal with data uncertainty as mentioned in preliminary 3 hba is used to derive the probability of each node in cbn after collecting the relevant data for each node from different sources the likelihood function of continuous nodes is specified for each data set according to the type of aggregated data as an example if the number of observed variables is collected in a specific period the poisson likelihood function can be used to model the data set thereafter the hierarchical model can be structured as the following x i poisson Î» i t i as likelihood function Î» i gamma Î± Î² as the first state of prior Î± gamma 0 0001 0 0001 diffusive hyperprior Î² gamma 0 0001 0 0001 diffusive hyperprior according to this point hba provides a posterior distribution for the parameter of interest which is probability in addition probability reflects the mean and reliable intervals the mean value signifies the most fitting value for the interested parameter the obtained distribution denotes source to source uncertainties in the interested parameter and therefore can be used as a prior information distribution when new information becomes available thus hba correctly deals with data uncertainty step 4 estimating the rate of mic and pit depth growth once all the probabilities of each node to be used in the developed cbn are obtained the pit depth growth can be estimated firstly the probability of parental nodes in cbn will be used as a prior belief to estimate the probability of pit depth growth secondly the probability of each node will be updated given new information through the probability propagation or reasoning process moreover cbn enables the setting of evidence in the network at any stage hence the posterior distribution estimated by hba is considered as an informative prior distribution thereafter the obtained informative prior distribution is used to update the probability of the nodes using probability reasoning processes the cbn is then updated the model completely to compute the pit depth growth over time it is assumed that the actual depth of an mic defect follows a power law path it is further assumed that the parameters of power law growth are constant by time and quantified for each specific defect therefore it is also considered that the pit depth growths of different defects are spatially independent according to the power law path model the pit depth growth of the defect i at time j can be estimated in the following equation al amin et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 4 d a i j a i t j t 0 i b i Î· i j where the parameter a i a i 0 is an indication of pit depth growth for defect i in one year from the initiation time of defect the parameter t j is the proceed time elapse time in a year from installation date until time j as the reorganization of a defect the parameter t 0 i represents the mic initiation time the proceed time from installation date to the time when defect i starts to grow in practice t 0 i t j the parameter b i b i 0 denotes the mic rate of growth path in which b i 0 b i 0 and b i 1 representthe linear acceleration and deceleration pit depth growth path respectively Î· i j denotes the model error of the pit depth growth connected with defect i at time j in practice there is no date for the specific defect until the first launch of an in line inspection tool thus hba using prior distribution are considered for the parameters the truncated normal distribution is allocated for the prior distribution of the parameter a i due to the fact that it should be positive in addition selecting a normal distribution provides better computational stability as well as enhancing the efficiency of the model the parameter b i is approximated with respect to the mechanistic model of mic the prior distribution of the parameter t 0 i is assumed to be uniformly distributed in interval zero and t 1 since t 1 is the elapsed time from installation until the reorganization of a defect using observation inspection tools etc the parameter Î· i j as the model error for the defect i at time j is considered to be normal distribution having a value of mean equal to zero which means that the power law model is considered to be on average unbiased for each defect therefore the prior distribution of three parameters a i t 0 i and Î· i j i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 n are represented as the following equations 5a a i n Î¼ a Ï a 2 5b t o i u 0 t 1 5c Î· i j n i Î¼ a Ï Î· i 2 in which all above mentioned distributions are identically distributed and independent n x y represents the normal distribution with mean and variance of x and y respectively u l x u y denotes a uniform distribution having a lower and upper bound of l x and u y respectively the parameter Î· i j is considered to be independent and identically distributed for a given defect i in a different time slice in addition the parameter Î· i j is considered to be independent at a given time the parameter Î· i j for different defects the prior distribution of parameter of b i is obtained from the mic mechanistic model using cbn the prior distribution parameters for a i and Î· i j are assigned another level of prior named hyper prior as they deal with the random variables to treat the random variables the normal and inverse gamma distributions are considered for mean Î¼ a and standard deviation Ï a 2 and Ï Î· i 2 as prior distributions respectively the normal and inverse gamma distributions are well known conjugate priors of a normal distribution and using conjugate priors further provides posterior distributions without numerical integration zhang and zhou 2014 keeping the above mentioned explanations the hyper priors can be defined as the following 6a Î¼ a n a b 6b Ï a 2 i g c d 6c Ï Î· i 2 i g e f where i g x y denotes the probability density function of inverse gamma distribution with shape and scale factors x and y respectively the parameters a b c d e and f are named as hyper priors of the model and are considered to be known using non informative distribution in addition as mentioned earlier the Î¼ Î· i is assumed to be zero the fully hierarchical bayesian model for pit depth growth is established in fig 3 with respect to the aforementioned hyper priors step 5 performing sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is carried out to study how the output uncertainty of the pit depth growth model can be separated into the different sources of input uncertainties saltelli 2002 in addition sensitivity analysis helps to validate the model by using different methods such as but not limited to the conditional variances first path conditional variances second path higher order sensitivity indices total effects etc to obtain more details one can refer to saltelli et al 2008 mic case is a highly complex process and as a result relationships between inputs and outputs in the model are not easy to follow therefore sensitivity analysis helps decision makers to see how changing or a combination of input parameters impacts the output according to this point in this study a sensitivity analysis is performed to provide valuable information for the next step to propose the best and optimum management practice step 6 proposing the best and optimum management practice once sensitivity analysis is performed from the previous step the behavior vitiation of each root parameter with the pit depth growth path will be obtained over a period of time in addition as mentioned earlier applying each management program with respect to its corresponding characteristics has an identified effect on the pit depth growth path by comparing all possible management programs including each practice as well as a combination of them we can select the optimum management practices in each time slice 3 application to a case study the proposed methodology is applied to an apl 5l grade x42 subsea hydrocarbon transition pipeline which is highly suspect of internal mic and is required to be in operational condition for at least 40 years the pipeline carries co mingled fluids from a different number of subsea resources according to the first step of the developed methodology the mechanistic model of maximum pit depth growth influence by mic appears in fig 4 the mechanistic model of mic is drawn with consideration to i environmental conditions including salinity co2 partial pressure ph o2 temperature water cut and sulphides ii operational conditions including fluid velocity and pressure iii material conditions including steel composition and carbon content iv biofilm and v exposure duration in the second step the pipeline operational data and information according to the operational environment are provided in table 1 based on the combination of discrete and continuous variables the provided data is based on literature adumene et al 2020b arzaghi et al 2018 bhandari et al 2015 bhardwaj et al 2020a 2020b dawuda et al 2021 dubois 2010 palencia et al 2019 teixeira et al 2008 2019 and mean value of continuous variables are based on operational and chemical analysis from searose fpso it is assumed that the pipeline contains multiple defects throughout the non informative distributions i e distributions with small means and very large variances are allocated as hyper priors to the pit depth growth factors a i t o i and Î· i j to obtain pit depth growth bayesian updating software such as openbugs www openbugs net using mcmc methods is utilized by 1000000 iterations within interval 2 tinning in which the estimated parameters of the growth models were then used to estimate the depth of a defect table 2 provides a chemical analysis of produced water showing the total number of microorganisms using the qpcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction method different types of microorganisms percentage as well as sulfate reduction rate srr which further means that the defect in the pipeline is influenced by mic in addition the sulfate reduction rate is used in the mechanistic model of mic to propose a management practice in this study a pit within a maximum pit depth is considered for evaluation in the third step testing data are provided from table 1 with hba as described in section 3 preliminary of hierarchical bayesian analysis which provides a probability distribution i e a predictive posterior distribution for each node in cbn as shown in fig 5 the mean value of the distributions represents an adequate value of each node after obtaining the description and probability value of all nodes in cbn it will then be used as prior belief in cbn to estimate the rate of mic and further pit depth growth as shown in fig 6 as it can be seen from fig 6 the node pit depth growth is constructed based on an equation representing that time varying characteristics of pit depth growth considered in the bn prediction mode in addition it should be highlighted that parameters such as pit indication of pit depth growth using gamma distribution represent the randomness in the bn model in the fourth step the probability of pit depth growth gained from the previous analysis can further be utilized to estimate the probability of pit depth growth over a period considering that only t j and t 0 i are varied by time fig 7 depicts the approximation of pit depth growth over a period showing mean median and 10 percent error for the fifth step sensitivity analysis is performed as a forward propagation to understand how proposing a management practice can properly prevent mitigate and control mic in addition it can increase the lifetime of the pipeline by decreasing the pit depth growth path over a period fig 8 presents the possible management practice for the subsea pipelines influenced by mic javaherdashti and alasvand 2019b the first two management practices are assumed that they are already considered in the pipeline installation it is known as a method to prevent or at least limit internal contamination the cathodic protection and coatings would be the least difficult most economically friendly and proficiently and preventively proactive to deal with mic skovhus et al 2017 the majority of offshore pipelines have coatings the fusion bonded epoxy fbe is the most popular applied coating for north america orazem 2014 cathodic protection systems are divided into two methods i the sacrificial anode and ii the impressed current system in the latter an external dc current is used to cathodically polarize the pipeline this method of cathodic protection can be used to protect bare or poorly coated pipelines because of high current capacity in the majority of subsea pipelines the sacrificial anode technique is used as a first practice continuous injecting inhibitors are evaluated mic inhibitors are those chemicals that influence anodic chromates cro4 2 nitrites no2 phosphate and molybdate cathodic zinc salts znso4 polyphosphates na4p2o7 and phosphonates or both types of reactions polyphosphates phosphates silicates and benzotriazole to considerably reduce the rate of corrosion in this case mic chugh et al 2020 the selection of mic inhibitor is a difficult task for subsea industries as different types of aspects need to be taken into consideration such as but not limited to partitioning effect compatibility of mic inhibitors and other injected chemicals the composition of produced water the content of co2 and or h2s for example sonke and grimes 2016 2017 inhibitors can control mic in three ways i increasing the anodic or cathodic polarization behavior ii reducing the movement or diffusion of ions to the metallic surface and iii increasing the electrical resistance of the metallic surface inhibitors can be generally classified as passivating inhibitors cathodic inhibitors precipitation inhibitors organic inhibitors volatile corrosion inhibitors in the subsea industry three types of chemical injection are typically used as inhibitors 1 hydrate inhibition 2 paraffin inhibitors and 3 asphaltene inhibitors bai and bai 2010 in this study a value of 80 for inhibitor efficiency is considered and assumed that the efficiency of inhibitors would be present in the system at the required dosage through the entire pipeline in such cases the efficiency of the inhibitor is considered in mechanistic model in which parent node leading to rate of mic and further pit depth growth are updated as an example if a management practice has a specific target such as biofilm the efficiency of the practice could improve the target parent node to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 9 shows the efficiency of selected inhibitors on the pit depth growth path as a second practice continuous injecting biocide is evaluated biocides mean the killer of those living things which may endorse the mitigation mechanism of mic the biocides can be single or a mixture of two or more compounds to kill microbes nace 2006 to select the biocides in subsea industries it is necessary to consider the following issues i selectivity against target microbes ii biodegradability and iii effectiveness in the presence of different chemical compounds such as inhibitors the biocides can be categorized into two classes oxidizing and non oxidizing biocides the oxidizing biocides such as chlorine chlorinating compounds chlorine dioxide and bromine are used in water systems the non oxidizing biocides use synthetic molecules which can be used in different environmental conditions in addition this type of biocide can reduce hydrocarbon contents formaldehyde glutaraldehyde quaternary amine substances carbamates metronidazole and isothiazolone which all have advantages and disadvantageous are the common biocides in subsea industries among all industry based biocides as an example formaldehyde is economical but it is carcinogenic large quantities are needed and combines with ammonia oxygen scavengers and hydrogen sulfide in this study formaldehyde ch2o h cho is considered for evaluation since it is economical and adequate for desulfo based microorganism srb category and sra category cheung and beech 1996 dawson 2010 which together constitute approximately 60 of available microbes in the system in this study a value of 60 for laboratory based biocide efficiency is considered since it can have efficiencies in the field of 99 9 dawson 2010 it also assumed that formaldehyde would be present in the system at the required dosage through the entire pipeline to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within mcmc method is utilized fig 10 shows the efficiency of selected inhibitors on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 as a third practice launching periodical pigging is evaluated periodical pigging as a mechanical strategy is a way of mic mitigation in pipelines a mechanical pig is used to clean garbage from the interior portion of the pipeline and can be used for investigation purposes its mechanism is removing a piece of the biofilm and keeping solid particles javaherdashti 2008 according to the laboratory study the efficiency of pigging in the rate of mic is approximately 65 mand et al 2019 fig 11 shows the efficiency of periodically launching pig within 3 years on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 as a fourth practice biological treatment is evaluated the biological treatment is using a different type of bacteria against the primary bacteria responsible for mic javaherdashti and alasvand 2019b several attempts have been made to use nitrate reducing bacteria nrb fighting against srb subsea industries two examples of methods for nrb against srb are i bio competitive exclusion and ii bio augmentation nitrate induce the heterotrophic nrb hnrb sulfide oxidizing nrb so nrb development as nrb the hnrb fights against srb to obtain a similar carbon variant the so nrb are autotrophs and do not compete for srb for electrons donation dichristina 1994 nemati et al 2001 a study demonstrated that the practicability of persevering with nrb as a treatment for mic mitigation can reduce the rate of mic up to 40 bÃ¸dtker et al 2008 in the presence of biocides and 50 without the presence of biocides sunde et al 2004 to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within mcmc method is utilized fig 12 shows the efficiency of nrb with and without biocides on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 as a fifth practice manipulating operational parameters including ph temperature and fluid velocity are evaluated in literature scholars have made numerous efforts to determine the optimum ph value to reduce the rate of corrosion javaherdashti 1999 in a laboratory study the rate of corrosion for carbon steel coupled with the influence of srb have been studied ismail et al 2014 the obtained results suggest that the value of ph 6 5 can highly influence the rate of corrosion because of the presence of sulfates within bacterial activities thus the optimum value of ph is considered in the mechanistic model fig 6 to update the model to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 13 shows the effect of the optimum value of ph on the pit depth growth path according to equation 4 the parameter temperature also highly influences corrosion behavior the pit depth growth path is a function of temperature and it can be concluded that it would increase with temperature according to melchers studies the temperature in value of 17 5 has influenced the lowest rate of corrosion and further metal loss melchers 1994 thus the optimum value of 17 5 is considered for the temperature in the mechanistic model fig 6 in order to update the model to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 13 shows the effect of the optimum value of ph on the pit depth growth path according to equation 4 the parameter velocity also has a high influence on corrosion behavior the pit depth growth path is a function of velocity and melchers reported that the velocity nonlinearly increases the rate of corrosion melchers 2004 the higher level of velocity increases the rate of corrosion according to the study of soares et al 2011 the minimum value velocity of 0 1 m s has the maximum effect on the rate of corrosion in the marine environment 0 12 mm yr thus to update the model the optimum value of 0 1 m s is considered for the velocity in the mechanistic model fig 6 to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 13 shows the effect of optimum value of ph on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 in the last practice replacement and repair of the corroded pipeline are evaluated it is considered that once the maximum pit depth growth path reaches 80 of wall thickness replacement methods such as grouted clamp coupling sleeve cladding welding etc are required to evaluate the replacement as can be seen in fig 14 three defects i 1 2 3 through the pipeline with the different indications of pit depth growth are considered as can be seen the replacement point of maximum pit depth would be in year 18 replacement is done by using double block isolation tools installed locally on both sides of the defect having maximum depth and depressurizing the entire section of the pipeline to allow safe removal and repair by installing a new pipeline section after installing a new section the defect having maximum pit depth has disappeared and defect 2 will have maximum pit depth growth and is predicted to need a replacement at year 22 in addition repair such as grouted clamp can be used instead of the replacement method assuming that the grouted clamp can increase the thickness of the pipeline up to 50 subsequently pit depth growth will sharply decrease and defect 2 will have maximum pit depth growth the pit depth growth considering the replacement and repair for defect 1 is depicted in fig 15 in step six of our proposed framework the efficiency of all singular management practice as well as different combinations in several time slices are considered thus the best management practice would be based on optimum operational parameters ph temperature and velocity injecting nrb and biocide into the system at the required dosage in addition to launching periodical pig in order for the pipeline to survive for 40 years as can be seen in fig 16 the period of launching pig increases to 5 years instead of 3 years as before and the last pigging would be in year 30 in addition if the pipeline still needs to be in operational condition replacement and repair can be applied and the second defect monitored within maximum pit depth growth up to this point a management practice was proposed at the time of installation of the pipeline to be in an operational condition for at least 40 years subsequently in line inspection tools are assumed to be used to update the pit depth growth path over a period by input information into the mic mechanistic model therefore once the new information related to behavior of corrosion is collected the pit depth growth path would be updated and accordingly a management practice may be changed in the first case scenario the in line inspection tool is launched into the pipeline in year 3 considering the measurement error of the in line inspection tool al amin et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the actual pit depth of the defect is estimated as an example 35 wt mic rate as an example 0 9 mm yr and biofilm thickness high as can be seen from fig 17 using new data as input into hba the pipeline will fail by the end of year 7 this sharp increase in the pit depth growth may be the result of the breakdown of the internal coating considering injection of nrb and biocide are in a highly effective manner immediate launching pigging can be utilized according to this practice the pipeline can operate for the extra few years observing the efficiency of pigging it is continued annually until year 13 with the pipeline close to failure point according to this point repair and replacement methods have been applied in years 13 and 19 respectively thus the pipeline will work under operational conditions for a longer time in the second scenario following the previous scenario another in line inspection tool is launched in the pipeline in year 5 the actual pit depth of the defect is estimated as an example 55 wt mic rate as an example 1 6 mm yr and biofilm thickness high as can be seen from fig 18 using new data as input into hba the pipeline will fail in the middle of year 6 according to the pit depth growth path the proposed management practice seems to be ineffective therefore the replacement of that area should be considered after replacement in year 6 the proposed management practice is continued 4 conclusions this paper presents individual pit depth growth characterization using a bayesian model the pit depth growth of an active corrosion defect influenced by mic was considered to observe a power law path the power law function parameters are obtained using hba based on the different effective operational and environmental factors and material properties the mcmc method was utilized to perform the bayesian updating and statistical inferences of the model parameters the application of the proposed model was demonstrated in a subsea pipeline currently in service the parameters of the pit depth growth model were developed for an internal corrosion defect influenced by mic the pit depth growth path for a period until reaching the failure point was estimated accordingly different types of management practices to prevent control and mitigate mic for the defect were proposed the effectiveness of each management practice and the their combination were evaluated thus the best and optimum management practice was selected moreover hba can incorporate the value of the parameters that affect pit depth growth as distribution which shows its effectiveness in dealing with data uncertainty compared with conventional methods considering the ability to update probability in cbn and dependency between the parameters it can adequately deal with the traditional methods limitation and reduce model uncertainty during the study however some important challenges have arisen these are necessary to mention and can be improved in further studies firstly the growth of an individual internal defect is assumed to be influenced by mic while multiple defects interactions need to be considered as much more practical second there is a lack of information to understand corrosion growth behaviours under the combination of management practice thus this requires further laboratory based studies lastly in the current study the cost which is an important factor for management strategies is not considered this can be regarded as a future research activity in addition the robustness of the proposed model can be further validated once new information from pigging becomes available credit authorship contribution statement mohammad yazdi conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

occurs when a microbial community is involved in the degradation of an asset e g pipelines it is widely recognized as a significant cause of hazardous hydrocarbon release and subsequently fires explosions and economic and environmental impacts this paper presents a new mic management methodology the proposed methodology assists in accurately monitoring mic activity and accordingly develop strategies to manage it the mic monitoring and management activities are achieved using continuous bayesian network cbn technique with hierarchical bayesian analysis hba the integration of hba and cbn helps overcome the bayesian network s discrete value limitations bn and source to source uncertainty for each node in the network the methodology can provide the precise value of parameters such as failure probability and mic occurrence rate which are verified using observed data the application of the methodology is demonstrated on a subsea pipeline the study provides a better understanding of the influencing factors of mic rate and failure probability this assists in developing effective mic management strategies keywords safety management subsea pipeline uncertainty pipeline markov chain monte carlo method bayesian analysis 1 introduction microbiologically influenced corrosion mic also known as biocorrosion is a significant threat to asset integrity in most industries especially in oil and gas industrial sectors taleb berrouane et al 2018 technol and gu 2012 xu et al 2016 because of their activities based on metabolites mic is caused by microbial biofilms where their activities reflect in reservoir souring and asset deterioration gu et al 2019 ibrahim et al 2018 as industrial assets age mic becomes a common risk factor leading to an accident e g fluid flooding leakage rupture etc besides mic has been extensively reported as annually causing the loss of billions of dollars in the us walsh et al 1993 mic has been attributed to approximately 10 of corrosion cases in the uk romero et al 2000 the largest prudhoe bay s oil spill occurred due to mic in 2006 ibrahim et al 2018 and alaskan pipeline leakage was caused by microbial activities staying with the aforementioned introduction performing mic management is therefore vital whereby operators can use quantitative semi quantitative and qualitative models to support decision making to manage corrosion mic management underlying the idea of corrosion management approaches should employ the key factors of recently introduced corrosion management systems cms morshed 2011 to make sure that all required mic preventives control and mitigative actions are performed in a sustainable well established and effective manner lund et al 2017 skovhus et al 2018 three main steps need to be considered in any corrosion management approach i understanding the mic threat mechanism and how it affects the assets ii recognizing and performing an appropriate management practice and iii monitoring the management practices to examine whether the practices are effective or need further modifications lund et al 2017 skovhus et al 2016 these steps are taken into account based on cms procedures on a daily weekly monthly and annual basis thus corrosion management in general and mic specifically can be viewed as a supporting program in which management practice is presented and facilitated it should be highlighted that mic management in an ongoing and continuous process since mic is known as an asset integrity threat which further increases the operational risk therefore mic management has to follow the iso 31000 iso 31000 risk management 2009 framework on risk management there are a considerable number of corrosion management programs based on the reliability availability of assets proposed by both the academic and industrial sectors over the past few decades these management programs are typically categorized into different classes namely i calculating the failure probability of asset pipeline over a period before and after launching in line inspection and cleaning tools ii repairing the defect if required iii optimizing the periodic schedule of in line inspection tools to determine the defects and corresponding sizes of the defects iv manipulating operational parameters v using chemical compounds e g inhibitors and biocides vi applying coating and cathodic protection and combination of the classes gomes et al 2013 gomes and beck 2014 javaherdashti and alasvand 2019a teixeira et al 2008 zhang and zhou 2014 zhao et al 2009 zhou 2010 2011 the pit depth growth models play an important role in proposing a corrosion management practice to approximate the failure probability of the pipeline as a function of time predicting the remaining strength of the pipeline as well as examining the defect s location and determining the efficiency of each management practice this is why utilizing the data collected from pipeline history over time is essential for the industry to develop a pit depth growth model in a much more realistic way in literature pit depth growth models can be developed by using conservative and non conservative techniques the latter may lead to critical defects being overlooked by the management practice and increase the occurrence of serious consequences on the other hand the conservative pit depth growth models will increase the uncertainty of management practice zhang et al 2014 developing a mechanistic model for pit depth growth models is an intrinsically complex process as it may include two types of variables namely temporal and spatial the temporal variables are defined as the pit depth growth path of a defect that varies over time while the spatial variables are defined as the pit depth growth path of more than one defect however all variables may be correlated the probabilistic pit depth growth model is widely used in the literature as random variables and stochastic based models it simply means that the pit depth growth is considered to follow a linear or power law function of time ahammed 1998 ahammed and melchers 1996 teixeira et al 2008 zhang and zhou 2014 zhou 2010 2011 as an example the growth of a corrosion defect is characterized by utilizing the markov process and a gamma distribution with a shape and scale parameter as time variant and time invariant respectively noortwijk 2009 noortwijk et al 2007 pandey et al 2009 a gamma process is employed to characterize corrosion growth of the multiple defect maes and dann 2007 a non homogenous markov process is used for pit growth according to the experimental data for aluminum maes and dann 2007 a non homogenous markov process is also used by caleyo et al 2009 valor and caleyo 2007 to characterize the pitting corrosion in which weibull distribution is assumed for corrosion initiation time a power law function of time is considered to model the parameters in transition probability in another study the time dependent transition intensities were examined by collecting the pipeline defect information with in line inspection tools hong 1999 however there are significant challenges associated with modeling the pit growth by adopting markov process based models i selecting a transition probability function and the sufficient numbers of damage state ii using data from in line inspection tools introduces the uncertainties as well as errors and iii facing the spatial correlation between the defects this is why the bayesian based methodologies are robust and powerful tools utilizing data for pit depth growth modeling as an example hierarchical bayesian methodology and dynamic bayesian networks by incorporating new data have been used to analyze the deterioration mechanistic model of corrosion and updating the parameters in the model palencia et al 2019 teixeira et al 2019 xiang and zhou 2018 zhang and weng 2020 the hierarchical bayesian analysis hba is utilized to model the pit growth in the pipeline zhang et al 2014 researchers used a non homogenous gamma process to derive the probability distribution for the parameters within multiple defects in another study al amin et al 2014 developed a pit depth growth model for a specific defect using hba based on the data obtained from the in line inspection tools a hierarchical bayesian framework was developed by qin et al 2015 to model defect generation and growth of metal deterioration in oil and gas steel pipelines pesinis and tee 2018 proposed a framework to estimate corrosion based failure probabilities of underground natural gas pipelines and corrosion growth defects by using a hierarchical bayesian model a hierarchical bayesian model based on a non homogeneous gamma process is proposed considering the operational conditions of a pipeline over a period of time groth 2019 zhang and wang zhang and weng 2020 used a bayesian network bn to construct a knowledge based model by analyzing the failure probability and leakage size of corrosion for an underground gas pipeline however in all aforementioned studies there is a lack of comprehensive pit depth growth modelling considering both model and data uncertainties which further helps on site operators to make decisions by proposing a management practice therefore to deal with the lack of previous studies cbn along with hba can be used cbn which can be considered as an extension of typical bn song et al 2017 is a powerful tool and can handle model uncertainty using adaptive models in addition cbn by utilizing continuous nodes can better reflect those variables that change continuously in nature cbn and its extensions have been broadly used such as but not limited to the field of safety reliability and risk management hossain et al 2019 kabir et al 2018 2020 khakzad et al 2013 misuri et al 2018 hba is also a robust technique to deal with different sources of information known as data uncertainty in safety reliability and risk management domains the existing data is generally inadequate to conduct analysis especially modeling the pit depth growth where improper modeling causes pipeline failure thus to obtain acceptable results to support decision making hba utilizes and then aggregates a wide range of information in addition in recent years the availability of markov chain monte carlo mcmc using a sampling application can help decision makers to fully track performing hba kelly and smith 2009 khakzad et al 2014b siu and kelly 1998 yang et al 2012 the contribution of this study is threefold the first contribution is in providing cbn along with hba in one methodology framework for mic management thus the proposed framework takes into account both model and data uncertainty second is in developing a new mechanistic model for pit depth growth under the influence of mic and third is using the bayesian based model over a period of time to propose the optimum and best management practices the organization of the paper is presented as follows in sections 2 and 3 the preliminaries of cbn and hba are explained respectively in section 4 a framework is proposed to manage mic considering both types of model and data uncertainties in section 5 a corroded pipeline is studied as a case study to demonstrate the application of the developed methodology in the final section a conclusion challenges of the current study and direction for upcoming research are provided 1 1 continuous bayesian network the bn has enough capacity to analyze the behavior of each node over time given new data making it one of the most powerful and robust tools common bn based approaches have been widely used in different engineering domains such as but not limited to abimbola et al 2016 adesina et al 2020 arzaghi et al 2018 noroozi et al 2013 taleb berrouane et al 2020 yazdi et al 2020 zarei et al 2019 zinetullina et al 2019 bn based approaches can employ different types of input data objective or subjective to estimate the probability centered event by reducing the model uncertainty with consideration of interdependency between all the participating nodes however the common bn based models ignore the preciseness and modeling flexibility since the discrete nodes are used in the models in other words the common bn based approaches consider the continuous nature of causal factors in the network as discrete variables therefore these types of estimations provides uncertainty during the analysis process adumene et al 2020a 2020b 2020c bhandari et al 2015 xia et al 2018 yazdi et al 2019 zarei et al 2020 in real world applications there are often variables that continuously change over time and therefore cannot be modeled using common bn based models with discrete variables such is the case for mic to deal with the abovementioned drawbacks the common bn based approaches can be further developed as a cbn considering the continuous causal factors in cbn the nodes of the models can be represented as a combination of discrete and continuous variables to see how cbn can be constructed from a common bn based model guozheng et al song et al 2017 proposed a framework to convert bn into the cbn according to this study two significant changes are required so that the parental nodes can quantitatively signify the child nodes first of all all nodes with a continuous nature in bn based modes must be defined by employing measurable variables next the child nodes value in cbn needs to be represented as a function of the parental nodes value this simply means that the conditional probability tables cpts in the common bn based models are transferred into the conditional probability distributions or mathematical functions that represent the relationships between the value of the child and parental nodes in cbn the computation of posterior distribution becomes much more complex and therefore the analytical methods or monto carlo simulations cannot compute the posterior distributions markov chain monto carlo mcmc is a robust tool and has high level capacity to compute the complicated posterior distribution with high dimensions to elaborate mcmc has two main parts i monto carlo and ii markov chain monto carlo refers to a method that relies on the generation of random numbers and markov chain refers to a sequence of numbers in which each number depends on the previous number in the sequence however monto carlo simulations fail to sample from the complicated distribution which has different types of dependent variables to handle this issue markov chain is used to assist monto carlo and therefore mcmc is utilized to obtain more details about mcmc and its algorithms one can refer to gilks 1996 1 2 hierarchical bayesian analysis simply put bayesian analysis is one of the main elements of the bayesian methods that deal with the unknown parameters of a mechanistic process as random variables instead of using deterministic values the bayesian analysis makes use of prior knowledge about the mechanistic process parameters which may be derived from expert opinion past experience and information from previous research studies subsequently the prior knowledge is adjusted based on the newly observed data to update the opinions about the parameters of a mechanistic model furthermore the updated belief can then be considered as the prior distribution for updating in the future as the new data becomes obtainable thus by repeating this process the data uncertainty about the parameters of the mechanistic model is reduced hierarchical bayesian analysis hba banerjee et al 2014 is a unique case of the bayesian methods in which the prior distribution is disjointed into the conditional distribution sequentially robert 2007 hba is a powerful tool for making statistical inferences about the parameters of the mechanistic model in which there are complicated interactions between the parameters in addition hba is principally appropriate for population where the model s parameters described as a sample in the population are measured to be associated with the parameters for another sample from the same population al amin et al 2014 demichelis et al 2006 let it be assumed that there is a population of n random variable y i 1 1 2 3 n which can describe similar mechanistic processes consider that there is a set of unknown parameters where Î¸ i denotes the probability distribution of a random variable y i the prior distribution p Î¸ i Ï can be assigned to Î¸ i in which p Î¸ i Ï signifies the pdf of Î¸ i and is conditioned on the known parameters Ï and are considered to be common to the population of y i moreover let it be us assumed that y i denotes a set of observed data for y i the updated opinion of Î¸ i can be obtained using bayes theorem fenton and neil 2013 by combining the prior distribution and the observed data in the following equation 1 p Î¸ i y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï p y i l y i Î¸ i is the known likelihood function is based on the information provided by the data which is conditional on Î¸ i besides the entity p Î¸ i Ï is called the posterior distribution which reflects the combination information of prior information and obtained new data the quantity p y i is the normalizing constant which confirms that the left hand side of equation 1 is a probability distribution the p Î¸ i y i integrates to be unity and is known as the marginal likelihood which can further be determined by integrating the numerator on the right hand side of equation 1 regarded as Î¸ i therefore the following equation can be derived 2 p y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï d Î¸ i keeping the normalization constant in mind using proportionality symbol equation 1 can be rewritten as 3 p Î¸ i y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï the abovementioned explanations are based on standard bayesian formulations where it is assigned a prior distribution into the parameter Î¸ i by controlling the distribution y i however the standard bayesian formulations can be further developed by considering that the parameter Ï which controls the distribution of Î¸ i is a random variable as well by assigning the prior distribution p Ï Ï into the Ï according to this extension the p Ï Ï is named as hyper prior and Ï in named as hyper parameter banerjee et al 2014 robert 2007 in addition the hyper parameter can be known and can present the prior belief about Ï in practice Ï can be also be treated as random variables and proceed to the next level of hierarchy as can be seen from fig 1 modified after banerjee et al 2014 the simple graphical structure of a common hbn of extended bayesian model is provided therefore the extended bayesian model can be summarized as follows i likelihood of data l y i Î¸ i ii first stage of prior p Î¸ i Ï iii second stage of prior p Ï Ï iv posterior distribution of Î¸ i p Î¸ i y i l y i Î¸ i p Î¸ i Ï v posterior distribution of Ï p Ï Î¸ i l Î¸ 1 Î¸ 2 Î¸ n Ï p Ï Ï in such cases hba can be defined in four levels due to the fact that level one is based on inspection data i e the defect depths described by inspections which are connected to measurement uncertainties level two highlights the auxiliary variables including the actual depths at the times of inspections and increments of the actual depths between two consecutive inspections level two also makes the likelihood function for the measured depth mathematically tractable and facilitates the bayesian updating in level three the parameters for level two are provided e g the parameters in gamma distributions and finally in level four hyperparameters assist in finding out the parameters in level three it should be added that based on the type of decision making problem the level can be increased or shortened by studying the literature and with the support of decision makers such as but not limited to al amin et al 2014 el gheriani et al 2016 el gheriani et al 2017 khakzad et al 2014a 2014b and to the best of the authors understanding some of the merits of hba compared to other statistical models can be highlighted as following i hba enables one to deal with the source to source uncertainties by utilizing the hierarchical prior assignment thus the feature of hba makes a robust estimation of the parameters in which the posterior results are based on the average from different possible prior options robert 2007 ii hba using the conditional hierarchical priors can better describe the spatiotemporally space time correlated data congdon 2020 iii the computations of the bayesian model are commonly simplified by the hierarchical structure within posterior distribution simplification this results from priors decomposition thus different sampling algorithms can be employed to update the parameters banerjee et al 2014 congdon 2020 robert 2007 iv in hba a specific group or singular parameter can derive information from the equivalent of the parameters ntzoufras 2011 thus the level of singular inference can be obtained as precisely as possible and shows its merits when the observed data and sample size are small to characterize the pit depth for a single mic defect of a subsea pipeline hba using inferences is practically advantageous since the information that is linked to give defect is commonly limited the mean standard deviation and other probabilistic characteristics of random variables which are entered in hba can be determined by integrating and combining the posterior distribution however there is a lack of close form solutions to obtain the posterior distribution when the bayesian network has high dimensions and is complex therefore similar to the cbn mentioned in preliminary 2 the difficulties can be handled using mcmc techniques in the mcmc methods a markov chain is initially constructed to consider the start values of the parameters and subsequently converges to the posterior distribution which is actual target density it should be added that the sample is dependent on the start value therefore the influence of the start value needs to be reduced by ignoring the first part of the sample this period is referred to as the burning in period the burning in period is the time it takes the chains to be stabilized which means therefore that there is not up and down drifting over time by ignoring the sample in the burning in period afterward the sample can be used for bayesian inference of the parameters there are some important algorithms that are commonly utilized to perform an mcmc such as but not limited to metropolis random walk hastings slice sampling and gibbs s sampling to get more details about mcmc methods and corresponding algorithms one can refer to the following references banerjee et al 2014 congdon 2020 ntzoufras 2011 robert 2007 2 methodology it is important to predict the rate of mic as well as pit depth growth in the early stage of subsea pipeline development to provide appropriate management practice s which can prevent mitigate and control the occurrence of pipeline failure caused by mic however mic management is a challenging task for decision makers due to a lack of information in probabilistic risk analysis the rate of mic and pit depth growth can be estimated by utilizing modeling techniques such as bayesian network such bayesian network modeling techniques have a number of shortfalls which result from some degree of uncertainty as can be seen from fig 2 the proposed six step methodology enables consideration of both types of data and model uncertainties by modeling cbn and hba in the proposed methodology cbn and hba can deal with the model and data uncertainties respectively step 1 constructing the mechanistic model of mic in this step mechanistic modelling of individual pit initiation influenced by mic is developed the mechanistic model considers the type of corrosion which in our case is mic chemical material type alloy composition mechanic characteristics of the system e g subsea onshore and effective environmental and operational conditions this can further lead but is not limited to the rate of corrosion material strength properties depth and width of the pits and remaining age of the pipeline once all potential factors impacting on the mic are identified the bn tool is further developed to consider the relationship between different parameters in the mic mechanistic model step 2 collecting all the required information the related data for each node in developed bn are obtained from different sources including different industrial sectors operational conditions various regions or subjective opinions from experts in the field because the nodes in bn can be defined by combination of both discrete and continuous variables cbn is therefore used instead of bn collecting data is the key step in any kind of statistical inference data can be defined as an observation value in a stochastic domain which may have different sources of uncertainty however assessing evaluating manipulating and organizing any form of data is referred as information knowledge in its general form is assembled from the information the inference is referred to as the process of obtaining a conclusion according to what is known for us kelly and smith 2009 in addition once all required data information is collected they are further processed into the intervals to approximate their probabilities for identified ranges therefore the predicted probabilities can be used as input data for the cbn model the cbn similarly to the bn can deal with model uncertainty step 3 utilizing hierarchical bayesian analysis to deal with data uncertainty as mentioned in preliminary 3 hba is used to derive the probability of each node in cbn after collecting the relevant data for each node from different sources the likelihood function of continuous nodes is specified for each data set according to the type of aggregated data as an example if the number of observed variables is collected in a specific period the poisson likelihood function can be used to model the data set thereafter the hierarchical model can be structured as the following x i poisson Î» i t i as likelihood function Î» i gamma Î± Î² as the first state of prior Î± gamma 0 0001 0 0001 diffusive hyperprior Î² gamma 0 0001 0 0001 diffusive hyperprior according to this point hba provides a posterior distribution for the parameter of interest which is probability in addition probability reflects the mean and reliable intervals the mean value signifies the most fitting value for the interested parameter the obtained distribution denotes source to source uncertainties in the interested parameter and therefore can be used as a prior information distribution when new information becomes available thus hba correctly deals with data uncertainty step 4 estimating the rate of mic and pit depth growth once all the probabilities of each node to be used in the developed cbn are obtained the pit depth growth can be estimated firstly the probability of parental nodes in cbn will be used as a prior belief to estimate the probability of pit depth growth secondly the probability of each node will be updated given new information through the probability propagation or reasoning process moreover cbn enables the setting of evidence in the network at any stage hence the posterior distribution estimated by hba is considered as an informative prior distribution thereafter the obtained informative prior distribution is used to update the probability of the nodes using probability reasoning processes the cbn is then updated the model completely to compute the pit depth growth over time it is assumed that the actual depth of an mic defect follows a power law path it is further assumed that the parameters of power law growth are constant by time and quantified for each specific defect therefore it is also considered that the pit depth growths of different defects are spatially independent according to the power law path model the pit depth growth of the defect i at time j can be estimated in the following equation al amin et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 4 d a i j a i t j t 0 i b i Î· i j where the parameter a i a i 0 is an indication of pit depth growth for defect i in one year from the initiation time of defect the parameter t j is the proceed time elapse time in a year from installation date until time j as the reorganization of a defect the parameter t 0 i represents the mic initiation time the proceed time from installation date to the time when defect i starts to grow in practice t 0 i t j the parameter b i b i 0 denotes the mic rate of growth path in which b i 0 b i 0 and b i 1 representthe linear acceleration and deceleration pit depth growth path respectively Î· i j denotes the model error of the pit depth growth connected with defect i at time j in practice there is no date for the specific defect until the first launch of an in line inspection tool thus hba using prior distribution are considered for the parameters the truncated normal distribution is allocated for the prior distribution of the parameter a i due to the fact that it should be positive in addition selecting a normal distribution provides better computational stability as well as enhancing the efficiency of the model the parameter b i is approximated with respect to the mechanistic model of mic the prior distribution of the parameter t 0 i is assumed to be uniformly distributed in interval zero and t 1 since t 1 is the elapsed time from installation until the reorganization of a defect using observation inspection tools etc the parameter Î· i j as the model error for the defect i at time j is considered to be normal distribution having a value of mean equal to zero which means that the power law model is considered to be on average unbiased for each defect therefore the prior distribution of three parameters a i t 0 i and Î· i j i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 n are represented as the following equations 5a a i n Î¼ a Ï a 2 5b t o i u 0 t 1 5c Î· i j n i Î¼ a Ï Î· i 2 in which all above mentioned distributions are identically distributed and independent n x y represents the normal distribution with mean and variance of x and y respectively u l x u y denotes a uniform distribution having a lower and upper bound of l x and u y respectively the parameter Î· i j is considered to be independent and identically distributed for a given defect i in a different time slice in addition the parameter Î· i j is considered to be independent at a given time the parameter Î· i j for different defects the prior distribution of parameter of b i is obtained from the mic mechanistic model using cbn the prior distribution parameters for a i and Î· i j are assigned another level of prior named hyper prior as they deal with the random variables to treat the random variables the normal and inverse gamma distributions are considered for mean Î¼ a and standard deviation Ï a 2 and Ï Î· i 2 as prior distributions respectively the normal and inverse gamma distributions are well known conjugate priors of a normal distribution and using conjugate priors further provides posterior distributions without numerical integration zhang and zhou 2014 keeping the above mentioned explanations the hyper priors can be defined as the following 6a Î¼ a n a b 6b Ï a 2 i g c d 6c Ï Î· i 2 i g e f where i g x y denotes the probability density function of inverse gamma distribution with shape and scale factors x and y respectively the parameters a b c d e and f are named as hyper priors of the model and are considered to be known using non informative distribution in addition as mentioned earlier the Î¼ Î· i is assumed to be zero the fully hierarchical bayesian model for pit depth growth is established in fig 3 with respect to the aforementioned hyper priors step 5 performing sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is carried out to study how the output uncertainty of the pit depth growth model can be separated into the different sources of input uncertainties saltelli 2002 in addition sensitivity analysis helps to validate the model by using different methods such as but not limited to the conditional variances first path conditional variances second path higher order sensitivity indices total effects etc to obtain more details one can refer to saltelli et al 2008 mic case is a highly complex process and as a result relationships between inputs and outputs in the model are not easy to follow therefore sensitivity analysis helps decision makers to see how changing or a combination of input parameters impacts the output according to this point in this study a sensitivity analysis is performed to provide valuable information for the next step to propose the best and optimum management practice step 6 proposing the best and optimum management practice once sensitivity analysis is performed from the previous step the behavior vitiation of each root parameter with the pit depth growth path will be obtained over a period of time in addition as mentioned earlier applying each management program with respect to its corresponding characteristics has an identified effect on the pit depth growth path by comparing all possible management programs including each practice as well as a combination of them we can select the optimum management practices in each time slice 3 application to a case study the proposed methodology is applied to an apl 5l grade x42 subsea hydrocarbon transition pipeline which is highly suspect of internal mic and is required to be in operational condition for at least 40 years the pipeline carries co mingled fluids from a different number of subsea resources according to the first step of the developed methodology the mechanistic model of maximum pit depth growth influence by mic appears in fig 4 the mechanistic model of mic is drawn with consideration to i environmental conditions including salinity co2 partial pressure ph o2 temperature water cut and sulphides ii operational conditions including fluid velocity and pressure iii material conditions including steel composition and carbon content iv biofilm and v exposure duration in the second step the pipeline operational data and information according to the operational environment are provided in table 1 based on the combination of discrete and continuous variables the provided data is based on literature adumene et al 2020b arzaghi et al 2018 bhandari et al 2015 bhardwaj et al 2020a 2020b dawuda et al 2021 dubois 2010 palencia et al 2019 teixeira et al 2008 2019 and mean value of continuous variables are based on operational and chemical analysis from searose fpso it is assumed that the pipeline contains multiple defects throughout the non informative distributions i e distributions with small means and very large variances are allocated as hyper priors to the pit depth growth factors a i t o i and Î· i j to obtain pit depth growth bayesian updating software such as openbugs www openbugs net using mcmc methods is utilized by 1000000 iterations within interval 2 tinning in which the estimated parameters of the growth models were then used to estimate the depth of a defect table 2 provides a chemical analysis of produced water showing the total number of microorganisms using the qpcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction method different types of microorganisms percentage as well as sulfate reduction rate srr which further means that the defect in the pipeline is influenced by mic in addition the sulfate reduction rate is used in the mechanistic model of mic to propose a management practice in this study a pit within a maximum pit depth is considered for evaluation in the third step testing data are provided from table 1 with hba as described in section 3 preliminary of hierarchical bayesian analysis which provides a probability distribution i e a predictive posterior distribution for each node in cbn as shown in fig 5 the mean value of the distributions represents an adequate value of each node after obtaining the description and probability value of all nodes in cbn it will then be used as prior belief in cbn to estimate the rate of mic and further pit depth growth as shown in fig 6 as it can be seen from fig 6 the node pit depth growth is constructed based on an equation representing that time varying characteristics of pit depth growth considered in the bn prediction mode in addition it should be highlighted that parameters such as pit indication of pit depth growth using gamma distribution represent the randomness in the bn model in the fourth step the probability of pit depth growth gained from the previous analysis can further be utilized to estimate the probability of pit depth growth over a period considering that only t j and t 0 i are varied by time fig 7 depicts the approximation of pit depth growth over a period showing mean median and 10 percent error for the fifth step sensitivity analysis is performed as a forward propagation to understand how proposing a management practice can properly prevent mitigate and control mic in addition it can increase the lifetime of the pipeline by decreasing the pit depth growth path over a period fig 8 presents the possible management practice for the subsea pipelines influenced by mic javaherdashti and alasvand 2019b the first two management practices are assumed that they are already considered in the pipeline installation it is known as a method to prevent or at least limit internal contamination the cathodic protection and coatings would be the least difficult most economically friendly and proficiently and preventively proactive to deal with mic skovhus et al 2017 the majority of offshore pipelines have coatings the fusion bonded epoxy fbe is the most popular applied coating for north america orazem 2014 cathodic protection systems are divided into two methods i the sacrificial anode and ii the impressed current system in the latter an external dc current is used to cathodically polarize the pipeline this method of cathodic protection can be used to protect bare or poorly coated pipelines because of high current capacity in the majority of subsea pipelines the sacrificial anode technique is used as a first practice continuous injecting inhibitors are evaluated mic inhibitors are those chemicals that influence anodic chromates cro4 2 nitrites no2 phosphate and molybdate cathodic zinc salts znso4 polyphosphates na4p2o7 and phosphonates or both types of reactions polyphosphates phosphates silicates and benzotriazole to considerably reduce the rate of corrosion in this case mic chugh et al 2020 the selection of mic inhibitor is a difficult task for subsea industries as different types of aspects need to be taken into consideration such as but not limited to partitioning effect compatibility of mic inhibitors and other injected chemicals the composition of produced water the content of co2 and or h2s for example sonke and grimes 2016 2017 inhibitors can control mic in three ways i increasing the anodic or cathodic polarization behavior ii reducing the movement or diffusion of ions to the metallic surface and iii increasing the electrical resistance of the metallic surface inhibitors can be generally classified as passivating inhibitors cathodic inhibitors precipitation inhibitors organic inhibitors volatile corrosion inhibitors in the subsea industry three types of chemical injection are typically used as inhibitors 1 hydrate inhibition 2 paraffin inhibitors and 3 asphaltene inhibitors bai and bai 2010 in this study a value of 80 for inhibitor efficiency is considered and assumed that the efficiency of inhibitors would be present in the system at the required dosage through the entire pipeline in such cases the efficiency of the inhibitor is considered in mechanistic model in which parent node leading to rate of mic and further pit depth growth are updated as an example if a management practice has a specific target such as biofilm the efficiency of the practice could improve the target parent node to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 9 shows the efficiency of selected inhibitors on the pit depth growth path as a second practice continuous injecting biocide is evaluated biocides mean the killer of those living things which may endorse the mitigation mechanism of mic the biocides can be single or a mixture of two or more compounds to kill microbes nace 2006 to select the biocides in subsea industries it is necessary to consider the following issues i selectivity against target microbes ii biodegradability and iii effectiveness in the presence of different chemical compounds such as inhibitors the biocides can be categorized into two classes oxidizing and non oxidizing biocides the oxidizing biocides such as chlorine chlorinating compounds chlorine dioxide and bromine are used in water systems the non oxidizing biocides use synthetic molecules which can be used in different environmental conditions in addition this type of biocide can reduce hydrocarbon contents formaldehyde glutaraldehyde quaternary amine substances carbamates metronidazole and isothiazolone which all have advantages and disadvantageous are the common biocides in subsea industries among all industry based biocides as an example formaldehyde is economical but it is carcinogenic large quantities are needed and combines with ammonia oxygen scavengers and hydrogen sulfide in this study formaldehyde ch2o h cho is considered for evaluation since it is economical and adequate for desulfo based microorganism srb category and sra category cheung and beech 1996 dawson 2010 which together constitute approximately 60 of available microbes in the system in this study a value of 60 for laboratory based biocide efficiency is considered since it can have efficiencies in the field of 99 9 dawson 2010 it also assumed that formaldehyde would be present in the system at the required dosage through the entire pipeline to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within mcmc method is utilized fig 10 shows the efficiency of selected inhibitors on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 as a third practice launching periodical pigging is evaluated periodical pigging as a mechanical strategy is a way of mic mitigation in pipelines a mechanical pig is used to clean garbage from the interior portion of the pipeline and can be used for investigation purposes its mechanism is removing a piece of the biofilm and keeping solid particles javaherdashti 2008 according to the laboratory study the efficiency of pigging in the rate of mic is approximately 65 mand et al 2019 fig 11 shows the efficiency of periodically launching pig within 3 years on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 as a fourth practice biological treatment is evaluated the biological treatment is using a different type of bacteria against the primary bacteria responsible for mic javaherdashti and alasvand 2019b several attempts have been made to use nitrate reducing bacteria nrb fighting against srb subsea industries two examples of methods for nrb against srb are i bio competitive exclusion and ii bio augmentation nitrate induce the heterotrophic nrb hnrb sulfide oxidizing nrb so nrb development as nrb the hnrb fights against srb to obtain a similar carbon variant the so nrb are autotrophs and do not compete for srb for electrons donation dichristina 1994 nemati et al 2001 a study demonstrated that the practicability of persevering with nrb as a treatment for mic mitigation can reduce the rate of mic up to 40 bÃ¸dtker et al 2008 in the presence of biocides and 50 without the presence of biocides sunde et al 2004 to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within mcmc method is utilized fig 12 shows the efficiency of nrb with and without biocides on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 as a fifth practice manipulating operational parameters including ph temperature and fluid velocity are evaluated in literature scholars have made numerous efforts to determine the optimum ph value to reduce the rate of corrosion javaherdashti 1999 in a laboratory study the rate of corrosion for carbon steel coupled with the influence of srb have been studied ismail et al 2014 the obtained results suggest that the value of ph 6 5 can highly influence the rate of corrosion because of the presence of sulfates within bacterial activities thus the optimum value of ph is considered in the mechanistic model fig 6 to update the model to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 13 shows the effect of the optimum value of ph on the pit depth growth path according to equation 4 the parameter temperature also highly influences corrosion behavior the pit depth growth path is a function of temperature and it can be concluded that it would increase with temperature according to melchers studies the temperature in value of 17 5 has influenced the lowest rate of corrosion and further metal loss melchers 1994 thus the optimum value of 17 5 is considered for the temperature in the mechanistic model fig 6 in order to update the model to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 13 shows the effect of the optimum value of ph on the pit depth growth path according to equation 4 the parameter velocity also has a high influence on corrosion behavior the pit depth growth path is a function of velocity and melchers reported that the velocity nonlinearly increases the rate of corrosion melchers 2004 the higher level of velocity increases the rate of corrosion according to the study of soares et al 2011 the minimum value velocity of 0 1 m s has the maximum effect on the rate of corrosion in the marine environment 0 12 mm yr thus to update the model the optimum value of 0 1 m s is considered for the velocity in the mechanistic model fig 6 to estimate the pit depth growth path over a period hba within the mcmc method is utilized fig 13 shows the effect of optimum value of ph on the pit depth growth path based on equation 4 in the last practice replacement and repair of the corroded pipeline are evaluated it is considered that once the maximum pit depth growth path reaches 80 of wall thickness replacement methods such as grouted clamp coupling sleeve cladding welding etc are required to evaluate the replacement as can be seen in fig 14 three defects i 1 2 3 through the pipeline with the different indications of pit depth growth are considered as can be seen the replacement point of maximum pit depth would be in year 18 replacement is done by using double block isolation tools installed locally on both sides of the defect having maximum depth and depressurizing the entire section of the pipeline to allow safe removal and repair by installing a new pipeline section after installing a new section the defect having maximum pit depth has disappeared and defect 2 will have maximum pit depth growth and is predicted to need a replacement at year 22 in addition repair such as grouted clamp can be used instead of the replacement method assuming that the grouted clamp can increase the thickness of the pipeline up to 50 subsequently pit depth growth will sharply decrease and defect 2 will have maximum pit depth growth the pit depth growth considering the replacement and repair for defect 1 is depicted in fig 15 in step six of our proposed framework the efficiency of all singular management practice as well as different combinations in several time slices are considered thus the best management practice would be based on optimum operational parameters ph temperature and velocity injecting nrb and biocide into the system at the required dosage in addition to launching periodical pig in order for the pipeline to survive for 40 years as can be seen in fig 16 the period of launching pig increases to 5 years instead of 3 years as before and the last pigging would be in year 30 in addition if the pipeline still needs to be in operational condition replacement and repair can be applied and the second defect monitored within maximum pit depth growth up to this point a management practice was proposed at the time of installation of the pipeline to be in an operational condition for at least 40 years subsequently in line inspection tools are assumed to be used to update the pit depth growth path over a period by input information into the mic mechanistic model therefore once the new information related to behavior of corrosion is collected the pit depth growth path would be updated and accordingly a management practice may be changed in the first case scenario the in line inspection tool is launched into the pipeline in year 3 considering the measurement error of the in line inspection tool al amin et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the actual pit depth of the defect is estimated as an example 35 wt mic rate as an example 0 9 mm yr and biofilm thickness high as can be seen from fig 17 using new data as input into hba the pipeline will fail by the end of year 7 this sharp increase in the pit depth growth may be the result of the breakdown of the internal coating considering injection of nrb and biocide are in a highly effective manner immediate launching pigging can be utilized according to this practice the pipeline can operate for the extra few years observing the efficiency of pigging it is continued annually until year 13 with the pipeline close to failure point according to this point repair and replacement methods have been applied in years 13 and 19 respectively thus the pipeline will work under operational conditions for a longer time in the second scenario following the previous scenario another in line inspection tool is launched in the pipeline in year 5 the actual pit depth of the defect is estimated as an example 55 wt mic rate as an example 1 6 mm yr and biofilm thickness high as can be seen from fig 18 using new data as input into hba the pipeline will fail in the middle of year 6 according to the pit depth growth path the proposed management practice seems to be ineffective therefore the replacement of that area should be considered after replacement in year 6 the proposed management practice is continued 4 conclusions this paper presents individual pit depth growth characterization using a bayesian model the pit depth growth of an active corrosion defect influenced by mic was considered to observe a power law path the power law function parameters are obtained using hba based on the different effective operational and environmental factors and material properties the mcmc method was utilized to perform the bayesian updating and statistical inferences of the model parameters the application of the proposed model was demonstrated in a subsea pipeline currently in service the parameters of the pit depth growth model were developed for an internal corrosion defect influenced by mic the pit depth growth path for a period until reaching the failure point was estimated accordingly different types of management practices to prevent control and mitigate mic for the defect were proposed the effectiveness of each management practice and the their combination were evaluated thus the best and optimum management practice was selected moreover hba can incorporate the value of the parameters that affect pit depth growth as distribution which shows its effectiveness in dealing with data uncertainty compared with conventional methods considering the ability to update probability in cbn and dependency between the parameters it can adequately deal with the traditional methods limitation and reduce model uncertainty during the study however some important challenges have arisen these are necessary to mention and can be improved in further studies firstly the growth of an individual internal defect is assumed to be influenced by mic while multiple defects interactions need to be considered as much more practical second there is a lack of information to understand corrosion growth behaviours under the combination of management practice thus this requires further laboratory based studies lastly in the current study the cost which is an important factor for management strategies is not considered this can be regarded as a future research activity in addition the robustness of the proposed model can be further validated once new information from pigging becomes available credit authorship contribution statement mohammad yazdi conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing
