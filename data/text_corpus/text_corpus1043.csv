when a large number of model runs are required to conduct history matching sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis and optimisation deep learning has shown great potential in relaxing this limitation by emulating the process based models for computational intensive application the current study investigates the feasibility of implementing deep learning emulators for a generalised flow

networks groundwater modelling contaminant transport modelling hybrid modelling 1 introduction groundwater flow and transport models are routinely applied for contamination risks assessments and remediation plan design zheng and bennett 2002 anderson et al 2015 process based reactive transport models describe the coupling of physical and chemical processes which depend on initial and boundary conditions that vary in space and time prediction relevant spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties and transient characteristics of boundary conditions require transport models to be discretised at fine scale both spatially and temporally and to be highly parameterised hunt et al 2007 depending on contaminants and hydrogeological properties transport models also need to incorporate multiple hydro chemical processes that are often computationally demanding the growing model complexity unavoidably leads to increasing model runtimes hindering the application of sophisticated modelling techniques that rely on a large number of model runs e g model calibration uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis and optimisation keating et al 2010 model emulation has been proposed in previous studies to tackle this particular issue with some success asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 an emulator is a faster running approximation of a process based model often time consuming it is also referred to a surrogate or metamodel in the literature emulators are often implemented with data driven models that can efficiently learn relationships among variables through statistical inference and machine learning ml when training data are available ml as a technique to construct emulators of process based models has shown great potential to reduce the computational burden of complex environmental models while still maintaining reasonable model accuracy asher et al 2015 cui et al 2018 razavi et al 2012 roy and datta 2018 sreekanth and datta 2015 in the past decades various techniques such as gaussian process regression support vector machine and artificial neural networks have been experimented to build emulators as a second level abstraction to alleviate the computational burden of such models existing applications of ml emulators in the context of transport modelling generally include i pump and treat remediation ii groundwater contaminant source identification and iii coastal groundwater management a brief summary of these applications under the three categories is provided in table 1 most of the previous studies focused on emulating a point based variable such as groundwater heads at a particular location to accelerate optimisation without accounting for parameter and model uncertainty although the previous studies have achieved some success the application of emulator faces challenges of scalability and accuracy when the input output relationship is highly non linear and or high dimensional the recent advancement of deep learning can potentially address some of these challenges deep learning relies on algorithms that use deep neural networks dnn artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers deep learning has exhibited superior performance and flexibility to simulate complex non linear relationships compared to traditional statistical inference and ml techniques g√©ron 2019 jiang et al 2019 ye et al 2019 however its application in groundwater transport modelling in the form of emulators remains very limited with the exception of mo et al 2019 in this recent research a dense convolutional encoder decoder network was adopted to transfer the contaminant field emulating problem to an image to image regression analysis and satisfying results were achieved with a synthetic transport model dnn is considered to be a revolutionary tool that is transforming multiple disciplines including hydrology marcais and de dreuzy 2017 shen 2018 due to its robustness and generalised prediction capacity for various regression and classification problems although numerous specific deep network structures have been proposed the following three popular classes of neural networks are sufficiently flexible in solving a vast range of problems multi layer perceptrons mlp can solve most of the classification and regression problems convolutional neural networks cnn are good at learning spatial relationships within image data which allows the model to learn positions and scales in the variant structures recurrent neural networks rnn are developed for sequence prediction such as hydrographs and are also heavily used in natural language processing in this study dnn are applied to emulate a groundwater contaminant transport model that involves advection dispersion and sorption processes the groundwater model was developed based on the hydrogeological conditions in southeast south australia where potential contamination pathways from on shore gas development and spills have been identified three types of target variables are emulated point based variables contaminant concentration at a specific location and time lumped variables objective functions used for model calibration and uncertainty analysis and multi output sequence variables breakthrough curves that describe the change of concentration over time the overall goal of the study is to explore the feasibility and performance of deep learning to emulate groundwater transport models the rest of the paper is organised into five sections the hydrogeological background is described in the study area section the development of the groundwater model and the design of the deep learning emulators are covered in the method section we then present the modelling results and some discussion on how to facilitate the application of dnn by data transformation to the target variables and heatmaps based on sensitivity analysis the paper is concluded by a summary of the important findings 2 study area the study is undertaken for an area that extends 36 km east west and 42 km north south in the south east of south australia the region has relatively flat topography characterised by limestone geology overlain by sandy soils the region has a mild temperate climate with average rainfall ranging from 480 to 780 mm yr and potential evapotranspiration ranging from 890 to 1160 mm yr regional groundwater flows from east to west with a higher eastern terrain fig 1 the area is characterised by dunes and interdunal flats from previous ocean ingression there are two major aquifers underlying this region the unconfined tertiary limestone aquifer tla and the confined tertiary confined sands aquifer tcsa the shallow tla is characterised by karstic limestone geology often referred to as the gambier limestone aquifer morgan 2015 the limestone aquifer is extensively used for irrigated agriculture stock and domestic and other uses historically the area has been waterlogged the water table in the low lying areas has been artificially lowered using agricultural drains since 1863 although the majority of drains were constructed between 1949 and 1972 a large number of lakes and wetlands are present in this region many of which are fed by groundwater inflows that maintain water levels for part or all of the year predominant land uses are dryland grazing irrigated pasture and viticulture softwood and hardwood forestry and native vegetation petroleum and conventional gas wells have been developed in the region around penola since 1987 with the commercialisation of the katnook and then the ladbroke grove fields additional gas wells have been recently built and or proposed for this region the low water table in the region makes the groundwater system relatively vulnerable to pollution from surface sources ncgrt 2016 identified that infiltration from surface spills provides a high risk of groundwater contamination a study conducted by jacobs 2016 also associated high risk with potential spills of surface contaminants migrating to the tla these concerns warrant detailed modelling analysis to quantify contamination risks the current study forms a critical component of a larger project that aims to provide a comprehensive contamination risk assessment for the study area in a probabilistic framework due to the high uncertainty in physical chemical processes and hydrogeological properties 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater models because the primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning emulators the model was designed to represent the general hydrogeological setting in the study area rather than being specifically designed for a particular location a 2d cross sectional model 3000 m wide and 105 m deep fig 2 was developed to represent the unconfined aquifer close to the petroleum wells in this study the top surface of the aquifer was assigned a fixed slope equal to 0 001 to the west surface elevations at the western and eastern boundaries are 2 m and 5 m respectively two local high permeability zones zone 1 and 2 in fig 2 were included to represent the karstic features in the aquifer the base of the aquifer was assumed to be a no flow boundary whereas the western and eastern boundaries were assigned time variant groundwater heads the transient head boundary data fig 3 a were acquired from nearby observation wells website https www waterconnect sa gov au systems gd pages default aspx transient recharge and evapotranspiration data fig 3b and 3c were sourced from the calibrated south east regional water balance model of morgan et al 2015 a unit concentration contaminant source was introduced from the top left aquifer boundary red dot in fig 2 through recharge the linear isotherm was selected to simulate the sorption process modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 and mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 were used for flow and contaminant transport modelling respectively the flow domain was discretised into 100 columns and 21 layers all of which were set as convertible layers the time variant specified head chd package the recharge package and the evapotranspiration package were used to implement the flow boundary conditions in mt3d usgs the dsp and rct package were used to implement solute dispersion and reaction mechanisms the drycell option was adopted to enable the contaminant to move in and out of the dry cells a monthly stress period was applied for a duration of 50 years from 1969 to 2019 a relatively simple parameterisation strategy was implemented for the cross section model table 2 parameter ranges for flow model parameters are primarily based on the previously calibrated regional model in the south east of south australia morgan 2015 other parameter ranges were selected based on expert knowledge and the local hydrogeological information 3 2 deep neural networks emulator deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that includes a family of algorithms using different structures of multi layer neural networks in the current study two types of them mlp and rnn were trained to approximate the non linear relationship between the parameters and outputs of the numerical models mlp was used to emulate point solute concentration and objective functions and rnn was used to emulate breakthrough curves a brief discussion is presented here to highlight the critical set up in our dnn emulators for readers who are interested in more details g√©ron 2019 provides an excellent practical and easy to follow introduction on deep learning 3 2 1 multi layer perceptrons mlp nodes in the mlp are fully connected to every node of the previous layer fig 4 a the connection weights are continuously reinforced for those that contribute to the correct prediction during the training until mlp finishes the preset iterations or until the improvement of accuracy is less than the specified threshold the computing input output relationship in each layer is given by 1 h l œÜ x l 1 w l b l where h is the output of a fully connected layer with the layer index of l x is the matrix of the previous layer s outputs one row per instance and one column per input node in layer l 1 x 0 means the matrix of inputs w is the weight matrix one row per input node in layer l 1 and one column per node in layer l b is the bias vector and œÜ is the activation function of mlp nodes rectified linear unit function œÜ z m a x 0 z was set in this study the lecun initializer lecun et al 2012 was used for the mlp emulators dropout layer with the dropout rate of 0 1 was set behind every hidden layer to regularise the neural networks to speed up the emulator training nadam optimisation dozat 2016 was applied as the optimiser for parameter learning rather than the regular gradient descent optimiser the loss function of mean square error was used batch size and training iterations were set to 30 and 1000 respectively learning rate schedule and early stopping were used as the call backs to converge to the optimum rapidly and avoid overfitting two hidden layers with 75 nodes per layer were adopted in mlp 3 2 2 recurrent neural networks rnn rnn can extract and remember the information from a sequence of inputs to produce a sequence of outputs through the memory cells backpropagation through time was used to propagate gradient back and enable updating the rnn model parameters however this algorithm is not very efficient at learning from long sequences since its memory of the first input gradually fades away rnn may also suffer the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients if they are trained with long sequences long short term memory lstm sak et al 2014 schmidhuber and hochreiter 1997 zaremba et al 2014 is one of the most popular architectures that have mitigated these limitations successfully two separate state vectors were implemented in the lstm cells a long term state vector c and a short term state vector h fig 4b at each time step during the training some memories were dropped and new memories were added to the cells more details including the computing equations can be found in the supplementary material the dropout rate and recurrent dropout rate were set to 0 1 in the lstm cells the glorot uniform initialiser glorot and bengio 2010 and orthogonal initializer saxe et al 2013 were used for kernel initialisation and recurrent initialisation three hidden layers with 75 memory cells per layer were used and other hyperparameters were the same as for the mlp structure 3 3 design of experiment doe once the model was ready design of experiments doe was conducted to sample the model space to supply training points for the emulators the first step of doe is to evaluate the model stability by randomly sampling the model space to ensure that the pre defined parameter ranges are compatible with the numerical model this should be implemented in a relatively small sample size for saving computational burden if the model fails the stability test it is because there are serious structural deficiencies or the initial parameter ranges need to be adjusted or correlations need to be taken into account during sampling the latin hypercube sampling method lhs was used in this context as it can efficiently cross the range of each sampled variable and generate a more stable input output pattern to reduce the required samples helton and davis 2003 using the lhs a total of 4080 samples were generated and simulated with the numerical model the next step is to check the quality of the simulation results biased correlation and false hypotheses may occur in the emulator if unreliable training data is used the samples with negative concentration caused by numerical error were removed which left 4000 samples remaining for emulator training and validation critical steps in the workflow of developing emulators include 1 raw data transformation 2 dnn emulator training 3 emulator prediction 4 inverse transform of predictions and 5 performance examination the overall workflow from numerical model development to emulator is given in fig s1 s hereinafter refers to the supplementary material to further improve the emulator performance four types of transformations were examined more discussion in the subsection 5 1 including standardisation transformation normalisation transformation normal quantile transformation nqt and uniform quantile transformation uqt standardisation transformation can transform any normally distributed data to a standard gaussian distribution with a mean value of 0 and variance of 1 using the equation z x Œº s normalisation transformation can transform such data to a range from 0 to 1 using the equation of z x x min x max x min nqt ranks all data first and then maps them to a normal distribution by the associated quantile function uqt is a similar transformation but maps the data to a uniform distribution nqt and uqt transformations are robust tools that could reduce the effect of marginal outliers pedregosa et al 2011 4 results 4 1 emulators of solute concentration the first emulator was trained for a point based prediction the solute concentration at observation point 10 fig 2 at time 40 years firstly the sensitivity of the ten input parameters on the emulated concentration was examined through scatterplots fig 5 fig 5a shows that k h 0 influenced solute concentration more significantly compared to the other parameters a higher k h 0 may allow earlier arrival of the contaminant to the observation location on the other hand the influence of aquifer anisotropy was not as significant in the current model configuration this can be attributed to the dominating effect of the head boundary conditions on the flow pattern and or the relative narrow parameter range of k h 0 k v 0 the moving average concentration black line in fig 5a slightly increased when s y porosity Œ± l Œ± t Œ± l and k d were increased it should be noted that a moving average might not correctly capture existing weak correlations e g larger sorption should decrease the concentration as it shows in fig s2j it seems that within the tested parameter range in fig 5 the impact of sorption is dominated by other parameters in addition the lower concentrations were closely associated with lower Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l and were also associated with larger k d fig 5h 5i and 5j respectively it implied that the smaller dispersion and larger sorption greatly aggravated the decrease of solute concentration at point 10 the relationship between point concentration and parameters should also be dependent on observation locations and time if the observation was for location 2 at earlier times in the simulation the role of Œ± l Œ± t Œ± l and k h 0 was expected to change the 4000 samples were split into a training dataset 3500 samples and a testing dataset 500 samples the splitting was conducted before any machine learning experiments to allow an objective and unbiased estimation of the emulator performance a ten fold cross validation hastie et al 2009 grid search was used to search the optimal number of hidden layers and nodes with the training dataset then the emulator was trained with these optimised hyperparameters performance examination was implemented with the test dataset input variables were normalised and a multiplier of 100 000 was used for solute concentration before the data were fed to the mlp some preliminary experiments indicated that the emulator performance was improved as the raw data of emulating targets was transformed to the range from 0 1 to 10 the concentrations from the dnn emulator were in close agreement with the results from the numerical models in the testing dataset indicated by scatterplot r squared 0 99 and rmse in fig 8a the ratio of rmse to mean concentration in the test dataset was 4 39 the scatterplot presented the higher accuracy for the samples with higher concentration because most samples were in the right side of the plot higher than 4 72 10 5 resulting in a high weight during emulator training in some application of machine learning a 0 99 r squared may indicate overfitting however it is not a critical concern for model emulation during the design of experiment parameter ranges were made large intentionally to cover the entire parameter space then essentially we are dealing with an interpolation issue rather than extrapolation please also note that r squared values in the scatterplots are only based on the test dataset the test data were saved aside for testing before we trained the emulators during the training process emulators were not allowed to see these data if there is a non realistic over fitting issue then the test data should uncover this 4 2 emulators of objective functions objective functions that define the discrepancy between observations and model outputs form a fundamental component for model calibration and uncertainty analysis cui et al 2018 demonstrated how modelling efficiency can be improved by using an emulator to substitute the objective functions for a regional groundwater flow model objective functions are considered as lumped variables that are functions of temporal and spatial information across the model domain two objective functions were emulated including one for hydraulic head and another one for solute concentration defining as follows 2 œÜ h 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m h s h o i j 2 0 5 3 œÜ c 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m c s c o i j 2 0 5 where œÜ h and œÜ c are the objective function of hydraulic head and solute concentration respectively h o and c o are the hypothetical observed historical head and concentration respectively which were randomly chosen from the available samples from the doe correspondingly h s and c s are the simulated head and concentration from the numerical model i denotes the observation point number associated with spatial distribution from 1 to n n 10 and j denotes the historical sequence data associated with temporal distribution from 1 to m m 80 data points every six months the inputs of the œÜ h emulator include parameters of modflow nwt the first 7 parameters of table 2 while the inputs of the œÜ c emulator contains all parameters in table 2 the k h 0 k h 1 and k h 2 were the major factors to the changes in œÜ h with specific yield slightly affecting the variation of œÜ h fig 6 the head objective function was not sensitive to the changes in anisotropy characterisation local horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h 1 had a positive correlation with œÜ h whereas k h 2 and specific yield had a negative correlation the non monotonic variation was found in the scatterplot of k h 0 in which the generated œÜ h went down and then up similar to the distribution of concentration prediction mentioned in the previous subsection the predominant factors for œÜ c were k h 0 specific yield porosity and k d fig 7 the tendency of a rising moving average was associated with a higher k h 0 Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l whereas the opposite trend was observed for the larger specific yield porosity and k d multipliers of 100 and 100 000 were used for the œÜ h and œÜ c emulators respectively the same hyperparameters were used for all the mlp emulators to allow a fair comparison among emulators for different types of predictions the emulated œÜ h was in good agreement with the result of the numerical model and the ratio of rmse to the mean value was 2 00 fig 8b for the more complex variable œÜ c our emulator also delivered a quite good performance with the ratio of rmse to the mean value of 3 07 fig 8c the emulator performance was better for the samples with the larger œÜ c similar to the emulated results for point based concentration 4 3 emulators of breakthrough curves except for single value predictions such as point concentration and objective functions the hydrology community is also seeking efficient prediction tools for time series such as hydrographs and breakthrough curves this type of predictions poses extra challenges for emulator training in this section we examined the feasibility of rnn as a time series emulator rnn emulator with lstm cells was developed to mimic the breakthrough curves at location 10 fig 2 with variable aquifer parameters numerical model results over 40 years were used to train the time sequence emulator with a time step length of 0 5 years as such this dataset was at least 80 times larger than that of the point solute concentration emulator an additional variable of time step counter was included in the rnn emulator this emulator costs more computational time to train a critical challenge for developing this emulator was that the raw output from the numerical models spanned over 30 orders of magnitude from 1 18 10 38 to 1 72 10 4 these data needed to be transformed to allow dnn to better perceive the correlation between input and output data with some experiments uniform quantile transformation was used for this output variable the comparison of different transformations will be given in section 5 1 the performance of this emulator was examined by comparing the simulated and emulated breakthrough curves twelve breakthrough curves were randomly selected from the test datasets the 500 samples from doe prior to training the emulator with the variations of numerical model parameters different shapes of breakthrough curves were observed roughly concentrations along the tested breakthrough curves started from 0 and rapidly crossed multiple orders of magnitude over the first 10 years after this rapid climbing the concentration fluctuated around some numbers between 1 10 5 and 1 10 4 fig 9 the results showed that the emulated breakthrough curves basically overlapped with the results from the numerical models the trends of concentration fluctuation were well learnt by the trained rnn emulator although some sections were slightly underestimated during certain times fig 9 our experiment demonstrates that rnn emulator is an extremely powerful data driven model that can be used to emulate time series of hydraulic variables the fast running and superior accuracy make it possible to use rnn emulators as substitutes for process based models for real time data assimilation e g integrating into real time monitoring or into an online management system 4 4 sample requirements and scalability sample requirements of the aforementioned emulators were further tested using r squared and rmse in the experiment 10 emulators were iteratively trained with the training samples increased from 100 to 3500 in increments of 100 while the testing samples kept at 500 the performance for a specified training sample size can be measured by the performance mean the solid lines in fig 10 and the confidence interval Œº œÉ the shaded area in fig 10 of the 10 emulators for both r squared and rmse for the point prediction of concentration the emulators based on 100 training samples had a mean r squared of 0 77 and a mean rmse of 1 48 10 5 as the increase of the training samples the performance was gradually improved as indicated by increasing r squared decreasing rmse and narrowing confidence intervals particularly when the sample size is less than 1400 a sample size of 500 delivered a reasonably high accuracy mean r squared of 0 95 and the performance was guaranteed as the training samples increased above 500 the mean r squared for the œÜ h emulators were 0 84 and 0 99 with the training samples of 100 and 1800 respectively there was no apparent improvement for additional training samples above 1800 fig 10b compared to the emulators for point concentration and œÜ h the mean r squared of the œÜ c emulators dramatically dropped when less than 300 samples were used training samples of 3100 resulted in a mean r squared of 0 99 for the œÜ c emulators fig 10c to allow a r squared of 0 99 the emulators of the concentration objective function required 1 48 and 1 72 times of the training samples used for the point concentration and head objective function respectively the sample requirement of the breakthrough curves emulator was also examined the mean r squared values were 0 74 and 0 99 when the training involved 100 and 2100 samples respectively fig 10d given the same hyperparameters adopted in the emulators for point concentration and œÜ h and œÜ c a larger required sample size indicated a more complicated input output relationship as expected the level of complexity increased from the simpler head objective function œÜ h to the point solute concentration then to the concentration objective function œÜ c although the head objective function is a lumped variable it shows that its input output relationship is relatively simpler than the point based solute concentration which involved more complex mechanisms including advection dispersion and sorption the input output relationship for the breakthrough curve was the most complicated one although the emulator showed a similar performance with the point concentration emulator our experiments also demonstrate that the sample requirements did not increase significantly from the simple point concentration emulator to more complex breakthrough curve emulator this may suggest that the dnn has a good upscaling capacity compared to other ml emulators although this needs to be further studied by comparing different model emulating techniques 4 5 emulator efficiency the primary motivation for this study was to explore the feasibility of deep learning as emulators to reduce the computational burden of contaminant transport modelling as expected more training time was required for the dnn emulators as the training data increased among the tested emulators a maximum training time of 20 min was needed to train the rnn emulator for the breakthrough curves once the emulators were trained and saved they can be reloaded rapidly for modelling in seconds on a modern personal desktop computer this represents a considerable computation time saving compared to the individual processed based model s running time of 5 min 5 discussion 5 1 effect of data transformation although it is a standard practice to scale transform the input variables target variable transformation is not commonly applied for regression machine learning however concentrations from the transport model that can span tens of orders of magnitude pose some unique challenges for the dnn emulators a common practice in groundwater modelling is to ignore the concentrations below a pre defined threshold such as 0 01 mg l the emergence of some new contaminants that are toxic even at very low concentration such as pfas makes this traditional practice no longer appropriate discarding the lower marginal values or altering them to zeros might introduce bias when developing ml emulators to improve the emulator accuracy in such situation different transformations to target variables are tested note that log transformation was not used as some samples had a zero concentration the parameter range of k d was expanded for this experiment to allow a better demonstration while other parameter ranges remained unchanged in the numerical model a total of 3000 samples were newly sampled within the new k d range 0 001 m 3 k g k d 22 m 3 k g vilks 2018 as a result the concentration spanned over 30 orders of magnitude a total of 2500 samples were used for emulator training while the remaining 500 samples were saved for performance testing the emulator without transformation performed worst with a minimum and maximum concentration of 3 51 10 7 and 9 85 10 3 respectively fig 11 a the results of this emulator could only span four orders of magnitudes the emulators with standardisation transformation and normalisation transformation also seriously overestimated concentrations for the samples of less than 1 00 10 10 fig 11b and 11c both nqt and uqt transformations can improve emulator results that can vary over 30 orders of magnitude however the scatterplots showed significant underestimation from the nqt transformation fig 11d by comparison the emulator with the uqt transformation outperformed others fig 11 dramatically it was also noted that the emulator performance with uqt transformation still required improvement if the interested concentration is close to the lower bound when this need occurs an adaptive iterative sampling and training strategy siade et al 2020 could dramatically improve the emulator accuracy in summary data transformation is strongly recommended for concentration predictions when machine learning emulators are applied for contaminant transport modelling 5 2 knowledge extraction from the dnn emulator the neural networks technique is well known for its superior accuracy whereas interpreting what a dnn model has learnt is still not straightforward in this section we discuss a strategy to explore the interaction between dnn nodes and input variables a correlation was derived between the weighted sum x l 1 w l b l associated with each hidden node and individual numerical model parameter using a density based global sensitivity analysis index Œ¥ borgonovo 2007 plischke et al 2013 a higher value of Œ¥ indicates a stronger correlation the evolution of the weighted sums for two representative hidden nodes and their values of Œ¥ are shown in figs s3 and s4 a total of 4050 Œ¥ values were calculated for three selected emulators and visualised by six heatmaps fig 12 these heatmaps can be used to identify the importance of input variables overall k h 0 is the most influential parameter in determining the weighted sums for most of the hidden nodes aquifer anisotropy contributed little to the weighted sums dark colour in the heatmaps which uncovered their insignificant role in the emulator development interestingly several hidden nodes were closely associated with Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l fig 12a this may be attributed to the fact that these nodes realised the significant role of Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l in determining the low concentration ranges fig 5h and 5i these findings are consistent with the patterns in the scatterplots based on the outputs of the numerical model figs 5 6 and 7 thus suggesting that the potential complex correlations between inputs and outputs were adequately and correctly learnt in the dnn emulators these heatmaps can help track the learning process of dnn and identify interactions among input variables as indicated by the more heterogeneous colour distribution nodes in the first hidden layer were more closely associated with individual inputs fig 12 dnn tends to find the characteristics of individual inputs at its first hidden layer and then learn possible interaction patterns among inputs at its second hidden layer for example hidden layer two of the head objective function emulator is trying to learn the combined information provided by k h 0 and k h 2 fig 12d generally all Œ¥ values decreased in hidden layer two the finding that dnn learns different levels of knowledge at different layers makes it easier for transfer learning where already trained layers can be recycled to improve the learning efficiency accuracy for a new but similar target variable this correlation analysis can also be applied to optimise the dnn network structure by dropping insensitive inputs or dropping the number of nodes when the efficiency of an emulator cannot meet the requirements this is not a concern for the relatively simple model under investigation however to demonstrate the method a refined emulator for œÜ h that has dropped inputs of k h 0 k v 0 k h 1 k v 1 and k h 2 k v 2 was trained fig 8d the accuracy of this emulator was very slightly compromised r squared of 0 99 and rmse of 2 13 10 3 in comparison with r squared of 1 00 and rmse of 1 71 10 3 5 3 limitations and future studies a simplified conceptual model and homogeneous hydraulic properties within different zones were applied in this paper for feasibility demonstration we developed a generalised 2d model based on the regional hydrogeological setting in the study area however transport modelling is essentially a complex process in 3d space with heterogenous parameters and dynamic stresses such heterogeneity needs to be represented by more sophisticated techniques such as geostatistics in addition more advanced biochemical reactions may be necessary for some transport modelling with a more realistic process based model with a large number of parameters hundreds to thousands further study such as dimension reduction is required to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of dnn emulators if the accuracy and efficiency of ddn emulators can be proved even with a more realistic 3d transport model from the study area a contamination risk assessment of on share gas development and spills will be conducted with the assistance of dnn emulator for the study area in the current study only one type of network architecture was applied for one dnn emulator in more complex situations hybrid architectures such as a mix of mlp and rnn can further improve the accuracy zhang et al 2018 time cost is another critical factor for the application of dnn emulators the primary time cost for dnn emulators is the runtime of the numerical model in doe to obtain enough training samples further work should be conducted for smart adaptive sampling to reduce this time cost particularly for environmental modelling with a large number of input parameters 6 conclusions intensive computing demand for reactive transport groundwater models often limits the application of such models to support risk based decision making for environmental management this paper investigated the feasibility of deep learning emulators as an approximation of the process based models to facilitate their application when computational burden forms an obstacle three types of variables representing different levels of non linearity between model inputs and outputs were emulated including point based variables point based concentration lumped variables head and concentration objective functions and multi output variables time series breakthrough curves the promising results lay a good foundation for a comprehensive contamination risk assessment for the study area using hybrid modelling combining process based models with data driven models specifically the following findings can benefit the future application of deep learning emulators in the context of groundwater modelling i deep learning techniques in the form of emulators provide a practical approach to speed up groundwater transport modelling all the tested emulators are able to approximate their counterparts from the process based numerical model with superior accuracy given a few thousands of training samples ii as expected more training samples are required as the mechanical relationships between inputs and outputs become more complicated however our results show that the required increase of sample size from point solute concentration to concentration objective function and to breakthrough curves is insignificant although it requires further investigation deep learning emulators show signs of good scalability due to its multiple layer learning structure iii although it is not common to apply data transformation to target variables such as contaminant concentration in our study in typical machine learning regression analysis our results suggest that the utilisation of the transformation in both

5215,groundwater flow and transport models are routinely applied for contamination risk assessments and remediation plan design the computational burden of such models has limited their application when a large number of model runs are required to conduct history matching sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis and optimisation deep learning has shown great potential in relaxing this limitation by emulating the process based models for computational intensive application the current study investigates the feasibility of implementing deep learning emulators for a generalised flow

decision making the study sheds light on hybrid modelling that combines the strength of process based environmental models and data driven machine learning models keywords machine learning deep neural networks groundwater modelling contaminant transport modelling hybrid modelling 1 introduction groundwater flow and transport models are routinely applied for contamination risks assessments and remediation plan design zheng and bennett 2002 anderson et al 2015 process based reactive transport models describe the coupling of physical and chemical processes which depend on initial and boundary conditions that vary in space and time prediction relevant spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties and transient characteristics of boundary conditions require transport models to be discretised at fine scale both spatially and temporally and to be highly parameterised hunt et al 2007 depending on contaminants and hydrogeological properties transport models also need to incorporate multiple hydro chemical processes that are often computationally demanding the growing model complexity unavoidably leads to increasing model runtimes hindering the application of sophisticated modelling techniques that rely on a large number of model runs e g model calibration uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis and optimisation keating et al 2010 model emulation has been proposed in previous studies to tackle this particular issue with some success asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 an emulator is a faster running approximation of a process based model often time consuming it is also referred to a surrogate or metamodel in the literature emulators are often implemented with data driven models that can efficiently learn relationships among variables through statistical inference and machine learning ml when training data are available ml as a technique to construct emulators of process based models has shown great potential to reduce the computational burden of complex environmental models while still maintaining reasonable model accuracy asher et al 2015 cui et al 2018 razavi et al 2012 roy and datta 2018 sreekanth and datta 2015 in the past decades various techniques such as gaussian process regression support vector machine and artificial neural networks have been experimented to build emulators as a second level abstraction to alleviate the computational burden of such models existing applications of ml emulators in the context of transport modelling generally include i pump and treat remediation ii groundwater contaminant source identification and iii coastal groundwater management a brief summary of these applications under the three categories is provided in table 1 most of the previous studies focused on emulating a point based variable such as groundwater heads at a particular location to accelerate optimisation without accounting for parameter and model uncertainty although the previous studies have achieved some success the application of emulator faces challenges of scalability and accuracy when the input output relationship is highly non linear and or high dimensional the recent advancement of deep learning can potentially address some of these challenges deep learning relies on algorithms that use deep neural networks dnn artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers deep learning has exhibited superior performance and flexibility to simulate complex non linear relationships compared to traditional statistical inference and ml techniques g√©ron 2019 jiang et al 2019 ye et al 2019 however its application in groundwater transport modelling in the form of emulators remains very limited with the exception of mo et al 2019 in this recent research a dense convolutional encoder decoder network was adopted to transfer the contaminant field emulating problem to an image to image regression analysis and satisfying results were achieved with a synthetic transport model dnn is considered to be a revolutionary tool that is transforming multiple disciplines including hydrology marcais and de dreuzy 2017 shen 2018 due to its robustness and generalised prediction capacity for various regression and classification problems although numerous specific deep network structures have been proposed the following three popular classes of neural networks are sufficiently flexible in solving a vast range of problems multi layer perceptrons mlp can solve most of the classification and regression problems convolutional neural networks cnn are good at learning spatial relationships within image data which allows the model to learn positions and scales in the variant structures recurrent neural networks rnn are developed for sequence prediction such as hydrographs and are also heavily used in natural language processing in this study dnn are applied to emulate a groundwater contaminant transport model that involves advection dispersion and sorption processes the groundwater model was developed based on the hydrogeological conditions in southeast south australia where potential contamination pathways from on shore gas development and spills have been identified three types of target variables are emulated point based variables contaminant concentration at a specific location and time lumped variables objective functions used for model calibration and uncertainty analysis and multi output sequence variables breakthrough curves that describe the change of concentration over time the overall goal of the study is to explore the feasibility and performance of deep learning to emulate groundwater transport models the rest of the paper is organised into five sections the hydrogeological background is described in the study area section the development of the groundwater model and the design of the deep learning emulators are covered in the method section we then present the modelling results and some discussion on how to facilitate the application of dnn by data transformation to the target variables and heatmaps based on sensitivity analysis the paper is concluded by a summary of the important findings 2 study area the study is undertaken for an area that extends 36 km east west and 42 km north south in the south east of south australia the region has relatively flat topography characterised by limestone geology overlain by sandy soils the region has a mild temperate climate with average rainfall ranging from 480 to 780 mm yr and potential evapotranspiration ranging from 890 to 1160 mm yr regional groundwater flows from east to west with a higher eastern terrain fig 1 the area is characterised by dunes and interdunal flats from previous ocean ingression there are two major aquifers underlying this region the unconfined tertiary limestone aquifer tla and the confined tertiary confined sands aquifer tcsa the shallow tla is characterised by karstic limestone geology often referred to as the gambier limestone aquifer morgan 2015 the limestone aquifer is extensively used for irrigated agriculture stock and domestic and other uses historically the area has been waterlogged the water table in the low lying areas has been artificially lowered using agricultural drains since 1863 although the majority of drains were constructed between 1949 and 1972 a large number of lakes and wetlands are present in this region many of which are fed by groundwater inflows that maintain water levels for part or all of the year predominant land uses are dryland grazing irrigated pasture and viticulture softwood and hardwood forestry and native vegetation petroleum and conventional gas wells have been developed in the region around penola since 1987 with the commercialisation of the katnook and then the ladbroke grove fields additional gas wells have been recently built and or proposed for this region the low water table in the region makes the groundwater system relatively vulnerable to pollution from surface sources ncgrt 2016 identified that infiltration from surface spills provides a high risk of groundwater contamination a study conducted by jacobs 2016 also associated high risk with potential spills of surface contaminants migrating to the tla these concerns warrant detailed modelling analysis to quantify contamination risks the current study forms a critical component of a larger project that aims to provide a comprehensive contamination risk assessment for the study area in a probabilistic framework due to the high uncertainty in physical chemical processes and hydrogeological properties 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater models because the primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning emulators the model was designed to represent the general hydrogeological setting in the study area rather than being specifically designed for a particular location a 2d cross sectional model 3000 m wide and 105 m deep fig 2 was developed to represent the unconfined aquifer close to the petroleum wells in this study the top surface of the aquifer was assigned a fixed slope equal to 0 001 to the west surface elevations at the western and eastern boundaries are 2 m and 5 m respectively two local high permeability zones zone 1 and 2 in fig 2 were included to represent the karstic features in the aquifer the base of the aquifer was assumed to be a no flow boundary whereas the western and eastern boundaries were assigned time variant groundwater heads the transient head boundary data fig 3 a were acquired from nearby observation wells website https www waterconnect sa gov au systems gd pages default aspx transient recharge and evapotranspiration data fig 3b and 3c were sourced from the calibrated south east regional water balance model of morgan et al 2015 a unit concentration contaminant source was introduced from the top left aquifer boundary red dot in fig 2 through recharge the linear isotherm was selected to simulate the sorption process modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 and mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 were used for flow and contaminant transport modelling respectively the flow domain was discretised into 100 columns and 21 layers all of which were set as convertible layers the time variant specified head chd package the recharge package and the evapotranspiration package were used to implement the flow boundary conditions in mt3d usgs the dsp and rct package were used to implement solute dispersion and reaction mechanisms the drycell option was adopted to enable the contaminant to move in and out of the dry cells a monthly stress period was applied for a duration of 50 years from 1969 to 2019 a relatively simple parameterisation strategy was implemented for the cross section model table 2 parameter ranges for flow model parameters are primarily based on the previously calibrated regional model in the south east of south australia morgan 2015 other parameter ranges were selected based on expert knowledge and the local hydrogeological information 3 2 deep neural networks emulator deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that includes a family of algorithms using different structures of multi layer neural networks in the current study two types of them mlp and rnn were trained to approximate the non linear relationship between the parameters and outputs of the numerical models mlp was used to emulate point solute concentration and objective functions and rnn was used to emulate breakthrough curves a brief discussion is presented here to highlight the critical set up in our dnn emulators for readers who are interested in more details g√©ron 2019 provides an excellent practical and easy to follow introduction on deep learning 3 2 1 multi layer perceptrons mlp nodes in the mlp are fully connected to every node of the previous layer fig 4 a the connection weights are continuously reinforced for those that contribute to the correct prediction during the training until mlp finishes the preset iterations or until the improvement of accuracy is less than the specified threshold the computing input output relationship in each layer is given by 1 h l œÜ x l 1 w l b l where h is the output of a fully connected layer with the layer index of l x is the matrix of the previous layer s outputs one row per instance and one column per input node in layer l 1 x 0 means the matrix of inputs w is the weight matrix one row per input node in layer l 1 and one column per node in layer l b is the bias vector and œÜ is the activation function of mlp nodes rectified linear unit function œÜ z m a x 0 z was set in this study the lecun initializer lecun et al 2012 was used for the mlp emulators dropout layer with the dropout rate of 0 1 was set behind every hidden layer to regularise the neural networks to speed up the emulator training nadam optimisation dozat 2016 was applied as the optimiser for parameter learning rather than the regular gradient descent optimiser the loss function of mean square error was used batch size and training iterations were set to 30 and 1000 respectively learning rate schedule and early stopping were used as the call backs to converge to the optimum rapidly and avoid overfitting two hidden layers with 75 nodes per layer were adopted in mlp 3 2 2 recurrent neural networks rnn rnn can extract and remember the information from a sequence of inputs to produce a sequence of outputs through the memory cells backpropagation through time was used to propagate gradient back and enable updating the rnn model parameters however this algorithm is not very efficient at learning from long sequences since its memory of the first input gradually fades away rnn may also suffer the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients if they are trained with long sequences long short term memory lstm sak et al 2014 schmidhuber and hochreiter 1997 zaremba et al 2014 is one of the most popular architectures that have mitigated these limitations successfully two separate state vectors were implemented in the lstm cells a long term state vector c and a short term state vector h fig 4b at each time step during the training some memories were dropped and new memories were added to the cells more details including the computing equations can be found in the supplementary material the dropout rate and recurrent dropout rate were set to 0 1 in the lstm cells the glorot uniform initialiser glorot and bengio 2010 and orthogonal initializer saxe et al 2013 were used for kernel initialisation and recurrent initialisation three hidden layers with 75 memory cells per layer were used and other hyperparameters were the same as for the mlp structure 3 3 design of experiment doe once the model was ready design of experiments doe was conducted to sample the model space to supply training points for the emulators the first step of doe is to evaluate the model stability by randomly sampling the model space to ensure that the pre defined parameter ranges are compatible with the numerical model this should be implemented in a relatively small sample size for saving computational burden if the model fails the stability test it is because there are serious structural deficiencies or the initial parameter ranges need to be adjusted or correlations need to be taken into account during sampling the latin hypercube sampling method lhs was used in this context as it can efficiently cross the range of each sampled variable and generate a more stable input output pattern to reduce the required samples helton and davis 2003 using the lhs a total of 4080 samples were generated and simulated with the numerical model the next step is to check the quality of the simulation results biased correlation and false hypotheses may occur in the emulator if unreliable training data is used the samples with negative concentration caused by numerical error were removed which left 4000 samples remaining for emulator training and validation critical steps in the workflow of developing emulators include 1 raw data transformation 2 dnn emulator training 3 emulator prediction 4 inverse transform of predictions and 5 performance examination the overall workflow from numerical model development to emulator is given in fig s1 s hereinafter refers to the supplementary material to further improve the emulator performance four types of transformations were examined more discussion in the subsection 5 1 including standardisation transformation normalisation transformation normal quantile transformation nqt and uniform quantile transformation uqt standardisation transformation can transform any normally distributed data to a standard gaussian distribution with a mean value of 0 and variance of 1 using the equation z x Œº s normalisation transformation can transform such data to a range from 0 to 1 using the equation of z x x min x max x min nqt ranks all data first and then maps them to a normal distribution by the associated quantile function uqt is a similar transformation but maps the data to a uniform distribution nqt and uqt transformations are robust tools that could reduce the effect of marginal outliers pedregosa et al 2011 4 results 4 1 emulators of solute concentration the first emulator was trained for a point based prediction the solute concentration at observation point 10 fig 2 at time 40 years firstly the sensitivity of the ten input parameters on the emulated concentration was examined through scatterplots fig 5 fig 5a shows that k h 0 influenced solute concentration more significantly compared to the other parameters a higher k h 0 may allow earlier arrival of the contaminant to the observation location on the other hand the influence of aquifer anisotropy was not as significant in the current model configuration this can be attributed to the dominating effect of the head boundary conditions on the flow pattern and or the relative narrow parameter range of k h 0 k v 0 the moving average concentration black line in fig 5a slightly increased when s y porosity Œ± l Œ± t Œ± l and k d were increased it should be noted that a moving average might not correctly capture existing weak correlations e g larger sorption should decrease the concentration as it shows in fig s2j it seems that within the tested parameter range in fig 5 the impact of sorption is dominated by other parameters in addition the lower concentrations were closely associated with lower Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l and were also associated with larger k d fig 5h 5i and 5j respectively it implied that the smaller dispersion and larger sorption greatly aggravated the decrease of solute concentration at point 10 the relationship between point concentration and parameters should also be dependent on observation locations and time if the observation was for location 2 at earlier times in the simulation the role of Œ± l Œ± t Œ± l and k h 0 was expected to change the 4000 samples were split into a training dataset 3500 samples and a testing dataset 500 samples the splitting was conducted before any machine learning experiments to allow an objective and unbiased estimation of the emulator performance a ten fold cross validation hastie et al 2009 grid search was used to search the optimal number of hidden layers and nodes with the training dataset then the emulator was trained with these optimised hyperparameters performance examination was implemented with the test dataset input variables were normalised and a multiplier of 100 000 was used for solute concentration before the data were fed to the mlp some preliminary experiments indicated that the emulator performance was improved as the raw data of emulating targets was transformed to the range from 0 1 to 10 the concentrations from the dnn emulator were in close agreement with the results from the numerical models in the testing dataset indicated by scatterplot r squared 0 99 and rmse in fig 8a the ratio of rmse to mean concentration in the test dataset was 4 39 the scatterplot presented the higher accuracy for the samples with higher concentration because most samples were in the right side of the plot higher than 4 72 10 5 resulting in a high weight during emulator training in some application of machine learning a 0 99 r squared may indicate overfitting however it is not a critical concern for model emulation during the design of experiment parameter ranges were made large intentionally to cover the entire parameter space then essentially we are dealing with an interpolation issue rather than extrapolation please also note that r squared values in the scatterplots are only based on the test dataset the test data were saved aside for testing before we trained the emulators during the training process emulators were not allowed to see these data if there is a non realistic over fitting issue then the test data should uncover this 4 2 emulators of objective functions objective functions that define the discrepancy between observations and model outputs form a fundamental component for model calibration and uncertainty analysis cui et al 2018 demonstrated how modelling efficiency can be improved by using an emulator to substitute the objective functions for a regional groundwater flow model objective functions are considered as lumped variables that are functions of temporal and spatial information across the model domain two objective functions were emulated including one for hydraulic head and another one for solute concentration defining as follows 2 œÜ h 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m h s h o i j 2 0 5 3 œÜ c 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m c s c o i j 2 0 5 where œÜ h and œÜ c are the objective function of hydraulic head and solute concentration respectively h o and c o are the hypothetical observed historical head and concentration respectively which were randomly chosen from the available samples from the doe correspondingly h s and c s are the simulated head and concentration from the numerical model i denotes the observation point number associated with spatial distribution from 1 to n n 10 and j denotes the historical sequence data associated with temporal distribution from 1 to m m 80 data points every six months the inputs of the œÜ h emulator include parameters of modflow nwt the first 7 parameters of table 2 while the inputs of the œÜ c emulator contains all parameters in table 2 the k h 0 k h 1 and k h 2 were the major factors to the changes in œÜ h with specific yield slightly affecting the variation of œÜ h fig 6 the head objective function was not sensitive to the changes in anisotropy characterisation local horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h 1 had a positive correlation with œÜ h whereas k h 2 and specific yield had a negative correlation the non monotonic variation was found in the scatterplot of k h 0 in which the generated œÜ h went down and then up similar to the distribution of concentration prediction mentioned in the previous subsection the predominant factors for œÜ c were k h 0 specific yield porosity and k d fig 7 the tendency of a rising moving average was associated with a higher k h 0 Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l whereas the opposite trend was observed for the larger specific yield porosity and k d multipliers of 100 and 100 000 were used for the œÜ h and œÜ c emulators respectively the same hyperparameters were used for all the mlp emulators to allow a fair comparison among emulators for different types of predictions the emulated œÜ h was in good agreement with the result of the numerical model and the ratio of rmse to the mean value was 2 00 fig 8b for the more complex variable œÜ c our emulator also delivered a quite good performance with the ratio of rmse to the mean value of 3 07 fig 8c the emulator performance was better for the samples with the larger œÜ c similar to the emulated results for point based concentration 4 3 emulators of breakthrough curves except for single value predictions such as point concentration and objective functions the hydrology community is also seeking efficient prediction tools for time series such as hydrographs and breakthrough curves this type of predictions poses extra challenges for emulator training in this section we examined the feasibility of rnn as a time series emulator rnn emulator with lstm cells was developed to mimic the breakthrough curves at location 10 fig 2 with variable aquifer parameters numerical model results over 40 years were used to train the time sequence emulator with a time step length of 0 5 years as such this dataset was at least 80 times larger than that of the point solute concentration emulator an additional variable of time step counter was included in the rnn emulator this emulator costs more computational time to train a critical challenge for developing this emulator was that the raw output from the numerical models spanned over 30 orders of magnitude from 1 18 10 38 to 1 72 10 4 these data needed to be transformed to allow dnn to better perceive the correlation between input and output data with some experiments uniform quantile transformation was used for this output variable the comparison of different transformations will be given in section 5 1 the performance of this emulator was examined by comparing the simulated and emulated breakthrough curves twelve breakthrough curves were randomly selected from the test datasets the 500 samples from doe prior to training the emulator with the variations of numerical model parameters different shapes of breakthrough curves were observed roughly concentrations along the tested breakthrough curves started from 0 and rapidly crossed multiple orders of magnitude over the first 10 years after this rapid climbing the concentration fluctuated around some numbers between 1 10 5 and 1 10 4 fig 9 the results showed that the emulated breakthrough curves basically overlapped with the results from the numerical models the trends of concentration fluctuation were well learnt by the trained rnn emulator although some sections were slightly underestimated during certain times fig 9 our experiment demonstrates that rnn emulator is an extremely powerful data driven model that can be used to emulate time series of hydraulic variables the fast running and superior accuracy make it possible to use rnn emulators as substitutes for process based models for real time data assimilation e g integrating into real time monitoring or into an online management system 4 4 sample requirements and scalability sample requirements of the aforementioned emulators were further tested using r squared and rmse in the experiment 10 emulators were iteratively trained with the training samples increased from 100 to 3500 in increments of 100 while the testing samples kept at 500 the performance for a specified training sample size can be measured by the performance mean the solid lines in fig 10 and the confidence interval Œº œÉ the shaded area in fig 10 of the 10 emulators for both r squared and rmse for the point prediction of concentration the emulators based on 100 training samples had a mean r squared of 0 77 and a mean rmse of 1 48 10 5 as the increase of the training samples the performance was gradually improved as indicated by increasing r squared decreasing rmse and narrowing confidence intervals particularly when the sample size is less than 1400 a sample size of 500 delivered a reasonably high accuracy mean r squared of 0 95 and the performance was guaranteed as the training samples increased above 500 the mean r squared for the œÜ h emulators were 0 84 and 0 99 with the training samples of 100 and 1800 respectively there was no apparent improvement for additional training samples above 1800 fig 10b compared to the emulators for point concentration and œÜ h the mean r squared of the œÜ c emulators dramatically dropped when less than 300 samples were used training samples of 3100 resulted in a mean r squared of 0 99 for the œÜ c emulators fig 10c to allow a r squared of 0 99 the emulators of the concentration objective function required 1 48 and 1 72 times of the training samples used for the point concentration and head objective function respectively the sample requirement of the breakthrough curves emulator was also examined the mean r squared values were 0 74 and 0 99 when the training involved 100 and 2100 samples respectively fig 10d given the same hyperparameters adopted in the emulators for point concentration and œÜ h and œÜ c a larger required sample size indicated a more complicated input output relationship as expected the level of complexity increased from the simpler head objective function œÜ h to the point solute concentration then to the concentration objective function œÜ c although the head objective function is a lumped variable it shows that its input output relationship is relatively simpler than the point based solute concentration which involved more complex mechanisms including advection dispersion and sorption the input output relationship for the breakthrough curve was the most complicated one although the emulator showed a similar performance with the point concentration emulator our experiments also demonstrate that the sample requirements did not increase significantly from the simple point concentration emulator to more complex breakthrough curve emulator this may suggest that the dnn has a good upscaling capacity compared to other ml emulators although this needs to be further studied by comparing different model emulating techniques 4 5 emulator efficiency the primary motivation for this study was to explore the feasibility of deep learning as emulators to reduce the computational burden of contaminant transport modelling as expected more training time was required for the dnn emulators as the training data increased among the tested emulators a maximum training time of 20 min was needed to train the rnn emulator for the breakthrough curves once the emulators were trained and saved they can be reloaded rapidly for modelling in seconds on a modern personal desktop computer this represents a considerable computation time saving compared to the individual processed based model s running time of 5 min 5 discussion 5 1 effect of data transformation although it is a standard practice to scale transform the input variables target variable transformation is not commonly applied for regression machine learning however concentrations from the transport model that can span tens of orders of magnitude pose some unique challenges for the dnn emulators a common practice in groundwater modelling is to ignore the concentrations below a pre defined threshold such as 0 01 mg l the emergence of some new contaminants that are toxic even at very low concentration such as pfas makes this traditional practice no longer appropriate discarding the lower marginal values or altering them to zeros might introduce bias when developing ml emulators to improve the emulator accuracy in such situation different transformations to target variables are tested note that log transformation was not used as some samples had a zero concentration the parameter range of k d was expanded for this experiment to allow a better demonstration while other parameter ranges remained unchanged in the numerical model a total of 3000 samples were newly sampled within the new k d range 0 001 m 3 k g k d 22 m 3 k g vilks 2018 as a result the concentration spanned over 30 orders of magnitude a total of 2500 samples were used for emulator training while the remaining 500 samples were saved for performance testing the emulator without transformation performed worst with a minimum and maximum concentration of 3 51 10 7 and 9 85 10 3 respectively fig 11 a the results of this emulator could only span four orders of magnitudes the emulators with standardisation transformation and normalisation transformation also seriously overestimated concentrations for the samples of less than 1 00 10 10 fig 11b and 11c both nqt and uqt transformations can improve emulator results that can vary over 30 orders of magnitude however the scatterplots showed significant underestimation from the nqt transformation fig 11d by comparison the emulator with the uqt transformation outperformed others fig 11 dramatically it was also noted that the emulator performance with uqt transformation still required improvement if the interested concentration is close to the lower bound when this need occurs an adaptive iterative sampling and training strategy siade et al 2020 could dramatically improve the emulator accuracy in summary data transformation is strongly recommended for concentration predictions when machine learning emulators are applied for contaminant transport modelling 5 2 knowledge extraction from the dnn emulator the neural networks technique is well known for its superior accuracy whereas interpreting what a dnn model has learnt is still not straightforward in this section we discuss a strategy to explore the interaction between dnn nodes and input variables a correlation was derived between the weighted sum x l 1 w l b l associated with each hidden node and individual numerical model parameter using a density based global sensitivity analysis index Œ¥ borgonovo 2007 plischke et al 2013 a higher value of Œ¥ indicates a stronger correlation the evolution of the weighted sums for two representative hidden nodes and their values of Œ¥ are shown in figs s3 and s4 a total of 4050 Œ¥ values were calculated for three selected emulators and visualised by six heatmaps fig 12 these heatmaps can be used to identify the importance of input variables overall k h 0 is the most influential parameter in determining the weighted sums for most of the hidden nodes aquifer anisotropy contributed little to the weighted sums dark colour in the heatmaps which uncovered their insignificant role in the emulator development interestingly several hidden nodes were closely associated with Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l fig 12a this may be attributed to the fact that these nodes realised the significant role of Œ± l and Œ± t Œ± l in determining the low concentration ranges fig 5h and 5i these findings are consistent with the patterns in the scatterplots based on the outputs of the numerical model figs 5 6 and 7 thus suggesting that the potential complex correlations between inputs and outputs were adequately and correctly learnt in the dnn emulators these heatmaps can help track the learning process of dnn and identify interactions among input variables as indicated by the more heterogeneous colour distribution nodes in the first hidden layer were more closely associated with individual inputs fig 12 dnn tends to find the characteristics of individual inputs at its first hidden layer and then learn possible interaction patterns among inputs at its second hidden layer for example hidden layer two of the head objective function emulator is trying to learn the combined information provided by k h 0 and k h 2 fig 12d generally all Œ¥ values decreased in hidden layer two the finding that dnn learns different levels of knowledge at different layers makes it easier for transfer learning where already trained layers can be recycled to improve the learning efficiency accuracy for a new but similar target variable this correlation analysis can also be applied to optimise the dnn network structure by dropping insensitive inputs or dropping the number of nodes when the efficiency of an emulator cannot meet the requirements this is not a concern for the relatively simple model under investigation however to demonstrate the method a refined emulator for œÜ h that has dropped inputs of k h 0 k v 0 k h 1 k v 1 and k h 2 k v 2 was trained fig 8d the accuracy of this emulator was very slightly compromised r squared of 0 99 and rmse of 2 13 10 3 in comparison with r squared of 1 00 and rmse of 1 71 10 3 5 3 limitations and future studies a simplified conceptual model and homogeneous hydraulic properties within different zones were applied in this paper for feasibility demonstration we developed a generalised 2d model based on the regional hydrogeological setting in the study area however transport modelling is essentially a complex process in 3d space with heterogenous parameters and dynamic stresses such heterogeneity needs to be represented by more sophisticated techniques such as geostatistics in addition more advanced biochemical reactions may be necessary for some transport modelling with a more realistic process based model with a large number of parameters hundreds to thousands further study such as dimension reduction is required to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of dnn emulators if the accuracy and efficiency of ddn emulators can be proved even with a more realistic 3d transport model from the study area a contamination risk assessment of on share gas development and spills will be conducted with the assistance of dnn emulator for the study area in the current study only one type of network architecture was applied for one dnn emulator in more complex situations hybrid architectures such as a mix of mlp and rnn can further improve the accuracy zhang et al 2018 time cost is another critical factor for the application of dnn emulators the primary time cost for dnn emulators is the runtime of the numerical model in doe to obtain enough training samples further work should be conducted for smart adaptive sampling to reduce this time cost particularly for environmental modelling with a large number of input parameters 6 conclusions intensive computing demand for reactive transport groundwater models often limits the application of such models to support risk based decision making for environmental management this paper investigated the feasibility of deep learning emulators as an approximation of the process based models to facilitate their application when computational burden forms an obstacle three types of variables representing different levels of non linearity between model inputs and outputs were emulated including point based variables point based concentration lumped variables head and concentration objective functions and multi output variables time series breakthrough curves the promising results lay a good foundation for a comprehensive contamination risk assessment for the study area using hybrid modelling combining process based models with data driven models specifically the following findings can benefit the future application of deep learning emulators in the context of groundwater modelling i deep learning techniques in the form of emulators provide a practical approach to speed up groundwater transport modelling all the tested emulators are able to approximate their counterparts from the process based numerical model with superior accuracy given a few thousands of training samples ii as expected more training samples are required as the mechanical relationships between inputs and outputs become more complicated however our results show that the required increase of sample size from point solute concentration to concentration objective function and to breakthrough curves is insignificant although it requires further investigation deep learning emulators show signs of good scalability due to its multiple layer learning structure iii although it is not common to apply data transformation to target variables such as contaminant concentration in our study in typical machine learning regression analysis our results suggest that the utilisation of the transformation in both inputs and outputs could improve the performance of concentration emulators significantly among the various available transforms uniform quantile transformation exhibited the best performance for concentrations that span tens of orders of magnitude iv correlation analysis between hidden nodes and input variables provides an easy to understand strategy to track the learning process of the deep learning emulators and identify influential input variables and neural network nodes credit authorship contribution statement xiayang yu methodology software conceptualization writing original draft

handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of weiping chen associate editor agricultural water optimization at the basin scale is critical for sustainable irrigated agriculture and water resources management crop water production function cwpf and surface water are key components of agricultural water optimization cwpf relates closely to crop yield growth related parameters and surface water of sub basins is often different and impacted by water withdrawals however cwpf accounting for the crop yield related parameter and natural runoff of sub basins were scarcely involved in agricultural water optimization at the basin scale to fill this gap cwpfs of different water units are estimated using a distributed ecohydrological model involving the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity parameter and the natural runoff of sub basins is reproduced by this model integrating these functions and variables and taking the agricultural benefit of the whole basin as the main objective an agricultural water optimization model at the basin scale awomb is developed and applied to a mountain plain basin in north china the results showed that agricultural water optimization in a representative year would lead to 0 4 increase of crop production for the whole basin at the expense of certain urban ecological water and equity of agricultural water in this scenario the river ecological water requirements in all sub basins would be satisfied assuming the domestic industrial and river ecological water demand being fully satisfied in 2020s water deficits will be 8 and 26 for the whole basin under the normal and dry year scenarios respectively correspondingly increments of 2 and 7 crop production are predicted in these two scenarios by agricultural water optimization it is demonstrated that water resources utilization and agricultural production are effectively improved by coupling a distributed ecohydrological model with water

the world schlager 2005 gal√°n mart√≠n et al 2017 under the influence of agricultural irrigation the streamflow in central asia southwest europe middle east pakistan northwest china and north china has decreased cai et al 2002 yang and tian 2009 siddiqi and wescoat 2013 liu et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2019 the runoff decrease in upper catchments in these arid semi arid or semi humid regions led to groundwater overexploitation and even river drying up in the lower catchments and consequently runoff into the terminal lakes or seas decreased wang et al 2008 guo and shen 2015 mekonnen et al 2015 xu et al 2019 on the other hand irrigation dominates grain production in these regions deng et al 2006 jiang et al 2015 hasson et al 2019 where agricultural irrigation poses a great challenge on the sustainability of water utilization and agricultural production since agricultural water optimization may effectively support both food and water sustainability by increasing water productivity brauman et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 smilovic et al 2019 it is required for sustainable water management and agricultural production in arid semi arid or semi humid regions with water stress at the basin scale optimization models are essential tools of agricultural water optimization these models are generally based on traditional programming method such as linear programming lp nonlinear programming and fractional programming ahrends et al 2008 garcia vila and fereres 2012 garg and dadhich 2014 jiang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2020 uncertain programming method such as stochastic optimization robust programming fractile optimization fuzzy programming interval programming and chance constrained programming wang and huang 2015 yang et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 dai et al 2018 dong et al 2018 tan and zhang 2018 li et al 2019a 2019b heuristic optimization algorithm such as genetic algorithm ga and ant colony optimization cai et al 2002 alvarez et al 2004 nguyen et al 2017 wen et al 2017 li et al 2020b and other optimization methods such as particle swarm optimization game model and pattern search algorithm su et al 2014 fu et al 2019 linker 2020 a few scholars have carried out agricultural water resources optimization at the basin scale with the optimization models mentioned above for example sadeghi et al 2020 designated the optimal agricultural management pattern from the view of water energy food nexus at the basin scale with a lp model ahrends et al 2008 optimized the irrigation cultivation in a semi arid catchment of west africa using the nonlinear programming and su et al 2014 conducted the agricultural water resources optimal allocation with the pattern search algorithm based on subdivision of virtual water into blue and green virtual water in shiyang river basin in northwest china further ga is one of the frequently used techniques to obtain the optimal water scheme li et al 2020b and this method can be applied to many complex problems that are difficult to solve using traditional gradient based approaches goldberg 1989 michalewicz 1994 montesinos et al 2001 optimization models are commonly constrained with available water resources agricultural water demand or irrigated area aiming to maximize the benefit for the study area ahrends et al 2008 garcia vila and fereres 2012 su et al 2014 yang et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 dang et al 2018 the available water resources used in the optimization models are normally for the whole study area either derived from the statistical information or hydrological modeling ahrends et al 2008 garcia vila and fereres 2012 su et al 2014 dang et al 2018 although the streamflow shows spatial difference in a watershed and the observed streamflow is reduced due to withdrawing for irrigation yang and tian 2009 zuo and chen 2012 li et al 2020a the natural runoff of sub basins is scarcely included in the agricultural water optimization in addition the response of crop yield to water in the optimization models is ordinarily based on empirical relationships garg and dadhich 2014 yang et al 2015 however the empirical relationship describing the response of crop yield to irrigation i e the crop water production function cwpf is inappropriate in a different environment saseendran et al 2015 the process based crop or agro hydrological model can describe the dynamic process of agro ecosystem well and is convenient to consider environmental parameters this kind of model has been used to investigate the spatial patterns of crop productivity and water use efficiency under climate change and to raise management strategies such as cropping structure based on scenario analysis of several pre specified alternatives singh et al 2006 mo et al 2009 jiang et al 2015 xue and ren 2017 yu et al 2017 a few researchers have used these kinds of models to derive cwpfs under different climate and soil conditions garcia vila and fereres 2012 saseendran et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 smilovic et al 2019 some of them even utilized the derived cwpfs in water resources optimization models garcia vila and fereres 2012 jiang et al 2016 considering crop yield is a key variable in cwpf and crop yield is sensitive to growth production related parameters in agro ecosystem model zhang et al 2020 cwpf derived from modelling will be impacted by the growth production related parameters crop photosynthetic capacity belongs to this kind of parameters mo et al 2005b and it shows spatial heterogeneity due to the impact of soil nitrogen br√ºck and guo 2006 hu and mo 2011 li et al 2019a 2019b however cwpf accounting for the spatial difference of crop growth production related parameters such as crop photosynthetic capacity has not been used in the agricultural water optimization at the basin scale the vegetation interface processes vip model is a process based distributed ecohydrological model based on grids the vip model can effectively describe the impact of the spatial heterogeneity of photosynthetic capacity on crop yield and the relationship between yield and irrigation hu et al 2010 2014 2019 hu and mo 2011 the vip model can also successfully simulate the river streamflow in different basins mo et al 2005a huang and mo 2015 wang et al 2015 as well as the natural runoff in the basin with intensified irrigation huang and mo 2015 since the runoff generation and runoff routing in vip model is based on grids it can reproduce the streamflow of different sub basins simultaneously in this work we will use the vip model to derive the natural runoff of sub basins as well as the cwpf accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity the objective of this study is to improve crop yield and outflow in a basin thus an agricultural water optimization model at the basin scale awomb solving by ga is developed the awomb takes agricultural benefit as the main objective function and this function is constructed with the cwpf retrieved with the vip ecohydrological dynamic model furthermore the natural runoff of sub basins from vip model is taken as critical parameter of constraints in the awomb using the hutuo river basin hrb in north china as an example agricultural water optimization is conducted at the basin scale under different water supply and demand scenarios and the response of crop yield and outflow is explored 2 study area and data 2 1 study area ziya river basin 112o13 116o03 36o17 39o28 is located in the southern part of haihe river basin in north china including fuyang river and hutuo river fig

coupling with a distributed ecohydrological model i e the vip model fig 2 in the mountain plain basin so as to alleviate the water scarcity and guarantee the agricultural productivity 3 1 the vip model the vip model is a physical process based ecosystem dynamic model and can simulate the exchanges of energy water and carbon between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere at each grid of the land surface mo et al 2017 based on the secondary derivations of the differences between leaf ground temperature and air temperature the energy budgets of vegetation canopy and soil surface are estimated separately with the penman monteith equation in the canopy short wave radiation transferring is separated into visible and near infrared components mo et al 2018 regarding water budgets land surface runoff generation is described with a modified variable infiltration capacity equation accounting for the daily net precipitation and moisture deficit to saturation in the upper soil layer simulation of soil water movement is implemented with the discrete richards equation the groundwater recharge from the soil is calculated with the darcy law the drainage of groundwater to channels is simulated with two namely the upper and lower linear reservoirs the overland and channel runoff routing is computed based on the kinematic wave equation solved by a one dimensional four point finite backward difference method according to the water and energy balance land surface evapotranspiration et is derived et consists of three components namely vegetation transpiration evaporation from soil surface and canopy interception mo et al 2005a in the carbon cycle scheme photosynthetic production is calculated based on the biochemical schemes for c3 farquhar et al 1980 and c4 plants collatz et al 1992 respectively then up scaled to canopy with vertical profiles of sunlit and shaded leaves groups the photosynthetic production is the input variables of the crop growth module for biomass and leaf area estimation in the crop growth module crop phenological stages are expressed with air temperature degree day which determines the fractions of assimilation partitioned to crop components leaf stem root and grain and crop yield is sensitive to the photosynthetic capacity parameter the spatial patterns of two photosynthetic capacity parameters i e maximum rubisco catalytic capacity of winter

demand of each unit in the awomb in this study the water units in the upstream fig 3 are derived based on the sub basins obtained with dem and the outlet stations with reported drainage area in annual hydrological report of china the small sub basin is taken as a separate water unit while the area not included in any small sub basin but included in a large sub basin is also taken as a water unit the water unit in the downstream is shijin district with discharge from the mountain outlet reservoirs as one of the water sources for unit k in year t its annual water supply wkt m3 includes surface water skt m3 groundwater not double counting in the surface water rgkt m3 and other water wokt such as collecting rainwater reclaimed water and water diverted from outside basins m3 1 w kt s kt r gkt

table 2 respectively the weight is set according to the advice of experts based on the purpose of the agricultural water optimization model namely to maximize agricultural benefit while considering social and ecological benefits further the social and ecological benefits are considered equally important the optimization techniques have been used widely in agricultural water allocation singh 2012 among these techniques ga focuses on the set of individuals and its calculation is for all decision variables ga is suitable for solving a multi objective problem for the whole system and it will be used to solve the multi objective optimization problem constrained with equations below section 3 4 in the present study 3 4 constraints of the awomb in this study considering the available water supply in each unit potential water demand of agriculture potential water demand of urban ecological landscape and inflow to the large reservoirs constraints of the awomb are as follows 1 total

assuming some river ecological water can be used as urban ecological water simultaneously sa min and sc min is set as 0 1 and 0 3 table 2 3 the inflow of the reservoir for unit 11 and 17 with large reservoirs the inflow from upper units should be larger than the river ecological water 17 w ukt w rkt 3 5 implementation considering different water supply and demand situations as well as water resources regulation in hrb four scenarios are set in this study namely the representative year with scarce water 2007 and wet normal dry year in 2020s with water delivery from south to north water transfer project for the lower reach based on the precipitation time series in 1956 2013 we choose the year with annual precipitation of 75 50 and 25 guaranteed rate as the wet normal and dry year in 2020s respectively the natural streamflow agricultural water demand and crop yield in the corresponding year is then used in the agricultural water optimization in 2020s the other water resources not including water delivery from south to north water transfer project will be calculated as 30 of the sum of urban domestic water and industrial water and the effective irrigation water utilization rate will increase to 0 55 table 3 according to the reports of shijin district administration and water conservancy bureau of xinzhou the irrigation structure has been greatly improved in recent years thus the effective irrigation water utilization rate in 2020s is suitable for the industrial water quota urbanization rate and domestic water quota in 2020s since the methods to derive them have been validated by the statistical data r 0 70 p 0 01 the corresponding values in table 3 are credible in addition according to our survey in haihe river water conservancy commission the water delivery from south to north water transfer project in 2020s will be carried out as plans therefore the water delivery in table 3 is rational except the data in table 3 other data used in 2020s will be the same as that in the representative year in order to obtain the responses of yield and outflow to agricultural water optimization in 2020s the situation without agricultural water optimization in 2020s is set as follows the water resources of unit k is firstly used by the domestic industrial river ecological and other water use sectors in this unit then for the urban ecological water use sector in unit k the third is the agricultural water use sector in unit k and the last is the water use sectors in lower units of unit k based on the agricultural and urban ecological water before and after agricultural water optimization the crop yield and outflow in response to agricultural water optimization are derived from eqs 6 and 18 respectively 18 w outkt w kt w lifekt w indkt w otherkt x kt y

relationship between total crop yield and allocated irrigation water in a water unit prior to evaluating the regional cwpf of spring maize derived with vip model the modelling of spring maize has been validated with the observed data hu et al 2019 the simulated above ground biomass and leaf area index agree well with the observed value in 2011 r 0 98 p 0 01 at the plot scale shouyang the simulated yield of each county forced by the spatial pattern of the intrinsic quantum efficiency is consistent with the statistical yield r 0 6 p 0 01 during 2005 2013 at the regional scale further the sufficient irrigation in each spring maize unit under different scenarios is all less than 200 mm since the relationship between maize yield and irrigation is linear when the irrigation is less than 500 mm linker 2020 the linear cwpf shown in eq 6 is valid for spring maize according to the regional linear cwpf of spring maize accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of photosynthetic capacity the average net actual irrigation of all counties is about 110 mm from 2005 to 2013 which is similar to the values reported in the water resources bulletin of shanxi province 114 134 mm therefore the regional cwpf of spring maize derived from the vip model is credible the derived cwpf of winter wheat summer maize is evaluated via assessing variables used in cwpf in the representative year the total sufficient irrigation used in cwpf is 330 mm table 4 in the shijin district which is consistent with the value 300 320 mm reported by the heibei water resources department in addition the average sufficient irrigation of the winter wheat summer maize units is 295 mm which is close to the value 288 mm reported by ma et al 2011 in the same area the sufficient irrigation ranges from 261 to 330 mm in winter wheat summer maize units table 4 which is similar to the optimal irrigation 240 330 mm for sustainable water use hu et al 2010 it indicates that the sufficient irrigation in this study represents the maximum irrigation in actual situation with limited water resources considering cwpf is linear when water supply for irrigation is limited zhao et al 2017 the linear cwpf shown in eq 6 is rational for winter wheat summer maize units furthermore the total crop yield with sufficient irrigation employed in cwpf is 13169 kg ha 1 in the shijin district referring to the regional yield simulated by vip model lin 2003 hu et al 2014 the corresponding value in shijin district ranges from 12400 kg ha 1 to 13800 kg ha 1 hence the predicted total crop yield with sufficient irrigation here is credible however the total yield with sufficient irrigation for winter wheat and summer maize in this study is less than the potential yield without water or nutrition stress 16300 kg ha 1 mo et al 2005b because the photosynthetic capacity parameter here has accounted for the nutrition stress the variables employed in cwpf under different scenarios in 2020s table 4 are also analyzed for winter wheat summer maize unit the total yield with sufficient irrigation is determined by the sum of precipitation and sufficient irrigation volume r 0 79 p 0 05 particularly under the dry and normal year scenarios r 0 87 p 0 05 for spring maize unit the rainfed yield of irrigated farm is impacted not only by the precipitation but also the photosynthetic capacity parameter the gap between the yield with sufficient irrigation and rainfed yield is dominated by the irrigation volume particularly under the dry and normal year scenario r 0 79 indicating that maize yield is sensitive to drought which is consistent with the results reported by other researchers potopova et al 2015 meng et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zdenek et al 2017 overall the derived cwpfs are effective 4 2 natural runoff evaluation the simulated natural runoff is firstly evaluated in the base period 1956 1979 with limited anthropogenic effects on river discharge yang and tian 2009 huang and mo 2015 the results fig 6 show that the simulated monthly value in the calibration period 1956 1960 and validation period 1961 1979 agreed well with the observed value for two different sub basins the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients are 0 82 and 0 75 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for xiaojue fig 6a while 0 75 and 0 88 for pingshan fig 6b the correlated coefficients are no less than 0 9 in both calibration and validation periods for these two sub basins according to wang et al 2013 the correlated coefficient is 0 93 in the calibration period and 0 79 in the validation period at xiaojue for a two parameter monthly hydrological model while the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is 0 86 and 0 62 respectively the difference of simulation efficiency between the calibration period and validation period of vip model is lower than that in wang et al 2013 implying the robust performance of this distributed ecohydrological model in term of natural runoff reproduction the reproduced natural runoff is secondly evaluated in the representative year via the difference between water demand and water supply including the natural runoff fig 7 primarily the calculated water demand is assessed for units in shanxi province the total water demand was about 6 41 108 m3 which was larger than the reported value 6 05 108 m3 in shanxi water resources bulletin by 6 considering that the river ecological water demand of all units was calculated as the minimum natural monthly runoff in recent 10 years while in fact a few rivers dried up the calculated water demand was acceptable the water supply and demand for the whole basin was about 33 51 108 m3 and 33 55 108m3 with a difference of 0 12 this indicates the reproduced natural runoff included in the water supply is effective 4 3 results of agricultural water optimization after agricultural water optimization in the representative year table 5 the agricultural water for most units in the upper reach declines particularly in the spring maize units with great rainfed yield such as jiehepu and quankou unit and winter wheat summer maize units with great actual irrigation water consumption such as pingshan and huangbizhuang unit moreover the urban ecological water in most units also decreases particularly in the units with larger urban ecological water demand these water decreases lead to a water increase of 0 74 108 m3 in the lower reach as a result the water deficit in the lower reach decreases by 4 and the crop yield in the lower reach increases by 0 44 108 kg about 1 25 for the whole basin there is a yield increase of 0 19 108 kg about 0 4 furthermore the outflow of most units increases after agricultural water optimization as well as the runoff into the sea fig 8 which can effectively improve the ecology and environment of the basin in 2020s there will be a water surplus of 5 79 108 m3 18 water deficit of 3 09 108 m3 8 and water deficit of 11 72 108 m3 26 under the wet normal and dry year scenario for the whole basin respectively fig 9 under the wet year scenario agricultural and urban ecological water of each unit will be fully satisfied and the agricultural and ecological benefits will reach maximum value 100 in addition the difference of the agricultural water satisfaction ratio for all units will be the smallest after agricultural water optimization under the normal and dry year scenarios table 6 the satisfaction ratio of urban ecological water for the whole basin can only reach 80 and 76 the maximum satisfaction ratio of the agricultural water for the units in the upper reach will be about 23 and 14 and the yield in irrigated farmlands for the whole basin can only reach 97 and 82 of that with sufficient irrigation respectively due to water optimization under the normal and dry year scenarios the water supply from the upper reach to shijin district will increase by 3 11 108 m3 and 5 44 108 m3 and the yield for the whole basin will increase by 1 108 kg i e 2 and 3 108 kg i e 7 respectively because the irrigation water use efficiency in the shijin district is greater under the dry year scenario than that under the normal year scenario the agricultural water optimization under the former scenario will be relatively more effective 5 discussion 5 1 effects of spatial difference of natural runoff and crop photosynthetic capacity the natural runoff takes up more than 60 of the water supply for the whole basin in all scenarios the water resources allocated to agricultural and urban ecological sectors correlate significantly p 0 01 r 0 59 with local natural runoff for all water units in the representative year dry and normal year in 2020s as the crop yield correlates significantly p 0 01 r 0 99 with the allocated agricultural water the local natural runoff can explain 49 63 and 62 p 0 01 of the crop yield for all units after water optimization in the representative year dry and normal year in 2020s respectively further the local natural runoff can explain more than 45 p 0 01 of the outflow for the upper units in all these three scenarios overall the spatial heterogeneity of natural runoff significantly impacts the agricultural production and outflow in water optimization the crop yield after water optimization is impacted by not only the allocated agricultural water but also the rainfed yield of irrigated farm p 0 01 r 0 99 the rainfed yield per unit area in spring maize units correlates with the intrinsic quantum efficiency significantly r 0 53 p 0 05 in the normal year in 2020s but it is not significant in the representative or dry year in 2020s it is because precipitation in the latter two scenarios is less and the crop yield correlates more closely with water the rainfed yield per unit area in winter wheat summer maize units can be explained more than 49 by the maximum catalytic capacity of rubisco of winter wheat in all the representative year dry and normal year in 2020s therefore the effect of the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity on agricultural production is essential in water optimization 5 2 uncertainty of parameters in the awomb the weights of objective functions table 2 in this study are set according to the advice of experts which is subjective taking the representative year as an example we analyz the uncertainty of this method by fixing the weight of one objective function fig 10 as a result when the weight of agricultural benefit is fixed as 0 1 the agricultural benefit keeps as 0 75 fig 10a when the weight of social benefit is fixed as 0 1 fig 10b the agricultural benefit increases from 0 75 to 0 85 as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 to 0 7 and the agricultural benefit almost keeps stable as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 7 to 0 9 when the weight of ecological benefit is fixed as 0 1 fig 10c the agricultural benefit increases from 0 75 to 0 85 as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 to 0 5 and the agricultural benefit almost keeps stable as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 5 to 0 9 these results indicate that when the weight of agricultural benefit is no less than 0 7 i e 0 6 the optimal agricultural benefit can be obtained when the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 7 to 0 9 fig 10b and c the agricultural and social benefits almost keep stable and the ecological benefit reaches its relatively small value when the weight of agricultural benefit is 0 9 and 0 7 in fig 10b and fig 10c respectively it implies the weight of agricultural benefit should be larger than 0 7 and smaller than 0 9 if the minimum increasing volume of weight is set as 0 1 the weight of agricultural benefit should be 0 8 the ecological and social benefits are considered equally important their weights should be both 0 1 therefore the weights used in this work 0 8 0 1 and 0 1 for the agricultural ecological and social benefit respectively are valid the minimum satisfaction ratio of agricultural water sa min and urban ecological water sc min is determined somewhat subjective table 2 in the representative year we analyz the impact of these two parameters on agricultural water optimization fig 11 it is found that when sa min is fixed as any value ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 the ecological benefit increases significantly r 0 83 p 0 05 as sc min increases from 0 1 to 1 0 fig 11c indicating the ecological benefit is sensitive to sc min further the greater the sa min the smaller the increasing rate of ecological benefit resulting from sc min increase implying the effect of sc min on ecological benefit decreases as sa min increases the reason is that when sa min increases the water allocated to ecology becomes less which leads to smaller ecology benefit similarly the social benefit i e equity of agricultural water is proved to be sensitive to sa min and the effect of sa min on social benefit decreases as sc min increases moreover as sa min or sc min changes the variances of ecological and social benefits are about 0 1 fig 11c d and that of the agricultural benefit is about 0 01 fig 11b due to the weights of the former two are both small and that of the latter one is great the variance of total benefit is also about 0 01 fig 11a it shows that the uncertainty of sa min and sc min is limited in addition when sa min and sc min are 0 1 and 0 3 respectively table 2 the value of the main objective function i e agricultural benefit is relatively great fig 11b thus the values of sa min and sc min in this work are rational 5 3 implications and limitations the results show that the developed agricultural water optimization scheme involving the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity and natural runoff is effective at the basin scale however there are some limitations of our agricultural water optimization scheme first the distributed ecohydrological model is coupled in agricultural water optimization via providing data which cannot completely reflect the dynamic agro hydrological process at the basin scale second cwpf is constructed for the whole growing season due to the shortage of seasonal photosynthetic capacity parameters which cannot reflect the impacts of irrigation at different growth stages on crop yield however the effect of irrigation depends on the particular growth stage singh et al 1991 for example water restriction has the greatest negative effects on maize grain production during or after silking by reducing the number of kernels and limiting kernel filling soderlund et al 2014 third three years with different annual precipitation are chosen to demonstrate different water resource scenarios in 2020s which is limited in water optimization at the monthly scale last but not least the agricultural water in this work is a rough estimate since the detailed map of crop pattern is not available the developed agricultural water optimization model with vip model is appropriate for water resources planning in a river basin where human activities such as irrigation have great impact on the discharge or crop yield particular the latter due to that the response of crop yield to crop photosynthetic capacity heterogeneity can be efficiently reproduced with vip model the spatial pattern of crop photosynthetic capacity parameter is the prime requirement to extend the developed awomb in other areas more information regarding the groundwater other water resources domestic water demand industrial water demand urban ecological water demand and the spatial distribution of irrigated farm is required for water demand calculation this work also provides a pragmatic methodology to employ the distributed model to manage water resources at the basin scale which is accomplished by providing cwpfs involving the spatial heterogeneity of sensitive crop yield parameter and runoff of sub basins 6 conclusions in order to improve the water utilization and agricultural production in a basin with intensive irrigation the awomb was developed with the help of a distributed ecohydrological model vip model namely the cwpf in the awomb accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of the effect of photosynthetic capacity on irrigation water productivity was obtained with vip model as well as the natural runoff of sub basins after evaluation of cwpf and natural runoff agricultural water optimization was conducted under different scenarios and the response of crop yield and outflow was analyzed the irrigation water calculated with cwpf considering the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity reproduced the actual volume well the variables used in this kind of cwpf were rational under different scenarios the generated natural runoff of different sub basins agreed with the observed value and was effective in the water balance equation the agricultural water optimization method involving the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity and natural runoff can be used to manage agricultural water at the basin scale the local natural runoff dominated the water allocation to the water units in the agricultural water optimization at the basin scale in the representative year the optimal agricultural water allocation scheme not only enhanced the agricultural benefit but also improved the river ecological water and the runoff into the sea after agricultural water optimization due to agricultural water decrease in the upper sub basins where rainfed crop yield or actual irrigation water was high the water supply in the lower reach with great potential crop productivity increased by 5 resulting in a crop yield increase of 0 19 108 kg for the whole basin however some urban ecological water and equity of agricultural water was sacrificed in 2020s there will be a water surplus for the whole basin under the wet year scenario and the crop yield will reach the yield with sufficient irrigation under the normal and dry year scenarios there will be water deficits for the whole basin in order to guarantee crop yield the water supply from the upper reach to the lower reach should increase in the dry and normal year scenarios if the water supply from the upper reach to the lower reach increases by 5 44 108 m3 and 3 11 108 the yield in the lower reach will increase by 3 108 kg 7 and 1 108 kg i e 2 respectively further the effect of spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity on agricultural production will be particularly important in the normal year scenario with the distributed ecohydrological model a practical agricultural water optimization model is constructed for the whole basin at the annual scale this technique can be used for water resource planning in

appendix a the natural runoff reproduction in the upstream units since the streamflow in the upper reach changed abruptly around 1979 yang and tian 2009 huang and mo 2015 the period from 1956 to 2013 was separated into the base period 1956 1979 and changing period 1980 2013 in the base period the effect of human activities on the streamflow could be neglected thus the observed streamflow was considered as the natural streamflow in the changing period the effect of human activities was significant and the observed streamflow was impacted by human activities such as irrigation with the natural streamflow in the base period vip model can be calibrated and validated to simulate the natural runoff with the calibrated parameters the natural runoff of sub basins in the changing period

handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of weiping chen associate editor agricultural water optimization at the basin scale is critical for sustainable irrigated agriculture and water resources management crop water production function cwpf and surface water are key components of agricultural water optimization cwpf relates closely to crop yield growth related parameters and surface water of sub basins is often different and impacted by water withdrawals however cwpf accounting for the crop yield related parameter and natural runoff of sub basins were scarcely involved in agricultural water optimization at the basin scale to fill this gap cwpfs of different water units are estimated using a distributed ecohydrological model involving the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity parameter and the natural runoff of sub basins is reproduced by this model integrating these functions and variables and taking the agricultural benefit of the whole basin as the main objective an agricultural water optimization model at the basin scale awomb is developed and applied to a mountain plain basin in north china the results showed that agricultural water optimization in a representative year would lead to 0 4 increase of crop production for the whole basin at the expense of certain urban ecological water and equity of agricultural water in this scenario the river ecological water requirements in all sub basins would be satisfied assuming the domestic industrial and river ecological water demand being fully satisfied in 2020s water deficits will be 8 and 26 for the whole basin under the normal and dry year scenarios respectively correspondingly increments of 2 and 7 crop production are predicted in these two scenarios by agricultural water optimization it is demonstrated that water resources utilization and agricultural production are effectively improved by coupling a distributed ecohydrological model with water

the world schlager 2005 gal√°n mart√≠n et al 2017 under the influence of agricultural irrigation the streamflow in central asia southwest europe middle east pakistan northwest china and north china has decreased cai et al 2002 yang and tian 2009 siddiqi and wescoat 2013 liu et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2019 the runoff decrease in upper catchments in these arid semi arid or semi humid regions led to groundwater overexploitation and even river drying up in the lower catchments and consequently runoff into the terminal lakes or seas decreased wang et al 2008 guo and shen 2015 mekonnen et al 2015 xu et al 2019 on the other hand irrigation dominates grain production in these regions deng et al 2006 jiang et al 2015 hasson et al 2019 where agricultural irrigation poses a great challenge on the sustainability of water utilization and agricultural production since agricultural water optimization may effectively support both food and water sustainability by increasing water productivity brauman et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 smilovic et al 2019 it is required for sustainable water management and agricultural production in arid semi arid or semi humid regions with water stress at the basin scale optimization models are essential tools of agricultural water optimization these models are generally based on traditional programming method such as linear programming lp nonlinear programming and fractional programming ahrends et al 2008 garcia vila and fereres 2012 garg and dadhich 2014 jiang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2020 uncertain programming method such as stochastic optimization robust programming fractile optimization fuzzy programming interval programming and chance constrained programming wang and huang 2015 yang et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 dai et al 2018 dong et al 2018 tan and zhang 2018 li et al 2019a 2019b heuristic optimization algorithm such as genetic algorithm ga and ant colony optimization cai et al 2002 alvarez et al 2004 nguyen et al 2017 wen et al 2017 li et al 2020b and other optimization methods such as particle swarm optimization game model and pattern search algorithm su et al 2014 fu et al 2019 linker 2020 a few scholars have carried out agricultural water resources optimization at the basin scale with the optimization models mentioned above for example sadeghi et al 2020 designated the optimal agricultural management pattern from the view of water energy food nexus at the basin scale with a lp model ahrends et al 2008 optimized the irrigation cultivation in a semi arid catchment of west africa using the nonlinear programming and su et al 2014 conducted the agricultural water resources optimal allocation with the pattern search algorithm based on subdivision of virtual water into blue and green virtual water in shiyang river basin in northwest china further ga is one of the frequently used techniques to obtain the optimal water scheme li et al 2020b and this method can be applied to many complex problems that are difficult to solve using traditional gradient based approaches goldberg 1989 michalewicz 1994 montesinos et al 2001 optimization models are commonly constrained with available water resources agricultural water demand or irrigated area aiming to maximize the benefit for the study area ahrends et al 2008 garcia vila and fereres 2012 su et al 2014 yang et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 dang et al 2018 the available water resources used in the optimization models are normally for the whole study area either derived from the statistical information or hydrological modeling ahrends et al 2008 garcia vila and fereres 2012 su et al 2014 dang et al 2018 although the streamflow shows spatial difference in a watershed and the observed streamflow is reduced due to withdrawing for irrigation yang and tian 2009 zuo and chen 2012 li et al 2020a the natural runoff of sub basins is scarcely included in the agricultural water optimization in addition the response of crop yield to water in the optimization models is ordinarily based on empirical relationships garg and dadhich 2014 yang et al 2015 however the empirical relationship describing the response of crop yield to irrigation i e the crop water production function cwpf is inappropriate in a different environment saseendran et al 2015 the process based crop or agro hydrological model can describe the dynamic process of agro ecosystem well and is convenient to consider environmental parameters this kind of model has been used to investigate the spatial patterns of crop productivity and water use efficiency under climate change and to raise management strategies such as cropping structure based on scenario analysis of several pre specified alternatives singh et al 2006 mo et al 2009 jiang et al 2015 xue and ren 2017 yu et al 2017 a few researchers have used these kinds of models to derive cwpfs under different climate and soil conditions garcia vila and fereres 2012 saseendran et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 smilovic et al 2019 some of them even utilized the derived cwpfs in water resources optimization models garcia vila and fereres 2012 jiang et al 2016 considering crop yield is a key variable in cwpf and crop yield is sensitive to growth production related parameters in agro ecosystem model zhang et al 2020 cwpf derived from modelling will be impacted by the growth production related parameters crop photosynthetic capacity belongs to this kind of parameters mo et al 2005b and it shows spatial heterogeneity due to the impact of soil nitrogen br√ºck and guo 2006 hu and mo 2011 li et al 2019a 2019b however cwpf accounting for the spatial difference of crop growth production related parameters such as crop photosynthetic capacity has not been used in the agricultural water optimization at the basin scale the vegetation interface processes vip model is a process based distributed ecohydrological model based on grids the vip model can effectively describe the impact of the spatial heterogeneity of photosynthetic capacity on crop yield and the relationship between yield and irrigation hu et al 2010 2014 2019 hu and mo 2011 the vip model can also successfully simulate the river streamflow in different basins mo et al 2005a huang and mo 2015 wang et al 2015 as well as the natural runoff in the basin with intensified irrigation huang and mo 2015 since the runoff generation and runoff routing in vip model is based on grids it can reproduce the streamflow of different sub basins simultaneously in this work we will use the vip model to derive the natural runoff of sub basins as well as the cwpf accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity the objective of this study is to improve crop yield and outflow in a basin thus an agricultural water optimization model at the basin scale awomb solving by ga is developed the awomb takes agricultural benefit as the main objective function and this function is constructed with the cwpf retrieved with the vip ecohydrological dynamic model furthermore the natural runoff of sub basins from vip model is taken as critical parameter of constraints in the awomb using the hutuo river basin hrb in north china as an example agricultural water optimization is conducted at the basin scale under different water supply and demand scenarios and the response of crop yield and outflow is explored 2 study area and data 2 1 study area ziya river basin 112o13 116o03 36o17 39o28 is located in the southern part of haihe river basin in north china including fuyang river and hutuo river fig

coupling with a distributed ecohydrological model i e the vip model fig 2 in the mountain plain basin so as to alleviate the water scarcity and guarantee the agricultural productivity 3 1 the vip model the vip model is a physical process based ecosystem dynamic model and can simulate the exchanges of energy water and carbon between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere at each grid of the land surface mo et al 2017 based on the secondary derivations of the differences between leaf ground temperature and air temperature the energy budgets of vegetation canopy and soil surface are estimated separately with the penman monteith equation in the canopy short wave radiation transferring is separated into visible and near infrared components mo et al 2018 regarding water budgets land surface runoff generation is described with a modified variable infiltration capacity equation accounting for the daily net precipitation and moisture deficit to saturation in the upper soil layer simulation of soil water movement is implemented with the discrete richards equation the groundwater recharge from the soil is calculated with the darcy law the drainage of groundwater to channels is simulated with two namely the upper and lower linear reservoirs the overland and channel runoff routing is computed based on the kinematic wave equation solved by a one dimensional four point finite backward difference method according to the water and energy balance land surface evapotranspiration et is derived et consists of three components namely vegetation transpiration evaporation from soil surface and canopy interception mo et al 2005a in the carbon cycle scheme photosynthetic production is calculated based on the biochemical schemes for c3 farquhar et al 1980 and c4 plants collatz et al 1992 respectively then up scaled to canopy with vertical profiles of sunlit and shaded leaves groups the photosynthetic production is the input variables of the crop growth module for biomass and leaf area estimation in the crop growth module crop phenological stages are expressed with air temperature degree day which determines the fractions of assimilation partitioned to crop components leaf stem root and grain and crop yield is sensitive to the photosynthetic capacity parameter the spatial patterns of two photosynthetic capacity parameters i e maximum rubisco catalytic capacity of winter

demand of each unit in the awomb in this study the water units in the upstream fig 3 are derived based on the sub basins obtained with dem and the outlet stations with reported drainage area in annual hydrological report of china the small sub basin is taken as a separate water unit while the area not included in any small sub basin but included in a large sub basin is also taken as a water unit

table 2 respectively the weight is set according to the advice of experts based on the purpose of the agricultural water optimization model namely to maximize agricultural benefit while considering social and ecological benefits further the social and ecological benefits are considered equally important the optimization techniques have been used widely in agricultural water allocation singh 2012 among these techniques ga focuses on the set of individuals and its calculation is for all decision variables ga is suitable for solving a multi objective problem for the whole system and it will be used to solve the multi objective optimization problem constrained with equations below section 3 4 in the present study 3 4 constraints of the awomb in this study considering the available water supply in each unit potential water demand of agriculture potential water demand of urban ecological landscape and inflow to the large reservoirs constraints of the awomb are as follows 1 total

assuming some river ecological water can be used as urban ecological water simultaneously sa min and sc min is set as 0 1 and 0 3 table 2 3 the inflow of the reservoir for unit 11 and 17 with large reservoirs the inflow from upper units should be larger than the river ecological water 17 w ukt w rkt 3 5 implementation considering different water supply and demand situations as well as water resources regulation in hrb four scenarios are set in this study namely the representative year with scarce water 2007 and wet normal dry year in 2020s with water delivery from south to north water transfer project for the lower reach based on the precipitation time series in 1956 2013 we choose the year with annual precipitation of 75 50 and 25 guaranteed rate as the wet normal and dry year in 2020s respectively the natural streamflow agricultural water demand and crop yield in the corresponding year is then used in the agricultural water optimization in 2020s the other water resources not including water delivery from south to north water transfer project will be calculated as 30 of the sum of urban domestic water and industrial water and the effective irrigation water utilization rate will increase to 0 55 table 3 according to the reports of shijin district administration and water conservancy bureau of xinzhou the irrigation structure has been greatly improved in recent years thus the effective irrigation water utilization rate in 2020s is suitable for the industrial water quota urbanization rate and domestic water quota in 2020s since the methods to derive them have been validated by the statistical data r 0 70 p 0 01 the corresponding values in table 3 are credible in addition according to our survey in haihe river water conservancy commission the water delivery from south to north water transfer project in 2020s will be carried out as plans therefore the water delivery in table 3 is rational except the data in table 3 other data used in 2020s will be the same as that in the representative year in order to obtain the responses of yield and outflow to agricultural water optimization in 2020s the situation without agricultural water optimization in 2020s is set as follows the water resources of unit k is firstly used by the domestic industrial river ecological and other water use sectors in this unit then for the urban ecological water use sector in unit k the third is the agricultural water use sector in unit k and the last is the water use sectors in lower units of unit k based on the agricultural and urban ecological water before and after agricultural water optimization the crop yield and outflow in response to agricultural water optimization are derived from eqs 6 and 18 respectively 18 w outkt w kt w lifekt w indkt w otherkt x kt y

relationship between total crop yield and allocated irrigation water in a water unit prior to evaluating the regional cwpf of spring maize derived with vip model the modelling of spring maize has been validated with the observed data hu et al 2019 the simulated above ground biomass and leaf area index agree well with the observed value in 2011 r 0 98 p 0 01 at the plot scale shouyang the simulated yield of each county forced by the spatial pattern of the intrinsic quantum efficiency is consistent with the statistical yield r 0 6 p 0 01 during 2005 2013 at the regional scale further the sufficient irrigation in each spring maize unit under different scenarios is all less than 200 mm since the relationship between maize yield and irrigation is linear when the irrigation is less than 500 mm linker 2020 the linear cwpf shown in eq 6 is valid for spring maize according to the regional linear cwpf of spring maize accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of photosynthetic capacity the average net actual irrigation of all counties is about 110 mm from 2005 to 2013 which is similar to the values reported in the water resources bulletin of shanxi province 114 134 mm therefore the regional cwpf of spring maize derived from the vip model is credible the derived cwpf of winter wheat summer maize is evaluated via assessing variables used in cwpf in the representative year the total sufficient irrigation used in cwpf is 330 mm table 4 in the shijin district which is consistent with the value 300 320 mm reported by the heibei water resources department in addition the average sufficient irrigation of the winter wheat summer maize units is 295 mm which is close to the value 288 mm reported by ma et al 2011 in the same area the sufficient irrigation ranges from 261 to 330 mm in winter wheat summer maize units table 4 which is similar to the optimal irrigation 240 330 mm for sustainable water use hu et al 2010 it indicates that the sufficient irrigation in this study represents the maximum irrigation in actual situation with limited water resources considering cwpf is linear when water supply for irrigation is limited zhao et al 2017 the linear cwpf shown in eq 6 is rational for winter wheat summer maize units furthermore the total crop yield with sufficient irrigation employed in cwpf is 13169 kg ha 1 in the shijin district referring to the regional yield simulated by vip model lin 2003 hu et al 2014 the corresponding value in shijin district ranges from 12400 kg ha 1 to 13800 kg ha 1 hence the predicted total crop yield with sufficient irrigation here is credible however the total yield with sufficient irrigation for winter wheat and summer maize in this study is less than the potential yield without water or nutrition stress 16300 kg ha 1 mo et al 2005b because the photosynthetic capacity parameter here has accounted for the nutrition stress the variables employed in cwpf under different scenarios in 2020s table 4 are also analyzed for winter wheat summer maize unit the total yield with sufficient irrigation is determined by the sum of precipitation and sufficient irrigation volume r 0 79 p 0 05 particularly under the dry and normal year scenarios r 0 87 p 0 05 for spring maize unit the rainfed yield of irrigated farm is impacted not only by the precipitation but also the photosynthetic capacity parameter the gap between the yield with sufficient irrigation and rainfed yield is dominated by the irrigation volume particularly under the dry and normal year scenario r 0 79 indicating that maize yield is sensitive to drought which is consistent with the results reported by other researchers potopova et al 2015 meng et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zdenek et al 2017 overall the derived cwpfs are effective 4 2 natural runoff evaluation the simulated natural runoff is firstly evaluated in the base period 1956 1979 with limited anthropogenic effects on river discharge yang and tian 2009 huang and mo 2015 the results fig 6 show that the simulated monthly value in the calibration period 1956 1960 and validation period 1961 1979 agreed well with the observed value for two different sub basins the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients are 0 82 and 0 75 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for xiaojue fig 6a while 0 75 and 0 88 for pingshan fig 6b the correlated coefficients are no less than 0 9 in both calibration and validation periods for these two sub basins according to wang et al 2013 the correlated coefficient is 0 93 in the calibration period and 0 79 in the validation period at xiaojue for a two parameter monthly hydrological model while the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is 0 86 and 0 62 respectively the difference of simulation efficiency between the calibration period and validation period of vip model is lower than that in wang et al 2013 implying the robust performance of this distributed ecohydrological model in term of natural runoff reproduction the reproduced natural runoff is secondly evaluated in the representative year via the difference between water demand and water supply including the natural runoff fig 7 primarily the calculated water demand is assessed for units in shanxi province the total water demand was about 6 41 108 m3 which was larger than the reported value 6 05 108 m3 in shanxi water resources bulletin by 6 considering that the river ecological water demand of all units was calculated as the minimum natural monthly runoff in recent 10 years while in fact a few rivers dried up the calculated water demand was acceptable the water supply and demand for the whole basin was about 33 51 108 m3 and 33 55 108m3 with a difference of 0 12 this indicates the reproduced natural runoff included in the water supply is effective 4 3 results of agricultural water optimization after agricultural water optimization in the representative year table 5 the agricultural water for most units in the upper reach declines particularly in the spring maize units with great rainfed yield such as jiehepu and quankou unit and winter wheat summer maize units with great actual irrigation water consumption such as pingshan and huangbizhuang unit moreover the urban ecological water in most units also decreases particularly in the units with larger urban ecological water demand these water decreases lead to a water increase of 0 74 108 m3 in the lower reach as a result the water deficit in the lower reach decreases by 4 and the crop yield in the lower reach increases by 0 44 108 kg about 1 25 for the whole basin there is a yield increase of 0 19 108 kg about 0 4 furthermore the outflow of most units increases after agricultural water optimization as well as the runoff into the sea fig 8 which can effectively improve the ecology and environment of the basin in 2020s there will be a water surplus of 5 79 108 m3 18 water deficit of 3 09 108 m3 8 and water deficit of 11 72 108 m3 26 under the wet normal and dry year scenario for the whole basin respectively fig 9 under the wet year scenario agricultural and urban ecological water of each unit will be fully satisfied and the agricultural and ecological benefits will reach maximum value 100 in addition the difference of the agricultural water satisfaction ratio for all units will be the smallest after agricultural water optimization under the normal and dry year scenarios table 6 the satisfaction ratio of urban ecological water for the whole basin can only reach 80 and 76 the maximum satisfaction ratio of the agricultural water for the units in the upper reach will be about 23 and 14 and the yield in irrigated farmlands for the whole basin can only reach 97 and 82 of that with sufficient irrigation respectively due to water optimization under the normal and dry year scenarios the water supply from the upper reach to shijin district will increase by 3 11 108 m3 and 5 44 108 m3 and the yield for the whole basin will increase by 1 108 kg i e 2 and 3 108 kg i e 7 respectively because the irrigation water use efficiency in the shijin district is greater under the dry year scenario than that under the normal year scenario the agricultural water optimization under the former scenario will be relatively more effective 5 discussion 5 1 effects of spatial difference of natural runoff and crop photosynthetic capacity the natural runoff takes up more than 60 of the water supply for the whole basin in all scenarios the water resources allocated to agricultural and urban ecological sectors correlate significantly p 0 01 r 0 59 with local natural runoff for all water units in the representative year dry and normal year in 2020s as the crop yield correlates significantly p 0 01 r 0 99 with the allocated agricultural water the local natural runoff can explain 49 63 and 62 p 0 01 of the crop yield for all units after water optimization in the representative year dry and normal year in 2020s respectively further the local natural runoff can explain more than 45 p 0 01 of the outflow for the upper units in all these three scenarios overall the spatial heterogeneity of natural runoff significantly impacts the agricultural production and outflow in water optimization the crop yield after water optimization is impacted by not only the allocated agricultural water but also the rainfed yield of irrigated farm p 0 01 r 0 99 the rainfed yield per unit area in spring maize units correlates with the intrinsic quantum efficiency significantly r 0 53 p 0 05 in the normal year in 2020s but it is not significant in the representative or dry year in 2020s it is because precipitation in the latter two scenarios is less and the crop yield correlates more closely with water the rainfed yield per unit area in winter wheat summer maize units can be explained more than 49 by the maximum catalytic capacity of rubisco of winter wheat in all the representative year dry and normal year in 2020s therefore the effect of the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity on agricultural production is essential in water optimization 5 2 uncertainty of parameters in the awomb the weights of objective functions table 2 in this study are set according to the advice of experts which is subjective taking the representative year as an example we analyz the uncertainty of this method by fixing the weight of one objective function fig 10 as a result when the weight of agricultural benefit is fixed as 0 1 the agricultural benefit keeps as 0 75 fig 10a when the weight of social benefit is fixed as 0 1 fig 10b the agricultural benefit increases from 0 75 to 0 85 as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 to 0 7 and the agricultural benefit almost keeps stable as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 7 to 0 9 when the weight of ecological benefit is fixed as 0 1 fig 10c the agricultural benefit increases from 0 75 to 0 85 as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 to 0 5 and the agricultural benefit almost keeps stable as the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 5 to 0 9 these results indicate that when the weight of agricultural benefit is no less than 0 7 i e 0 6 the optimal agricultural benefit can be obtained when the weight of agricultural benefit increases from 0 7 to 0 9 fig 10b and c the agricultural and social benefits almost keep stable and the ecological benefit reaches its relatively small value when the weight of agricultural benefit is 0 9 and 0 7 in fig 10b and fig 10c respectively it implies the weight of agricultural benefit should be larger than 0 7 and smaller than 0 9 if the minimum increasing volume of weight is set as 0 1 the weight of agricultural benefit should be 0 8 the ecological and social benefits are considered equally important their weights should be both 0 1 therefore the weights used in this work 0 8 0 1 and 0 1 for the agricultural ecological and social benefit respectively are valid the minimum satisfaction ratio of agricultural water sa min and urban ecological water sc min is determined somewhat subjective table 2 in the representative year we analyz the impact of these two parameters on agricultural water optimization fig 11 it is found that when sa min is fixed as any value ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 the ecological benefit increases significantly r 0 83 p 0 05 as sc min increases from 0 1 to 1 0 fig 11c indicating the ecological benefit is sensitive to sc min further the greater the sa min the smaller the increasing rate of ecological benefit resulting from sc min increase implying the effect of sc min on ecological benefit decreases as sa min increases the reason is that when sa min increases the water allocated to ecology becomes less which leads to smaller ecology benefit similarly the social benefit i e equity of agricultural water is proved to be sensitive to sa min and the effect of sa min on social benefit decreases as sc min increases moreover as sa min or sc min changes the variances of ecological and social benefits are about 0 1 fig 11c d and that of the agricultural benefit is about 0 01 fig 11b due to the weights of the former two are both small and that of the latter one is great the variance of total benefit is also about 0 01 fig 11a it shows that the uncertainty of sa min and sc min is limited in addition when sa min and sc min are 0 1 and 0 3 respectively table 2 the value of the main objective function i e agricultural benefit is relatively great fig 11b thus the values of sa min and sc min in this work are rational 5 3 implications and limitations the results show that the developed agricultural water optimization scheme involving the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity and natural runoff is effective at the basin scale however there are some limitations of our agricultural water optimization scheme first the distributed ecohydrological model is coupled in agricultural water optimization via providing data which cannot completely reflect the dynamic agro hydrological process at the basin scale second cwpf is constructed for the whole growing season due to the shortage of seasonal photosynthetic capacity parameters which cannot reflect the impacts of irrigation at different growth stages on crop yield however the effect of irrigation depends on the particular growth stage singh et al 1991 for example water restriction has the greatest negative effects on maize grain production during or after silking by reducing the number of kernels and limiting kernel filling soderlund et al 2014 third three years with different annual precipitation are chosen to demonstrate different water resource scenarios in 2020s which is limited in water optimization at the monthly scale last but not least the agricultural water in this work is a rough estimate since the detailed map of crop pattern is not available the developed agricultural water optimization model with vip model is appropriate for water resources planning in a river basin where human activities such as irrigation have great impact on the discharge or crop yield particular the latter due to that the response of crop yield to crop photosynthetic capacity heterogeneity can be efficiently reproduced with vip model the spatial pattern of crop photosynthetic capacity parameter is the prime requirement to extend the developed awomb in other areas more information regarding the groundwater other water resources domestic water demand industrial water demand urban ecological water demand and the spatial distribution of irrigated farm is required for water demand calculation this work also provides a pragmatic methodology to employ the distributed model to manage water resources at the basin scale which is accomplished by providing cwpfs involving the spatial heterogeneity of sensitive crop yield parameter and runoff of sub basins 6 conclusions in order to improve the water utilization and agricultural production in a basin with intensive irrigation the awomb was developed with the help of a distributed ecohydrological model vip model namely the cwpf in the awomb accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of the effect of photosynthetic capacity on irrigation water productivity was obtained with vip model as well as the natural runoff of sub basins after evaluation of cwpf and natural runoff agricultural water optimization was conducted under different scenarios and the response of crop yield and outflow was analyzed the irrigation water calculated with cwpf considering the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity reproduced the actual volume well the variables used in this kind of cwpf were rational under different scenarios the generated natural runoff of different sub basins agreed with the observed value and was effective in the water balance equation the agricultural water optimization method involving the spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity and natural runoff can be used to manage agricultural water at the basin scale the local natural runoff dominated the water allocation to the water units in the agricultural water optimization at the basin scale in the representative year the optimal agricultural water allocation scheme not only enhanced the agricultural benefit but also improved the river ecological water and the runoff into the sea after agricultural water optimization due to agricultural water decrease in the upper sub basins where rainfed crop yield or actual irrigation water was high the water supply in the lower reach with great potential crop productivity increased by 5 resulting in a crop yield increase of 0 19 108 kg for the whole basin however some urban ecological water and equity of agricultural water was sacrificed in 2020s there will be a water surplus for the whole basin under the wet year scenario and the crop yield will reach the yield with sufficient irrigation under the normal and dry year scenarios there will be water deficits for the whole basin in order to guarantee crop yield the water supply from the upper reach to the lower reach should increase in the dry and normal year scenarios if the water supply from the upper reach to the lower reach increases by 5 44 108 m3 and 3 11 108 the yield in the lower reach will increase by 3 108 kg 7 and 1 108 kg i e 2 respectively further the effect of spatial heterogeneity of crop photosynthetic capacity on agricultural production will be particularly important in the normal year scenario with the distributed ecohydrological model a practical agricultural water optimization model is constructed for the whole basin at the annual scale this technique can be used for water resource planning in

appendix a the natural runoff reproduction in the upstream units since the streamflow in the upper reach changed abruptly around 1979 yang and tian 2009 huang and mo 2015 the period from 1956 to 2013 was separated into the base period 1956 1979 and changing period 1980 2013 in the base period the effect of human activities on the streamflow could be neglected thus the observed streamflow was considered as the natural streamflow in the changing period the effect of human activities was significant and the observed streamflow was impacted by human activities such as irrigation with the natural streamflow in the base period vip model can be calibrated and validated to simulate the natural runoff with the calibrated parameters the natural runoff of sub basins in the changing period

lower than that of ms and scs cn method in addition the performance of all four methods is further evaluated based on the watershed characteristics such as landuse soil type drainage area and mean rainfall and the results show that in all cases the asma scs cn method performs much better than the rest of the methods overall the improved performance of asma scs cn can be attributed to the inclusion of sma along with the static infiltration component for representing the complete picture of sma system in modelling rainfall runoff process keywords scs cn method soil moisture accounting static infiltration activation soil moisture threshold soil moisture rainfall runoff process 1 introduction estimation of direct surface runoff resulting from a storm rainfall event is needed for myriad applications including planning watershed conservation and management practices measures for mitigation of drought and flood hazards stream flow prediction reservoir operation and irrigation scheduling various methods available for estimation of direct surface runoff have limited applicability in data scarce watersheds due to large input data requirement uncertainty in specifying the parameters values and the difference between the spatial scales of the application i e a catchment versus a field gupta et al 2019a b sahu et al 2010 shi et al 2009 the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method developed by the united states department of agriculture usda scs 1956 is one of the most commonly applied methods in practical hydrology for computing the direct surface runoff

2003a michel et al 2005 jain et al 2006 shi et al 2009 soulis et al 2009 and bartlett et al 2016 santikari and murdoch 2018 baiamonte 2019 notably the amcs only explains a portion of the inter event variation of the cn parameter ogden et al 2017 hjelmfelt 1991 for any change in amc say from amci to amciii on a given catchment a sudden jump in the cn value i e from cn i to cn iii invariably occurs and this variability is discontinuous in nature which ultimately results in a quantum jump in computed runoff mccuen 1989 2002 mishra et al 2003a b singh et al 2013 singh et al 2015 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 found that the swing between the amc classes and rainfall patterns has a greater impact on the runoff generating mechanisms in the watershed than the variation in rainfall depth many investigators argue that the initial soil moisture condition of the watershed is the most important factor to determine the predictive outcome of an event williams and laseur 1976 brocca et al 2009a b de michele and salvadori 2002 mishra and singh 2004a b sahu et al 2010 bonaccorso et al 2017 michel et al 2005 worth mentioning that the initial soil moisture conditions represent a major parameter in the surface runoff generation bonaccorso et al 2017 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 mentioned that the scs cn method does not directly use the actual antecedent moisture in the computations and rather classifies amc into three discrete classes the soil moisture accounting sma procedure was developed by michel et al 2005 to rectify the classical problem of sudden jump in scs cn method the sma procedure developed by michel et al 2005 hereafter michel vazken perrin mvp method is based on the notion that higher the moisture store level higher the fraction of rainfall that is converted into runoff if the moisture storage level is full all the rainfall will become runoff kannan et al 2007 found that the combination of sma procedure with the scs cn method is necessary for predicting runoff from rainfall realistically due to the cn variation from storm to storm beck et al 2009 stated that soil moisture is a key factor in determining the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration and the soil moisture proxies are calculated to account for a catchment s wetness status prior to the rainfall event in the hope to improve stream flow prediction camici et al 2011 stated that a sma procedure has to incorporate all the above mentioned conditions and termed the soil moisture conditions before the storm event as design soil moisture rajib and merwade 2016 observed that the cn method suffers from several structural inconsistencies and lack of theoretical foundation which need to be addressed to enable improved sma system in in the model and developed swat sma model for improved streamflow predictions ogden et al 2017 suggested that a new runoff prediction model shall have valid theoretical underpinnings with needed model capabilities and verifiable outperform existing models to solve specific problem e g water management erosion sedimentation etc recently cho and engel 2019 developed a long term hydrologic simulation model by coupling the original scs cn method and revised sma procedure to overcome the structural and hydrological inconsistency associated and to account for the sma procedure in the original scs cn method the basic proportionality concept c sr concept gupta et al 2019a b mishra and singh 2003a b singh et al 2015 has been modified accordingly and advanced versions of the scs cn method have also been developed by various researchers worldwide e g mishra et al 2004 ajmal et al 2015 gupta et al 2019a b kannan et al 2008 sahu et al 2007 michel et al 2005 singh et al 2015 mishra and singh 2003a b proposed a revised scs cn based hereafter mishra singh ms method by incorporating the static infiltration component fc in the basic proportionality concept however the method does not consider the sma procedure in its formulation mvp method michel et al 2005 incorporated the sma procedure in the scs cn method and developed renewed and improved version of scs cn method the mvp method conceptualizes the sma procedure based on threshold soil moisture sa as the soil moisture barrier which has to be overcome before runoff to start however if we critically examine the mvp method it can be diagnosed that it does ignores the static infiltration component of infiltration which also plays an important role in assessing the sma system mishra and singh 2003a b interestingly mishra and singh 2003a b highlighted that the original scs cn method also does not include the static component of infiltration rather considers only the dynamic capillary portion of the infiltration and hence it underestimates infiltration therefore there exists a scope for further development of an improved scs cn method based on the coupling of the concept of sma procedure mvp method and static infiltration ms method for a complete assessment of sma system and has been termed here as the activation soil moisture accounting asma system for improving the overall rainfall runoff modelling process keeping in view of the above this study has twofold objectives as i to develop a asma based scs cn asma scs cn method by coupling the sma concept of mvp method with fc of ms method to present a complete assessment of sma system and ii to compare the performance of the asma scs cn method with the original scs cn method mvp method and ms method and by applying a large dataset of 56 343 storm events from 164 small to large watersheds in the united states this paper has been organised as follows section 1 introduces the rationale behind the development of the proposed asma scs cn method explores the concepts which can be coupled with the scs cn method for this purpose and outlines the objectives of the study section 2 deals with the study area and data used and presents a broad overview of the data used in this study section 3 briefly discusses the original scs cn method mishra singh ms method scs cn method coupled with static infiltration component michel vazken perrin mvp method scs cn method coupled with

with the application of all the four methods i e original scs cn method ms method mvp method and asma scs cn method using storm event data of 164 watersheds this sections also discusses the parameter

indices factors affecting model uncertainty rationale behind the improved performance of the asma scs cn method as compared to the scs cn ms mvp methods performance evaluation of these methods based on watershed characteristics such as land use soil type landuse and soil type combination and drainage area finally section 5 deals with the important conclusions drawn from the study a workflow of the methodology is also given in fig 1 to have an overall structural organization of the paper 2 study area and data used to test the activation soil moisture concept in the scs cn method the present study utilizes the rainfall runoff datasets of 164 watersheds with areas varying from 0 2 to 17 353 ha from different regions of usa fig 2 these watersheds have different landuse pasture mixed cultivated and soil type silty sandy clayey data for a total of 56 343 storm events from these watersheds has been used in this study the number of events ranged from 8 to 1924 for different watersheds these rainfall runoff datasets were derived from usda agricultural research service usda ars water database which is a collection of rainfall and stream flow data from small agricultural watersheds of the united states the database is available on http www ars usda gov arsdb html the existing rain gauge networks range from one station to over 200 stations per watershed the period of record for individual watersheds vary from 1 to 50 years some watersheds have been in continuous observation since the mid 1930 s usda also maintains various types of ancillary data such as air temperature land management practices topography and soil types along with rainfall and streamflow data 3 methodology 3 1 original soil conservation service curve number method a brief structural and conceptual background of the original soil conservation service curve number scs cn method is given here as follows the method is based on the water balance equation along with two fundamental relationships the first relationship equates the ratio of actual amount of direct surface runoff q to the total rainfall p or maximum potential surface runoff to the ratio of actual infiltration f to the amount of the potential maximum retention s mishra and singh 2003a b singh et al 2010 the second relationship relates the initial abstraction ia to s and also described as potential post initial abstraction retention mccuen 2002 as a water balance equation 1 p i a f q b basic proportional equality first hypothesis 2 q p i a f s c ia s relationship second hypothesis 3 ia Œª s the values of p q and s are in depth dimensions while the initial abstraction coefficient Œª is dimensionless the basic proportional equality eq 2 is also known as c sr concept where c q p ia and sr f s jain et al 2006 mishra and singh 2002 2003a b sahu et al 2010 santikari and murdoch 2018 singh et al 2010 2015 combination of eqs 1 and 2 leads to the basic equation of the original scs cn as 4 q p i a 2 p i a s i f p i a q 0 otherwise for Œª 0 2 the coupling of eqs 3 and 4 results in 5 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s equation 5 is the popular form of the original scs cn method having only one parameter s the parameter s of the scs cn method depends on soil type land use hydrologic condition and amc the parameter s is mapped onto a dimensionless curve number cn varying in a range 0 cn 100 as 6 s 25400 cn 254 where s has the unit in mm 3 2 mishra singh method for inclusion of the cumulative static portion of infiltration fc in the original scs cn method mishra and singh 2003a b modified the proportionality concept c sr concept as 7a q p i a f c f d s the water balance equation can be written as 7b p i a f d f c q where fd and fc are the cumulative dynamic capillary and static gravitational infiltration respectively the coupling of eqs 7a b yields the expression of q as 8 q p i a f c 2 p i a f c s for p i a f c 0 otherwise for Œª 0 2 eq 8 can be written as 9 q p 0 2 s f c 2 p 0 8 s f c for p 0 2 s f c 0 otherwise where 10 f c f c t where fc is the minimum infiltration rate mm h and t is the rainfall duration h the mishra singh method has been denoted as ms method in the forthcoming sections 3 3 michel vazken perrin method michel et al 2005 incorporated the sma procedure in the scs cn method and developed a renewed version of scs cn method expressed as 11 if v 0 s a p then q 0 if sa p v0 sa then 12 q p s a v 0 2 p v 0 s a s if sa v0 sa s then 13 q p 1 s s a v 0 2 s 2 s s a v 0 p where v0 initial soil moisture i e the soil moisture before the storm event sa threshold soil moisture v0 ia and ia initial abstractions the values of sa and v0 are given in depth dimensions the michel vazken perrin method has been referred to as mvp method in the forthcoming sections 3 4 development of activation soil moisture accounting asma based scs cn method for the development of the activation soil moisture accounting asma based scs cn asma scs cn method eq 8 was selected as the base equation which is valid for the accumulated rainfall p and accumulated runoff q for any storm event and considers the static infiltration in its formulation however it can be shown that eq 8 is hydrologically unstable as it does not yield q 0 for p ia fc now assuming that v is the soil moisture store at any time t during a storm event p is the accumulated rainfall up to the time t and q is the corresponding runoff the water balance equation can be written as 14 v v 0 p q substituting the value of q from eq 8 in eq 14 we get 15 v v 0 p p i a f c 2 p i a f c s the runoff rate q dq dt can be obtained by taking the derivative of eq 8 as 16 q p i a f c p i a f c 2 s p i a f c s 2 p if p i a f c where p is the rainfall intensity rate and is equal to dp dt now deriving the value of p from eq 15 and putting into eq 16 results into 17 q v v 0 i a f c 2 s v v 0 i a f c s 2 p i f v v 0 i a f c q 0 otherwise the detailed derivations are given in appendix a now if we critically look at eq 17 then the numerator has ia fc in addition to the initial soil moisture v0 notably the v0 represents the state of the system mishra and singh 2003a b michel et al 2005 this ia fc acts as the as the activation soil moisture vasm and term v0 ia fc is taken as the revised threshold soil moisture vet v0 vasm graphically this has been shown in fig 3 eq 17 shows that if the amount of moisture is less than the vet then there will be no runoff and hence for runoff generation the moisture store has to be more than the vet therefore the complete sma system should consider the revised threshold soil moisture vet and the concept of threshold soil moisture sa is just the part of the complete sma system on replacing ia v0 fc with vet eq 17 leads to 18 q v v et s 2 v v et s p if v v et q 0 otherwise taking the derivative of eq 14 can be expressed as 19 dv dt p q now coupling the expressions for vasm and vet in eq 8 ms method the base method incorporating the fc yields 20 q p v 0 v et 2 p v 0 v et s if p v 0 v et q 0 otherwise if the soil is fully saturated before the start of storm event i e v0 vet s then q should be equal to p from eq 20 however putting v0 vet s in eq 20 yields a value of q greater than p which is not possible in reality as 21 q p s 2 p 2 s therefore the ms method eq 20 is hydrologically not sound and needs some conceptual and structural modifications notably the ms method does not consider the sma procedure in its formulation therefore a hydrologically sound and structurally stable formulation can be obtained by recalculating the formula for the total amount of rainfall and runoff p and q by integrating the eq 19 and using the value of q from eq 18 as 22 q p 1 s v et v 0 2 s 2 s v et v 0 p the detailed derivations are given in appendix b eq 22 shows that if v0 vet s then q p and this is consistent both mathematically and hydrologically similarly for the intermediate and lowest conditions i e i for v0 vet but p v0 vet i e vet p v0 vet the generated runoff q can be computed using eq 20 and ii for v0 vet p i e rainfall p is not large enough to overcome the initial moisture deficit of the soil moisture store then q 0 these conditions are summarised as follows 23 if v 0 v et p then q 0 if vet p v0 vet then 24 q p v 0 v et 2 p v 0 v et s if v et v 0 v et s then 25 q p 1 s v et v 0 2 s 2 s v et v 0 p eqs 23 25 represent the asma scs cn method the proposed approach is more logical and hydrologically more stable and complete than the other methods under study a summary of all the four cn based methods is given in table 1 3 5 applications of the methods all the four methods i e the original scs cn method eq 6 scs cn mishra singh method eq 8 ms michel vazken perrin method eqs 11 13 mvp and the asma scs cn method eqs 23 25 table 1 were applied to the large us rainfall runoff datasets 164 watersheds with 56 343 storm events to test the comparative performance of these methods 3 5 1 parameter estimation to estimate the different parameters of all the four methods i e the original scs cn method scs cn mishra singh method ms michel vazken perrin method mvp and the proposed asma scs cn method simplified expressions were used in this study as suggested by mishra et al 2006b and singh et al 2015 expressed here 26 v 0 Œ± p 5 s 27 s a Œ≤ s 28 f c f c t where p5 is the antecedent rainfall amount mm fc is the minimum infiltration rate mm h t is the rainfall duration h and Œ± Œ≤ are coefficients the marquardt 1963 algorithm of constrained least squares mcls was used for optimizing the parameters of all the four methods i e scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn the marquardt provided an elegant and improved version of the non linear optimization method originally proposed by levenberg 1944 the method primarily provides a smooth variation between the two extremes of the inverse hessian method and the steepest descent method the latter is used when the trial solution is far from the minimum and it tends continuously towards the former as the minimum is approached this levenberg marquardt method is also known as marquardt method which works well in practice and has become the standard of non linear least squares routines mishra and singh 2003a in application to the scs cn method the initial estimate of cn was taken as 50 and was allowed to vary in the range of 0 to 100 for all the methods except scs cn the initial estimate of parameter s was taken as 125 mm and was assumed to vary in the range of 0 to 2500 mm for mvp method the v0 and sa parameters were allowed to vary in the range of 0 to 500 mm with its initial estimate of 100 mm for the proposed asma scs cn method an initial estimate of both the parameters Œ± and Œ≤ was taken as 0 01 and was allowed to vary in the range of 0 00 and 2 00 and 0 00 to 1 00 respectively parameter fc was allowed to vary in the range of 0 00 and 25 00 with an initial estimate 1 00 the vet was estimated as the sum of sa and fc i e sa fc 3 5 2 performance evaluation of methods the process of performance evaluation of models is of primary importance not only in their development and calibration process but also when communicating the results to other researchers and to the stakeholder schaefli and gupta 2007 for evaluating the performance of all the four methods having different parameters seven indices of agreement between observed and computed runoff values are used in this study these performance indices are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae standard error se and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr as discussed here mathematically these indices are expressed as 29 nse 1 i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 i 1 n q obs q obs i 2 30 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 nrmse 31 1 n i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 q obs 32 pbias i 1 n q obs q comp i i 1 n q obs i 100 33 mae 1 n i 1 n q obs q comp i se 34 1 n m 1 i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 rsr 35 rmse stde v obs i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 i 1 n q obs q obs i 2 where qobs is the observed runoff qcomp is the computed runoff qobs is the mean of observed runoff values in a watershed n is the total number of rainfall runoff events m the number of model parameters and i is an integer varying from 1 to n the nse compares the variance of the errors against the observations how well the plot of observations versus simulations fit the 1 1 line ahmadisharaf et al 2019 the nse ranges between and 1 0 1 inclusive with nse 1 being the optimal value the values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance moriasi et al 2007 a value of zero indicates that the observed mean is as good a predictor as the model while negative values indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model ahmadisharaf et al 2019 moriasi et al 2007 wilcox et al 1990 coffey et al 2004a b mccuen et al 2006 stated that nse is a very good criterion for assessing comparative performance of hydrologic models according to legates and mccabe 1999 the nse is sensitive to the differences in the observed and model simulated means and variance and can be thought of as an improvement over the coefficient of determination r2 widely used for evaluating the goodness of fit of hydrologic and hydro climatic models the nse cannot also help identify the bias and is sensitive to extreme values criss and winston 2008 larabi et al 2018 and if the goal is to quantify the bias the pbias can be used krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2015 alamdari et al 2017 alamdari and sample 2019 according to p√©rez s√°nchez et al 2019 however nse cannot help identify model bias moriasi et al 2015 and it should be complemented by other measures such as pbias in order to consider how well the model simulates the average magnitudes for the outputs and to identify the average model simulation bias over prediction versus under prediction therefore pbias has been used in this study to identify the average model simulation bias by all the four methods similarly normalized root mean square error nrmse is an another most widely used statistical indicator for model performance evaluation santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 mishra et al 2006a the nrmse standardizes the rmse values into a common and comparable scale ranatunga et al 2017 the rmse and mae can be used to determine confidence intervals in model predictions and it is possible to incorporate measurement uncertainty harmel and smith 2007 harmel et al 2010 moriai et al 2015 the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr chu and shirmohammadi 2004 moriasi et al 2007 vazquez am√°bile and engel 2005 standardizes rmse using the observations standard deviation and it combines both an error index and the additional information recommended by legates and mccabe 1999 rsr incorporates the benefits of error index statistics and includes a scaling normalization factor so the resulting statistics and reported values can apply to various output responses the lower rsr the lower the rmse and the better the model simulation performance rsr is a relatively new statistical performance measure has not been widely used in the h wq modelling literature moriasi et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 established a performance criterion for model s evaluation where nse 0 50 unsatisfactory 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory 0 65 nse 0 75 good and 0 75 nse 1 00 very good according to ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 a model is judged to be very good if nse 0 90 good if 0 90 nse 0 80 acceptable if 0 80 nse 0 65 and unsatisfactory if 0 65 nse the value of rmse equal to 0 shows a perfect agreement between observed and estimated values the lower the rmse the better is the model s performance and vice versa the pbias measures model s tendency to underestimate or overestimate values negative positive value of pbias indicates model overestimation underestimation whereas a value of zero shows perfect fit moriasi et al 2007 for the hydrologic models performance was indicated as unsatisfactory if pbias 25 fair if 15 pbias 25 good if 10 pbias 15 and very good if pbias 10 durbude et al 2011 moriasi et al 2007 the nrmse and rsr estimate show how important these are errors relative to the magnitude of the observations ahmadisharaf et al 2019 according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is rated as very good if 0 00 rsr 0 50 good if 0 50 rsr 0 60 satisfactory if 0 60 rsr 0 70 and unsatisfactory if rsr greater than 0 70 the standard error se of all the four methods has also been evaluated to evaluate the methods performance higher the se poorer is the model performance and vice versa a value of se equal to zero exhibits a perfect fit se has the advantages of having the same units as the variable and accounts for the methods degree of freedom in case of comparing the methods having different number of parameters which is generally the case in most of the applications the hydrological models are subjected to the uncertainty ahmadisharaf et al 2018 the uncertainty in hydrological modeling arises from input datasets shrestha et al 2009 montanari et al 2009 observed flow choice of hydrological model model structure and parameters accounting of relevant physical processes in the watershed choice of goodness of fit measures and calibration validation period krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 krzysztofowicz and herr 2001 montanari and brath 2004 liu and gupta 2007 mcmillan et al 2010 2011 2012 renard et al 2010 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 and also the experience of the modeler in manual calibration orth et al 2015 martina and todini 2008 the parameter uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges in hydrological modeling and it reflects the inability to specify exact values of model parameters renard et al 2010 and it may stem from errors in input data and observations used for model conditioning navratil et al 2011 also discussed various sources of uncertainty associated with the observations such as i choice of suitable instrument ii data acquisition strategy iii field sampling procedures for water and sediment sampling iv laboratory procedures and v discharge and water level measurement among many others 4 results and discussions 4 1 parameter estimation as discussed in section 3 5 1 the optimized parameters values of all the four methods i e scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn for 164 usda study watersheds are given in appendix i the statistical range of all the parameters for four methods is also given in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that the average value of parameter cn for the scs cn method is 82 03 with min and max values as 30 80 and 96 30 respectively table 2 also show that the min infiltration rate fc for asma scs cn method is lower 0 52 than that of ms method 0 99 the average values of parameters Œ± and Œ≤ are found to be 0 24 and 0 12 with min to max values as 0 01 to 1 30 and 0 00 to 7 00 respectively singh et al 2015 also reported the average values of Œ± and Œ≤ as 0 220 and 0 118 while applying their modified sma based mscs cn mmscs cn method to 35 usda watersheds dataset the average values of parameter s for asma scs cn mvp and ms method are found to be 232 80 mm and 227 61 mm and 46 24 mm respectively while applying to 164 usda study watersheds 4 2 comparative performance evaluation of the methods the performance of all the four methods is evaluated on the basis of their i visual closeness of the observed and computed runoff and ii goodness of fit gof in terms of nse rmse nrmse mae se pbias and rsr as discussed in section 3 5 2 worth highlighting that any method having greater nse and lesser rmse nrmse mae se rsr as well as pbias either positive or negative than the other methods can be ranked as superior and vice versa for visual comparison fig 4 a h show the comparison between the observed and computed runoff by all the four methods for 8 different watersheds in general it can be observed from these figures that the asma scs cn method resembles a better agreement with the observed runoff and are closest to the 1 1 line than the other methods fig 4a h also show that the r2 value of the ama scs cn is higher than the rest of the three methods i e scs cn ms and mvp another visual comparison event wise is also shown in fig 5 a d it is evident from these figures that the asmascs cn method has better agreement between the observed and computed runoff than the scs cn ms mvp methods there is a larger mismatch between the observed and computed runoff for most of the events underestimation in case of ms and scs cn method than the mvp and asma scs cn method the improved performance of the asma scs cn method may be due attributed to inclusion of sma and fc in its model structure and overall in the rainfall runoff process similar results are found for most of the watersheds not shown here as discussed above the gof statistics is evaluated in terms of nse and error indices as rmse nrmse mae se pbias and rsr and the results are given in appendix iia b for all the 164 watersheds the mean value of nse for asma scs cn is found to be highest 0 696 followed by mvp 0 643 ms 0 571 and scs cn 0 53 respectively while application to all the 164 watersheds similar results can also be drawn from fig 6a which shows the plot of nse values for all the for methods on 164 watersheds annexure ii a b it can be seen from fig 6 a that the asma scs cn method has higher nse as compared to the other methods i e mvp ms and scs cn for most of the watersheds the improved performance of asma scs cn can be attributed to the inclusion of sma along with the static infiltration component for representing the complete picture of sma system in modelling rainfall runoff process the range of variation of nse values for all the four methods is also shown using box whisker plots as shown in fig 6b it can be observed from fig 5 b that the asma scs cn method has the highest median value of nse 0 71 varying from 0 11 to 0 97 with inter quartile range iqr as 0 62 0 80 followed by mvp with nse 0 67 varying from 0 10 to 0 0 96 and iqr as 0 57 0 74 ms with nse 0 61 varying from 0 02 to 0 97 and iqr range as 0 46 0 72 and scs cn with nse 0 58 varying from 0 01 to 0 92 and iqr as 0 44 0 69 the nse performance rating as per the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 is also given in table 3a the asma scs cn method performs very good on 87 watersheds good on 63 satisfactory on 23 and unsatisfactory on 15 watersheds the mvp method is found to perform very good on 63 watersheds good on 73 watersheds satisfactory on 31 watersheds and unsatisfactory on 23 watersheds the ms method performs very good on 52 watersheds good on 55 watersheds satisfactory on 30 watersheds and unsatisfactory on 47 watersheds the scs cn method performs very good on the least no of watersheds i e 35 good on 55 watersheds satisfactory on 38 watersheds and performs unsatisfactory on the larger number of the watersheds i e 56 therefore on the basis of moriasi et al 2007 nse performance rating the order of performance is asma scs cn mvp ms scs cn method and the improved performance is attributed to the inclusion of fc in the sma procedure resulting into the improved representation of the rainfall runoff process similarly table 3b shows the performance rating based on the criteria given by ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 the results show that the scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn perform very good on 1 6 1 and 10 watersheds good on 6 9 13 and 30 watersheds and acceptable on 45 49 76 and 68 watersheds respectively the rmc performance rating also show the improved performance of the asma scs cn method than the mvp ms and scs cn method fig 6 c also shows the nse variation with watershed area for all the four methods here it is found that the method asma scs cn performs better than the other methods for small as well as large watersheds the nse values at 50 75 and 90 probability of exceedance fig 6d resulting from the application of all the four methods on 164 watersheds are found to be 0 56 0 60 0 66 0 70 0 66 0 71 0 73 0 77 and 0 72 0 76 0 77 0 82 respectively for scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn methods fig 5d shows that the asma scs cn method has the highest values of nse corresponding for all the three probability of exceedance during application to 164 watersheds the performance of all the four methods is further evaluated based on rmse as shown in fig 7 a b and appendix iia for all the 164 watersheds fig 7 a and appendix iia show the rmse variation for 164 watersheds it is evident from fig 7 a and appendix iia that the asma scs cn method has lower rmse as compared to mvp ms and scs cn method fig 7 b shows the box whisker plots of rmse values obtained by applying all the four methods to 164 watersheds fig 7 b shows that the asma scs cn method has lower median value 4 03 mm and inter quartile range 3 07 5 97 mm compared to other methods i e mvp median value 4 56 mm and iqr 3 29 6 33 mm ms median value 4 61 mm and iqr 3 57 6 70 mm and scs cn median value 5 04 mm and iqr 3 92 7 14 mm the mean values of the rmse are found to be 4 653 mm 5 058 5 415 and 5 643 respectively for asma scs cn mvs ms and scs cn method therefore based on rmse criteria the asma scs cn is found to perform best followed by mvp ms and scs cn methods using the rmse statistics the performance of all the four methods based on the different watershed characteristics is also discussed in the forthcoming section the nrmse statistics is also evaluated to assess the comparative performance of all the four methods as shown in fig 8a b and appendix iib fig 8a shows the variation of nrmse for all the four methods on 164 watersheds it can be seen from fig 8a that the asma scs cn method has lower values of nrmse as compared to the mvp ms and scs cn method the median nrmse and iqr for asma scs cn method is found to be lowest iqr 0 83 1 38 and median nrmse 1 02 followed by mvp iqr 0 94 1 48 and median nrmse 1 11 ms iqr 0 98 1 69 and median nrmse 1 19 and scs cn method iqr 1 03 1 76 and median nrmse 1 24 fig 8b according to stow et al 2003 smaller the values of rmse and nrmse the greater is the agreement between the simulations and observations therefore based on nrmse criteria the asma scs cn performs best followed by mvp ms and scs cn methods based on rmse and nrmse it may also be stated that the asma scs cn method has lower uncertainty as compared to the scs cn ms and mvp method the goodness of fit statistics is also evaluated in terms of mae eq 33 for all the four methods as shown in fig 9a b and appendix iib detailed mae statistics is also given appendix iib fig 9a shows the general variability of mae statistics for all the 164 watersheds which shows that asma scs cn method has lowest values of mae for most of the watersheds as compared to the scs cn ms mvp methods the mean values of mae for asma scs cn mvp ms and scs cn method are found to be 2 66 mm 2 93 mm 2 99 mm and 3 07 respectively the box whisker plots fig 9b shows that the asma scs cn method has lower variability outside the upper and lower quartiles and median mae than the rest of the three methods overall mae statistics shows that the asma scs cn method has improved performance than the scs cn ms and mvp methods the mae results also show that as the area of the watershed increases the asma scs cn method has much lower mae as compared to the rest of the three methods the se results for all the four methods are also shown in figs 10a and 10b the se results show that the asma scs cn method has lowest mean value of se 0 661 mm followed by mvp method 0 664 mm ms 0 733 and scs cn 0 777 mm for all the 164 watersheds fig 10a shows the se variability for 164 watersheds and fig 10b shows the box whisker plots for all the four methods these figures also show that the difference between the se values of asma scs cn and mvp method is very less as compared to the ms and scs cn method however the se results also show that as the watershed area increases the asma scs cn method has much lower values of se as compared to the scs cn ms and mvp method based on the mae and se statistics it can be stated that the asma scs cn method has lower uncertainty as compared to the rest of the three methods as discussed above the performance of all the four methods is further evaluated using pbias statistics for all the 164 watersheds the results are given in appendix iia and figs 11a and 11b it is observed from these figures that both the asma scs cn and mvp methods have lower pbias either positive or negative than the ms and scs cn methods for all the 164 watersheds the box whisker plots fig 11b depicts the data distribution through their quartiles which shows that asma scs cn method has lower variability outside the upper and lower quartiles than the mvp method and lower median rmse than the ms and scs cn methods further the results also show that mvp method has quite lower median pbias than the rest of the three methods and notably the difference between median pbias values of asma scs cn and mvp is very small as compared to the ms and scs cn methods this also indicates that the asma scs cn method has lower uncertainty as compared to the other methods the median pbias values of ms and scs cn methods are found to be much higher than that of asma scs cn and mvp methods further all the four methods were also evaluated on the basis of the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 and it is found that the scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn methods perform very good on 50 31 129 and 108 watersheds good on 17 24 12 and 26 watersheds fair in 38 39 12 and 24 watersheds and unsatisfactory in 59 70 11 and 6 watersheds respectively lastly to assess the comparative performance of the asma scs cn mvp ms and scs cn method the rsr statistics is also evaluated as shown in figs 12a and 12b and appendix iib it is observed from fig 12a that asma scs cn has lowest median value of rsr than the mvp ms and scs cn method for all the 164 watersheds the box whisker plots fig 12b also show that asma scs cn has the lowest value of median rsr than the mvp ms and scs cn method the values of the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the asma scs cn are also lower than the rest of the three methods which supports its improved performance and lower uncertainty as compared to the other three methods finally the performance of all the four methods is also rated on the basis of the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 and it shows that asma scs cn method performs very good on 87 watersheds followed by mvp 63 watersheds ms 52 watersheds and scs cn method 35 watersheds and found to perform good on 63 73 55 and 55 watersheds satisfactory on 23 31 30 and 38 watersheds and unsatisfactory on 15 23 47 and 56 watersheds respectively 4 3 performance evaluation based on watershed characteristics the watershed characteristics such as land use soil type landuse and soil and their combination catchment area and average rainfall also play an important role on runoff generation process and hence on the performance of a model keeping in view of the above all the four methods were further evaluated on the basis of the watershed characteristics as discussed here table 4 shows the number of watersheds grouped under different watershed characteristics 4 3 1 evaluation based on landuse there are three major land use classes i e mixed pasture range and cultivated as shown in table 4 a brief discussion on the performance of all the four methods for three land use classes in terms of rmse is given here as follows i mixed land use for mixed landuse class there are 37 watersheds as given in table 4 for these watersheds the asma scs cn method yields the lowest mean and median rmse values as 5 97 mm and 5 96 mm respectively the inter quartile range 3 91 7 58 mm and bounds at 90 c i 5 25 mm 6 69 mm for asma scs cn method are also found to be lowest amongst all methods table 5 hence asma scs cn method works best for mixed landuse followed by ms mvp and scs cn method ii pasture range landuse there are 40 watersheds having pasture range landuse as given in table 3 for these watersheds the asma scs cn method yields the lowest mean 4 97 and median 4 09 rmse values amongst all the four models the result is further supported by lowest inter quartile range from 3 11 mm to 6 36 mm and lower and upper bounds at 90 c i as 4 07 mm and 5 88 mm respectively table 5 hence asma scs cn method performed the best for watersheds having pasture range landuse on the basis of mean rmse the methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn again the scs cn method performed the poorest among all for pasture range watersheds the increased performance of the asma scs cn method in this landuse category may be attributed to be inclusion of static infiltration component in the model formulation as the vegetation tends to maintain the soil infiltration potential by preventing the sealing of the soil surface from the impacts of raindrops it is worth highlighting that all the methods performed significantly better for the watersheds having pasture range landuse than the mixed landuse iii cultivated landuse a total of 51 watersheds have been grouped in cultivated landuse as given in table 4 for these watersheds asma scs cn method yields lowest values of mean 4 73 mm median 4 32 mm lower and upper bounds at 90 c i 4 35 mm 5 11 mm and inter quartile range 3 86 mm 5 50 mm respectively of rmse amongst the all four methods and hence it performs the best for this landuse table 5 on the basis of mean rmse the methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn the mean rmse of asma scs cn method in cultivated landuse is lower 4 73 than that of pasture range and mixed land uses 4 3 2 evaluation based on soil type on the basis of the soil type the watersheds are classified as clayey silty and sandy table 4 similar to the above the performance of all the four methods has been evaluated using rmse criteria and the results are given in table 6 i clayey soil table 4 shows that 34 watersheds have clay soils the rmse statistics i e mean 6 87 mm median 7 49 mm inter quartile range 4 66 mm 9 19 mm and lower and upper bounds at 90 c i 5 81 mm 7 92 mm for asma scs cn method is lower than that of scscn ms and mvp for all the study watersheds table 6 on the basis of rmse values all the four methods are ranked as asma scs cn mvp ms scs cn ii sandy soil for sandy watersheds the rmse statistics is given in table 5 which shows that asma scs cn method yields lowest values of mean 4 38 mm median 4 10 mm lower and upper bounds at 90 c i 4 07 mm 4 68 mm and inter quartile range 3 66 mm 4 87 mm of rmse among all the methods and hence it performs the best for this soil table 6 it is worth highlighting that all the models perform significantly better for the watersheds having sandy soil than those having other soils the best performance of this model supports the significance of incorporating the effect of static infiltration on the runoff for a given rainfall especially for watersheds with sandy soils the reason is that the static infiltration is comparatively high for sandy soil than clayey and silty soil the scs cn method again performs the poorest among all the methods on the basis of mean rmse values the methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn iii silty soil for such watersheds the asma scs cn method performs better than the existing methods by showing lowest values of mean 5 05 m median 5 09 mm inter quartile range 3 89 mm 6 06 mm and bounds of rmse at 90 c i 4 40 mm 5 69 mm table 6 on the basis of mean rmse these methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn 4 3 3 landuse and soil type the performance of all the four methods is also evaluated based on the combination of all the three land uses and three land three soils i e total nine classes as shown in table 6 the rmse statistics resulting from the application of these methods to watersheds of different land uses and different is presented in table 7 on the basis of rmse statistics all the four methods performed best for watersheds with pasture range landuse and silty soil and poorest for watersheds with mixed landuse and clayey soils among all the combinations for all the combinations the asma scs cn method performs best and scs cn method performs the poorest of all the methods on the basis of mean rmse the suitability of the asma scs cn method can be ranked for different landuse soil combinations as pasture range silty cultivated silty pasture range sandy mixed silty cultivated sandy mixed sandy pasture range clayey cultivated clayey mixed clayey 4 3 4 drainage area catchment area based evaluation of all the four methods is also conducted using rmse statistics and the results are given in table 7 for this purpose all the 164 watersheds are grouped into five classes as i catchment area 0 01 km2 ii 0 01 catchment area 0 1 km2 iii 0 1 km2 catchment area 1 km2 iv 1 km2 catchment area 10 km2 and v catchment area 10 km2 as shown in table 7 out of five catchment area classes all the methods performs best for the watersheds with catchment area 0 01 km2 with lowest rmse statistic mean median inter quartile range and lower and upper bounds at 90 c i further in catchment area class i the asma scs cn method is found to have the lowest values of rmse statistics such as mean 4 28 mm median 4 10 mm inter quartile range 3 52 5 14 mm and lower and upper bounds of the 90 ci 3 63 4 93 mm table 8 notably all the methods perform poorest for the catchments having area greater than 10 km2 class v however the asma scs cn method performs best among all the methods under study for all ranges of catchment areas whereas the scs cn method performed the poorest for all table 9 also summarises the performance of all the four methods based on all the watershed characteristics appendix i appendix ii a appendix ii b 5 conclusions in this study an activation soil moisture accounting asma based scs cn asma scs cn method has been developed by coupling the sma concept of michel vazken perrin mvp method with the static infiltration fc based mishra singh ms method for presenting a fuller picture of sma system to model rainfall runoff process the comparative performance of the asma scs cn method is evaluated with the original scs cn method ms method and mvp method by applying a large dataset of usda watersheds 56343 storm events from 164 small to large watersheds the goodness of fit statistics in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae standard error se and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr shows that the asma scs cn method has the highest mean and median values of nse and lowest mean and median values of error indices i e rmse nrmse mae and rsr as compared to the mvp ms and scs cn method the pbias values of the asma scs cn and mvp methods are also lower than that of ms and scs cn method these lower values of error indices and higher values of nse also indicate that the asma scs cn method has lowest uncertainty as compared to the scs cn ms and mvp method a comparative performance of all the methods based on landuse cultivated pasture range mixed and soil type sandy silty clayey shows that the asma scs cn method performs significantly better for the watersheds with cultivated land use than those having mixed or pasture range land use enhanced performance has been also observed for the watersheds having sandy soil than those having clayey or silty soils this could be further attributed to the consideration of static infiltration in the model formulation the results show that the concept of activation soil moisture i e coupling of sma with static infiltration component provides a more complete assessment of sma system 6 limitations and potential for future research though the asma concept present the fuller picture of sma in rainfall runoff modelling however it lacks the storm intensity and duration in its formulation efforts may be put to address this issue secondly the model also ignores the watershed slope and hence it may be an innovative idea to couple the asma intensity slope concept in scs cn based rainfall runoff modelling it will also be a good idea to develop erosion and sediment yield model based on asma concept where it may play a greater role of course the slope concept may also be coupled with asma sediment yield model for improved performance finally there exists a large scope for harnessing of satellite soil moisture products to devise the components of asma system for rainfall runoff modelling credit authorship contribution statement s verma investigation formal analysis

5217,in this study the concept of activation soil moisture asm has been conceptualised by coupling the soil moisture accounting sma concept with the static infiltration component fc for simulating rainfall runoff process the asm has been defined as the height of soil moisture barrier or the amount of soil moisture deficit which must be fulfilled before runoff can start most of the scs cn inspired methods including the original one do not consider asm in their formulation to simulate rainfall runoff process to account for asm here we develop an activation soil moisture accounting asma based method asma scs cn by coupling the sma concept of michel vazken perrin mvp method with the static infiltration fc based mishra singh ms method which presents a fuller picture of sma system the performance of the asma scs cn method is compared with the original scs cn method ms method and mvp method by applying a large dataset of 56 343 storm events from 164 small to large watersheds in the united states using goodness of fit statistics in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae standard error se and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr the asma scs cn method has the highest median value of nse 0 71 varying from 0 11 to 0 97 with inter quartile range iqr as 0 62 0 80 followed by mvp with nse 0 67 varying from 0 10 to 0 0 96 and iqr as 0 57 0 74 ms with nse 0 61 varying from 0 02 to 0 97 and iqr range as 0 46 0 72 and scs cn with nse 0 58 varying from 0 01 to 0 92 and iqr as 0 44 0 69 the asma scs cn method is found to have lowest mean and median values of rmse nrmse mae se and rsr than the mvp ms and scs cn method the pbias values of the asma scs cn and mvp methods are lower than that of ms and scs cn method in addition the performance of all four methods is further evaluated based on the watershed characteristics such as landuse soil type drainage area and mean rainfall and the results show that in all cases the asma scs cn method performs much better than the rest of the methods overall the improved performance of asma scs cn can be attributed to the inclusion of sma along with the static infiltration component for representing the complete picture of sma system in modelling rainfall runoff process keywords scs cn method soil moisture accounting static infiltration activation soil moisture threshold soil moisture rainfall runoff process 1 introduction estimation of direct surface runoff resulting from a storm rainfall event is needed for myriad applications including planning watershed conservation and management practices measures for mitigation of drought and flood hazards stream flow prediction reservoir operation and irrigation scheduling various methods available for estimation of direct surface runoff have limited applicability in data scarce watersheds due to large input data requirement uncertainty in specifying the parameters values and the difference between the spatial scales of the application i e a catchment versus a field gupta et al 2019a b sahu et al 2010 shi et al 2009 the soil conservation service curve

variation of the cn parameter ogden et al 2017 hjelmfelt 1991 for any change in amc say from amci to amciii on a given catchment a sudden jump in the cn value i e from cn i to cn iii invariably occurs and this variability is discontinuous in nature which ultimately results in a quantum jump in computed runoff mccuen 1989 2002 mishra et al 2003a b singh et al 2013 singh et al 2015 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 found that the swing between the amc classes and rainfall patterns has a greater impact on the runoff generating mechanisms in the watershed than the variation in rainfall depth many investigators argue that the initial soil moisture condition of the watershed is the most important factor to determine the predictive outcome of an event williams and laseur 1976 brocca et al 2009a b de michele and salvadori 2002 mishra and singh 2004a b sahu et al 2010 bonaccorso et al 2017 michel et al 2005 worth mentioning that the initial soil moisture conditions represent a major parameter in the surface runoff generation bonaccorso et al 2017 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 mentioned that the scs cn method does not directly use the actual antecedent moisture in the computations and rather classifies amc into three discrete classes the soil moisture accounting sma procedure was developed by michel et al 2005 to rectify the classical problem of sudden jump in scs cn method the sma procedure developed by michel et al 2005 hereafter michel vazken perrin mvp method is based on the notion that higher the moisture store level higher the fraction of rainfall that is converted into runoff if the moisture storage level is full all the rainfall will become runoff kannan et al 2007 found that the combination of sma procedure with the scs cn method is necessary for predicting runoff from rainfall realistically due to the cn variation from storm to storm beck et al 2009 stated that soil moisture is a key factor in determining the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration and the soil moisture proxies are calculated to account for a catchment s wetness status prior to the rainfall event in the hope to improve stream flow prediction camici et al 2011 stated that a sma procedure has to incorporate all the above mentioned conditions and termed the soil moisture conditions before the storm event as design soil moisture rajib and merwade 2016 observed that the cn method suffers from several structural inconsistencies and lack of theoretical foundation which need to be addressed to enable improved sma system in in the model and developed swat sma model for improved streamflow predictions ogden et al 2017 suggested that a new runoff prediction model shall have valid theoretical underpinnings with needed model capabilities and verifiable outperform existing models to solve specific problem e g water management erosion sedimentation etc recently cho and engel 2019 developed a long term hydrologic simulation model by coupling the original scs cn method and revised sma procedure to overcome the structural and hydrological inconsistency associated and to account for the sma procedure in the original scs cn method the basic proportionality concept c sr concept gupta et al 2019a b mishra and singh 2003a b singh et al 2015 has been modified accordingly and advanced versions of the scs cn method have also been developed by various

based hereafter mishra singh ms method by incorporating the static infiltration component fc in the basic proportionality concept however the method does not consider the sma procedure in its formulation mvp method michel et al 2005 incorporated the sma procedure in the scs cn method and developed renewed and improved version of scs cn method the mvp method conceptualizes the sma procedure based on threshold soil moisture sa as the soil moisture barrier which has to be overcome before runoff to start however if we critically examine the mvp method it can be diagnosed that it does ignores the static infiltration component of infiltration which also plays an important role in assessing the sma system mishra and singh 2003a b interestingly mishra and singh 2003a b highlighted that the original scs cn method also does not include the static component of infiltration rather considers only the dynamic capillary portion of the infiltration and hence it underestimates infiltration therefore there exists a scope for further development of an improved scs cn method based on the coupling of the concept of sma procedure mvp method and static infiltration ms method for a complete assessment of sma system and has been termed here as the activation soil moisture accounting asma system for improving the overall rainfall runoff modelling process keeping in view of the above this study has twofold objectives as i to develop a asma based scs cn asma scs cn method by coupling the sma concept of mvp method with fc of ms method to present a complete assessment of sma system and ii to compare the performance of the asma scs cn method with the original scs cn method mvp method and ms method and by applying a large dataset of 56 343 storm events from 164 small to large watersheds in the united states this paper has been organised as follows section 1 introduces the rationale behind the development of the proposed asma scs cn method explores the concepts which can be coupled with the scs cn method for this purpose and outlines the objectives of the study section 2 deals with the study area and data used and presents a broad overview of the data used in this study section 3 briefly discusses the original scs cn method mishra singh ms method scs cn method coupled with static infiltration component michel vazken perrin mvp method scs cn method coupled with sma procedure and develops the asma scs cn method by coupling the sma procedure with the ms method to present a fuller picture of sma system in modelling rainfall runoff process section 3 also deals with the application of all the four methods i e original scs cn method ms method mvp method and asma scs cn method using storm event data of 164 watersheds this sections also discusses the parameter estimation technique and different formulations used for this purpose this section discusses six different performance evaluation indices as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error

indices factors affecting model uncertainty rationale behind the improved performance of the asma scs cn method as compared to the scs cn ms mvp methods performance evaluation of these methods based on watershed characteristics such as land use soil type landuse and soil type combination and drainage area finally section 5 deals with the important conclusions drawn from the study a workflow of the methodology is also given in fig 1 to have an overall structural organization of the paper 2 study area and data used to test the activation soil moisture concept in the scs cn method the present study utilizes the rainfall runoff datasets of 164 watersheds with areas varying from 0 2 to 17 353 ha from different regions of usa fig 2 these watersheds have different landuse pasture mixed cultivated and soil type silty sandy clayey data for a total of 56 343 storm events from these watersheds has been used in this study the number of events ranged from 8 to 1924 for different watersheds these rainfall runoff datasets were derived from usda agricultural research service usda ars water database which is a collection of rainfall and stream flow data from small agricultural watersheds of the united states the database is available on http www ars usda gov arsdb html the existing rain gauge networks range from one station to over 200 stations per watershed the period of record for individual watersheds vary from 1 to 50 years some watersheds have been in continuous observation since the mid 1930 s usda also maintains various types of ancillary data such as air temperature land management practices topography and soil types along with rainfall and streamflow data 3 methodology 3 1 original soil conservation service curve number method a brief structural and conceptual background of the original soil conservation service curve number scs cn method is given here as follows the method is based on the water balance equation along with two fundamental relationships the first relationship equates the ratio of actual amount of direct surface runoff q to the total rainfall p or maximum potential surface runoff to the ratio of actual infiltration f to the amount of the potential maximum retention s mishra and singh 2003a b singh et al 2010 the second relationship relates the initial abstraction ia to s and also described as potential post initial abstraction retention mccuen 2002 as a water balance equation 1 p i a f q b basic proportional equality first hypothesis 2 q p i a f s c ia s relationship second hypothesis 3 ia Œª s the values of p q and s are in depth dimensions while the initial abstraction coefficient Œª is dimensionless the basic proportional equality eq 2 is also known as c sr concept where c q p ia and sr f s jain et al 2006 mishra and singh 2002 2003a b sahu et al 2010 santikari and murdoch 2018 singh et al 2010 2015 combination of eqs 1 and 2 leads to the basic equation of the original scs cn as 4 q p i a 2 p i a s i f p i a q 0 otherwise for Œª 0 2 the coupling of eqs 3 and 4 results in 5 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s equation 5 is the popular form of the original scs cn method having only one parameter s the parameter s of the scs cn method depends on soil type land use hydrologic condition and amc the parameter s is mapped onto a dimensionless curve number cn varying in a range 0 cn 100 as 6 s 25400 cn 254 where s has the unit in mm 3 2 mishra singh method for inclusion of the cumulative static portion of infiltration fc in the original scs cn method mishra and singh 2003a b modified the proportionality concept c sr concept as 7a q p i a f c f d s the water balance equation can be written as 7b p i a f d f c q where fd and fc are the cumulative dynamic capillary and static gravitational infiltration respectively the coupling of eqs 7a b yields the expression of q as 8 q p i a f c 2 p i a f c s for p i a f c 0 otherwise for Œª 0 2 eq 8 can be written as 9 q p 0 2 s f c 2 p 0 8 s f c for p 0 2 s f c 0 otherwise where 10 f c f c t where fc is the minimum infiltration rate mm h and t is the rainfall duration h the mishra singh method has been denoted as ms method in the forthcoming sections 3 3 michel vazken perrin method michel et al 2005 incorporated the sma procedure in the scs cn method and developed a renewed version of scs cn method expressed as 11 if v 0 s a p then q 0 if sa p v0 sa then 12 q p s a v 0 2 p v 0 s a s if sa v0 sa s then 13 q p 1 s s a v 0 2 s 2 s s a v 0 p where v0 initial soil moisture i e the soil moisture before the storm event sa threshold soil moisture v0 ia and ia initial abstractions the values of sa and v0 are given in depth dimensions the michel vazken perrin method has been referred to as mvp method in the forthcoming sections 3 4 development of activation soil moisture accounting asma based scs cn method for the development of the activation soil moisture accounting asma based scs cn asma scs cn method eq 8 was selected as the base equation which is valid for the accumulated rainfall p and accumulated runoff q for any storm event and considers the static infiltration in its formulation however it can be shown that eq 8 is hydrologically unstable as it does not yield q 0 for p ia fc now assuming that v is the soil moisture store at any time t during a storm event p is the accumulated rainfall up to the time t and q is the corresponding runoff the water balance equation can be written as 14 v v 0 p q substituting the value of q from eq 8 in eq 14 we get 15 v v 0 p p i a f c 2 p i a f c s the runoff rate q dq dt can be obtained by taking the derivative of eq 8 as 16 q p i a f c p i a f c 2 s p i a f c s 2 p if p i a f c where p is the rainfall intensity rate and is equal to dp dt now deriving the value of p from eq 15 and putting into eq 16 results into 17 q v v 0 i a f c 2 s v v 0 i a f c s 2 p i f v v 0 i a f c q 0 otherwise the detailed derivations are given in appendix a now if we critically look at eq 17 then the numerator has ia fc in addition to the initial soil moisture v0 notably the v0 represents the state of the system mishra and singh 2003a b michel et al 2005 this ia fc acts as the as the activation soil moisture vasm and term v0 ia fc is taken as the revised threshold soil moisture vet v0 vasm graphically this has been shown in fig 3 eq 17 shows that if the amount of moisture is less than the vet then there will be no runoff and hence for runoff generation the moisture store has to be more than the vet therefore the complete sma system should consider the revised threshold soil moisture vet and the concept of threshold soil moisture sa is just the part of the complete sma system on replacing ia v0 fc with vet eq 17 leads to 18 q v v et s 2 v v et s p if v v et q 0 otherwise taking the derivative of eq 14 can be expressed as 19 dv dt p q now coupling the expressions for vasm and vet in eq 8 ms method the base method incorporating the fc yields 20 q p v 0 v et 2 p v 0 v et s if p v 0 v et q 0 otherwise if the soil is fully saturated before the start of storm event i e v0 vet s then q should be equal to p from eq 20 however putting v0 vet s in eq 20 yields a value of q greater than p which is not possible in reality as 21 q p s 2 p 2 s therefore the ms method eq 20 is hydrologically not sound and needs some conceptual and structural modifications notably the ms method does not consider the sma procedure in its formulation therefore a hydrologically sound and structurally stable formulation can be obtained by recalculating the formula for the total amount of rainfall and runoff p and q by integrating the eq 19 and using the value of q from eq 18 as 22 q p 1 s v et v 0 2 s 2 s v et v 0 p the detailed derivations are given in appendix b eq 22 shows that if v0 vet s then q p and this is consistent both mathematically and hydrologically similarly for the intermediate and lowest conditions i e i for v0 vet but p v0 vet i e vet p v0 vet the generated runoff q can be computed using eq 20 and ii for v0 vet p i e rainfall p is not large enough to overcome the initial moisture deficit of the soil moisture store then q 0 these conditions are summarised as follows 23 if v 0 v et p then q 0 if vet p v0 vet then 24 q p v 0 v et 2 p v 0 v et s if v et v 0 v et s then 25 q p 1 s v et v 0 2 s 2 s v et v 0 p eqs 23 25 represent the asma scs cn method the proposed approach is more logical and hydrologically more stable and complete than the other methods under study a summary of all the four cn based methods is given in table 1 3 5 applications of the methods all the four methods i e the original scs cn method eq 6 scs cn mishra singh method eq 8 ms michel vazken perrin method eqs 11 13 mvp and the asma scs cn method eqs 23 25 table 1 were applied to the large us rainfall runoff datasets 164 watersheds with 56 343 storm events to test the comparative performance of these methods 3 5 1 parameter estimation to estimate the different parameters of all the four methods i e the original scs cn method scs cn mishra singh method ms michel vazken perrin method mvp and the proposed asma scs cn method simplified expressions were used in this study as suggested by mishra et al 2006b and singh et al 2015 expressed here 26 v 0 Œ± p 5 s 27 s a Œ≤ s 28 f c f c t where p5 is the antecedent rainfall amount mm fc is the minimum infiltration rate mm h t is the rainfall duration h and Œ± Œ≤ are coefficients the marquardt 1963 algorithm of constrained least squares mcls was used for optimizing the parameters of all the four methods i e scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn the marquardt provided an elegant and improved version of the non linear optimization method originally proposed by levenberg 1944 the method primarily provides a smooth variation between the two extremes of the inverse hessian method and the steepest descent method the latter is used when the trial solution is far from the minimum and it tends continuously towards the former as the minimum is approached this levenberg marquardt method is also known as marquardt method which works well in practice and has become the standard of non linear least squares routines mishra and singh 2003a in application to the scs cn method the initial estimate of cn was taken as 50 and was allowed to vary in the range of 0 to 100 for all the methods except scs cn the initial estimate of parameter s was taken as 125 mm and was assumed to vary in the range of 0 to 2500 mm for mvp method the v0 and sa parameters were allowed to vary in the range of 0 to 500 mm with its initial estimate of 100 mm for the proposed asma scs cn method an initial estimate of both the parameters Œ± and Œ≤ was taken as 0 01 and was allowed to vary in the range of 0 00 and 2 00 and 0 00 to 1 00 respectively parameter fc was allowed to vary in the range of 0 00 and 25 00 with an initial estimate 1 00 the vet was estimated as the sum of sa and fc i e sa fc 3 5 2 performance evaluation of methods the process of performance evaluation of models is of primary importance not only in their development and calibration process but also when communicating the results to other researchers and to the stakeholder schaefli and gupta 2007 for evaluating the performance of all the four methods having different parameters seven indices of agreement between observed and computed runoff values are used in this study these performance indices are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae standard error se and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr as discussed here mathematically these indices are expressed as 29 nse 1 i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 i 1 n q obs q obs i 2 30 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 nrmse 31 1 n i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 q obs 32 pbias i 1 n q obs q comp i i 1 n q obs i 100 33 mae 1 n i 1 n q obs q comp i se 34 1 n m 1 i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 rsr 35 rmse stde v obs i 1 n q obs q comp i 2 i 1 n q obs q obs i 2 where qobs is the observed runoff qcomp is the computed runoff qobs is the mean of observed runoff values in a watershed n is the total number of rainfall runoff events m the number of model parameters and i is an integer varying from 1 to n the nse compares the variance of the errors against the observations how well the plot of observations versus simulations fit the 1 1 line ahmadisharaf et al 2019 the nse ranges between and 1 0 1 inclusive with nse 1 being the optimal value the values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance moriasi et al 2007 a value of zero indicates that the observed mean is as good a predictor as the model while negative values indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model ahmadisharaf et al 2019 moriasi et al 2007 wilcox et al 1990 coffey et al 2004a b mccuen et al 2006 stated that nse is a very good criterion for assessing comparative performance of hydrologic models according to legates and mccabe 1999 the nse is sensitive to the differences in the observed and model simulated means and variance and can be thought of as an improvement over the coefficient of determination r2 widely used for evaluating the goodness of fit of hydrologic and hydro climatic models the nse cannot also help identify the bias and is sensitive to extreme values criss and winston 2008 larabi et al 2018 and if the goal is to quantify the bias the pbias can be used krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2015 alamdari et al 2017 alamdari and sample 2019 according to p√©rez s√°nchez et al 2019 however nse cannot help identify model bias moriasi et al 2015 and it should be complemented by other measures such as pbias in order to consider how well the model simulates the average magnitudes for the outputs and to identify the average model simulation bias over prediction versus under prediction therefore pbias has been used in this study to identify the average model simulation bias by all the four methods similarly normalized root mean square error nrmse is an another most widely used statistical indicator for model performance evaluation santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 mishra et al 2006a the nrmse standardizes the rmse values into a common and comparable scale ranatunga et al 2017 the rmse and mae can be used to determine confidence intervals in model predictions and it is possible to incorporate measurement uncertainty harmel and smith 2007 harmel et al 2010 moriai et al 2015 the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr chu and shirmohammadi 2004 moriasi et al 2007 vazquez am√°bile and engel 2005 standardizes rmse using the observations standard deviation and it combines both an error index and the additional information recommended by legates and mccabe 1999 rsr incorporates the benefits of error index statistics and includes a scaling normalization factor so the resulting statistics and reported values can apply to various output responses the lower rsr the lower the rmse and the better the model simulation performance rsr is a relatively new statistical performance measure has not been widely used in the h wq modelling literature moriasi et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 established a performance criterion for model s evaluation where nse 0 50 unsatisfactory 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory 0 65 nse 0 75 good and 0 75 nse 1 00 very good according to ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 a model is judged to be very good if nse 0 90 good if 0 90 nse 0 80 acceptable if 0 80 nse 0 65 and unsatisfactory if 0 65 nse the value of rmse equal to 0 shows a perfect agreement between observed and estimated values the lower the rmse the better is the model s performance and vice versa the pbias measures model s tendency to underestimate or overestimate values negative positive value of pbias indicates model overestimation underestimation whereas a value of zero shows perfect fit moriasi et al 2007 for the hydrologic models performance was indicated as unsatisfactory if pbias 25 fair if 15 pbias 25 good if 10 pbias 15 and very good if pbias 10 durbude et al 2011 moriasi et al 2007 the nrmse and rsr estimate show how important these are errors relative to the magnitude of the observations ahmadisharaf et al 2019 according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is rated as very good if 0 00 rsr 0 50 good if 0 50 rsr 0 60 satisfactory if 0 60 rsr 0 70 and unsatisfactory if rsr greater than 0 70 the standard error se of all the four methods has also been evaluated to evaluate the methods performance higher the se poorer is the model performance and vice versa a value of se equal to zero exhibits a perfect fit se has the advantages of having the same units as the variable and accounts for the methods degree of freedom in case of comparing the methods having different number of parameters which is generally the case in most of the applications the hydrological models are subjected to the uncertainty ahmadisharaf et al 2018 the uncertainty in hydrological modeling arises from input datasets shrestha et al 2009 montanari et al 2009 observed flow choice of hydrological model model structure and parameters accounting of relevant physical processes in the watershed choice of goodness of fit measures and calibration validation period krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 krzysztofowicz and herr 2001 montanari and brath 2004 liu and gupta 2007 mcmillan et al 2010 2011 2012 renard et al 2010 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 and also the experience of the modeler in manual calibration orth et al 2015 martina and todini 2008 the parameter uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges in hydrological modeling and it reflects the inability to specify exact values of model parameters renard et al 2010 and it may stem from errors in input data and observations used for model conditioning navratil et al 2011 also discussed various sources of uncertainty associated with the observations such as i choice of suitable instrument ii data acquisition strategy iii field sampling procedures for water and sediment sampling iv laboratory procedures and v discharge and water level measurement among many others 4 results and discussions 4 1 parameter estimation as discussed in section 3 5 1 the optimized parameters values of all the four methods i e scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn for 164 usda study watersheds are given in appendix i the statistical range of all the parameters for four methods is also given in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that the average value of parameter cn for the scs cn method is 82 03 with min and max values as 30 80 and 96 30 respectively table 2 also show that the min infiltration rate fc for asma scs cn method is lower 0 52 than that of ms method 0 99 the average values of parameters Œ± and Œ≤ are found to be 0 24 and 0 12 with min to max values as 0 01 to 1 30 and 0 00 to 7 00 respectively singh et al 2015 also reported the average values of Œ± and Œ≤ as 0 220 and 0 118 while applying their modified sma based mscs cn mmscs cn method to 35 usda watersheds dataset the average values of parameter s for asma scs cn mvp and ms method are found to be 232 80 mm and 227 61 mm and 46 24 mm respectively while applying to 164 usda study watersheds 4 2 comparative performance evaluation of the methods the performance of all the four methods is evaluated on the basis of their i visual closeness of the observed and computed runoff and ii goodness of fit gof in terms of nse rmse nrmse mae se pbias and rsr as discussed in section 3 5 2 worth highlighting that any method having greater nse and lesser rmse nrmse mae se rsr as well as pbias either positive or negative than the other methods can be ranked as superior and vice versa for visual comparison fig 4 a h show the comparison between the observed and computed runoff by all the four methods for 8 different watersheds in general it can be observed from these figures that the asma scs cn method resembles a better agreement with the observed runoff and are closest to the 1 1 line than the other methods fig 4a h also show that the r2 value of the ama scs cn is higher than the rest of the three methods i e scs cn ms and mvp another visual comparison event wise is also shown in fig 5 a d it is evident from these figures that the asmascs cn method has better agreement between the observed and computed runoff than the scs cn ms mvp methods there is a larger mismatch between the observed and computed runoff for most of the events underestimation in case of ms and scs cn method than the mvp and asma scs cn method the improved performance of the asma scs cn method may be due attributed to inclusion of sma and fc in its model structure and overall in the rainfall runoff process similar results are found for most of the watersheds not shown here as discussed above the gof statistics is evaluated in terms of nse and error indices as rmse nrmse mae se pbias and rsr and the results are given in appendix iia b for all the 164 watersheds the mean value of nse for asma scs cn is found to be highest 0 696 followed by mvp 0 643 ms 0 571 and scs cn 0 53 respectively while application to all the 164 watersheds similar results can also be drawn from fig 6a which shows the plot of nse values for all the for methods on 164 watersheds annexure ii a b it can be seen from fig 6 a that the asma scs cn method has higher nse as compared to the other methods i e mvp ms and scs cn for most of the watersheds the improved performance of asma scs cn can be attributed to the inclusion of sma along with the static infiltration component for representing the complete picture of sma system in modelling rainfall runoff process the range of variation of nse values for all the four methods is also shown using box whisker plots as shown in fig 6b it can be observed from fig 5 b that the asma scs cn method has the highest median value of nse 0 71 varying from 0 11 to 0 97 with inter quartile range iqr as 0 62 0 80 followed by mvp with nse 0 67 varying from 0 10 to 0 0 96 and iqr as 0 57 0 74 ms with nse 0 61 varying from 0 02 to 0 97 and iqr range as 0 46 0 72 and scs cn with nse 0 58 varying from 0 01 to 0 92 and iqr as 0 44 0 69 the nse performance rating as per the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 is also given in table 3a the asma scs cn method performs very good on 87 watersheds good on 63 satisfactory on 23 and unsatisfactory on 15 watersheds the mvp method is found to perform very good on 63 watersheds good on 73 watersheds satisfactory on 31 watersheds and unsatisfactory on 23 watersheds the ms method performs very good on 52 watersheds good on 55 watersheds satisfactory on 30 watersheds and unsatisfactory on 47 watersheds the scs cn method performs very good on the least no of watersheds i e 35 good on 55 watersheds satisfactory on 38 watersheds and performs unsatisfactory on the larger number of the watersheds i e 56 therefore on the basis of moriasi et al 2007 nse performance rating the order of performance is asma scs cn mvp ms scs cn method and the improved performance is attributed to the inclusion of fc in the sma procedure resulting into the improved representation of the rainfall runoff process similarly table 3b shows the performance rating based on the criteria given by ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 the results show that the scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn perform very good on 1 6 1 and 10 watersheds good on 6 9 13 and 30 watersheds and acceptable on 45 49 76 and 68 watersheds respectively the rmc performance rating also show the improved performance of the asma scs cn method than the mvp ms and scs cn method fig 6 c also shows the nse variation with watershed area for all the four methods here it is found that the method asma scs cn performs better than the other methods for small as well as large watersheds the nse values at 50 75 and 90 probability of exceedance fig 6d resulting from the application of all the four methods on 164 watersheds are found to be 0 56 0 60 0 66 0 70 0 66 0 71 0 73 0 77 and 0 72 0 76 0 77 0 82 respectively for scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn methods fig 5d shows that the asma scs cn method has the highest values of nse corresponding for all the three probability of exceedance during application to 164 watersheds the performance of all the four methods is further evaluated based on rmse as shown in fig 7 a b and appendix iia for all the 164 watersheds fig 7 a and appendix iia show the rmse variation for 164 watersheds it is evident from fig 7 a and appendix iia that the asma scs cn method has lower rmse as compared to mvp ms and scs cn method fig 7 b shows the box whisker plots of rmse values obtained by applying all the four methods to 164 watersheds fig 7 b shows that the asma scs cn method has lower median value 4 03 mm and inter quartile range 3 07 5 97 mm compared to other methods i e mvp median value 4 56 mm and iqr 3 29 6 33 mm ms median value 4 61 mm and iqr 3 57 6 70 mm and scs cn median value 5 04 mm and iqr 3 92 7 14 mm the mean values of the rmse are found to be 4 653 mm 5 058 5 415 and 5 643 respectively for asma scs cn mvs ms and scs cn method therefore based on rmse criteria the asma scs cn is found to perform best followed by mvp ms and scs cn methods using the rmse statistics the performance of all the four methods based on the different watershed characteristics is also discussed in the forthcoming section the nrmse statistics is also evaluated to assess the comparative performance of all the four methods as shown in fig 8a b and appendix iib fig 8a shows the variation of nrmse for all the four methods on 164 watersheds it can be seen from fig 8a that the asma scs cn method has lower values of nrmse as compared to the mvp ms and scs cn method the median nrmse and iqr for asma scs cn method is found to be lowest iqr 0 83 1 38 and median nrmse 1 02 followed by mvp iqr 0 94 1 48 and median nrmse 1 11 ms iqr 0 98 1 69 and median nrmse 1 19 and scs cn method iqr 1 03 1 76 and median nrmse 1 24 fig 8b according to stow et al 2003 smaller the values of rmse and nrmse the greater is the agreement between the simulations and observations therefore based on nrmse criteria the asma scs cn performs best followed by mvp ms and scs cn methods based on rmse and nrmse it may also be stated that the asma scs cn method has lower uncertainty as compared to the scs cn ms and mvp method the goodness of fit statistics is also evaluated in terms of mae eq 33 for all the four methods as shown in fig 9a b and appendix iib detailed mae statistics is also given appendix iib fig 9a shows the general variability of mae statistics for all the 164 watersheds which shows that asma scs cn method has lowest values of mae for most of the watersheds as compared to the scs cn ms mvp methods the mean values of mae for asma scs cn mvp ms and scs cn method are found to be 2 66 mm 2 93 mm 2 99 mm and 3 07 respectively the box whisker plots fig 9b shows that the asma scs cn method has lower variability outside the upper and lower quartiles and median mae than the rest of the three methods overall mae statistics shows that the asma scs cn method has improved performance than the scs cn ms and mvp methods the mae results also show that as the area of the watershed increases the asma scs cn method has much lower mae as compared to the rest of the three methods the se results for all the four methods are also shown in figs 10a and 10b the se results show that the asma scs cn method has lowest mean value of se 0 661 mm followed by mvp method 0 664 mm ms 0 733 and scs cn 0 777 mm for all the 164 watersheds fig 10a shows the se variability for 164 watersheds and fig 10b shows the box whisker plots for all the four methods these figures also show that the difference between the se values of asma scs cn and mvp method is very less as compared to the ms and scs cn method however the se results also show that as the watershed area increases the asma scs cn method has much lower values of se as compared to the scs cn ms and mvp method based on the mae and se statistics it can be stated that the asma scs cn method has lower uncertainty as compared to the rest of the three methods as discussed above the performance of all the four methods is further evaluated using pbias statistics for all the 164 watersheds the results are given in appendix iia and figs 11a and 11b it is observed from these figures that both the asma scs cn and mvp methods have lower pbias either positive or negative than the ms and scs cn methods for all the 164 watersheds the box whisker plots fig 11b depicts the data distribution through their quartiles which shows that asma scs cn method has lower variability outside the upper and lower quartiles than the mvp method and lower median rmse than the ms and scs cn methods further the results also show that mvp method has quite lower median pbias than the rest of the three methods and notably the difference between median pbias values of asma scs cn and mvp is very small as compared to the ms and scs cn methods this also indicates that the asma scs cn method has lower uncertainty as compared to the other methods the median pbias values of ms and scs cn methods are found to be much higher than that of asma scs cn and mvp methods further all the four methods were also evaluated on the basis of the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 and it is found that the scs cn ms mvp and asma scs cn methods perform very good on 50 31 129 and 108 watersheds good on 17 24 12 and 26 watersheds fair in 38 39 12 and 24 watersheds and unsatisfactory in 59 70 11 and 6 watersheds respectively lastly to assess the comparative performance of the asma scs cn mvp ms and scs cn method the rsr statistics is also evaluated as shown in figs 12a and 12b and appendix iib it is observed from fig 12a that asma scs cn has lowest median value of rsr than the mvp ms and scs cn method for all the 164 watersheds the box whisker plots fig 12b also show that asma scs cn has the lowest value of median rsr than the mvp ms and scs cn method the values of the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the asma scs cn are also lower than the rest of the three methods which supports its improved performance and lower uncertainty as compared to the other three methods finally the performance of all the four methods is also rated on the basis of the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 and it shows that asma scs cn method performs very good on 87 watersheds followed by mvp 63 watersheds ms 52 watersheds and scs cn method 35 watersheds and found to perform good on 63 73 55 and 55 watersheds satisfactory on 23 31 30 and 38 watersheds and unsatisfactory on 15 23 47 and 56 watersheds respectively 4 3 performance evaluation based on watershed characteristics the watershed characteristics such as land use soil type landuse and soil and their combination catchment area and average rainfall also play an important role on runoff generation process and hence on the performance of a model keeping in view of the above all the four methods were further evaluated on the basis of the watershed characteristics as discussed here table 4 shows the number of watersheds grouped under different watershed characteristics 4 3 1 evaluation based on landuse there are three major land use classes i e mixed pasture range and cultivated as shown in table 4 a brief discussion on the performance of all the four methods for three land use classes in terms of rmse is given here as follows i mixed land use for mixed landuse class there are 37 watersheds as given in table 4 for these watersheds the asma scs cn method yields the lowest mean and median rmse values as 5 97 mm and 5 96 mm respectively the inter quartile range 3 91 7 58 mm and bounds at 90 c i 5 25 mm 6 69 mm for asma scs cn method are also found to be lowest amongst all methods table 5 hence asma scs cn method works best for mixed landuse followed by ms mvp and scs cn method ii pasture range landuse there are 40 watersheds having pasture range landuse as given in table 3 for these watersheds the asma scs cn method yields the lowest mean 4 97 and median 4 09 rmse values amongst all the four models the result is further supported by lowest inter quartile range from 3 11 mm to 6 36 mm and lower and upper bounds at 90 c i as 4 07 mm and 5 88 mm respectively table 5 hence asma scs cn method performed the best for watersheds having pasture range landuse on the basis of mean rmse the methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn again the scs cn method performed the poorest among all for pasture range watersheds the increased performance of the asma scs cn method in this landuse category may be attributed to be inclusion of static infiltration component in the model formulation as the vegetation tends to maintain the soil infiltration potential by preventing the sealing of the soil surface from the impacts of raindrops it is worth highlighting that all the methods performed significantly better for the watersheds having pasture range landuse than the mixed landuse iii cultivated landuse a total of 51 watersheds have been grouped in cultivated landuse as given in table 4 for these watersheds asma scs cn method yields lowest values of mean 4 73 mm median 4 32 mm lower and upper bounds at 90 c i 4 35 mm 5 11 mm and inter quartile range 3 86 mm 5 50 mm respectively of rmse amongst the all four methods and hence it performs the best for this landuse table 5 on the basis of mean rmse the methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn the mean rmse of asma scs cn method in cultivated landuse is lower 4 73 than that of pasture range and mixed land uses 4 3 2 evaluation based on soil type on the basis of the soil type the watersheds are classified as clayey silty and sandy table 4 similar to the above the performance of all the four methods has been evaluated using rmse criteria and the results are given in table 6 i clayey soil table 4 shows that 34 watersheds have clay soils the rmse statistics i e mean 6 87 mm median 7 49 mm inter quartile range 4 66 mm 9 19 mm and lower and upper bounds at 90 c i 5 81 mm 7 92 mm for asma scs cn method is lower than that of scscn ms and mvp for all the study watersheds table 6 on the basis of rmse values all the four methods are ranked as asma scs cn mvp ms scs cn ii sandy soil for sandy watersheds the rmse statistics is given in table 5 which shows that asma scs cn method yields lowest values of mean 4 38 mm median 4 10 mm lower and upper bounds at 90 c i 4 07 mm 4 68 mm and inter quartile range 3 66 mm 4 87 mm of rmse among all the methods and hence it performs the best for this soil table 6 it is worth highlighting that all the models perform significantly better for the watersheds having sandy soil than those having other soils the best performance of this model supports the significance of incorporating the effect of static infiltration on the runoff for a given rainfall especially for watersheds with sandy soils the reason is that the static infiltration is comparatively high for sandy soil than clayey and silty soil the scs cn method again performs the poorest among all the methods on the basis of mean rmse values the methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn iii silty soil for such watersheds the asma scs cn method performs better than the existing methods by showing lowest values of mean 5 05 m median 5 09 mm inter quartile range 3 89 mm 6 06 mm and bounds of rmse at 90 c i 4 40 mm 5 69 mm table 6 on the basis of mean rmse these methods can be ranked as asma scs cn ms mvp scs cn 4 3 3 landuse and soil type the performance of all the four methods is also evaluated based on the combination of all the three land uses and three land three soils i e total nine classes as shown in table 6 the rmse statistics resulting from the application of these methods to watersheds of different land uses and different is presented in table 7 on the basis of rmse statistics all the four methods performed best for watersheds with pasture range landuse and silty soil and poorest for watersheds with mixed landuse and clayey soils among all the combinations for all the combinations the asma scs cn method performs best and scs cn method performs the poorest of all the methods on the basis of mean rmse the suitability of the asma scs cn method can be ranked for different landuse soil combinations as pasture range silty cultivated silty pasture range sandy mixed silty cultivated sandy mixed sandy pasture range clayey cultivated clayey mixed clayey 4 3 4 drainage area catchment area based evaluation of all the four methods is also conducted using rmse statistics and the results are given in table 7 for this purpose all the 164 watersheds are grouped into five classes as i catchment area 0 01 km2 ii 0 01 catchment area 0 1 km2 iii 0 1 km2 catchment area 1 km2 iv 1 km2 catchment area 10 km2 and v catchment area 10 km2 as shown in table 7 out of five catchment area classes all the methods performs best for the watersheds with catchment area 0 01 km2 with lowest rmse statistic mean median inter quartile range and lower and upper bounds at 90 c i further in catchment area class i the asma scs cn method is found to have the lowest values of rmse statistics such as mean 4 28 mm median 4 10 mm inter quartile range 3 52 5 14 mm and lower and upper bounds of the 90 ci 3 63 4 93 mm table 8 notably all the methods perform poorest for the catchments having area greater than 10 km2 class v however the asma scs cn method performs best among all the methods under study for all ranges of catchment areas whereas the scs cn method performed the poorest for all table 9 also summarises the performance of all the four methods based on all the watershed characteristics appendix i appendix ii a appendix ii b 5 conclusions in this study an activation soil moisture accounting asma based scs cn asma scs cn method has been developed by coupling the sma concept of michel vazken perrin mvp method with the static infiltration fc based mishra singh ms method for presenting a fuller picture of sma system to model rainfall runoff process the comparative performance of the asma scs cn method is evaluated with the original scs cn method ms method and mvp method by applying a large dataset of usda watersheds 56343 storm events from 164 small to large watersheds the goodness of fit statistics in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae standard error se and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr shows that the asma scs cn method has the highest mean and median values of nse and lowest mean and median values of error indices i e rmse nrmse mae and rsr as compared to the mvp ms and scs cn method the pbias values of the asma scs cn and mvp methods are also lower than that of ms and scs cn method these lower values of error indices and higher values of nse also indicate that the asma scs cn method has lowest uncertainty as compared to the scs cn ms and mvp method a comparative performance of all the methods based on landuse cultivated pasture range mixed and soil type sandy silty clayey shows that the asma scs cn method performs significantly better for the watersheds with cultivated land use than those having mixed or pasture range land use enhanced performance has been also observed for the watersheds having sandy soil than those having clayey or silty soils this could be further attributed to the consideration of static infiltration in the model formulation the results show that the concept of activation soil moisture i e coupling of sma with static infiltration component provides a more complete assessment of sma system 6 limitations and potential for future research though the asma concept present the fuller picture of sma in rainfall runoff modelling however it lacks the storm intensity and duration in its formulation efforts may be put to address this issue secondly the model also ignores the watershed slope and hence it may be an innovative idea to couple the asma intensity slope concept in scs cn based rainfall runoff modelling it will also be a good idea to develop erosion and sediment yield model based on asma concept where it may play a greater role of course the slope concept may also be coupled with asma sediment yield model for improved performance finally there exists a large scope for harnessing of satellite soil moisture products to devise the components of asma system for rainfall runoff modelling credit authorship contribution statement s verma investigation formal analysis

5218,dissolved organic matter dom plays critical roles in biogeochemistry of arsenic in groundwater systems to characterize the spatial temporal variations of groundwater dom and its impacts on arsenic dynamics surface water and shallow groundwater from two different depths were collected during monsoon and non monsoon periods in jianghan plain central yangtze river basin parallel factor analysis parafac of the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem reveals that dom comprises three major components one microbial humic like component c1 and two terrestrial humic like components c2 and c3 abundant terrestrially derived humic like components were observed during monsoon while more microbially derived dom occurred in groundwater during non monsoon season these seasonal dom variations are found to be related to groundwater surface water gw sw interactions which is evidenced by stable h and o isotopes and cl br mass ratios during monsoon season groundwater is recharged from dilute rainwater evaporated surface water and polluted surface water more terrestrial humic like components are introduced by precipitation and local agricultural activities e g irrigation paddy cultivation during monsoon the fluorescence spectroscopy and stable carbon isotopes Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc results indicate that seasonal as variations are affected by seasonal dom dynamics smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c values defined as Œ¥13cdic Œ¥13cdoc with higher as concentrations are found during non monsoon while larger Œ¥Œ¥13c values with relatively lower as concentrations are observed during monsoon season the strong correlation between doc and fe ii concentrations r 0 64 p 0 01 and that between c2 maximum fluorescence intensity and as concentrations r 0 57 p 0 01 clearly reflect the critical role of doc in as mobilization the seasonal variations of as concentrations are therefore correlated with biodegradation of labile organic matter and terrestrially derived high molecular weight humic like components promote seasonal as mobilization via complexation reactions these findings reveal the effects of seasonal dom variations on as dynamics in shallow quaternary alluvial aquifers and are applicable to similar geogenic as affected quaternary aquifers in floodplains and river delta regions of monsoon climate keywords dissolved organic matter dom groundwater arsenic carbon isotope monsoon climate eem parafac 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitous in the aquatic environment has been reported as a key component in global carbon cycle and biogeochemical and ecological function bolan et al 2011 the aquatic ecosystems receive dom inputs mainly from two pools autochthonous e g microbial and phytoplankton produced and allochthonous source e g terrestrial and anthropogenic inputs aitkenhead peterson et al 2003 bertilsson and jones 2003 the dom composition exhibits temporal and spatial variations borisover et al 2009 chen et al 2013 jaff√© et al 2008 which are controlled by diverse hydro biogeochemical processes hudson et al 2007 kalbitz et al 2000 qualls and richardson 2003 yamashita et al 2010 seasonal variations of dom have received considerable attention as a primary factor in determining the chemical variability of dom in recent years brooks et al 2007 catal√°n et al 2013 fellman et al 2009 larsen et al 2010 o donnell et al 2010 singh et al 2014 however most of previous studies focus on the seasonal dynamics of dom in wetlands lakes rivers estuaries and coastal environments borisover et al 2009 jaff√© et al 2008 singh et al 2014 little work has been done to observe the seasonal variations of dom in groundwater and its interaction with surface water groundwater could act as the sources of stream water and dom which is controlled by hydrologic regimes such as flow paths and connectivity hood et al 2006 larsen et al 2010 singh et al 2014 since dom serves as the carbon source for metabolism of microorganisms in the subsurface environment studying the seasonal changes in groundwater dom and the drivers involved is critical not only for comprehensive understanding of dom in hydrosphere but also for better understanding of biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems moreover dom also plays an essential role in the transport of trace metals and organic pollutants as some redox sensitive groundwater contaminants such as arsenic are affected by dom degradation appelo and postma 2005 which has important implications for water quality management and human public health findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 for instance geogenic arsenic as contamination of groundwater has been reported from over 70 countries with the most serious waterborne endemic arsenic poisoning occurring in south and southeast asia including china fendorf et al 2010 nordstrom 2002 rodr√≠guezlado et al 2013 wang et al 2019 many studies have highlighted the important role of dom in arsenic mobilization into groundwater dom

mladenov et al 2010 nickson et al 2000 other processes influencing as mobility include the complexation of as with dom and competitive sorption and electron shuttling reactions mediated by humic substances bauer and blodau 2006 chen et al 2017 davis et al 2001 jiang et al 2009 kl√ºpfel et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2017 li et al 2017 mladenov et al 2015 however although seasonal as variations in groundwater have been observed in some areas the relationship between seasonal dom dynamics and seasonal as variations remains unclear planer friedrich et al 2012 different methods have been applied to characterize dom in the aquatic environment spectroscopic properties could well reflect the source and reactivity of dom fellman et al 2010 hudson et al 2007 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem is the simple way to characterize the spectroscopic properties of dom due to its high sensitivity low cost and fast response coble 1996 huguet et al 2009 parallel factor analysis parafac combined with eem is an efficient statistical tool that separates the overlapping peaks to quantitatively identify individual fluorescent components of dom cuss and gu√©guen 2012 stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon et al 2003 including humic like protein like terrestrially derived and microbially derived components cory and mcknight 2005 mladenov et al 2015 fluorescence indices have been developed to further characterize dom on its extent of aromaticity and microbial activity such as humification index biological index fluorescence index and microbial to terrestrial index kulkarni et al 2017 li et al 2019 on the other hand stable carbon isotopes of dissolve inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc could be used to reveal the dom sources and biogeochemical processes related to microbial consumption and degradation of dom in groundwater guo et al 2014 guo et al 2016 mcknight et al 2003 zhou et al 2018 however few monitoring works have been done to combine both fluorescence spectroscopy and stable carbon isotopes which could provide comprehensive insights into the source composition and fate of seasonal dom dynamics in aquatic environment as well as its role in seasonal variations of as concentrations in groundwater jianghan plain is a typical quaternary alluvial lacustrine river basin in the middle reaches of yangtze river in central china where widespread lacustrine sediments with abundant dom occurred under reducing conditions that significantly influence the groundwater chemistry huang et al 2012 within the jianghan plain of the central yangtze river basin as was released from arsenic enriched sediments of 20 m depth into aquifer schaefer et al 2017 which leads to arsenic poisoning issue of local residents by drinking high as groundwater moreover significant as concentrations are observed between seasons duan et al 2015 due to intensive interactions between surface and groundwater schaefer et al 2016 herein this study investigated the effect of groundwater dom dynamics on seasonal as mobilization using fluorescence eem parafac analysis coupled with multiple isotopes h o and c and water chemistry the objectives of this study are to 1 characterize the source composition and transformation of dom during monsoon and non monsoon season in groundwater and surface water 2 reveal the drivers involved in seasonal dom dynamics 3 identify the roles of dom dynamics on seasonal as variations in shallow quaternary alluvial aquifer systems these findings are generally applicable to similar geogenic as affected quaternary aquifers in

during the monsoon season whereas the same or lower during non monsoon season table s1 thus permeation of groundwater from sya to syb prevails the interaction between groundwater and surface water is intense during monsoon season and groundwater may recharge surface water during non monsoon season groundwater chemistry in sya differs from that in syb the ph of groundwater in sya is between 6 58

during monsoon season median 9 0 groundwater Œ¥13c values in dissolved organic carbon Œ¥13cdoc range between 29 3 and 12 3 median 23 6 at sya while between 31 0 and 15 3 median 20 0 at syb with heavier Œ¥13cdoc during non monsoon season median 15 9 than during monsoon season median 29 7 which is opposite to the Œ¥13cdic seasonal change trend the Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc values of surface water are only measured during non monsoon season median 7 6 and 24 7 respectively in general Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc are both more depleted in syb with heavier Œ¥13cdic but lighter Œ¥13cdoc during monsoon season fig 3 3 4 eem parafac analysis eem fluorescence spectra are validated with a three component parafac model for dom in water samples fig s1 the three components are recognized as one microbial humic like component component 1 c1 and two terrestrial humic like components component 2 and component 3 c2 and c3 the peaks identified in this study show many features in common with previously identified peaks found in many parafac studies on organic matter table 2 c1 shows an excitation emission ex em maximum at 250 424 nm with similar eem peak range to microbial humic like materials c2 exhibits its ex em maximum at 340 470 nm which is considered as terrestrial humic like component the components at longer wavelength are related to more conjugated fluorescent molecules structural condensation and polymerization of organic compounds which have higher aromaticity and more complicated structure chen et al 2003 hur and kim 2009 lee et al 2015 thus the humic like c2 is probably associated with larger molecular size and more condensed structure indicating a relatively more refractory nature c3 has a similar fluorophore spectrum to c2 it is identified at ex em maximum of 325 394 nm with a blue shift which could also be the terrestrial humic like component but less structurally condensed and more labile compared to c2 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal dom dynamics in groundwater the relative abundance of three components in groundwater dom shows obvious seasonal variations in sya component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 are higher during monsoon and lower during non monsoon season while component 1 c1 exhibits the opposite trend fig 4 the relative abundance of c1 c2 and c3 is relatively stable in syb fig 4 indicating the intensive interaction between sya and surface water according to the dom components assignment table 2 the higher relative abundance of c2 and c3 might relate to the introduction of terrestrial humic like components by rainfall during monsoon and higher c1 indicates more microbial humic like component derived during non monsoon season fluorescence indices fi hix bix and Œ≤ Œ± could also shed a light on dom characteristics and transformation in groundwater table 3 the biological index bix values ranged from 0 7 to 0 8 show an overall intermediate autochthonous component in groundwater lower fluorescence index fi values 1 4 indicate dom from terrestrial sources such as plant and soil organic matter make up the major contribution cory and mcknight 2005 fellman et al 2010 mcknight et al 2001 higher humification index hix values 6 16 are found during non monsoon season indicating important humic character and weak recent autochthonous component introduced into groundwater the calculated microbial to terrestrial ratios mti are higher during non monsoon and in syb table 3 which provides another evidence that the intensive microbial activities occur in deeper aquifers and during non monsoon season and is consistent with the findings above moreover Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc values also show seasonal variations in both aquifers the Œ¥13cdic values are smaller whereas the Œ¥13cdoc are larger during non monsoon season fig 3 generally the main sources for dic in groundwater are atmospheric co2 soil co2 biotic respiration and carbonate dissolution wachniew 2006 the Œ¥13cdic is about 0 in marine carbonate rocks 25 in the soil co2 similar to plants between 25 and 18 when microbial decomposition of organic matter and 7 in the atmospheric co2 truesdell and hulston 1980 wachniew 2006 xie et al 2013 during microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter light carbon 12c is preferentially respired clark and fritz 1997 theoretically causing relatively lower Œ¥13cdic and higher dic concentration in groundwater which may illustrate active microbial processes in contrast relatively higher Œ¥13cdic may indicate comparatively low microbial activities most groundwater has Œ¥13cdic values lower than 12 in syb which could attribute to a biogenic source lower Œ¥13cdic values consistent with higher relative abundance of c1 in groundwater indicate that microbial activities are active and microbially derived dom is enriched during non monsoon season especially in deeper aquifers 4 2 groundwater and surface water interactions involved in seasonal dom dynamics the characteristics of dom differ significantly between groundwater and surface water in jianghan plain the doc concentrations of surface water median 4 90 mg l 1 are close to those of sya median 5 47 mg l 1 but higher than those of syb median 3 22 mg l 1 higher bix values 0 7 to 0 9 are found in most surface water except a highest one 1 4 in the pond sample which corresponds to a predominantly autochthonous origin of dom and to the presence of om freshly released into water the high bix values 1 could be explained as biological or aquatic bacterial origin in the pond huguet et al 2009 much lower hix values are found in surface water than groundwater table 3 these low hix values in surface water may be attributed to the mixing of groundwater and surface water which contains fresher microbially derived and less humified organic matter from sewage and other wastewater inputs knappett et al 2011 mladenov et al 2015 and algae parlanti et al 2000 the higher freshness index Œ≤ Œ± and mti values support this finding as well generally Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h are more depleted in deeper groundwater aquifer all samples are located around global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥2h 8Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥2h 7 96Œ¥18o 5 1 gan et al 2014 showing their precipitation origins fig 5 notably some surface water and groundwater samples are aligned parallel to but shifted apart from the gmwl which could be related to the mixing of direct vertical recharge and evaporated pore water and the meteoric water has experienced evaporation before recharge allen 2004 the lower confined aquifer syb had both low salinity and lower Œ¥18o fig s3 higher salinity of sya could be introduced by surface water thus demonstrating that the mixing between groundwater and surface water is more intensive at shallower depths especially when surface water is replenished during monsoonal precipitation desbarats et al 2014 the cl br mass ratios increase with cl concentrations fig 6 although some samples are absent due to undetectable bromide concentrations the dilute groundwater end member of cl br of 20 and 1 4 mg l 1cl is obtained from mcarthur et al 2012 the low cl br 20 and cl 10 mg l 1 of samples that plotted below the dilute recharge zone may be attributed to recharge with dilute and uncontaminated rainwater or surface water or to the decomposition of organic matter organic matter concentrates bromide over chloride and mineralization of organic matter in aquifers decreases cl br in groundwater by increasing concentrations of bromide with respect to chloride in contrast our samples plotted above the seawater mixing line of mcarthur et al 2012 may receive the recharge from evaporated and contaminated sources evaporation of infiltrating water increases the cl concentrations in recharge but leaves cl br unaffected the highest cl br and cl concentration sample collected from the tongshun river tsr is considered as a surface water end member that receives sewage the inputs of cl containing non point and point source pollutants could also cause increase of cl br ratio in aquifers thus the fluorescence characteristics of surface water and cl br mass ratios results suggest that groundwater is recharged by dilute rainwater evaporated surface water and polluted surface water and could lead to seasonal dom dynamics during monsoonal recharge and groundwater surface water interactions for instance paddy cultivation is a common agricultural practice the harvested crop is cut from the middle of stem and the remnants of the stem and roots are plowed back for next cultivation during the next cultivation paddy fields are flooded with rain water and irrigation water the decomposition of the remnants increases the contents of organic carbon in the soils mandal et al 2004 chen et al 2018 then the infiltrating irrigation water could transport labile carbon to directly introduce more terrestrial dom and increase doc concentrations into groundwater during monsoon season 4 3 effects of seasonal dom dynamics on seasonal as mobilization organic matter is critical for as mobilization in aquifer systems on the one hand the humic like components can form complexes with as through positively charged amino groups as dom binary complexes or through metal cation bridges as fe dom ternary complexes mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 which leads to high as mobility redman et al 2002 saada et al 2003 specifically terrestrially derived aromatic humic like substance hs may promote as fe hs complexation reactions mladenov et al 2015 among the relative abundances of three dom components the two from terrestrial origins c2 and c3 show positive relationship with as concentrations in two different trends fig 7 b c suggesting that the terrestrially derived humic like component should be conducive to as enrichment the as concentrations increase significantly when c2 and c3 increase in syb trend 1 however with a relatively slow rate in sya trend 2 the relatively higher correlation coefficient of trend 2 in c2 r 0 57 p 0 01 than in c3 r 0 36 p 0 01 indicates that higher molecular weight organics are more likely involved in the complexation reactions the reactions usually happen when the organic acids e g humic acid with specific functional groups which are available to complex with as pourret et al 2007 for instance phenolic hydroxyl groups on humic acids can bind to as hydroxides under different ph conditions at elevated ph hydroxides compete with phenolic hydroxyl groups resulting in the release of as adsorbed on mineral surfaces warwick et al 2005 on the other hand the decomposition of biodegradable dom may result in microbially mediated reduction of fe iii oxides to fe ii and reduction of as v to as iii fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2019 leading to as release from solid surfaces into groundwater from fig 8 a it can be seen that there are two trends between dissolved as and fe ii concentrations first there is a mutual increase and as shows a good positive correlation with fe ii in syb which can be attributed to the concurrent release of fe ii and as that is controlled by the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides hydroxides second the fe ii concentrations monotonously increase while as concentrations keep at a relatively low level in sya in this case as behavior should have been controlled by other non conservative processes it is worth noting that high concentrations of doc are observed in high fe ii groundwater fig 8b with a strong positive correlation r 0 64 p 0 01 the consistent variations of fe ii and as between seasons fig 2c d and the strong relationship between fe ii and doc concentrations fig 8b reflect the critical role of doc in as mobilization via fe iii oxides hydroxides reduction mediated by microorganisms this is also evidenced by elevations of as and fe ii concentrations along with higher c1 maximum fluorescence intensity fig 7a and fig 7d especially during non monsoon season thus the labile dom could be easily utilized by indigenous microorganisms as an electron donor to promote the microbial respiration which favors the reduction of fe iii oxides hydroxides releasing more microbially derived humic like components and accumulating as into aqueous phase the Œ¥Œ¥13c here defined as Œ¥13cdic Œ¥13cdoc could reflect the intensity of microbial degradation of organic matters increased Œ¥13cdoc and decreased Œ¥13cdic values smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c are related to a more sufficient biotransformation of organic matter into dic farquhar et al 2007 i e a higher intensity of microbial degradation by contrast decreased Œ¥13cdoc and increased Œ¥13cdic values larger Œ¥Œ¥13c might be interpreted as inadequate biodegradation of doc into dic under weakly reducing conditions with less intensive microbial activities in this study smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c values with higher as concentrations are found during non monsoon while larger Œ¥Œ¥13c values with relatively lower as concentrations are observed during monsoon season fig 9 a therefore the intensified biodegradation of dom and biotransformation of doc into dic could favor as mobilization into groundwater during non monsoon season however lower fe ii concentrations are associated with smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c values during non monsoon fig 9b which may result from siderite precipitation given more hco3 generated by dom degradation phreeqc calculation showed that most groundwaters are oversaturated with respect to siderite fig s2 due to limited adsorption of arsenic on siderite more as is released from fe iii oxides reduction coupled with dom degradation than that scavenged by siderite precipitation guo et al 2013 thus the results suggest that seasonal variations of as concentrations could be correlated with biodegradation of labile organic matter and terrestrially derived high molecular weight humic like components promote seasonal as mobilization via complexation reactions 5 conclusions seasonal dynamics of dom in shallow phreatic and confined aquifers were observed in jianghan plain where groundwater is mostly of a ca mg hco3 type with elevated dic contents three components of dom were identified by eem parafac analysis including one microbially derived humic like component and two terrestrially derived humic like components with high and low molecular weight respectively their spectroscopic properties illustrate an overall intermediate autochthonous and terrestrially derived dom in the aquifers the relative abundance of the three components show that the microbial humic like component is higher during non monsoon season and more terrestrial humic like components are found during monsoon season the results of stable h and o isotopes and cl br mass ratios results suggest that the observed seasonal dom dynamics might relate to groundwater surface water interactions with diverse sources of groundwater recharge dilute rainwater evaporated surface water and polluted surface water during monsoonal recharge more terrestrial humic like components are introduced by precipitation and local agricultural activities during monsoon such as irrigation and paddy cultivation increase in as concentrations was observed during non monsoon season the seasonal as variations strongly correlate with seasonal dom dynamics as shown by the results of both fluorescence spectroscopy and stable carbon isotopic compositions Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc terrestrial humic like dom may promote as mobilization via complexation reactions especially with high molecular weight humic like component to form as dom and or as fe dom complex labile dom could be utilized by microorganisms through microbially mediated reduction of fe oxides hydroxides leading to as enrichment and humic substances could serve as an electron donor and electron shuttle to accelerate the process of reductive dissolution thus enhancing as mobility our results suggest that seasonally high as concentrations are likely associated with the different extents of microbial degradation of labile organic matter and seasonal introduction of terrestrially derived humic like components which is controlled by groundwater surface water interactions in

5218,dissolved organic matter dom plays critical roles in biogeochemistry of arsenic in groundwater systems to characterize the spatial temporal variations of groundwater dom and its impacts on arsenic dynamics surface water and shallow groundwater from two different depths were collected during monsoon and non monsoon periods in jianghan plain central yangtze river basin parallel factor analysis parafac of the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem reveals that dom comprises three major components one microbial humic like component c1 and two terrestrial humic like components c2 and c3 abundant terrestrially derived humic like components were observed during monsoon while more microbially derived dom occurred in groundwater during non monsoon season these seasonal dom variations are found to be related to groundwater surface water gw sw interactions which is evidenced by stable h and o isotopes and cl br mass ratios during monsoon season groundwater is recharged from dilute rainwater evaporated surface water and polluted surface water more terrestrial humic like components are introduced by precipitation and local agricultural activities e g irrigation paddy cultivation during monsoon the fluorescence spectroscopy and stable carbon isotopes Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc results indicate that seasonal as variations are affected by seasonal dom dynamics smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c values defined as Œ¥13cdic Œ¥13cdoc with higher as concentrations are found during non monsoon while larger Œ¥Œ¥13c values with relatively lower as concentrations are observed during monsoon season the strong correlation between doc and fe ii concentrations r 0 64 p 0 01 and that between c2 maximum fluorescence intensity and as concentrations r 0 57 p 0 01 clearly reflect the critical role of doc in as mobilization the seasonal variations of as concentrations are therefore correlated with biodegradation of labile organic matter and terrestrially derived high molecular weight humic like components promote seasonal as mobilization via complexation reactions these findings reveal the effects of seasonal dom variations on as dynamics in shallow quaternary alluvial aquifers and are applicable to similar geogenic as affected quaternary aquifers in floodplains and river delta regions of monsoon climate keywords dissolved organic matter dom groundwater arsenic carbon isotope monsoon climate eem parafac 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitous in the aquatic environment has been reported as a key component in global carbon cycle and

e g terrestrial and anthropogenic inputs aitkenhead peterson et al 2003 bertilsson and jones 2003 the dom composition exhibits temporal and spatial variations borisover et al 2009 chen et al 2013 jaff√© et al 2008 which are controlled by diverse hydro biogeochemical processes hudson et al 2007 kalbitz et al 2000 qualls and richardson 2003 yamashita et al 2010 seasonal variations of dom have received considerable attention as a primary factor in determining the chemical variability of dom in recent years brooks et al 2007 catal√°n et al 2013 fellman et al 2009 larsen et al 2010 o donnell et al 2010 singh et al 2014 however most of previous studies focus on the seasonal dynamics of dom in wetlands lakes rivers estuaries and coastal environments borisover et al 2009 jaff√© et al 2008 singh et al 2014 little work has been done to observe the seasonal variations of dom in groundwater and its interaction with surface water groundwater could act as the sources of stream water and dom which is controlled by hydrologic regimes such as flow paths and connectivity hood et al 2006 larsen et al 2010 singh et al 2014 since dom serves as the carbon source for metabolism of microorganisms in the subsurface environment studying the seasonal changes in groundwater dom and the drivers involved is critical not only for comprehensive understanding of dom in hydrosphere but also for better understanding of biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems moreover dom also plays an essential role in the transport of trace metals and organic pollutants as some redox sensitive groundwater contaminants such as arsenic are affected by dom degradation appelo and postma 2005 which has important implications for water quality management and human public health findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 for instance geogenic arsenic as contamination of groundwater has been reported from over 70 countries with the most serious waterborne endemic arsenic poisoning occurring in south and southeast asia including china fendorf et al 2010 nordstrom 2002 rodr√≠guezlado et al 2013 wang et al 2019 many studies have highlighted the important role of dom in arsenic mobilization into groundwater dom

mladenov et al 2010 nickson et al 2000 other processes influencing as mobility include the complexation of as with dom and competitive sorption and electron shuttling reactions mediated by humic

groundwater have been observed in some areas the relationship between seasonal dom dynamics and seasonal as variations remains unclear planer friedrich et al 2012 different methods have been applied to characterize dom in the aquatic environment spectroscopic properties could well reflect the source and reactivity of dom fellman et al 2010 hudson et al 2007 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem is the simple way to characterize the spectroscopic properties of dom due to its high sensitivity low cost and fast response coble 1996 huguet et al 2009 parallel factor analysis parafac

stedmon et al 2003 including humic like protein like terrestrially derived and microbially derived components cory and mcknight 2005 mladenov et al 2015 fluorescence indices have been developed to further characterize dom on its extent of aromaticity and microbial activity such as humification index biological index fluorescence index and microbial to terrestrial index kulkarni et al 2017 li et al 2019 on the other hand stable carbon isotopes of dissolve inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc could be used to reveal the dom sources and biogeochemical processes related to microbial consumption and degradation of dom in groundwater guo et al 2014 guo et al 2016 mcknight et al 2003 zhou et al 2018 however few monitoring works have been done to combine both fluorescence

variations of as concentrations in groundwater jianghan plain is a typical quaternary alluvial lacustrine river basin in the middle reaches of yangtze river in central china where widespread lacustrine sediments with abundant dom occurred under reducing conditions that significantly influence the groundwater chemistry huang et al 2012 within the jianghan plain of the central yangtze river

characterize the source composition and transformation of dom during monsoon and non monsoon season in groundwater and surface water 2 reveal the drivers involved in seasonal dom dynamics 3 identify

levels of syb rise during monsoon median 21 4 m a s l and decline during non monsoon season median 20 7 m a s l similar trends are found in sya surface water levels are higher than groundwater levels during the monsoon season whereas the same or lower during non monsoon season table s1 thus permeation of groundwater from sya to syb prevails the interaction between groundwater and surface water is intense during monsoon season and groundwater may recharge surface water during non monsoon season groundwater chemistry in sya differs from that in syb the ph of groundwater in sya is between 6 58 and 7 37 while that in syb is between 7 05 and 7 76 the eh is 160 to 108 mv in sya while that is 186 to 3 50 mv in syb indicating more reducing environment in syb doc concentrations are higher in sya median 5 47 mg l 1 than in syb median 3 22 mg l 1 temporal variations of the concentrations of redox sensitive components are observed in groundwater for instance in syb the sulfide concentrations are

monsoon than during non monsoon season 162 mv to 3 5 mv and similar pattern could also be found in sya doc concentrations also have seasonal variations although different trends are observed in different aquifers which range from 2 07 to 7 97 mg l 1 during non monsoon and from 3 94 to 12 3 mg l 1 during monsoon in sya and vary from 2 24 to 6 84 mg l 1 during non monsoon and from 2 24 to 3 91

of arsenic who 2011 groundwater with low eh usually has high as concentrations fig 2b and seasonal as variations are observed with elevated as concentrations during non monsoon season fig 2c d the reductive dissolution of fe oxides has been widely accepted as the mechanism for as release and mobilization in reducing conditions which is also evidenced by the consistent variations of as and fe ii concentrations between seasons these coupling of increases and decreases could be observed from two selected wells fig 2c d and also all other monitoring wells at the field area table 1 3 3 isotope geochemistry 3 3 1 oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes seasonal variations of o and h isotopic signatures of water samples have been observed with average Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h value during monsoon of 7 4 and 48 6 sw 6 4 and 41 2 sya and 7 7 and 47 7 syb and those during non monsoon season of 5 0 and 38 0 sw 6 4 and 41 0 sya and 7 3 and 47 4 syb respectively 3 3 2 stable carbon isotopes groundwater Œ¥13c values in dissolved inorganic carbon Œ¥13cdic vary from 16 9 to 1 9 median 5 7 at sya whereas from 14 1 to 6 2 median 11 3 at syb with lighter Œ¥13cdic during non monsoon season median 13 1 than during monsoon season median 9 0 groundwater Œ¥13c values in dissolved organic carbon Œ¥13cdoc range between 29 3 and 12 3 median 23 6 at sya while between 31 0 and 15 3 median 20 0 at syb with heavier Œ¥13cdoc during non monsoon season median 15 9 than during monsoon season median 29 7 which is opposite to the Œ¥13cdic seasonal change trend the Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc values of surface water are only measured during non monsoon season median 7 6 and 24 7 respectively in general Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc are both more depleted in syb with heavier Œ¥13cdic but lighter Œ¥13cdoc during monsoon season fig 3 3 4 eem parafac analysis eem fluorescence spectra are validated with a three component parafac model for dom in water samples fig s1 the three components are recognized as one microbial humic like component component 1 c1 and two terrestrial humic like components component 2 and component 3 c2 and c3 the peaks identified in this study show many features in common with previously identified peaks found in many parafac studies on organic matter table 2 c1 shows an excitation emission ex em maximum at 250 424 nm with similar eem peak range to microbial humic like materials c2 exhibits its ex em maximum at 340 470 nm which is considered as terrestrial humic like component the components at longer wavelength are related to more conjugated fluorescent molecules structural condensation and polymerization of organic compounds which have higher aromaticity and more complicated structure chen et al 2003 hur and kim 2009 lee et al 2015 thus the humic like c2 is probably associated with larger molecular size and more condensed structure indicating a relatively more refractory nature c3 has a similar fluorophore spectrum to c2 it is identified at ex em maximum of 325 394 nm with a blue shift which could also be the terrestrial humic like component but less structurally condensed and more labile compared to c2 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal dom dynamics in groundwater the relative abundance of three components in groundwater dom shows obvious seasonal variations in sya component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 are higher during monsoon and lower during non monsoon season while component 1 c1 exhibits the opposite trend fig 4 the relative abundance of c1 c2 and c3 is relatively stable in syb fig 4 indicating the intensive interaction between sya and surface water according to the dom components assignment table 2 the higher relative abundance of c2 and c3 might relate to the introduction of terrestrial humic like components by rainfall during monsoon and higher c1 indicates more microbial humic like component derived during non monsoon season fluorescence indices fi hix bix and Œ≤ Œ± could also shed a light on dom characteristics and transformation in groundwater table 3 the biological index bix values ranged from 0 7 to 0 8 show an overall intermediate autochthonous component in groundwater lower fluorescence index fi values 1 4 indicate dom from terrestrial sources such as plant and soil organic matter make up the major contribution cory and mcknight 2005 fellman et al 2010 mcknight et al 2001 higher humification index hix values 6 16 are found during non monsoon season indicating important humic character and weak recent autochthonous component introduced into groundwater the calculated microbial to terrestrial ratios mti are higher during non monsoon and in syb table 3 which provides another evidence that the intensive microbial activities occur in deeper aquifers and during non monsoon season and is consistent with the findings above moreover Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc values also show seasonal variations in both aquifers the Œ¥13cdic values are smaller whereas the Œ¥13cdoc are larger during non monsoon season fig 3 generally the main sources for dic in groundwater are atmospheric co2 soil co2 biotic respiration and carbonate dissolution wachniew 2006 the Œ¥13cdic is about 0 in marine carbonate rocks 25 in the soil co2 similar to plants between 25 and 18 when microbial decomposition of organic matter and 7 in the atmospheric co2 truesdell and hulston 1980 wachniew 2006 xie et al 2013 during microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter light carbon 12c is preferentially respired clark and fritz 1997 theoretically causing relatively lower Œ¥13cdic and higher dic concentration in groundwater which may illustrate active microbial processes in contrast relatively higher Œ¥13cdic may indicate comparatively low microbial activities most groundwater has Œ¥13cdic values lower than 12 in syb which could attribute to a biogenic source lower Œ¥13cdic values consistent with higher relative abundance of c1 in groundwater indicate that microbial activities are active and microbially derived dom is enriched during non monsoon season especially in deeper aquifers 4 2 groundwater and surface water interactions involved in seasonal dom dynamics the characteristics of dom differ significantly between groundwater and surface water in jianghan plain the doc concentrations of surface water median 4 90 mg l 1 are close to those of sya median 5 47 mg l 1 but higher than those of syb median 3 22 mg l 1 higher bix values 0 7 to 0 9 are found in most surface water except a highest one 1 4 in the pond sample which corresponds to a predominantly autochthonous origin of dom and to the presence of om freshly released into water the high bix values 1 could be explained as biological or aquatic bacterial origin in the pond huguet et al 2009 much lower hix values are found in surface water than groundwater table 3 these low hix values in surface water may be attributed to the mixing of groundwater and surface water which contains fresher microbially derived and less humified organic matter from sewage and other wastewater inputs knappett et al 2011 mladenov et al 2015 and algae parlanti et al 2000 the higher freshness index Œ≤ Œ± and mti values support this finding as well generally Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h are more depleted in deeper groundwater aquifer all samples are located around global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥2h 8Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥2h 7 96Œ¥18o 5 1 gan et al 2014 showing their precipitation origins fig 5 notably some surface water and groundwater samples are aligned parallel to but shifted apart from the gmwl which could be related to the mixing of direct vertical recharge and evaporated pore water and the meteoric water has experienced evaporation before recharge allen 2004 the lower confined aquifer syb had both low salinity and lower Œ¥18o fig s3 higher salinity of sya could be introduced by surface water thus demonstrating that the mixing between groundwater and surface water is more intensive at shallower depths especially when surface water is replenished during monsoonal precipitation desbarats et al 2014 the cl br mass ratios increase with cl concentrations fig 6 although some samples are absent due to undetectable bromide concentrations the dilute groundwater end member of cl br of 20 and 1 4 mg l 1cl is obtained from mcarthur et al 2012 the low cl br 20 and cl 10 mg l 1 of samples that plotted below the dilute recharge zone may be attributed to recharge with dilute and uncontaminated rainwater or surface water or to the decomposition of organic matter organic matter concentrates bromide over chloride and mineralization of organic matter in aquifers decreases cl br in groundwater by increasing concentrations of bromide with respect to chloride in contrast our samples plotted above the seawater mixing line of mcarthur et al 2012 may receive the recharge from evaporated and contaminated sources evaporation of infiltrating water increases the cl concentrations in recharge but leaves cl br unaffected the highest cl br and cl concentration sample collected from the tongshun river tsr is considered as a surface water end member that receives sewage the inputs of cl containing non point and point source pollutants could also cause increase of cl br ratio in aquifers thus the fluorescence characteristics of surface water and cl br mass ratios results suggest that groundwater is recharged by dilute rainwater evaporated surface water and polluted surface water and could lead to seasonal dom dynamics during monsoonal recharge and groundwater surface water interactions for instance paddy cultivation is a common agricultural practice the harvested crop is cut from the middle of stem and the remnants of the stem and roots are plowed back for next cultivation during the next cultivation paddy fields are flooded with rain water and irrigation water the decomposition of the remnants increases the contents of organic carbon in the soils mandal et al 2004 chen et al 2018 then the infiltrating irrigation water could transport labile carbon to directly introduce more terrestrial dom and increase doc concentrations into groundwater during monsoon season 4 3 effects of seasonal dom dynamics on seasonal as mobilization organic matter is critical for as mobilization in aquifer systems on the one hand the humic like components can form complexes with as through positively charged amino groups as dom binary complexes or through metal cation bridges as fe dom ternary complexes mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 which leads to high as mobility redman et al 2002 saada et al 2003 specifically terrestrially derived aromatic humic like substance hs may promote as fe hs complexation reactions mladenov et al 2015 among the relative abundances of three dom components the two from terrestrial origins c2 and c3 show positive relationship with as concentrations in two different trends fig 7 b c suggesting that the terrestrially derived humic like component should be conducive to as enrichment the as concentrations increase significantly when c2 and c3 increase in syb trend 1 however with a relatively slow rate in sya trend 2 the relatively higher correlation coefficient of trend 2 in c2 r 0 57 p 0 01 than in c3 r 0 36 p 0 01 indicates that higher molecular weight organics are more likely involved in the complexation reactions the reactions usually happen when the organic acids e g humic acid with specific functional groups which are available to complex with as pourret et al 2007 for instance phenolic hydroxyl groups on humic acids can bind to as hydroxides under different ph conditions at elevated ph hydroxides compete with phenolic hydroxyl groups resulting in the release of as adsorbed on mineral surfaces warwick et al 2005 on the other hand the decomposition of biodegradable dom may result in microbially mediated reduction of fe iii oxides to fe ii and reduction of as v to as iii fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2019 leading to as release from solid surfaces into groundwater from fig 8 a it can be seen that there are two trends between dissolved as and fe ii concentrations first there is a mutual increase and as shows a good positive correlation with fe ii in syb which can be attributed to the concurrent release of fe ii and as that is controlled by the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides hydroxides second the fe ii concentrations monotonously increase while as concentrations keep at a relatively low level in sya in this case as behavior should have been controlled by other non conservative processes it is worth noting that high concentrations of doc are observed in high fe ii groundwater fig 8b with a strong positive correlation r 0 64 p 0 01 the consistent variations of fe ii and as between seasons fig 2c d and the strong relationship between fe ii and doc concentrations fig 8b reflect the critical role of doc in as mobilization via fe iii oxides hydroxides reduction mediated by microorganisms this is also evidenced by elevations of as and fe ii concentrations along with higher c1 maximum fluorescence intensity fig 7a and fig 7d especially during non monsoon season thus the labile dom could be easily utilized by indigenous microorganisms as an electron donor to promote the microbial respiration which favors the reduction of fe iii oxides hydroxides releasing more microbially derived humic like components and accumulating as into aqueous phase the Œ¥Œ¥13c here defined as Œ¥13cdic Œ¥13cdoc could reflect the intensity of microbial degradation of organic matters increased Œ¥13cdoc and decreased Œ¥13cdic values smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c are related to a more sufficient biotransformation of organic matter into dic farquhar et al 2007 i e a higher intensity of microbial degradation by contrast decreased Œ¥13cdoc and increased Œ¥13cdic values larger Œ¥Œ¥13c might be interpreted as inadequate biodegradation of doc into dic under weakly reducing conditions with less intensive microbial activities in this study smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c values with higher as concentrations are found during non monsoon while larger Œ¥Œ¥13c values with relatively lower as concentrations are observed during monsoon season fig 9 a therefore the intensified biodegradation of dom and biotransformation of doc into dic could favor as mobilization into groundwater during non monsoon season however lower fe ii concentrations are associated with smaller Œ¥Œ¥13c values during non monsoon fig 9b which may result from siderite precipitation given more hco3 generated by dom degradation phreeqc calculation showed that most groundwaters are oversaturated with respect to siderite fig s2 due to limited adsorption of arsenic on siderite more as is released from fe iii oxides reduction coupled with dom degradation than that scavenged by siderite precipitation guo et al 2013 thus the results suggest that seasonal variations of as concentrations could be correlated with biodegradation of labile organic matter and terrestrially derived high molecular weight humic like components promote seasonal as mobilization via complexation reactions 5 conclusions seasonal dynamics of dom in shallow phreatic and confined aquifers were observed in jianghan plain where groundwater is mostly of a ca mg hco3 type with elevated dic contents three components of dom were identified by eem parafac analysis including one microbially derived humic like component and two terrestrially derived humic like components with high and low molecular weight respectively their spectroscopic properties illustrate an overall intermediate autochthonous and terrestrially derived dom in the aquifers the relative abundance of the three components show that the microbial humic like component is higher during non monsoon season and more terrestrial humic like components are found during monsoon season the results of stable h and o isotopes and cl br mass ratios results suggest that the observed seasonal dom dynamics might relate to groundwater surface water interactions with diverse sources of groundwater recharge dilute rainwater evaporated surface water and polluted surface water during monsoonal recharge more terrestrial humic like components are introduced by precipitation and local agricultural activities during monsoon such as irrigation and paddy cultivation increase in as concentrations was observed during non monsoon season the seasonal as variations strongly correlate with seasonal dom dynamics as shown by the results of both fluorescence spectroscopy and stable carbon isotopic compositions Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cdoc terrestrial humic like dom may promote as mobilization via complexation reactions especially with high molecular weight humic like component to form as dom and or as fe dom complex labile dom could be utilized by microorganisms through microbially mediated reduction of fe oxides hydroxides leading to as enrichment and humic substances could serve as an electron donor and electron shuttle to accelerate the process of reductive dissolution thus enhancing as mobility our results suggest that seasonally high as concentrations are likely associated with the different extents of microbial degradation of labile organic matter and seasonal introduction of terrestrially derived humic like components which is controlled by groundwater surface water interactions in different seasons credit authorship contribution statement yijun yang methodology data curation writing original draft visualization xiaofang yuan investigation yamin deng conceptualization writing

5219,the propagation of tides into coastal aquifers is an important phenomenon in the migration of coastal contaminants for the representation of shoreline boundary conditions in regional scale groundwater models and for the estimation of aquifer properties based on tidal amplitude attenuation and or phase increase in this study an analytical solution to the propagation of tidal fluctuations in a radial flow field applicable to circular islands is compared to the existing straight coastline ferris solution the analytical solution is compared to numerical simulation using seawat of a simple harmonic ocean tide and its propagation within a circular island this represents the first attempt to combine a previous correction that allows seawat to simulate axisymmetric flow and a modification to seawat to create tidal boundary conditions bench testing the analytical solution against the numerical model confirms the numerical approach the circular island solution is compared to the ferris solution in terms of tidal amplitude decay and phase shift whereas amplitude decay from the ferris solution is valid only for near shore locations within circular islands the ferris solution produces reasonable phase lag estimates for typical aquifer diffusivities and for most locations within circular islands by comparing the ferris and circular island solutions we propose a correction factor to the ferris solution that allows it to be applied in circular boundary settings this extends the application of the widely applied ferris solution to a broader range of situations keywords coastal aquifer tidal propagation phase lag radial groundwater flow ferris solution 1 introduction tidal propagation in coastal aquifers has been shown to be an important phenomenon in studies of coastal contaminant transport and seawater intrusion and for the field estimation of aquifer diffusivity e g ferris 1951 werner and lockington 2006 pool et al 2014 the development of methodologies to predict the transmission of tides in coastal aquifers has been the subject of significant research attention e g jacob 1950 ferris 1951 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 chuang and yeh 2007 guo et al 2010 consequently several analytical solutions to groundwater tidal propagation have been devised ferris 1951 provided the most popular analytical solution for estimating the characteristics amplitude and phase of groundwater oscillations caused by ocean tides the analytical solution hereafter termed the ferris solution is based on the analogous work of ingersoll et al 1948 for the conduction of heat in solids and that of jacob 1950 who was the first to present an analytical solution to groundwater fluctuations in response to a tidal force it applies to aquifers with hydraulic diffusivity Œ± l2 t 1 that is constant in space and time i e homogeneous confined aquifer conditions and vertical straight infinitely long coastlines hydraulic diffusivity is the ratio between transmissivity t l2 t 1 and storativity s e g merritt 2004 or hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 and specific storage s s l 1 e g depner and rasmussen 2016 the ferris solution has been applied to islands with somewhat orbiculate rounded curvilinear or irregular shorelines e g banerjee et al 2008 rotzoll and el kadi 2008 chattopadhyay et al 2014 however it is currently unclear whether the curvature of these islands invalidates the use of the ferris solution an analytical solution to tidal propagation in circular islands is an important tool to estimate aquifer properties the remoteness and strong influence of tides on many small islands often hampers the determination of their aquifer properties using standard methods such as pump tests williams et al 1970 presented the first attempt to assess the effect of tidal propagation within circular islands in their technical report on tidal effects in hawaii they studied the influence of tides on groundwater flow through analytical physical i e polyurethane foam tank and electric analogue models the conceptual models of williams et al 1970 include straight coastlines consistent with the ferris solution and circular boundaries physical and electrical analogue models were used to evaluate the straight coastline analytical solutions townley 1995 also presented a set of analytical solutions for periodic aquifer flow including circular boundaries trefry 1999 applied townley s 1995 methodology to extend it to aquifers of composite structure the objective of this paper is to describe an analytical solution for the response of groundwater hydraulic heads to oceanic tidal fluctuation in aquifers with circular boundaries i e circular islands although the solution presented here is an existing solution the evaluation of the ferris solution to curved coastlines was not assessed in previous studies i e williams et al 1970 townley 1995 likewise the same underlying assumptions i e homogenous isotropic confined aquifer that apply to the ferris solution are adopted the analytical solution for circular boundaries is analogous to heat conduction theory developed by carslaw and jaeger 1959 which provides the basis for the mathematical development of the current solution we compare the analytical solution to a numerical solution using a modified version of seawat post 2011 the numerical model adopts langevin s 2008 radial adaptation to seawat parameters thereby leading to the first published attempt to simulate tidal propagation in circular islands combining the langevin 2008 approach to radial flow simulation and the modified version of seawat post 2011 that provides for a tidal boundary condition the present study aims to provide guidance on the application of straight boundary based analytical solutions to tidal propagation where shorelines are circular by exploring the accuracy of the ferris solution when applied to curved coastlines 2 conceptual model fig 1 shows a cross section in radial coordinates through a homogeneous circular island that is confined and of uniform geometry the same conceptual model was used by ferris 1951 except cartesian rather than radial coordinates are adopted the cross section length is the radius of the island a and axisymmetric flow is assumed fig 1 is bounded to the left and right by the centre of the island and the ocean respectively the seaward boundary is defined by a simple harmonic tidal signal and water density variations are neglected numerically the centre of the island is defined by a no horizontal flow boundary condition despite the fact that island aquifers are generally unconfined with shallow watertables e g werner et al 2017 confined aquifer conditions are often presumed for the sake of mathematical tractability e g bear 1979 p 115 that is the groundwater flow equation for a phreatic aquifer i e the boussinesq equation is linearised by adopting the dupuit approximation and assuming a constant average t i e first method of linearisation of bear 1979 p 115 which is reasonable where watertable fluctuations are small relative to the saturated thickness from the base of the aquifer e g ferris 1951 thus the ferris solution may be applied to unconfined aquifers for relatively small tidal amplitudes erskine 1991 supported the use of ferris 1951 in a costal unconfined aquifer in the uk where the groundwater tides observed at different distances from the shoreline appeared to follow the same trends that are described by the ferris solution serrano and workman 1998 explored the difference between adopting the linearised and nonlinear boussinesq equation for an unconfined aquifer subject to the tidal influence of a river they compared results to observed groundwater heads and found that both approaches provided similar results except when the ratio of the amplitude of the river tide to the average aquifer thickness was higher than about 0 16 for which the nonlinear boussinesq equation better represented head changes 3 circular island solution here we develop the circular island analytical solution i e williams et al 1970 townley 1995 to seek functional relationships between the circular and ferris solutions following the assumption of small tidal amplitudes the circular island solution is found by solving the one dimensional axisymmetric groundwater

clear that the two variables a gf and œÜ f are exponentially related conversely in the case of the circular island solution i e eqs 10 and 11 the relationship between a g and œÜ is more complex the applicability of the ferris solution to circular boundaries is assessed by comparing the ratios a gf a g and œÜ f œÜ the comparison between the ferris and circular island solutions was undertaken for a hypothetical island of a 500 m the total simulation time was 100 days subdivided into 10 000 uniform time steps contrary to the analysis in the previous section where 20 000 time steps were used

5219,the propagation of tides into coastal aquifers is an important phenomenon in the migration of coastal contaminants for the representation of shoreline boundary conditions in regional scale groundwater models and for the estimation of aquifer properties based on tidal amplitude attenuation and or phase increase in this study an analytical solution to the propagation of tidal fluctuations in a radial flow field applicable to circular islands is compared to the existing straight coastline ferris solution the analytical solution is compared to numerical simulation using seawat of a simple harmonic ocean tide and its propagation within a circular island this represents the first attempt to combine a previous correction that allows seawat to simulate axisymmetric flow and a modification to seawat to create tidal boundary conditions bench testing the analytical solution against the numerical model confirms the numerical approach the circular island solution is compared to the ferris solution in terms of tidal amplitude decay and phase shift whereas amplitude decay from the ferris solution is valid only for near shore locations within circular islands the ferris solution produces reasonable phase lag estimates for typical aquifer diffusivities and for most locations within circular islands by comparing the ferris and circular island solutions we propose a correction factor to the ferris solution that allows it to be applied in circular boundary settings this extends the application of the widely applied ferris solution to a broader range of situations keywords coastal aquifer tidal propagation phase lag radial groundwater flow ferris solution 1 introduction tidal propagation in coastal aquifers has been shown to be an important phenomenon in studies of coastal contaminant transport and seawater intrusion and for the field estimation of aquifer diffusivity e g ferris 1951 werner and lockington 2006 pool et al 2014 the development of methodologies to predict the transmission of tides in coastal aquifers has been the subject of significant research attention e g jacob 1950 ferris 1951 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 chuang and yeh 2007 guo et al 2010 consequently several analytical solutions to groundwater tidal propagation have been devised ferris 1951 provided the most popular analytical solution for estimating the characteristics amplitude and phase of groundwater oscillations caused by ocean tides the analytical solution hereafter termed the ferris solution is based on the analogous work of ingersoll et al 1948 for the conduction of heat in solids and that of jacob 1950 who was the first to present an analytical solution to groundwater fluctuations in response to a tidal force it applies to aquifers with hydraulic diffusivity Œ± l2 t 1 that is constant in space and time i e homogeneous confined aquifer conditions and vertical straight infinitely long coastlines hydraulic diffusivity is the ratio between transmissivity t l2 t 1 and storativity s e g merritt 2004 or hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 and specific storage s s l 1 e g depner and rasmussen 2016 the ferris solution has been applied to islands with somewhat orbiculate rounded curvilinear or irregular shorelines e g banerjee et al 2008 rotzoll and el kadi 2008 chattopadhyay et al 2014 however it is currently unclear whether the curvature of these islands invalidates the use of the ferris solution an analytical solution to tidal propagation in circular islands is an important tool to estimate aquifer properties the remoteness and strong influence of tides on many small islands often hampers the determination of their aquifer properties using standard methods such as pump tests williams et al 1970 presented the first attempt to assess the effect of tidal propagation within circular islands in their technical report on tidal effects in hawaii they studied the influence of tides on groundwater flow through analytical physical i e polyurethane foam tank and electric analogue models the conceptual models of williams et al 1970 include straight coastlines consistent with the ferris solution and circular boundaries physical and electrical analogue models were used to evaluate the straight coastline analytical solutions townley 1995 also presented a set of analytical solutions for periodic aquifer flow including circular boundaries trefry 1999 applied townley s 1995 methodology to extend it to aquifers of composite structure the objective of this paper is to describe an analytical solution for the response of groundwater hydraulic heads to oceanic tidal fluctuation in aquifers with circular boundaries i e circular islands although the solution presented here is an existing solution the evaluation of the ferris solution to curved coastlines was not assessed in previous studies i e williams et al 1970 townley 1995 likewise the same underlying assumptions i e homogenous isotropic confined aquifer that apply to the ferris solution are adopted the analytical solution for circular boundaries is analogous to heat conduction theory developed by carslaw and jaeger 1959 which provides the basis for the mathematical development of the current solution we compare the analytical solution to a numerical solution using a modified version of seawat post 2011 the numerical model adopts langevin s 2008 radial adaptation to seawat parameters thereby leading to the first published attempt to simulate tidal propagation in circular islands combining the langevin 2008 approach to radial flow simulation and the modified version of seawat post 2011 that provides for a tidal boundary condition the present study aims to provide guidance on the application of straight boundary based analytical solutions to tidal propagation where shorelines are circular by exploring the accuracy of the ferris solution when applied to curved coastlines 2 conceptual model fig 1 shows a cross section in radial coordinates through a homogeneous circular island that is confined and of uniform geometry the same conceptual model was used by ferris 1951 except cartesian rather than radial coordinates are adopted the cross section length is the radius of the island a and axisymmetric flow is assumed fig 1 is bounded to the left and right by the centre of the island and the ocean respectively the seaward boundary is defined by a simple harmonic tidal signal and water density variations are neglected numerically the centre of the island is defined by a no horizontal flow boundary condition despite the fact that island aquifers are generally unconfined with shallow watertables e g werner et al 2017 confined aquifer conditions are often presumed for the sake of mathematical tractability e g bear 1979 p 115 that is the groundwater flow equation for a phreatic aquifer i e the boussinesq equation is linearised by adopting the dupuit approximation and assuming a constant average t i e first method of linearisation of bear 1979 p 115 which is reasonable where watertable fluctuations are small relative to the saturated thickness from the base of the aquifer e g ferris 1951 thus the ferris solution may be applied to unconfined aquifers for relatively small tidal amplitudes erskine 1991 supported the use of ferris 1951 in a costal unconfined aquifer in the uk where the groundwater tides observed at different distances from the shoreline appeared to follow the same trends that are described by the ferris solution serrano and workman 1998 explored the difference between adopting the linearised and nonlinear boussinesq equation for an unconfined aquifer subject to the tidal influence of a river they compared results to observed groundwater heads and found that both approaches provided similar results except when the ratio of the amplitude of the river tide to the average aquifer thickness was higher than about 0 16 for which the nonlinear boussinesq equation better represented head changes 3 circular island solution here we develop the circular island analytical solution i e williams et al 1970 townley 1995 to seek functional relationships between the circular and ferris solutions following the assumption of small tidal amplitudes the circular island solution is found by solving the one dimensional axisymmetric groundwater

properties for island settings particularly given the advantages of tidal based approaches over aquifer testing methods such as pumping and also noting that errors of up to 60 a gf a g 0 4 may be incurred as the island centre is approached using the standard ferris solution credit authorship contribution statement s c sol√≥rzano rivas methodology software investigation formal analysis
