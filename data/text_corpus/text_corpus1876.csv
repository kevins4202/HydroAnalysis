9380,improving crop drought resistance is crucial for mitigating the impacts of drought stress on crop production worldwide for a long time deep roots have been considered one of the most effective ways to facilitate full utilization of subsoil water when topsoil water is not available under drought conditions however a deeper root system is not always associated with a higher drought resistance therefore gaining a comprehensive understanding of deep roots would be beneficial for improving drought resistance in this review we first systematically outline the deep root functions influencing crop drought resistance we propose that a deeper root system with low metabolic costs can benefit drought resistance particularly when subsoil water exists in water limited environments then we overview the methods including crop breeding and field managements to increase the drought resistance by regulating deep roots third we review the methods for phenotyping deep roots directly and indirectly high throughput deep root phenotyping methods in the field are highly needed and electromagnetic technologies are promising to satisfy this need in the future looking forward we provide some perspectives on studying deep root systems keywords deep root system soil water metabolism cost root phenotyping drought resistance 1 introduction world crop production is subject to many factors such as water scarcity the multifaceted threat of global climate change and the slow breeding process campbell et al 2016 springmann et al 2018 the global population is expected to increase to approximately 9 7 billion by 2050 and 5 0 billion people will live in water scarce areas koncag√ºl et al 2018 under global climate change the limitation of crop yields due to a lack of water will be further strengthened daryanto et al 2017 therefore improving crop drought resistance is an important way to increase crop yields gupta et al 2020 drought resistance is a complex trait in which crops use three mechanisms e g drought escape completion of the plant reproductive phase before drought stress drought avoidance maintenance of water supply and drought tolerance prevention of tissue damage due to low internal water content to enhance their survival under drought stress gupta et al 2020 the biological drought resistance which allows crop to survive under drought stress may not have beneficial effects in agricultural production bandurska 2022 therefore the drought resistance discussed in this review predominantly refers to the agricultural drought resistance which stabilizes yield by improving water uptake and water use efficiency in water limited environments in water limited areas there is not much rainfall during the crop growing season and the topsoil gradually becomes dry through evaporation and transpiration thus subsoil water becomes an important water source during late growing stages such as the reproductive stage wasson et al 2012 under these conditions crops that can make full use of subsoil water during flowering and grain filling periods can benefit yield production angus and van herwaarden 2001 yang et al 2021 manschadi et al 2006 found that in southern queensland australia for every 1 mm of water absorbed by the crop during the grain filling stage the yield increased by 55 kg ha 1 for a long time deep roots have been considered essential to obtain subsoil water to improve crop drought resistance gowda et al 2011 lynch 2018 wasaya et al 2018 however the correlation between deep roots and drought resistance is inconsistent palta and watt 2009 xiong et al 2006 compared the root growth of ancient and modern chinese wheat cultivars and found that when soil water is limited cultivars with large and deep roots can reach the subsoil to absorb water however there is also evidence that subsoil water uptake cannot alleviate the response to drought rasmussen et al 2020 on the one hand the insufficient water supply in the topsoil causes shallow roots to produce phytohormones such as abscisic acid resulting in the closure of stomata despite sufficient water supply in the deep soil dodd et al 2008 on the other hand the deep root system may have a large biomass which consumes high amounts of photosynthetic products resulting in a yield penalty lynch 2018 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the roles of deep roots in crop drought resistance will be beneficial however at present gaining knowledge on deep roots faces many challenges the deep root system is not only controlled by genes but is also dramatically affected by the growth environment kuijken et al 2015 wasson et al 2014 as a result we need to investigate under what conditions deep roots would benefit crop drought resistance or vice versa in addition deep root phenotyping has advanced in the past few decades but destructive methods soil coring trenching etc are commonly used for determining the root distribution maeght et al 2013 these methods are time and labor consuming which slows the progress of deep root research there are some reviews on root traits and drought resistance lynch 2013 paez garcia et al 2015 wasson et al 2012 and a few papers have highlighted the importance of deep roots for drought resistance lynch 2018 however the specific growth conditions under which deep roots can improve crop production are complex our current understanding of deep roots is not comprehensive furthermore the potential techniques for deep root phenotyping that can be used in the field is not fully recognized therefore the review attempts to provide potential answers to the following questions 1 what is the relationship between deep roots and crop drought resistance 2 how can crop yields be increased by improving deep root systems in drought environments 3 how can deep roots be phenotyped 2 deep roots for crop drought resistance 2 1 deep roots increase subsoil water uptake in general deep roots allow crops to obtain subsoil water which helps cool the canopy maintain leaf greenness and increase grain yield fang et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2020 zegada lizarazu and iijima 2015 since the roots of crops generally reach the maximum rooting depth during the flowering period a deeper rooting depth can result in more absorption of subsoil water at this time and afterward passioura 1983 in water limited environments deep rooted varieties or lines have been found to provide advantages in water use and yield formation in a variety of crops li et al 2022 found that under the same seasonal evapotranspiration deep roots increased soil water availability and improved yield in winter wheat uga et al 2013 found that deep rooted rice lines under drought conditions had significantly better water use and yield formation than shallow rooted lines with the same genetic background severini et al 2020 found a positive correlation between yield and rooting depth in diverse wheat and triticale genotypes r 0 61 n 36 henry et al 2011 found that rain fed lowland rice cultivars with higher root length density rld in the 35 45 cm soil profile had greater water extraction and better drought resistance the importance of deep roots for drought resistance is further verified by various root pruning experiments guo et al 2007 found that root pruning of winter wheat during the filling stage led to reduced leaf photosynthesis earlier senescence and a 35 9 43 4 decrease in yield but irrigation alleviated these negative effects furthermore root eating organisms such as termites nematodes and aphids severely reduce the yield of crops under drought conditions by reducing the rooting depth and root proliferation audebert et al 2000 while the yield of highly resistant cultivars was reported to increase marshall and smiley 2016 the direct cause of the reduced water uptake capacity of crops due to fewer or shallower roots is the reduction of the contact area between the roots and the soil mckenzie et al 2009 used mesh which had holes of 40 mm buried horizontally in 0 2 m soil to control root penetration and found that crops with unrestricted contact with subsoil performed better than crops with limited or no subsoil contact however in some cases the evidence that deep roots are important for drought resistance may need further investigation for example root pruning may produce severe changes in metabolic processes hormone homeostasis and gas fluxes bloom and caldwell 1988 which may not be conducive to water uptake this means that factors other than the deep roots may also play a role in subsoil water acquisition 2 2 factors influencing the function of deep roots 2 2 1 subsoil water availability although deep roots are important for improving drought resistance in most cases a greater number and amount of deep roots does not equate to stronger drought resistance the availability of subsoil water determines whether deep roots are useful palta and turner 2018 studies have shown that in years with sufficient water deep rooted cultivars are superior to shallow rooted cultivars in terms of yield and maintaining greenness while in years with limited subsoil water deep rooted cultivars lose their advantage christopher et al 2008 there is much subsoil water left after the harvest in many areas including rain fed areas liu et al 2018 but it is uncertain whether there is water available in the subsoil in all cases in particular in some cases the subsoil is prone to drought during the filling period terminal drought will do great harm to crop production habus jercic et al 2018 in water limited areas rainfall frequency and rainfall distribution determine the depth and time of soil wetting thereby affecting the role of deep roots in enhancing drought resistance palta and turner 2018 there are two patterns of rainfall in water limited areas one is that no effective rainfall occurs during the crop growing season and the other is that a frequently small amount of rainfall occurs during the crop growing season when there is no effective rainfall during the crop growing season the topsoil is drier than the subsoil and roots have to use water in the subsoil however if there is some rainfall during the crop growing season the topsoil can conserve water or even become wetter than the subsoil smith and harris 1981 simulated the impact of rainfall on soil water depth in aleppo syria during 12 years 1962 1974 and showed that in the driest 25 of the years rainfall only wetted the upper 0 4 m of the soil profile this means that the moisture content in the deep layer of the soil in water limited areas may be lower than the moisture content in the shallow layer in this case the ability of subsoil to provide more water will be limited on the other hand in different soil types the difference in soil water conductivity leads to different water absorption efficiencies of roots for example in high clay 70 90 soil even if the volumetric water content of the soil is high the soil has high resistance to water movement and deep root absorption is still limited markewitz et al 2010 in soils with high hydraulic conductivity such as sandy soil deep roots can absorb leached water while in clay soils with lower hydraulic conductivity shallow roots may be more important van wijk 2011 asseng and turner 2007 used the apsim model to simulate mediterranean climate regions they found that in sandy soils with a low soil water content and low nitrogen input deep roots allowed wheat to increase yield and water utilization efficiency but this advantage disappeared in clay with a high soil water content and low nitrogen input in addition the availability of subsoil water is affected by differences in soil structure even within the same soil type droogers et al 1997 for example when a clay layer exists in deep soil deep roots typically collect in pores with larger diameters resulting that subsoil water uptake may be constrained white and kirkegaard 2010 these results indicate that the availability of subsoil water is an important factor in determining whether deep root systems can improve drought resistance 2 2 2 the cost of root growth and metabolism a large and deep root system is not necessarily helpful for drought resistance even if there is available water in the subsoil although the increase in total root length and root mass can improve water uptake this also increases the cost of root growth and metabolism more non photosynthetic tissue must be maintained per unit leaf area for a large and deep root system which may lead to less photosynthetic products transferred to the grain mehrabi et al 2021 studies have shown that the metabolic cost of roots can exceed 50 of daily photosynthesis lambers et al 2002 therefore reducing the cost of root metabolism to some extent is beneficial for increasing yield on the other hand overmuch deep roots will accelerate the absorption of subsoil water leading to drought during the filling period figueroa bustos et al 2020 compared two wheat cultivars under terminal drought conditions and found that bahatans 87 had 81 higher root biomass and used 39 more water than tincurrin but produced 26 lower grain yield the excessive root biomass of bahatans 87 resulted in a rapid decrease in soil water content 17 days earlier than that under tincurrin and required a large number of photosynthetic products to maintain root metabolism in fact half of the roots of most crops are located in the top 0 20 cm of soil fan et al 2016 even with a large total root length the deep root length density drld of the subsoil is usually low an insufficient drld may cause the subsoil water to not be fully utilized due to reduced root soil contact white and kirkegaard 2010 it is estimated that the minimal root length density rld should be 0 8 1 0 cm cm 3 to effectively extract soil water and sufficient time and hydraulic conduction are required for contact with the soil passioura 1983 in the presence of available subsoil water a reduction in shallow roots and an increase in low cost and deep roots are beneficial to improve drought resistance in terms of root structure many root traits have an impact on the growth and water uptake of deep root systems table 1 there are three main strategies to increase subsoil water uptake and reduce the cost of root metabolism namely producing the optimum axial root number allocating more biomass to roots with lower metabolic needs and reducing the respiratory demand of root tissues lynch 2015 a reduction in the axial root number can increase drld and allow the absorption of more water in the subsoil which may be effective in improving drought resistance gao and lynch 2016 found that under water stress genotypes with low crown root number had 31 fewer crown roots and 30 deeper rooting depth than genotypes with high crown root number at 35 days after planting furthermore high number of roots in dry topsoil will produce high amounts of abscisic acid which may reduce the stomatal conductance and crop yield hund et al 2008 studies have shown that in the absence of water maize mutants lacking crown roots had better water conditions sebastian et al 2016 the number of tillers in tillering species may have a similar effect on root growth as the number of crown roots of maize lynch 2013 a reduction in the branching density of lateral roots in topsoil is similar to a reduction in the axial root number but lateral root branches have higher metabolic requirements than axial roots miller et al 2003 zhan et al 2015 found that a reduction in the branching density of lateral roots promoted axial root elongation and reduced root respiration thereby improving the drought resistance of maize compared with root length and root diameter root hair growth requires the least amount of biomass segal et al 2008 thus a reduction in the branching density of lateral roots in topsoil and an increase in the number of root hairs can increase subsoil water uptake and reduce the cost of root metabolism another way in which root metabolic costs can be reduced and deep root growth promoted may be the replacement of living cortical cells with air filled root cortical aerenchyma rca wasaya et al 2018 studies have shown that rca can significantly reduce the respiration and nutritional requirements of root tissues roots with a 30 cross sectional rca area had 70 less respiration than roots without rca fan et al 2003 the living cortex area lca is more predictive of root respiration soil exploration and drought resistance than rca formation and root diameter lynch 2015 this hypothesis was supported by a comparative study of drought resistance between high lca and low lca lines under water stress jaramillo et al 2013 although these hypotheses are supported by evidence the specific impact of changes in anatomy on water transport is still unclear 2 2 3 axial resistance to water transport the process of water transport in roots is also very important for crops to use subsoil water subsoil water must pass through the root xylem the diameter of which has a strong influence on the axial resistance of water transport richards and passioura 1989 proposed that cultivars with narrow xylem can make better use of subsoil water by increasing axial resistance a reduction in the diameter of the root xylem can increase the axial resistance of soil water from roots to shoots this can reduce soil water absorption in the early growth period so that more soil water can be used during the grain filling period richards 2006 in field trials in eastern australia the yield of lines with narrow xylem in drought environments increased and the reduction in xylem diameter did not adversely affect yield in environments with better rainfall because the development of nodal roots took advantage of the extra rainfall richards and passioura 1989 therefore wasson et al 2012 further proposed that by combining the base of the root system with high axial resistance and deep roots with low axial resistance the moisture in the deep soil may be fully utilized in short since crops need water under drought stress conditions the benefits of deep root systems for drought resistance depend on soil water availability and root structure fig 1 we assume that in an environment where deep soil water can be used by crops an efficient deep root system i e a deeper rooting depth more root hairs narrower root diameter cheaper anatomical structure and greater drld may maximize root water uptake and improve drought resistance 3 manipulating root systems to increase crop drought resistance 3 1 breeding deep rooted cultivars crop breeding is the fundamental method to regulate the root system due to the lack of suitable high throughput root phenotyping methods evaluation of the function of the entire root system for a large pool of cultivars is not easy to carry out therefore the breeding of deep rooted cultivars tends to be overlooked in breeding targets as contrast the aboveground characteristics were often selected as breeding objects in previous breeding processes studies have shown that with the development of breeding the size and growth rate of wheat roots gradually decrease mcgrail and mcnear 2021 as a result the root systems of modern wheat cultivars are too small and may not be sufficient to acquire sufficient water and nutrients to obtain optimal yields in water limited regions waines and ehdaie 2007 this further illustrates the importance of breeding deep rooted cultivars root traits affect each other for example the root angle axial root number and branching can affect the rooting depth lynch 2019 as previously mentioned a reduction in the root angle axial root number and density of branches can promote root growth which may be effective in improving drought resistance in the process of selecting deep rooted cultivars selection targets include root angle axial root number branching and so on breeding for the optimum root structure against drought stress necessitates the identification of genes and allelic variants as well as further research into the molecular mechanisms of drought responsive root system architecture rsa regulation li et al 2021 in recent years an increasing number of quantitative trait loci and genes in roots have been found in rice maize and wheat table 2 a decrease in the genetic diversity of root structure has been observed during the breeding process voss fels et al 2017 expanding the germplasm base of landraces and wild relatives can restore biodiversity and provide necessary resources for the selection of deep rooted cultivars gur and zamir 2004 a valuable germplasm for improving root structure has been discovered in india danakumara et al 2021 there is a large variability in root traits and new genomic regions that regulate these traits furthermore developments in the science of molecular biology and biotechnology have advanced many breeding techniques such as dna marker assisted selection and genome editing uga 2021 even so rsa ideotypes have not been adequately considered in crop breeding and our current understanding of genes controlling root traits is inadequate e g in wheat ober et al 2021 3 2 management practices to enhance deep root growth when the progress of directly breeding deep rooted cultivars is slow management practices are a shortcut to increase deep roots in crop production root growth is significantly affected by environmental factors such as water and fertilizer distribution and the soil structure liang et al 2021 liu et al 2015 these factors can effectively regulate the growth of deep root systems in addition treatments such as earlier planting and root pruning can effectively regulate a deep root system different irrigation methods have very different effects on root growth compared with conventional irrigation water saving irrigation methods such as limited irrigation xu et al 2016 alternate dry and wet irrigation chu et al 2016 and underground irrigation miyazaki and arita 2020 can significantly improve root architecture and promote deep root growth similar to the effect of soil water fertilization applications also regulate deep root systems liu et al 2018 furthermore irrigation and fertilization can jointly affect root growth in general the temporal and spatial distribution of water and nutrients will affect the distribution of roots which in turn leads to changes in yield and water productivity liang et al 2021 therefore optimizing the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrients and water is conducive to the deep root growth of crops and improved drought resistance improving soil structure by tillage is an important measure to promote the growth of crop roots and increase the proportion of deep roots crop roots tend to grow in soil pores that already exist in the soil white and kirkegaard 2010 zhou et al 2021 found that 59 of the variation in wheat rld could be explained by soil macroporosity in recent years due to the advancement of agricultural mechanization soil compaction has generally increased forming compact plow bottoms which have seriously affected the downward growth of the root system tracy et al 2020 zhang et al 2012b studies have shown that compared with rotary tillage deep tillage can break the plow bottom thereby improving the proportion of deep roots and delaying root senescence especially in the case of a water deficit liu et al 2015 wang et al 2021 however deep tillage has relatively high energy requirements and related costs and there is a potential risk of recompaction and the destruction of biological pores due to subsequent tillage kautz et al 2013 break crops can also be used to improve the soil structure creating new soil biopores through root growth richards 2015 when roots grow in a large block of soil they compress the surrounding soil to create pores and release mucilage at the root tip to stabilize the pores after the roots die dexter 2004 the formation of biopores can not only reduce the mechanical resistance of root growth but can also facilitate the formation of soil physical chemical and biological properties suitable for root growth kautz et al 2013 therefore the previous crop is a break crop that is conducive to the downward growth of the root system of subsequent shallow rooted crops for example the use of rape as the previous crop improved the root growth of the subsequent wheat crop and resulted in the extraction of more water and nutrients from the soil kirkegaard et al 1994 similarly the intercropping of break crops with other crops will promote the development of crop roots and increase the rooting depth inagaki et al 2021 in the long run break crops not only create soil pores and increase the rooting depth of shallow rooted crops but also provide more sustainable soil improvement however special care should be given to diseases water consumption soil quality and economic returns when introducing break crops for example water competition may limit the water use of intercropped shallow rooted crops zegada lizarazu et al 2015 extending the crop vegetative growth time is also an effective way to increase the rooting depth richards 2006 in general the duration of the downward growth of crop roots is approximately the time from sowing to flowering and during the flowering and filling periods photosynthetic products are mainly transported to the grain when the roots stop growing gregory et al 2009 in areas where spring wheat is mainly grown by planting cultivars containing vernalization or photoperiod genes early in the season the time before flowering can be extended richards 2006 in addition the sowing time will also affect the length of the crop growing season which affects the rooting depth during the entire crop growing season a study showed that early sowing of winter wheat promoted root growth and significantly increased the rooting depth rasmussen and thorup kristensen 2016 however not all regions are suitable for prolonging the growth period of crops for example dry hot winds often occur during the wheat filling period on the north china plain zhao et al 2012 but early flowering can reduce the damage caused by dry hot winds root pruning is a destructive method used to regulate root growth root pruning during vegetative growth can significantly reduce shallow roots a study showed that cutting secondary roots of wheat at the stem elongation stage the zadoks growth stage 30 significantly reduced root biomass in the surface soil but deep roots did not decrease and may have increased fang et al 2010 this means that root respiration will be lower and more photosynthetic products may be available to the aboveground parts ma et al 2013 found that compared to an intact root system wheat after root pruning had reduced water consumption and showed no significant change in yield under mild drought conditions this may be due to an increase in the proportion of deep roots of wheat after root break leading to an increase in water utilization however root pruning is not recommended under severe drought conditions the reduced ability to absorb water will result in the inability to properly utilize soil water and will limit crop production ma et al 2013 a summary of the management practices and their effects on the regulation of root growth and distribution is listed in table 3 methods for regulating the deep root system are mainly breeding and cultivation measures in terms of breeding the breeding process to improve the root structure is slow due to the limitations of observation methods the design oriented breeding of rsa still needs further efforts the research on management practices is relatively fully evidenced the deep root system is mainly regulated by management practices that affect the distribution of water fertilizer and air in the soil however root growth and function are strongly affected by local soil conditions kuijken et al 2015 wasson et al 2014 in different environments it may be better to use corresponding comprehensive management practices other factors such as economic benefits still need to be considered 4 deep root phenotyping although deep roots are important for coping with drought stress their functions are not fully fulfilled the key reason is that roots grow in opaque soil and accurate measurement of deep roots is always a challenge particularly in the field thus in the following section we summarize the current available approaches to phenotype deep roots fig 2 4 1 direct methods destructive methods such as soil coring are the most commonly used traditional methods for deep root phenotyping although we can obtain important root information the efficiency is low the most time and labor consuming parts are the washing and cleaning of roots wasson et al 2016 developed a non washing protocol using fluorescence scanning to quantify root length without root washing this method can essentially improve the processing efficiency but it is still destructive and not suitable to repeatedly measure crop roots during the growing stages fortunately an increasing number of nondestructive root phenotyping methods have emerged such as minirhizotron x ray computed tomography xct magnetic resonance imaging mri electrical capacitance ec and ground penetrating radar gpr table 4 the minirhizotron method allows long term and continuous observation of specific locations in the soil profile and can even observe very fine roots root hairs vamerali et al 2012 however minirhizotrons also have obvious shortcomings first the tube installation disturbs the surrounding soil conditions in addition it is not easy to obtain good contact between the root canal and the soil these voids formed around the tube will affect root growth to a certain extent and may lead to deviations in the measured root traits joslin and wolfe 1999 wasson et al 2012 second the current software used to obtain root traits is labor intensive and manual identification of roots is very time intensive recently many efforts have been devoted to solve this issue rahman et al 2020 with the development of machine learning and image analysis this issue could be solved however another inherent disadvantage is that it is difficult to quantify the soil volume for the observed roots this means that important root traits such as rld cannot be obtained the root growth angle and 3d structure cannot be obtained either thus minirhizotrons are not that attractive to many researchers electrical technologies have been developed to measure crop roots nondestructively dalton 1995 the ec method is thus far the most widely used noninvasive method to measure crop roots in the field however this method has caused much doubt about the current leaking when using the stem to inject the current particularly under wet conditions dietrich et al 2013 gu et al 2021 systematically studied the current paths under different soil water conditions in cotton and found that the ec of the roots was significantly reduced after root cutting especially under drought conditions this may indicate that electric current can flow into deep roots in dry soil however the ec is a measurement of the overall root biomass and cannot distinguish between deep and shallow roots new advanced electrical technologies such as electrical capacitance tomography and electrical impedance tomography can image the three dimensional skeleton of the root but cannot provide detailed structural information corona lopez et al 2019 furthermore due to the limitations of the electrode number and configuration and forecast model inversion there are still uncertainties in the electrical imaging method and processing process zhao et al 2019 gpr has long been used to measure coarse roots 2 mm pierret et al 2005 because very thin roots may not reflect enough electromagnetic energy to be clearly detected by gpr however liu et al 2017 successfully used gpr to detect crop root biomass of winter wheat at the bulk soil level although gpr also suffers from the same problem of not being able to measure crop roots in different layers the potential of these two methods for measuring deep root systems cannot be ignored for example gpr can detect soil moisture which can reflect deep root information indirectly see the next section xct is considered an excellent nondestructive root phenotyping technology wasaya et al 2018 xct can monitor root growth for a long time and repeated scans will not adversely affect plant development zappala et al 2013 today advanced xct scanners have been able to achieve observations with a spatial resolution of less than 20 ¬µm tracy et al 2012 making it possible to observe the fine roots of plants in situ daly et al 2018 used xct and image based modeling to capture the influence of roots on water uptake at the soil root interface of course xct also has disadvantages that is it is difficult to directly use in the field because the equipment is not moveable and is expensive for now although intact soil cores can be collected and transported to the laboratory for imaging daly et al 2018 it would make the nondestructive measurement destructive in addition the soil type soil water content roots and substrate pores and root water content can cause poor contrast and increase the difficulty of root image segmentation and recognition flavel et al 2012 indeed xct also has problems in imaging fine roots xct may overestimate the diameter of the roots and underestimate the length of the root and the number of lateral roots perret et al 2007 currently portable and low cost xct is under development which may make this technique available in the field https www nanoranch com roots imaging html mri is an excellent root imaging technique in the laboratory zhang et al 2012a successfully acquired the 3 d root architecture of corn in situ by using mri studies have shown that almost all natural soil substrates tested allow mri to be used to image roots pflugfelder et al 2017 this makes it possible to use mri to conduct research on the root system in a variety of substrates however van dusschoten et al 2016 found that a higher magnetic field may result in a higher signal to noise ratio in the detected signal but will also produce image artifacts to avoid this problem a weak magnetic material is recommended compared with traditional mri experiments a weak magnetic material can reduce the distortion caused by magnetic materials naturally present in agricultural soil bagnall et al 2020 however the signal to noise ratio needs to be further improved for fine root quantification this will require further improvements in hardware and image processing software in addition similar to xct mri is expensive and difficult to apply in the field in the future portable devices may be developed for nondestructive root phenotyping in the field as well fortunately there are some ongoing projects such as arpa e roots funded by the u s department of energy https arpa e energy gov technologies programs roots working on these technologies overall destructive methods are time labor intensive and unsustainable thus nondestructive root phenotyping is highly needed however the current nondestructive root phenotyping methods have various limitations in measuring deep root systems the ec method cannot provide the depth information of the root system currently neither xct nor mri can be used to phenotype roots in the field in addition these methods all suffer from insufficient accuracy with the development of other techniques more root phenotypic analysis methods are emerging for example singhvi et al 2019 recently proposed noncontact thermoacoustic sensing to measure root biomass in addition to continually innovating and improving root phenotyping imaging data processing is also a major difficulty in deep root quantification the data process directly affects the accuracy of the measurement results the emergence of high class computing methods such as machine learning can definitely help data processing singh et al 2016 overall a high throughput accurate and low cost root phenotyping technique should be developed in the future 4 2 indirect methods directly phenotyping deep roots in the field has low throughput and a high cost thus far so some researchers use indirect methods such as alternative traits and root water uptake to estimate deep roots table 5 the demand for high throughput and low cost can be better satisfied via these indirect methods alternative traits are usually shallow root traits shoot traits or seedling root traits that are easy to measure because of the correlation of these traits with root distribution deep root traits can be indirectly estimated wasson et al 2012 the root angle and axial root number are closely related to the rooting depth thus they are very helpful for high throughput screening of deep root traits kato et al 2006 rich et al 2020 trachsel et al 2010 proposed shovelomics to visually evaluate root numbers angles and branching patterns of crown and branch roots recently this method has proven that the nodal root number and growth angle of wheat have significant effects on rooting depth in the field slack et al 2018 although shovelomics is still labor intensive its measurement efficiency has been greatly improved compared to traditional destructive soil coring methods other alternative traits are seedling root traits such as the root length root number and penetration ability watt et al 2013 found that the length and number of seedling roots measured in germination paper can represent the field root growth during the vegetative period kubo et al 2015 found that the root penetration ability observed in a paraffin vaseline layer pot experiment was a useful indicator for estimating the deep rooting ability of wheat however these methods cannot always reflect the root system in the field since a single seedling trait under a controlled environment does not have a strong correlation with mature deep root traits in the field rich et al 2020 recently proposed that a combination of traits can be designed to screen the mature rooting depth of crops we believe that more traits can be used to screen crops more comprehensively however the correlation between alternative traits and mature root traits is inconsistent between years and needs further study the strong correlation between root and shoot traits makes the aboveground part informative for the root system under drought stress conditions wheat cultivars with a lower midday canopy temperature have better plant water conditions reflecting deeper water extraction blum et al 1989 therefore we can use the canopy temperature to indirectly select cultivars with deep roots that have a strong water uptake capacity in the field generally the lower the crop canopy temperature the deeper depths the roots can reach osmont et al 2007 studies have shown that canopy temperature is related to root biomass r2 0 97 y 32 99 1 198x and the total root length r2 0 98 y 34 61 24 22x palta et al 2011 however there are also many factors that are independent of rooting depth including shoot biomass canopy height and development which may affect canopy temperature rebetzke et al 2012 in other words roots are not the only factor determining canopy temperature thus this method is not always reliable a change in the soil water content lower than the field water capacity indicates root water uptake and thus can indirectly reflect the vertical distribution of the roots whalley et al 2017 there are two ways to measure this first the isotopic approach can be used to estimate the root information by tracing the isotopic signal in the roots in different soil layers ma and song 2016 wang et al 2017 this method can provide deep root information however the use of hydrogen or oxygen isotopes as tracers requires that the isotopic forms of hydrogen or oxygen do not undergo isotopic fractionation during the process of root absorption and the transport of water at present it is not clear whether isotopes undergo fractionation during crop root water uptake second direct soil moisture measurements are definitely informative for root distribution there are many ways to measure soil moisture but most of them are point based since soil moisture is very variable in the field plot area based measurements should be more accurate some electromagnetic techniques such as electrical resistance tomography ert and gpr can be used to monitor soil moisture in a large area furman et al 2015 galagedara et al 2005 this provides the possibility for the in situ detection of field roots in addition the equipment needed is portable and inexpensive the major issue associated with these techniques is the measuring accuracy for now we are not clear if they can distinguish differences between different cultivars or cultivation practices in particular prediction models need to be rebuilt when the soil undergoes changes therefore a reliable reverse model should be built for a specific study site when ert and gpr are applied alternative traits are not always reliable on the one hand the root phenotype is more susceptible to the field environment in different environments the correlation between seedlings and mature roots in the field is not stable on the other hand aboveground traits such as canopy temperature are affected by many factors the root system is not the decisive factor it is a good way to estimate root systems based on soil moisture changes ert technology can continuously monitor spatial changes in the soil water content over a large area providing a good method for determining the water uptake of roots in addition lynch recently invented leader leaf elemental accumulation for deep roots which is a tool that uses handheld x ray fluorescence technology to determine the rooting depth by using soil elemental gradients https plantscience psu edu research labs roots projects deeper research projects leader however the shortcomings of these root uptake measurements are obvious the absorption capacity of the root system is not only influenced by the distribution of roots but is also strongly affected by shoot growth and other factors such as the soil texture in general the usefulness of indirect methods needs to be determined according to specific needs 5 perspectives improved root distribution is the key to better agricultural usage of natural resources an increase in deep roots increases the contact area between roots and subsoil which is conducive to capturing more subsoil resources however as discussed above a deep root system is not always beneficial for drought resistance because a large root system may increase the rate of water consumption and may make the soil more susceptible to drought in addition more roots need many photosynthetic products for growth and maintenance which may lead to a decrease in the photosynthetic products obtained by the grains therefore whether deep root systems benefit drought resistance depends on the soil water availability and root structure however roots decrease downward growth and increase branching in response to drought stress morita and okuda 1994 how to make crops grow an ideal root structure with deeper roots in response to the presence of available subsoil water is an important issue the strategy of the root system to respond to a resource patch needs to be carefully considered sometimes localized root proliferation in response to a resource patch may not be adaptive lynch 2013 root phenotypic plasticity the ability of an organism to alter its root phenotype in response to the environment may be an important solution current research on root phenotypic plasticity has focused on the utility of specific root traits under drought stress chimungu et al 2014 liao et al 2022 and the interaction of root traits in drought environments remains to be explored therefore it is necessary to further research root phenotypic plasticity and to establish a set of evaluation technology system of root phenotypic plasticity this will provide a reference for field management and breeding in water limited environments in this review we mainly discuss the effects of the root structure on root water uptake and drought resistance in fact not only the root structure is important to properly uptake water under water deficit conditions but also root metabolites to conduct water efficiently root metabolites may be critical under drought stress on the one hand metabolites such as hormones proteins and primary metabolites produced by root metabolism affect the drought resistance of crops perlikowski et al 2020 for example the location and timing of abscisic acid synthesis may affect the efficiency of water absorption zegada lizarazu and monti 2019 on the other hand root exudates play a key role in the selection of rhizosphere microbial communities and may alleviate drought stress de vries et al 2020 williams and de vries 2020 however the exact chemical signal that improves drought resistance remains unclear increasing our understanding of root metabolism under drought conditions offers huge potential for improving the efficiency of water uptake and crop drought resistance field management has become an effective method to change the root system proper field cultivation can be selected by considering the trade off between inputs and outputs the soil and climate conditions and cultivar availability at present the challenge of regulating the deep root system mainly exists in the breeding process to date only a few successful examples of breeding deep rooted cultivars have been reported and most of these deep rooted cultivars are bred indirectly through shoot traits this may be because the current root phenotyping methods only allow for measuring limited deep root traits such as the rooting depth or root biomass in breeding populations direct selection of deep root traits will further accelerate the breeding efficiency of deep rooted cultivars additionally the root angle axial root number lateral root branching density and root anatomy are all traits that affect the rooting depth lynch 2019 the deep root breeding process will be improved if these traits are systematically considered however this premise is a high throughput root phenotyping method that can identify specific root traits in the field in the absence of deep root phenotyping methods an alternative way to increase the rooting depth may be through the conversion of annual crops to perennial crops recently many countries have implemented projects to breed hybrid or perennial cereal cultivars such as wheat rice sorghum oats and barley kantar et al 2016 although the grain yield is low these have great potential to become drought resistant crops as well as a large impact because of the low input and high levels of carbon fixation there are two major challenges for deep root phenotyping large depth and small root diameter this means that deep root measurement requires high accuracy however the existing root phenotyping methods generally suffer from poor accuracy in general there is no perfect method for all application situations we should select methods according to specific needs reducing errors the sample size root characteristics of different crops growth medium cost and accuracy need to be considered when choosing a measurement method for example sample size and accuracy may largely determine which methods we can use for deep root eco physiological studies with limited root samples we recommend direct methods such as xct mri minirhizotron and soil coring methods because they are accurate and able to acquire the 3 d root architecture of crops atkinson et al 2019 and root turnover guo et al 2008 for breeding work with large root samples we currently recommend indirect methods such as alternative traits and root water uptake to estimate deep roots although indirect methods have the problem of instability we can pretest these alternative traits before application and select the reliable ones of course we need to make further efforts in the field of high throughput in situ root phenotyping methods at present the newly developed nondestructive methods such as portable xct have great potential to make breakthroughs in addition by measuring root uptake information through soil electrical characteristics such as capacitance and resistance root morphological traits can be inferred zhao et al 2019 we are currently developing micro soil ec techniques to phenotype root 3d distribution which also seems very promising because of the low cost and portability and this may need special attention in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9380,improving crop drought resistance is crucial for mitigating the impacts of drought stress on crop production worldwide for a long time deep roots have been considered one of the most effective ways to facilitate full utilization of subsoil water when topsoil water is not available under drought conditions however a deeper root system is not always associated with a higher drought resistance therefore gaining a comprehensive understanding of deep roots would be beneficial for improving drought resistance in this review we first systematically outline the deep root functions influencing crop drought resistance we propose that a deeper root system with low metabolic costs can benefit drought resistance particularly when subsoil water exists in water limited environments then we overview the methods including crop breeding and field managements to increase the drought resistance by regulating deep roots third we review the methods for phenotyping deep roots directly and indirectly high throughput deep root phenotyping methods in the field are highly needed and electromagnetic technologies are promising to satisfy this need in the future looking forward we provide some perspectives on studying deep root systems keywords deep root system soil water metabolism cost root phenotyping drought resistance 1 introduction world crop production is subject to many factors such as water scarcity the multifaceted threat of global climate change and the slow breeding process campbell et al 2016 springmann et al 2018 the global population is expected to increase to approximately 9 7 billion by 2050 and 5 0 billion people will live in water scarce areas koncag√ºl et al 2018 under global climate change the limitation of crop yields due to a lack of water will be further strengthened daryanto et al 2017 therefore improving crop drought resistance is an important way to increase crop yields gupta et al 2020 drought resistance is a complex trait in which crops use three mechanisms e g drought escape completion of the plant reproductive phase before drought stress drought avoidance maintenance of water supply and drought tolerance prevention of tissue damage due to low internal water content to enhance their survival under drought stress gupta et al 2020 the biological drought resistance which allows crop to survive under drought stress may not have beneficial effects in agricultural production bandurska 2022 therefore the drought resistance discussed in this review predominantly refers to the agricultural drought resistance which stabilizes yield by improving water uptake and water use efficiency in water limited environments in water limited areas there is not much rainfall during the crop growing season and the topsoil gradually becomes dry through evaporation and transpiration thus subsoil water becomes an important water source during late growing stages such as the reproductive stage wasson et al 2012 under these conditions crops that can make full use of subsoil water during flowering and grain filling periods can benefit yield production angus and van herwaarden 2001 yang et al 2021 manschadi et al 2006 found that in southern queensland australia for every 1 mm of water absorbed by the crop during the grain filling stage the yield increased by 55 kg ha 1 for a long time deep roots have been considered essential to obtain subsoil water to improve crop drought resistance gowda et al 2011 lynch 2018 wasaya et al 2018 however the correlation between deep roots and drought resistance is inconsistent palta and watt 2009 xiong et al 2006 compared the root growth of ancient and modern chinese wheat cultivars and found that when soil water is limited cultivars with large and deep roots can reach the subsoil to absorb water however there is also evidence that subsoil water uptake cannot alleviate the response to drought rasmussen et al 2020 on the one hand the insufficient water supply in the topsoil causes shallow roots to produce phytohormones such as abscisic acid resulting in the closure of stomata despite sufficient water supply in the deep soil dodd et al 2008 on the other hand the deep root system may have a large biomass which consumes high amounts of photosynthetic products resulting in a yield penalty lynch 2018 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the roles of deep roots in crop drought resistance will be beneficial however at present gaining knowledge on deep roots faces many challenges the deep root system is not only controlled by genes but is also dramatically affected by the growth environment kuijken et al 2015 wasson et al 2014 as a result we need to investigate under what conditions deep roots would benefit crop drought resistance or vice versa in addition deep root phenotyping has advanced in the past few decades but destructive methods soil coring trenching etc are commonly used for determining the root distribution maeght et al 2013 these methods are time and labor consuming which slows the progress of deep root research there are some reviews on root traits and drought resistance lynch 2013 paez garcia et al 2015 wasson et al 2012 and a few papers have highlighted the importance of deep roots for drought resistance lynch 2018 however the specific growth conditions under which deep roots can improve crop production are complex our current understanding of deep roots is not comprehensive furthermore the potential techniques for deep root phenotyping that can be used in the field is not fully recognized therefore the review attempts to provide potential answers to the following questions 1 what is the relationship between deep roots and crop drought resistance 2 how can crop yields be increased by improving deep root systems in drought environments 3 how can deep roots be phenotyped 2 deep roots for crop drought resistance 2 1 deep roots increase subsoil water uptake in general deep roots allow crops to obtain subsoil water which helps cool the canopy maintain leaf greenness and increase grain yield fang et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2020 zegada lizarazu and iijima 2015 since the roots of crops generally reach the maximum rooting depth during the flowering period a deeper rooting depth can result in more absorption of subsoil water at this time and afterward passioura 1983 in water limited environments deep rooted varieties or lines have been found to provide advantages in water use and yield formation in a variety of crops li et al 2022 found that under the same seasonal evapotranspiration deep roots increased soil water availability and improved yield in winter wheat uga et al 2013 found that deep rooted rice lines under drought conditions had significantly better water use and yield formation than shallow rooted lines with the same genetic background severini et al 2020 found a positive correlation between yield and rooting depth in diverse wheat and triticale genotypes r 0 61 n 36 henry et al 2011 found that rain fed lowland rice cultivars with higher root length density rld in the 35 45 cm soil profile had greater water extraction and better drought resistance the importance of deep roots for drought resistance is further verified by various root pruning experiments guo et al 2007 found that root pruning of winter wheat during the filling stage led to reduced leaf photosynthesis earlier senescence and a 35 9 43 4 decrease in yield but irrigation alleviated these negative effects furthermore root eating organisms such as termites nematodes and aphids severely reduce the yield of crops under drought conditions by reducing the rooting depth and root proliferation audebert et al 2000 while the yield of highly resistant cultivars was reported to increase marshall and smiley 2016 the direct cause of the reduced water uptake capacity of crops due to fewer or shallower roots is the reduction of the contact area between the roots and the soil mckenzie et al 2009 used mesh which had holes of 40 mm buried horizontally in 0 2 m soil to control root penetration and found that crops with unrestricted contact with subsoil performed better than crops with limited or no subsoil contact however in some cases the evidence that deep roots are important for drought resistance may need further investigation for example root pruning may produce severe changes in metabolic processes hormone homeostasis and gas fluxes bloom and caldwell 1988 which may not be conducive to water uptake this means that factors other than the deep roots may also play a role in subsoil water acquisition 2 2 factors influencing the function of deep roots 2 2 1 subsoil water availability although deep roots are important for improving drought resistance in most cases a greater number and amount of deep roots does not equate to stronger drought resistance the availability of subsoil water determines whether deep roots are useful palta and turner 2018 studies have shown that in years with sufficient water deep rooted cultivars are superior to shallow rooted cultivars in terms of yield and maintaining greenness while in years with limited subsoil water deep rooted cultivars lose their advantage christopher et al 2008 there is much subsoil water left after the harvest in many areas including rain fed areas liu et al 2018 but it is uncertain whether there is water available in the subsoil in all cases in particular in some cases the subsoil is prone to drought during the filling period terminal drought will do great harm to crop production habus jercic et al 2018 in water limited areas rainfall frequency and rainfall distribution determine the depth and time of soil wetting thereby affecting the role of deep roots in enhancing drought resistance palta and turner 2018 there are two patterns of rainfall in water limited areas one is that no effective rainfall occurs during the crop growing season and the other is that a frequently small amount of rainfall occurs during the crop growing season when there is no effective rainfall during the crop growing season the topsoil is drier than the subsoil and roots have to use water in the subsoil however if there is some rainfall during the crop growing season the topsoil can conserve water or even become wetter than the subsoil smith and harris 1981 simulated the impact of rainfall on soil water depth in aleppo syria during 12 years 1962 1974 and showed that in the driest 25 of the years rainfall only wetted the upper 0 4 m of the soil profile this means that the moisture content in the deep layer of the soil in water limited areas may be lower than the moisture content in the shallow layer in this case the ability of subsoil to provide more water will be limited on the other hand in different soil types the difference in soil water conductivity leads to different water absorption efficiencies of roots for example in high clay 70 90 soil even if the volumetric water content of the soil is high the soil has high resistance to water movement and deep root absorption is still limited markewitz et al 2010 in soils with high hydraulic conductivity such as sandy soil deep roots can absorb leached water while in clay soils with lower hydraulic conductivity shallow roots may be more important van wijk 2011 asseng and turner 2007 used the apsim model to simulate mediterranean climate regions they found that in sandy soils with a low soil water content and low nitrogen input deep roots allowed wheat to increase yield and water utilization efficiency but this advantage disappeared in clay with a high soil water content and low nitrogen input in addition the availability of subsoil water is affected by differences in soil structure even within the same soil type droogers et al 1997 for example when a clay layer exists in deep soil deep roots typically collect in pores with larger diameters resulting that subsoil water uptake may be constrained white and kirkegaard 2010 these results indicate that the availability of subsoil water is an important factor in determining whether deep root systems can improve drought resistance 2 2 2 the cost of root growth and metabolism a large and deep root system is not necessarily helpful for drought resistance even if there is available water in the subsoil although the increase in total root length and root mass can improve water uptake this also increases the cost of root growth and metabolism more non photosynthetic tissue must be maintained per unit leaf area for a large and deep root system which may lead to less photosynthetic products transferred to the grain mehrabi et al 2021 studies have shown that the metabolic cost of roots can exceed 50 of daily photosynthesis lambers et al 2002 therefore reducing the cost of root metabolism to some extent is beneficial for increasing yield on the other hand overmuch deep roots will accelerate the absorption of subsoil water leading to drought during the filling period figueroa bustos et al 2020 compared two wheat cultivars under terminal drought conditions and found that bahatans 87 had 81 higher root biomass and used 39 more water than tincurrin but produced 26 lower grain yield the excessive root biomass of bahatans 87 resulted in a rapid decrease in soil water content 17 days earlier than that under tincurrin and required a large number of photosynthetic products to maintain root metabolism in fact half of the roots of most crops are located in the top 0 20 cm of soil fan et al 2016 even with a large total root length the deep root length density drld of the subsoil is usually low an insufficient drld may cause the subsoil water to not be fully utilized due to reduced root soil contact white and kirkegaard 2010 it is estimated that the minimal root length density rld should be 0 8 1 0 cm cm 3 to effectively extract soil water and sufficient time and hydraulic conduction are required for contact with the soil passioura 1983 in the presence of available subsoil water a reduction in shallow roots and an increase in low cost and deep roots are beneficial to improve drought resistance in terms of root structure many root traits have an impact on the growth and water uptake of deep root systems table 1 there are three main strategies to increase subsoil water uptake and reduce the cost of root metabolism namely producing the optimum axial root number allocating more biomass to roots with lower metabolic needs and reducing the respiratory demand of root tissues lynch 2015 a reduction in the axial root number can increase drld and allow the absorption of more water in the subsoil which may be effective in improving drought resistance gao and lynch 2016 found that under water stress genotypes with low crown root number had 31 fewer crown roots and 30 deeper rooting depth than genotypes with high crown root number at 35 days after planting furthermore high number of roots in dry topsoil will produce high amounts of abscisic acid which may reduce the stomatal conductance and crop yield hund et al 2008 studies have shown that in the absence of water maize mutants lacking crown roots had better water conditions sebastian et al 2016 the number of tillers in tillering species may have a similar effect on root growth as the number of crown roots of maize lynch 2013 a reduction in the branching density of lateral roots in topsoil is similar to a reduction in the axial root number but lateral root branches have higher metabolic requirements than axial roots miller et al 2003 zhan et al 2015 found that a reduction in the branching density of lateral roots promoted axial root elongation and reduced root respiration thereby improving the drought resistance of maize compared with root length and root diameter root hair growth requires the least amount of biomass segal et al 2008 thus a reduction in the branching density of lateral roots in topsoil and an increase in the number of root hairs can increase subsoil water uptake and reduce the cost of root metabolism another way in which root metabolic costs can be reduced and deep root growth promoted may be the replacement of living cortical cells with air filled root cortical aerenchyma rca wasaya et al 2018 studies have shown that rca can significantly reduce the respiration and nutritional requirements of root tissues roots with a 30 cross sectional rca area had 70 less respiration than roots without rca fan et al 2003 the living cortex area lca is more predictive of root respiration soil exploration and drought resistance than rca formation and root diameter lynch 2015 this hypothesis was supported by a comparative study of drought resistance between high lca and low lca lines under water stress jaramillo et al 2013 although these hypotheses are supported by evidence the specific impact of changes in anatomy on water transport is still unclear 2 2 3 axial resistance to water transport the process of water transport in roots is also very important for crops to use subsoil water subsoil water must pass through the root xylem the diameter of which has a strong influence on the axial resistance of water transport richards and passioura 1989 proposed that cultivars with narrow xylem can make better use of subsoil water by increasing axial resistance a reduction in the diameter of the root xylem can increase the axial resistance of soil water from roots to shoots this can reduce soil water absorption in the early growth period so that more soil water can be used during the grain filling period richards 2006 in field trials in eastern australia the yield of lines with narrow xylem in drought environments increased and the reduction in xylem diameter did not adversely affect yield in environments with better rainfall because the development of nodal roots took advantage of the extra rainfall richards and passioura 1989 therefore wasson et al 2012 further proposed that by combining the base of the root system with high axial resistance and deep roots with low axial resistance the moisture in the deep soil may be fully utilized in short since crops need water under drought stress conditions the benefits of deep root systems for drought resistance depend on soil water availability and root structure fig 1 we assume that in an environment where deep soil water can be used by crops an efficient deep root system i e a deeper rooting depth more root hairs narrower root diameter cheaper anatomical structure and greater drld may maximize root water uptake and improve drought resistance 3 manipulating root systems to increase crop drought resistance 3 1 breeding deep rooted cultivars crop breeding is the fundamental method to regulate the root system due to the lack of suitable high throughput root phenotyping methods evaluation of the function of the entire root system for a large pool of cultivars is not easy to carry out therefore the breeding of deep rooted cultivars tends to be overlooked in breeding targets as contrast the aboveground characteristics were often selected as breeding objects in previous breeding processes studies have shown that with the development of breeding the size and growth rate of wheat roots gradually decrease mcgrail and mcnear 2021 as a result the root systems of modern wheat cultivars are too small and may not be sufficient to acquire sufficient water and nutrients to obtain optimal yields in water limited regions waines and ehdaie 2007 this further illustrates the importance of breeding deep rooted cultivars root traits affect each other for example the root angle axial root number and branching can affect the rooting depth lynch 2019 as previously mentioned a reduction in the root angle axial root number and density of branches can promote root growth which may be effective in improving drought resistance in the process of selecting deep rooted cultivars selection targets include root angle axial root number branching and so on breeding for the optimum root structure against drought stress necessitates the identification of genes and allelic variants as well as further research into the molecular mechanisms of drought responsive root system architecture rsa regulation li et al 2021 in recent years an increasing number of quantitative trait loci and genes in roots have been found in rice maize and wheat table 2 a decrease in the genetic diversity of root structure has been observed during the breeding process voss fels et al 2017 expanding the germplasm base of landraces and wild relatives can restore biodiversity and provide necessary resources for the selection of deep rooted cultivars gur and zamir 2004 a valuable germplasm for improving root structure has been discovered in india danakumara et al 2021 there is a large variability in root traits and new genomic regions that regulate these traits furthermore developments in the science of molecular biology and biotechnology have advanced many breeding techniques such as dna marker assisted selection and genome editing uga 2021 even so rsa ideotypes have not been adequately considered in crop breeding and our current understanding of genes controlling root traits is inadequate e g in wheat ober et al 2021 3 2 management practices to enhance deep root growth when the progress of directly breeding deep rooted cultivars is slow management practices are a shortcut to increase deep roots in crop production root growth is significantly affected by environmental factors such as water and fertilizer distribution and the soil structure liang et al 2021 liu et al 2015 these factors can effectively regulate the growth of deep root systems in addition treatments such as earlier planting and root pruning can effectively regulate a deep root system different irrigation methods have very different effects on root growth compared with conventional irrigation water saving irrigation methods such as limited irrigation xu et al 2016 alternate dry and wet irrigation chu et al 2016 and underground irrigation miyazaki and arita 2020 can significantly improve root architecture and promote deep root growth similar to the effect of soil water fertilization applications also regulate deep root systems liu et al 2018 furthermore irrigation and fertilization can jointly affect root growth in general the temporal and spatial distribution of water and nutrients will affect the distribution of roots which in turn leads to changes in yield and water productivity liang et al 2021 therefore optimizing the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrients and water is conducive to the deep root growth of crops and improved drought resistance improving soil structure by tillage is an important measure to promote the growth of crop roots and increase the proportion of deep roots crop roots tend to grow in soil pores that already exist in the soil white and kirkegaard 2010 zhou et al 2021 found that 59 of the variation in wheat rld could be explained by soil macroporosity in recent years due to the advancement of agricultural mechanization soil compaction has generally increased forming compact plow bottoms which have seriously affected the downward growth of the root system tracy et al 2020 zhang et al 2012b studies have shown that compared with rotary tillage deep tillage can break the plow bottom thereby improving the proportion of deep roots and delaying root senescence especially in the case of a water deficit liu et al 2015 wang et al 2021 however deep tillage has relatively high energy requirements and related costs and there is a potential risk of recompaction and the destruction of biological pores due to subsequent tillage kautz et al 2013 break crops can also be used to improve the soil structure creating new soil biopores through root growth richards 2015 when roots grow in a large block of soil they compress the surrounding soil to create pores and release mucilage at the root tip to stabilize the pores after the roots die dexter 2004 the formation of biopores can not only reduce the mechanical resistance of root growth but can also facilitate the formation of soil physical chemical and biological properties suitable for root growth kautz et al 2013 therefore the previous crop is a break crop that is conducive to the downward growth of the root system of subsequent shallow rooted crops for example the use of rape as the previous crop improved the root growth of the subsequent wheat crop and resulted in the extraction of more water and nutrients from the soil kirkegaard et al 1994 similarly the intercropping of break crops with other crops will promote the development of crop roots and increase the rooting depth inagaki et al 2021 in the long run break crops not only create soil pores and increase the rooting depth of shallow rooted crops but also provide more sustainable soil improvement however special care should be given to diseases water consumption soil quality and economic returns when introducing break crops for example water competition may limit the water use of intercropped shallow rooted crops zegada lizarazu et al 2015 extending the crop vegetative growth time is also an effective way to increase the rooting depth richards 2006 in general the duration of the downward growth of crop roots is approximately the time from sowing to flowering and during the flowering and filling periods photosynthetic products are mainly transported to the grain when the roots stop growing gregory et al 2009 in areas where spring wheat is mainly grown by planting cultivars containing vernalization or photoperiod genes early in the season the time before flowering can be extended richards 2006 in addition the sowing time will also affect the length of the crop growing season which affects the rooting depth during the entire crop growing season a study showed that early sowing of winter wheat promoted root growth and significantly increased the rooting depth rasmussen and thorup kristensen 2016 however not all regions are suitable for prolonging the growth period of crops for example dry hot winds often occur during the wheat filling period on the north china plain zhao et al 2012 but early flowering can reduce the damage caused by dry hot winds root pruning is a destructive method used to regulate root growth root pruning during vegetative growth can significantly reduce shallow roots a study showed that cutting secondary roots of wheat at the stem elongation stage the zadoks growth stage 30 significantly reduced root biomass in the surface soil but deep roots did not decrease and may have increased fang et al 2010 this means that root respiration will be lower and more photosynthetic products may be available to the aboveground parts ma et al 2013 found that compared to an intact root system wheat after root pruning had reduced water consumption and showed no significant change in yield under mild drought conditions this may be due to an increase in the proportion of deep roots of wheat after root break leading to an increase in water utilization however root pruning is not recommended under severe drought conditions the reduced ability to absorb water will result in the inability to properly utilize soil water and will limit crop production ma et al 2013 a summary of the management practices and their effects on the regulation of root growth and distribution is listed in table 3 methods for regulating the deep root system are mainly breeding and cultivation measures in terms of breeding the breeding process to improve the root structure is slow due to the limitations of observation methods the design oriented breeding of rsa still needs further efforts the research on management practices is relatively fully evidenced the deep root system is mainly regulated by management practices that affect the distribution of water fertilizer and air in the soil however root growth and function are strongly affected by local soil conditions kuijken et al 2015 wasson et al 2014 in different environments it may be better to use corresponding comprehensive management practices other factors such as economic benefits still need to be considered 4 deep root phenotyping although deep roots are important for coping with drought stress their functions are not fully fulfilled the key reason is that roots grow in opaque soil and accurate measurement of deep roots is always a challenge particularly in the field thus in the following section we summarize the current available approaches to phenotype deep roots fig 2 4 1 direct methods destructive methods such as soil coring are the most commonly used traditional methods for deep root phenotyping although we can obtain important root information the efficiency is low the most time and labor consuming parts are the washing and cleaning of roots wasson et al 2016 developed a non washing protocol using fluorescence scanning to quantify root length without root washing this method can essentially improve the processing efficiency but it is still destructive and not suitable to repeatedly measure crop roots during the growing stages fortunately an increasing number of nondestructive root phenotyping methods have emerged such as minirhizotron x ray computed tomography xct magnetic resonance imaging mri electrical capacitance ec and ground penetrating radar gpr table 4 the minirhizotron method allows long term and continuous observation of specific locations in the soil profile and can even observe very fine roots root hairs vamerali et al 2012 however minirhizotrons also have obvious shortcomings first the tube installation disturbs the surrounding soil conditions in addition it is not easy to obtain good contact between the root canal and the soil these voids formed around the tube will affect root growth to a certain extent and may lead to deviations in the measured root traits joslin and wolfe 1999 wasson et al 2012 second the current software used to obtain root traits is labor intensive and manual identification of roots is very time intensive recently many efforts have been devoted to solve this issue rahman et al 2020 with the development of machine learning and image analysis this issue could be solved however another inherent disadvantage is that it is difficult to quantify the soil volume for the observed roots this means that important root traits such as rld cannot be obtained the root growth angle and 3d structure cannot be obtained either thus minirhizotrons are not that attractive to many researchers electrical technologies have been developed to measure crop roots nondestructively dalton 1995 the ec method is thus far the most widely used noninvasive method to measure crop roots in the field however this method has caused much doubt about the current leaking when using the stem to inject the current particularly under wet conditions dietrich et al 2013 gu et al 2021 systematically studied the current paths under different soil water conditions in cotton and found that the ec of the roots was significantly reduced after root cutting especially under drought conditions this may indicate that electric current can flow into deep roots in dry soil however the ec is a measurement of the overall root biomass and cannot distinguish between deep and shallow roots new advanced electrical technologies such as electrical capacitance tomography and electrical impedance tomography can image the three dimensional skeleton of the root but cannot provide detailed structural information corona lopez et al 2019 furthermore due to the limitations of the electrode number and configuration and forecast model inversion there are still uncertainties in the electrical imaging method and processing process zhao et al 2019 gpr has long been used to measure coarse roots 2 mm pierret et al 2005 because very thin roots may not reflect enough electromagnetic energy to be clearly detected by gpr however liu et al 2017 successfully used gpr to detect crop root biomass of winter wheat at the bulk soil level although gpr also suffers from the same problem of not being able to measure crop roots in different layers the potential of these two methods for measuring deep root systems cannot be ignored for example gpr can detect soil moisture which can reflect deep root information indirectly see the next section xct is considered an excellent nondestructive root phenotyping technology wasaya et al 2018 xct can monitor root growth for a long time and repeated scans will not adversely affect plant development zappala et al 2013 today advanced xct scanners have been able to achieve observations with a spatial resolution of less than 20 ¬µm tracy et al 2012 making it possible to observe the fine roots of plants in situ daly et al 2018 used xct and image based modeling to capture the influence of roots on water uptake at the soil root interface of course xct also has disadvantages that is it is difficult to directly use in the field because the equipment is not moveable and is expensive for now although intact soil cores can be collected and transported to the laboratory for imaging daly et al 2018 it would make the nondestructive measurement destructive in addition the soil type soil water content roots and substrate pores and root water content can cause poor contrast and increase the difficulty of root image segmentation and recognition flavel et al 2012 indeed xct also has problems in imaging fine roots xct may overestimate the diameter of the roots and underestimate the length of the root and the number of lateral roots perret et al 2007 currently portable and low cost xct is under development which may make this technique available in the field https www nanoranch com roots imaging html mri is an excellent root imaging technique in the laboratory zhang et al 2012a successfully acquired the 3 d root architecture of corn in situ by using mri studies have shown that almost all natural soil substrates tested allow mri to be used to image roots pflugfelder et al 2017 this makes it possible to use mri to conduct research on the root system in a variety of substrates however van dusschoten et al 2016 found that a higher magnetic field may result in a higher signal to noise ratio in the detected signal but will also produce image artifacts to avoid this problem a weak magnetic material is recommended compared with traditional mri experiments a weak magnetic material can reduce the distortion caused by magnetic materials naturally present in agricultural soil bagnall et al 2020 however the signal to noise ratio needs to be further improved for fine root quantification this will require further improvements in hardware and image processing software in addition similar to xct mri is expensive and difficult to apply in the field in the future portable devices may be developed for nondestructive root phenotyping in the field as well fortunately there are some ongoing projects such as arpa e roots funded by the u s department of energy https arpa e energy gov technologies programs roots working on these technologies overall destructive methods are time labor intensive and unsustainable thus nondestructive root phenotyping is highly needed however the current nondestructive root phenotyping methods have various limitations in measuring deep root systems the ec method cannot provide the depth information of the root system currently neither xct nor mri can be used to phenotype roots in the field in addition these methods all suffer from insufficient accuracy with the development of other techniques more root phenotypic analysis methods are emerging for example singhvi et al 2019 recently proposed noncontact thermoacoustic sensing to measure root biomass in addition to continually innovating and improving root phenotyping imaging data processing is also a major difficulty in deep root quantification the data process directly affects the accuracy of the measurement results the emergence of high class computing methods such as machine learning can definitely help data processing singh et al 2016 overall a high throughput accurate and low cost root phenotyping technique should be developed in the future 4 2 indirect methods directly phenotyping deep roots in the field has low throughput and a high cost thus far so some researchers use indirect methods such as alternative traits and root water uptake to estimate deep roots table 5 the demand for high throughput and low cost can be better satisfied via these indirect methods alternative traits are usually shallow root traits shoot traits or seedling root traits that are easy to measure because of the correlation of these traits with root distribution deep root traits can be indirectly estimated wasson et al 2012 the root angle and axial root number are closely related to the rooting depth thus they are very helpful for high throughput screening of deep root traits kato et al 2006 rich et al 2020 trachsel et al 2010 proposed shovelomics to visually evaluate root numbers angles and branching patterns of crown and branch roots recently this method has proven that the nodal root number and growth angle of wheat have significant effects on rooting depth in the field slack et al 2018 although shovelomics is still labor intensive its measurement efficiency has been greatly improved compared to traditional destructive soil coring methods other alternative traits are seedling root traits such as the root length root number and penetration ability watt et al 2013 found that the length and number of seedling roots measured in germination paper can represent the field root growth during the vegetative period kubo et al 2015 found that the root penetration ability observed in a paraffin vaseline layer pot experiment was a useful indicator for estimating the deep rooting ability of wheat however these methods cannot always reflect the root system in the field since a single seedling trait under a controlled environment does not have a strong correlation with mature deep root traits in the field rich et al 2020 recently proposed that a combination of traits can be designed to screen the mature rooting depth of crops we believe that more traits can be used to screen crops more comprehensively however the correlation between alternative traits and mature root traits is inconsistent between years and needs further study the strong correlation between root and shoot traits makes the aboveground part informative for the root system under drought stress conditions wheat cultivars with a lower midday canopy temperature have better plant water conditions reflecting deeper water extraction blum et al 1989 therefore we can use the canopy temperature to indirectly select cultivars with deep roots that have a strong water uptake capacity in the field generally the lower the crop canopy temperature the deeper depths the roots can reach osmont et al 2007 studies have shown that canopy temperature is related to root biomass r2 0 97 y 32 99 1 198x and the total root length r2 0 98 y 34 61 24 22x palta et al 2011 however there are also many factors that are independent of rooting depth including shoot biomass canopy height and development which may affect canopy temperature rebetzke et al 2012 in other words roots are not the only factor determining canopy temperature thus this method is not always reliable a change in the soil water content lower than the field water capacity indicates root water uptake and thus can indirectly reflect the vertical distribution of the roots whalley et al 2017 there are two ways to measure this first the isotopic approach can be used to estimate the root information by tracing the isotopic signal in the roots in different soil layers ma and song 2016 wang et al 2017 this method can provide deep root information however the use of hydrogen or oxygen isotopes as tracers requires that the isotopic forms of hydrogen or oxygen do not undergo isotopic fractionation during the process of root absorption and the transport of water at present it is not clear whether isotopes undergo fractionation during crop root water uptake second direct soil moisture measurements are definitely informative for root distribution there are many ways to measure soil moisture but most of them are point based since soil moisture is very variable in the field plot area based measurements should be more accurate some electromagnetic techniques such as electrical resistance tomography ert and gpr can be used to monitor soil moisture in a large area furman et al 2015 galagedara et al 2005 this provides the possibility for the in situ detection of field roots in addition the equipment needed is portable and inexpensive the major issue associated with these techniques is the measuring accuracy for now we are not clear if they can distinguish differences between different cultivars or cultivation practices in particular prediction models need to be rebuilt when the soil undergoes changes therefore a reliable reverse model should be built for a specific study site when ert and gpr are applied alternative traits are not always reliable on the one hand the root phenotype is more susceptible to the field environment in different environments the correlation between seedlings and mature roots in the field is not stable on the other hand aboveground traits such as canopy temperature are affected by many factors the root system is not the decisive factor it is a good way to estimate root systems based on soil moisture changes ert technology can continuously monitor spatial changes in the soil water content over a large area providing a good method for determining the water uptake of roots in addition lynch recently invented leader leaf elemental accumulation for deep roots which is a tool that uses handheld x ray fluorescence technology to determine the rooting depth by using soil elemental gradients https plantscience psu edu research labs roots projects deeper research projects leader however the shortcomings of these root uptake measurements are obvious the absorption capacity of the root system is not only influenced by the distribution of roots but is also strongly affected by shoot growth and other factors such as the soil texture in general the usefulness of indirect methods needs to be determined according to specific needs 5 perspectives improved root distribution is the key to better agricultural usage of natural resources an increase in deep roots increases the contact area between roots and subsoil which is conducive to capturing more subsoil resources however as discussed above a deep root system is not always beneficial for drought resistance because a large root system may increase the rate of water consumption and may make the soil more susceptible to drought in addition more roots need many photosynthetic products for growth and maintenance which may lead to a decrease in the photosynthetic products obtained by the grains therefore whether deep root systems benefit drought resistance depends on the soil water availability and root structure however roots decrease downward growth and increase branching in response to drought stress morita and okuda 1994 how to make crops grow an ideal root structure with deeper roots in response to the presence of available subsoil water is an important issue the strategy of the root system to respond to a resource patch needs to be carefully considered sometimes localized root proliferation in response to a resource patch may not be adaptive lynch 2013 root phenotypic plasticity the ability of an organism to alter its root phenotype in response to the environment may be an important solution current research on root phenotypic plasticity has focused on the utility of specific root traits under drought stress chimungu et al 2014 liao et al 2022 and the interaction of root traits in drought environments remains to be explored therefore it is necessary to further research root phenotypic plasticity and to establish a set of evaluation technology system of root phenotypic plasticity this will provide a reference for field management and breeding in water limited environments in this review we mainly discuss the effects of the root structure on root water uptake and drought resistance in fact not only the root structure is important to properly uptake water under water deficit conditions but also root metabolites to conduct water efficiently root metabolites may be critical under drought stress on the one hand metabolites such as hormones proteins and primary metabolites produced by root metabolism affect the drought resistance of crops perlikowski et al 2020 for example the location and timing of abscisic acid synthesis may affect the efficiency of water absorption zegada lizarazu and monti 2019 on the other hand root exudates play a key role in the selection of rhizosphere microbial communities and may alleviate drought stress de vries et al 2020 williams and de vries 2020 however the exact chemical signal that improves drought resistance remains unclear increasing our understanding of root metabolism under drought conditions offers huge potential for improving the efficiency of water uptake and crop drought resistance field management has become an effective method to change the root system proper field cultivation can be selected by considering the trade off between inputs and outputs the soil and climate conditions and cultivar availability at present the challenge of regulating the deep root system mainly exists in the breeding process to date only a few successful examples of breeding deep rooted cultivars have been reported and most of these deep rooted cultivars are bred indirectly through shoot traits this may be because the current root phenotyping methods only allow for measuring limited deep root traits such as the rooting depth or root biomass in breeding populations direct selection of deep root traits will further accelerate the breeding efficiency of deep rooted cultivars additionally the root angle axial root number lateral root branching density and root anatomy are all traits that affect the rooting depth lynch 2019 the deep root breeding process will be improved if these traits are systematically considered however this premise is a high throughput root phenotyping method that can identify specific root traits in the field in the absence of deep root phenotyping methods an alternative way to increase the rooting depth may be through the conversion of annual crops to perennial crops recently many countries have implemented projects to breed hybrid or perennial cereal cultivars such as wheat rice sorghum oats and barley kantar et al 2016 although the grain yield is low these have great potential to become drought resistant crops as well as a large impact because of the low input and high levels of carbon fixation there are two major challenges for deep root phenotyping large depth and small root diameter this means that deep root measurement requires high accuracy however the existing root phenotyping methods generally suffer from poor accuracy in general there is no perfect method for all application situations we should select methods according to specific needs reducing errors the sample size root characteristics of different crops growth medium cost and accuracy need to be considered when choosing a measurement method for example sample size and accuracy may largely determine which methods we can use for deep root eco physiological studies with limited root samples we recommend direct methods such as xct mri minirhizotron and soil coring methods because they are accurate and able to acquire the 3 d root architecture of crops atkinson et al 2019 and root turnover guo et al 2008 for breeding work with large root samples we currently recommend indirect methods such as alternative traits and root water uptake to estimate deep roots although indirect methods have the problem of instability we can pretest these alternative traits before application and select the reliable ones of course we need to make further efforts in the field of high throughput in situ root phenotyping methods at present the newly developed nondestructive methods such as portable xct have great potential to make breakthroughs in addition by measuring root uptake information through soil electrical characteristics such as capacitance and resistance root morphological traits can be inferred zhao et al 2019 we are currently developing micro soil ec techniques to phenotype root 3d distribution which also seems very promising because of the low cost and portability and this may need special attention in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9381,it is necessary to understand and measure the impact of tillage and irrigation practices on co2 emissions from the soil with an environmental sensitivity while wastewater irrigation increases crop biomass yield the main objective of the present study was to investigate the changes and reasons in co2 emissions from soil conventional and conservative tillage under different levels of wastewater irrigation the co2 emission from tillage sowing to harvest over the regular measurements with a egm 5 infrared gas analyzer device was investigated with three replicates in three deficit irrigation levels 0 33 and 67 of domestic recycled wastewater in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices binary relationships of co2 emissions with h2o emission air temperature and the soil temperature and moisture measured at three different depths 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm were also investigated and strong p 0 01 positive linear correlations were determined wastewater irrigation and conventional tillage significantly increased co2 emissions compared to freshwater irrigation and direct sowing practice while deficit irrigation practice decreased it the direct sowing reduced seasonal co2 emissions 25 1 and 26 1 for per unit area 1 ha of silage maize and per unit of fresh silage yield 1 kg respectively compared to conventional tillage the lowest co2 emission per unit area and yield was determined in full irrigation treatment with freshwater in direct sowing while in wastewater applications it was determined in irrigation levels 33 per unit area and 67 per unit yield under direct sowing thirty three percent and 67 treatments in direct sowing resulted in less seasonal co2 emissions as 38 7 per unit area and 13 8 per unit fresh silage yield respectively compared to full irrigation treatment with freshwater in conventional tillage mean co2 emissions in these treatments were found lower 17 9 per unit area and higher 17 8 per unit fresh silage yield compared to the full irrigation treatment with freshwater in direct sowing it was concluded that co2 emissions per unit yield could be decreased with 33 water saving under wastewater irrigation conditions and could be achieved environmental additional benefits from more decreasing co2 emission by direct sowing also graphical abstract ga1 keywords co2 emission conventional tillage deficit irrigation direct sowing van turkey wastewater irrigation 1 introduction freshwater as renewable resource is actually a limited resource and this resource is getting polluted gradually with various anthropogenic factors and become inadequate to demand of increased population sahin et al 2016 song et al 2018 tufenkci et al 2021 yerli and sahin 2022 burak and margat 2016 stated that the world s water requirement will increase between 23 and 42 in 2050 while mancosu et al 2015 also stated that the amount of available water should be increased by 53 considering that the agriculture is the sector consumes water at most with a rate of 69 of the world s freshwater use fao 2020 it has become a necessity to save water in agricultural irrigation and to use marginal water resources instead of freshwater wastewater polluted as a result of various uses and whose contents have changed partially or completely compared to freshwater is one of most common usable of the marginal water resources on the world wastewater for irrigation can be generated from several sectors including desalination industry textile industry oil and gas industry food dairy and agriculture panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 panagopoulos 2021 2022 considering that 99 of wastewater is composed of water it has been not considered polluted water source preventing its reuse un 2014 wastewater applications help to increase soil productivity by adding its rich nutrient content into the soil wastewater which reduces the need for fertilizers contributes to environmental sustainability through its disposal also despite of these positive effects soil salinity nutrient discharge eutrophication the pathogen and heavy metal pollution in soil and crop limit the use of wastewater qadir and scott 2010 qadir et al 2015 although wastewater applications to soil results in carbon storing carbon emissions can be induced with the impact of enhanced microbial activity lahlou et al 2022 the carbon and nitrogen cycle transformations in wastewater irrigation influences soil microbial communities and indirectly ghg emission wang et al 2021 carbon as the main component of the organic substances in wastewater are expressed with chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod many domestic wastewaters are characterized as low c n ratios wastewater with a cod n ratio lower than 8 0 is defined as a low c n ratio wastewater zhu et al 2019 a low cod total nitrogen c n ratio can result in significantly increase n2o emission as an end product of denitrification mander et al 2014 ge et al 2017 ntonta et al 2022 also reported that the principal hypothesis of higher emissions at higher n contents was the advanced microbial activity resulting to high decomposition and co2 emissions many studies showed that using of municipal wastewater in irrigation enhanced the nutrients availability in soil and microbial activities could be stimulated by the biodegradable organic matter and nutrients in reclaimed water and increased the activities of soil enzymes yan dong et al 2012 the agricultural sector produces greenhouse gas emissions with agricultural activities such as animal husbandry improper land use irrigation and fertilization paddy fields degradation of forest areas intensive tillage and exhaust gases of agricultural machineries tubiello et al 2015 vurarak and bilgili 2015 biswas and mojid 2018 yerli and sahin 2021 therefore it is contributed to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions between 14 and 30 reynolds and wenzlau 2012 in agriculture sector ch4 emission occurs mostly through animal activities da silva cardoso et al 2019 while n2o emission occurs with nitrification and denitrification processes from n fertilization luo et al 2019 co2 emission also occurs as a result of soil organic matter which is an indicator of soil fertility encountering o2 as a result of various interventions applied to the soil yerli et al 2019 tufenkci et al 2021 yerli and sahin 2021 although the impact of ch4 and n2o on global warming is higher than co2 ipcc 2014 80 share of co2 among other greenhouse gases has made it the most important greenhouse gas epa 2022 co2 emission from soil is controlled by many factors such as soil and air temperature soil water content soil tillage vegetation and soil substrate availability sun et al 2011 rowlings et al 2012 evans and burke 2013 mancinelli et al 2015 the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil also affect the emissions haddaway et al 2017 soil temperature and moisture can increase co2 emission from soil by mineralization of organic matter by increasing microorganism activities temperature increases decomposition of organic matter which leads to mineralization of soil organic carbon and increases release of carbon into the atmosphere das et al 2022 chen et al 2018 du et al 2019 and zhao et al 2020 reported that there are positive linear relationships between soil temperatures and co2 emissions irrigation coupled with conservation tillage practices can have a significant positive influence upon the soil carbon stock enrichment through improving soil moisture content and microbial activities das et al 2022 buragiene et al 2019 expressed that co2 emission from soil showed positive linear correlation with soil moisture content jabro et al 2008 also indicated that co2 emission increases from increased organic matter oxidation with increased soil moisture therefore water deficiency generally results less co2 emissions similarly zornoza et al 2016 sinaie et al 2019 and zhong et al 2021 stated that deficit irrigation reduces co2 emissions soil ph had significant effect on cumulative co2 emissions from crop residues ntonta et al 2022 observed the lowest emissions for strongly acidic soils while the highest emissions were determined in slightly acidic soils due to the liming effect of residues it is known that soil acidity increases as a result of the decomposition of organic acids and organic substances in the soil under wastewater irrigation conditions vaseghi et al 2005 microbial activities in acidic conditions hinders to produce organic matter in soil das et al 2022 limiting the impact on co2 losses from soils via long term conservation of carbon stocks are aimed in land management practices to better management the global carbon cycle chaplot et al 2019 intensive soil tillage has considerable effect on increasing agricultural greenhouse gases abdalla et al 2016 some of the c in soil can be earned from plant residues or exudates and the quantity changes by tillage practices however some part of plant residues can be mineralized and emitted back to the atmosphere as co2 while a considerable proportion can be saved as soil organic matter ntonta et al 2022 intensive tillage practices increase the o2 level of the soil providing a more suitable environment for microbial activities and thus co2 emissions increase protection of organic matter from microbial decomposition within undisturbed soil aggregates from the absence of soil disturbance in no tillage also known as zero tillage or direct sowing are assumed to lower ghg emissions chaplot et al 2015 biland≈æija et al 2016 buragiene et al 2019 and nyambo et al 2020 also reported that intensive tillage causes more co2 emissions from soil than reduced tillage or direct sowing previous studies have reported in the impacts of tillage on soil carbon losses and especially co2 emissions under different soil types cropping systems and climates however despite numerous investigations findings have led to a lack of consensus on the impact on co2 emissions from tilled or no tilled soils irrigated with the wastewater at different levels the understanding the effects of wastewater on soil co2 emissions under improved management practices is a necessity to accurately estimating the budget of regional co2 emissions for per unit area and unit product yield as a second necessity to explain the carbon emission increases seasonal co2 emissions and their correlations with h2o emission soil moisture and air and soil temperatures should have known therefore the hypothesis of this study were 1 direct sowing would be decreased seasonal co2 emission from soil in wastewater irrigation conditions 2 deficit irrigation might contribute to decreasing co2 emission over per unit area and per unit fresh silage yield of silage maize and 3 seasonal co2 emissions would show strong correlations to air temperatures and the h2o emissions soil moisture content and soil temperature which affected by tillage practices 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and soil properties the study was carried out in the experimental field of the faculty of agriculture van yuzuncu

surface drip irrigation system which including driplines with the emitter spacing of 33 cm and 2 3 l h 1 emitter flow rate at 0 1 mpa operation pressure considering soil infiltration rate measured in the study field the driplines with 70 cm intervals for each crop row in the plots were laid on the soil surface with 7 2 m length five driplines in each plot were connected a manifold pipeline and water quantities were measured for controlled irrigation with a water meter installed to each manifold the freshwater used in the study was tap water obtained from university campus the recycled

treated wastewater at 100 ww100 67 ww67 33 ww33 levels and irrigation with freshwater at 100 fw100 control level the wastewater irrigation levels were defined by considering a silage maize study in the region by cakmakci and sahin 2021 totally 24 plots with 5 rows for each were arranged in experimental field with sized of 3 5 m 7 2 m and row and plant spacing were 70 cm and 15 cm respectively the seeds of silage maize cv ossk 644 in study years were sown in may may 15 in 2020 and may 11 in 2021 and harvested in september september 13 in 2020 september 4 in 2021 the conventional tillage plots were ploughed then the clods were broken down by using a cultivator rotary harrow combination and the plots were leveled the seeds were sowed with a precision sowing machine on the same day after soil tillage in direct sowing without tillage the seeds were sowed with a direct sowing machine on the same day with conventional tillage while hoeing was done twice in conventional tillage plots when the crop height was reached to 15 20 cm and 40 50 cm hoeing was not done in direct sowing and herbicide suitable for the weed characteristics of the study area was used in the first year of the experiment as the basal fertilization 100 kg ha 1 urea 45 46 n and 150 kg ha 1 triple super phosphate 43 46 p2o5 were manually applied to all plots during seed sowing period celebi et al 2010 however the fertilization in the second year was applied to only freshwater plots considering residual effect form previous year in wastewater plots and missing doses were completed according to the total n and p2o5 analyzes before sowing in addition in both years of the experiment only the first year in the wastewater plots in the second hoeing period which when the plants reached to 40 50 cm height the second dose of urea fertilizer as equal to the first dose was applied with fertigation celebi et al 2010 irrigations were started with freshwater in all plots and continued with wastewater in wastewater plots for the remainder of the season while with freshwater in freshwater plots therefore maize plants in all plots were equally irrigated with freshwater with 0 30 wetting ratio considering 30 cm soil depth until they get 40 50 cm height from the sowing after this stage irrigations with three different levels 100 67 and of wastewater and 100 level of freshwater were started in each tillage sowing practice and continued until the harvest with 0 65 wetting ratio considering 90 cm soil depth irrigations were applied when the amount of œÉ etc precipitation was reached to 40 of available soil moisture in 30 cm for the first period and in 90 cm soil depth for the second period crop evapotranspiration etc values were calculated by eto multiplied by kc values allen et al 1998 valipour et al 2020 anwar et al 2021 while the crop coefficient kc values were obtained from the last and current study the water consumption guide for irrigated crops in turkey by the turkish ministry of agriculture and forestry tagem 2017 reference evapotranspiration eto values were calculated using cropwat software ver 8 0 the climate data required in the calculations were obtained daily from the climate station located in the experimental area in each irrigation the irrigations quantities were determined separately for two tillage sowing practice considering the amounts enough to bring the decreasing water which determined with gravimetric sampling in effective rooting depth to the field capacity total 13 irrigations were made in the first year while 12 irrigations in the second year in the first and second years while seasonal irrigation quantities of 351 3 mm and 327 3 mm 242 1 mm and 226 3 mm and 129 4 mm and 122 4 mm were applied to the ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively in the conventional tillage irrigation quantities were 318 7 mm and 294 1 mm 220 2 mm and 204 1 mm and 117 7 mm and 111 4 mm in the direct sowing practice total irrigation quantities applied in four irrigations during irrigations with freshwater at the beginning of the season were 20 2 mm in 2020 and 21 5 mm in 2021 2 4 co2 emissions and related measurements the egm 5 infrared gas analyzer device cfx 2 ppsystems stotfold uk was used to measure co2 emissions from soil the measurements in the center region of all plots were made from 3 different points randomly selected between two crops approximately 15 20 cm far from the emitters to ensure complete isolation from the outside environment in the measurements the chamber of the device was hammered into the soil 1 2 cm morell et al 2010 co2 emission measurements were carried out in three different periods throughout the vegetation period namely tillage sowing period irrigation period with freshwater until the plant heights reached to 40 50 cm from tillage sowing and irrigation period with wastewater until the harvest from plant heights of 40 50 cm the first co2 emission measurement was carried out as soon as the tillage sowing was completed 0 h and the subsequent measurements were carried out 4 24 and 48 h after the tillage sowing during the irrigation period with freshwater co2 emissions were measured 1 day before and 1 2 3 days after from irrigation in only freshwater plots of each tillage sowing treatment during the irrigation period with wastewater co2 emissions were measured 1 day before and 1 2 3 days after from irrigation in all plots continuously until the first 4 irrigations and once in two irrigations in the following irrigations in the second year to determine the residual effect of the first year wastewater irrigation co2 emission measurements were made in all plots in both tillage sowing period and freshwater irrigation period soil temperatures and moisture contents at 5 10 20 cm soil depths air temperature and the h2o emissions from soil were measured simultaneously with co2 emission measurements the measurement of h2o emission and air temperature were provided automatically by the egm 5 device while temperature probe connected to the co2 measurement device stp 1 was used in soil temperature measurements soil moisture contents were determined using the tdr probe trime pico iph t3 imko calibrated to the experimental field all measured co2 emission data g m2 h 1 until the harvest from tillage sowing were used to calculate seasonal co2 emission firstly the data arranged with considering changed wetting rates during the vegetation period and then it was converted to the emission per unit area of silage maize kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 seasonal co2 emissions per unit fresh silage yield g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 were calculated by dividing the co2 emissions per unit area g co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 to the fresh silage yield given in table 3 kg ha 1 2 5 data analysis statistical analysis of the data was performed using the general linear model in spss ver 23 program considering variables as fixed factors tillage and irrigation treatments treatment means were separated using duncan multiple comparison test at the 5 level of probability the t test was used to determine the difference arising from tillage sowing in the tillage sowing and freshwater irrigation periods of the first year the statistical analyzes were performed separately for trial years by considering that the co2 emissions can be influenced significantly from instantaneous changes in temperature and humidity furthermore pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate binary relationships of the co2 emission with the h2o emission air temperature and the soil moisture and temperature values measured in 5 10 20 cm soil depths 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 emissions during the vegetation period the co2 emissions measured throughout vegetation period was evaluated in three periods considered tillage sowing irrigation with freshwater and irrigation with wastewater in 2020 tillage sowing period the effect of tillage sowing practices on co2 emission was significant p 0 01 suppl 1 the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage 0 612 g co2 m 2 h 1 was found 107 5 higher than in the direct sowing practice fig 1 and suppl 2 the effects of irrigation and tillage treatments and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on the co2 emission in 2021 tillage sowing period were significant p 0 01 suppl 1 the highest mean co2 emission 0 816 g co2 m 2 h 1 was determined in ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage fig 2 and suppl 2 the mean co2 emission in the ww100 treatment 0 611 g co2 m 2 h 1 was 31 7 20 5 and 80 8 higher than in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage was found 106 4 higher compared to the direct sowing practice 0 313 g co2 m 2 h 1 fig 2 in freshwater irrigation period in 2020 direct sowing practice caused significantly p 0 05 lower co2 emission than in conventional tillage suppl 1 the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage 0 290 g co2 m 2 h 1 was determined 16 higher than in the direct sowing practice fig 1 and suppl 2 the effects of tillage sowing and irrigation practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on the mean co2 emission in freshwater irrigation period in 2021 were significant p 0 01 suppl 1 the highest emission was found in ww100 treatment 0 373 g co2 m 2 h 1 in the conventional tillage fig 3 suppl 2 the mean co2 emission in the ww100 treatment 0 321 g co2 m 2 h 1 were 21 1 30 5 and 57 4 higher than in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively conventional tillage 0 299 g co2 m 2 h 1 emitted as 35 9 higher co2 compared to the direct sowing practice fig 3 in wastewater irrigation period in 2020 the effects of irrigation and tillage sowing treatments and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on the mean co2 emission were found significant p 0 01 and 0 05 suppl 1 the ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage had the highest co2 emission 0 550 g co2 m 2 h 1 fig 4 and suppl 2 the mean co2 emission in the ww100 treatment 0 521 g co2 m 2 h 1 were 52 8 35 0 and 61 3 higher than the fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage 0 408 g co2 m 2 h 1 was found 8 2 higher than in direct sowing practice fig 4 in the wastewater irrigation period in 2021 the effects of irrigation and tillage sowing practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on co2 emissions were found significant p 0 01 suppl 1 it was observed that the highest co2 emission 0 588 g co2 m 2 h 1 was in ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage practice while the lowest emission 0 200 g co2 m 2 h 1 was in ww33 treatment in the direct sowing practice fig 5 and suppl 2 the mean co2 emissions in fw100 and ww67 irrigation treatments were statistically similar considering the mean of co2 emissions ww100 treatment 0 511 g co2 m 2 h 1 caused 69 2 68 7 and 128 1 higher emissions than the fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively compared to direct sowing practice 0 291 g co2 m 2 h 1 the mean co2 emission was 30 2 higher than in conventional tillage fig 5 the higher co2 emission in the wastewater irrigation conditions was due to higher nutritive properties of wastewater table 2 especially the high amount of organic carbon provided by wastewater to the soil can be considered as the main reason of co2 emission after organic carbon accumulated in the soil encounters o2 in the soil it turns into co2 form and leaves the soil and spreads to the atmosphere yerli et al 2019 compared to fw100 the mean content 1 20 of organic carbon in 0 30 cm soil layer in ww100 treatment was found to be 16 5 higher similarly biswas and mojid 2018 expressed that wastewater irrigation increased organic carbon more than 1 2 fold compared to freshwater addition of fresh organic matter present in wastewater may also induce priming of old organic matter fontaine et al 2007 however considerable increase in soil organic carbon in wastewater irrigation conditions could be evaluated in relation to the high bod 23 2 mg l 1 and cod contents 37 5 mg l 1 of the wastewater table 2 rosso and stenstrom 2008 thangarajan et al 2012 and kudal and muftuoglu 2014 also reported that the content of organic carbon in the soil increased the wastewater irrigation with high dissolved organic matter fern√°ndez luque√±o et al 2010 indicated that co2 emission in soils irrigated with wastewater is 2 4 times higher than in soils irrigated with freshwater and that the increase in co2 emissions in wastewater irrigation conditions is associated with a high content of soil organic carbon shakeel et al 2021 also stated that the highest co2 emission is in maize plots irrigated with raw wastewater and the least in irrigated with channel water the increased co2 emission values in wastewater irrigation conditions were reported by nosalewicz et al 2013 and gonzalez mendez et al 2015 as well nitrogen enhances the biological activity in soil and promotes the mineralization of organic matter which increases soil respiration tang et al 2018 the drivers for c and n cycling in soils are microorganisms el hawwary et al 2022 advanced microbial activity at higher n contents was one of the principal mechanism to explain higher co2 emissions and organic matter decomposition ntonta et al 2022 therefore the appropriate c n ratio improves soil microbial activities and promotes co2 emissions from soil yu et al 2014 reported that nitrogen in the soil can be oxidized under suitable and sufficient moisture conditions and trigger co2 emission from the soil the ww100 treatment had the highest total n content 0 132 in surface soil with a 43 5 an increase compared to the freshwater plots mean value therefore the higher nitrogen content provided by the wastewater to the soils with the use of wastewater in irrigation can also be considered as another reason for the increase in co2 emissions it is thought that the increase in co2 emission under full irrigation conditions is related to the increase in the microbial activity of the soil due to the increase in moisture in the soil and thus the increase in the mineralization of the organic matter more water in irrigation can lead to trace gas accumulation with reduce soil water free pore amount and then result in huge amount of co2 emission wang et al 2021 the positive correlations between co2 emissions and the soil moisture contents measured at three soil depths 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm also supports this event table 4 similarly jabro et al 2008 indicated that increased microbial activity due to increased soil moisture causes the decomposition of organic matter and thus increased co2 emission entry et al 2008 determined that the continuous supply of water to the soil provides more organic carbon gain to the soil from plant roots and dead plant residues thus increasing the emission li et al 2010 pointed out that the amount of irrigation affects soil biology and changes the dynamics of organic matter in the soil mancinelli et al 2015 in their study in which they examined the co2 emissions in 100 75 and 50 irrigation water levels they stated that the co2 release from the soil decreased with the decrease in the amount of irrigation similarly sinaie et al 2019 reported that with the decreasing amount of irrigation water microorganism activities slowed down and accordingly co2 emissions decreased and the lowest emission value was found at 50 water deficit in addition many researchers have reported that co2 emissions increase under full irrigation conditions and decrease in co2 emissions due to limited irrigation practices senyigit and akbolat 2010 zornoza et al 2016 zhong et al 2021 carbon fluxes are related to the soil organic carbon stocks in soil and emission is estimated from the loses in stocks over time with the impact of many factors the higher co2 emissions in the conventional tillage compared to direct sowing could be related intensive tillage which increases o2 entry into the soil and thus accelerates the oxidation process of organic matter with a microbial process altikat et al 2012 reported that increasing soil tillage increases aeration resulted in organic carbon decomposition while reduced tillage practices can effectively reduce co2 emissions with conserving soil carbon and soil microbial populations sharif et al 2018 indicated that both emissions decrease and soil organic carbon contents increase with the plant residues on the soil surface in conservation tillage undisturbed soil aggregates protect organic matter from microbial decomposition in no tillage practice absence of soil disturbance chaplot et al 2015 the agricultural practices such as conventional tillage versus conservation tillage can also increase the distribution of fresh c at depth could stimulate loss of this ancient buried carbon fontaine et al 2007 in addition it is thought that the emission values increase with thus the increase in the speed of microbial activities the effect of the breakdown of crop residues and wastes with the physical effect of conventional tillage similarly vurarak and bilgili 2015 stated that tillage creates a suitable environment for microbial activities by both increasing the o2 level of the soil and enabling the surface residues to come into closer contact with the soil particles de oliveira silva et al 2019 emphasized that co2 emissions are triggered due to physical interventions to the soil in soil cultivation practices and the change in soil structure the mean bulk density 1 32 mg m 3 and porosity 51 3 values in surface soil in direct sowing practice were 1 5 higher and 1 5 lower than the conventional tillage respectively this could be evaluated an effect at a minimal level for lower co2 emissions in direct sowing practice mineralization may have been adversely affected due to decreased o2 entry into the soil with increased soil compaction and decreased porosity lower soil porosity and associated reduced oxygen inputs from the atmosphere may limits the development and activity of living organisms and so seen possible explanation of the lower microbial activity decreasing co2 emission chaplot et al 2015 especially the slow soil organic carbon decomposition at lower depths could result from inappropriate conditions for microbes such as a lack of oxygen fontaine et al 2007 barut et al 2012 reported that organic carbon was maintained in the soil and co2 emissions decreased with a declining air movement due to the increased bulk density of the soil in direct sowing buragiene et al 2019 stated that co2 emissions tend to decrease due to the decrease in soil porosity in direct sowing practice feng et al 2003 and gosai et al 2010 indicated that co2 emissions were lower in direct sowing than in other tillage practices on the contrary abdalla et al 2016 and nyambo et al 2020 reported that carbon losses in the soil in intensive tillage practices were enhanced through increased co2 emissions with a result of increasing the speed of microbial activities the effect of increased aeration in the soil akbolat et al 2016 also stated that the emission in conventional tillage is 44 higher than in direct sowing practice similarly talantimur 2014 biland≈æija et al 2016 and buragiene et al 2019 reported higher emissions in intensive tillage 3 2 h2o emissions soil moisture and soil and air temperatures during co2 measurements h2o emissions from the soil air temperatures and the moisture and temperature values at three different soil depths 5 cm

in the second year tillage sowing period the mean h2o emissions in different irrigation treatments were similar suppl 3 compared to direct sowing 15 9 g m 2 h 1 h2o emission was 23 9 higher in

determined compared to direct sowing in wastewater irrigation period h2o emissions were similar in ww100 and fw100 treatments h2o emission 20 4 g m 2 h 1 in ww100 treatment was 5 7 and 10 3 higher than ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively h2o emission 20 0 g m 2 h 1 in conventional tillage was determined 3 6 higher than direct sowing practice suppl 3 soil moisture and temperature values

values at 5 cm soil depth were measured 24 9 c and 25 3 c respectively suppl 3 in freshwater irrigation period the mean temperatures in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices were 23 6 c and 22 9 c respectively in wastewater irrigation period the temperature was 29 3 c in ww100 treatment while the values were determined between 28 8 c and 29 0 c in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments conventional tillage 29 2 c had 1 4 higher soil temperature than direct sowing practice suppl 3 in tillage sowing period in 2021 the mean temperature values at 5 cm soil depth were determined 19 7 c in direct sowing and 19 9 c in conventional tillage suppl 3 the temperature values in different irrigation treatments during the freshwater irrigation period varied between 24 6 c and 24 8 c compared to direct sowing practice 24 6 c mean temperature was found 1 2 higher in conventional tillage in wastewater irrigation period mean soil temperatures in ww100 fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments were determined 30 5 c 30 3 c 30 7 c and 30 8 c respectively soil temperature 30 7 c in conventional tillage was found 1 0 higher than direct sowing practice suppl 3 during the tillage sowing period in the first year the mean temperature values at 10 cm soil depth were 24 5 c and 24 2 c in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices respectively suppl 3 in freshwater irrigation period the mean temperature 23 5 c in conventional tillage was determined 2 6 higher than in direct sowing in the wastewater irrigation period the mean soil temperature in ww100 treatment was 29 1 c while close values were measured as 28 6 c 28 8 c and 28 7 c at fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively in conventional tillage practice the mean temperature value 29 0 c was found 1 4 higher than direct sowing suppl 3 in the tillage sowing period in 2021 the mean temperature values at 10 cm soil depth in different irrigation treatments changed between 19 2 c and 19 6 c and conventional tillage provided 1 6 higher value compared to the direct sowing 19 3 c suppl 3 the temperature values at 10 cm soil depth in freshwater irrigation period were determined between 24 3 c and 24 5 c in different

were determined 30 1 ¬∫c in ww100 and fw100 treatments the values were measured at ww67 and ww33 treatments as 30 4 c and 30 5 c respectively in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices the mean temperatures were determined as 30 4 c and 30 2 c respectively in the first year tillage sowing period the mean temperature values at 20 cm soil depth in conventional tillage and direct sowing

direct sowing practices the mean temperature values at 20 cm soil depth were determined as 30 0 c and 29 9 c respectively the lowest air temperature values in both years of the experiment were recorded in the tillage sowing period and the highest air temperature values were recorded in the wastewater irrigation period suppl 3 higher h2o emissions in full irrigation treatments compared to deficit irrigation could be a result of more water in the soil suppl 3 considering significant p 0 01 positive linear correlations determined between h2o release and the soil moisture contents in three different soil depths table 4 similarly akbolat and senyigit 2012 reported a declining in the h2o emissions the effect of declined soil moisture content with increasing irrigation water shortage in an another study senyiƒüit and akbolat 2010 stated that the h2o emissions were the lowest in drip irrigation which was applied the lowest irrigation quantity among the drip micro sprinkling and surface irrigation methods moreover both soil temperature affected by air temperature and direct air temperature had significant positive linear effect p 0 01 on the h2o emission from the soil table 4 higher soil moisture values in direct sowing practice compared to conventional tillage suppl 3 could be explained by the lower h2o emissions occurred from plant residues left on the soil surface lower soil temperatures suppl 3 in direct sowing could be also seen as another factor that may support the reduction in evaporation crop residues reduces evaporation because of causing lower surface soil temperatures from shielded from solar radiation and reducing the air movement just above the soil surface van donk et al 2010 moreover irrigation treatments with less quantities in direct sowing practice compared to conventional tillage might have contributed to the decrease in h2o emission akbolat et al 2016 determined that the h2o emission in conventional tillage practice was 25 higher than in direct sowing many researchers also have reported that conservation tillage practices increase moisture retention in the soil due to covering effects of residues on the soil surface thus decrease evaporation mkoga et al 2010 gozubuyuk et al 2012 mishra and kushwaha 2016 gozubuyuk et al 2020 burke et al 2021 mitchell et al 2012 also stated that the moisture conservation in the soil increased by 13 due to the covering of the soil surface with plant residues in direct sowing practice higher soil moisture values in direct sowing compared to conventional tillage can be related to the soil microporosity also similarly strudley et al 2008 and subbulakshmi et al 2009 stated that direct sowing application increase microporosity in soil and contribute to the conservation of water in the soil due to the improvement of pore connections between soil layers gozubuyuk et al 2014 also reported that the reason of moisture preservation for a longer period of time in direct sowing was the micropores increase it is evaluated that the decrease in soil temperature after irrigation is due to the cooling effect of water increased in soil similarly mancinelli et al 2015 reported that the water application can create a cooling effect on the soil by increasing the soil moisture the increase in soil temperature under wastewater irrigation treatment could be evaluated with the oxidation of organic matter provided from the wastewater yerli and sahin 2021 stated that the soil temperature increased with the increasing amount of sheep and chicken manure mixed into the soil and the increase was due to the chemical reaction effect during the decomposition process of nitrogen and organic matter simeckova et al 2016 also reported that the fertilizing has a significant effect on soil temperature moreover surface soil temperature might have changed with air temperature significantly the significant p 0 01 positive correlations of air temperature with the temperature values at 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depths of the soil also support this situation table 4 it has been evaluated that the cumulative reflections of all climate data can be represented by the mean air temperature due to the climate data in both years are compatible with each other as can be seen table 1 in the higher soil temperatures in conventional tillage practice compared to direct sowing could be effect air circulation increased in the pores as a result of earlier moisture losses in conventional tillage it can also be stated that the residues left on the soil surface in direct sowing have a significant effect on lowering soil temperature de oliveira silva et al 2019 stated that tillage can change soil structure and thus soil temperature van wie et al 2013 emphasized that tillage practices significantly affect the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the soil by changing the organic matter content bulk density and aggregate stability of the soil licht and al kaisi 2005 reported that lower soil temperatures were observed in direct sowing compared to intensive tillage conditions and this was related to the increased moisture in the soil causes lower soil temperatures shen et al 2018 stated that the soil temperature was lower between 0 and 1 5 c due to the effect of residues left on the soil surface in direct sowing compared to intensive tillage applications salem et al 2015 also indicated that the soil temperature is lower under direct sowing conditions the emission of co2 from the soil is a process that occurs with the combined effect of many factors in addition to soil temperature and moisture evans and burke 2013 hou et al 2020 co2 emissions can be significantly affected by changes in soil physical chemical and biological properties haddaway et al 2017 in this study there were significant p 0 01 positive correlations between co2 emission from the soil and air temperature p 0 05 and also between the co2 emission both h2o emission and the soil temperatures and moisture contents measured at different depths 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm table 4 it could be indicated that the effect of soil temperature and soil moisture on co2 emission is direct and the effect of air temperature is indirect by affecting soil temperature and soil moisture as a result it could be say that emissions were changed with mineralization ratio from moisture and temperature changes affecting soil microorganism activities jabro et al 2008 indicated that soil temperature increased co2 emission by 59 sainju et al 2008 rey et al 2011 nosalewicz et al 2013 chen et al 2018 du et al 2019 and zhao et al 2020 reported that soil temperature which affects the biological activities of the soil is positively correlated with co2 emission however mariko et al 2007 and gonzalez mendez et al 2015 stated that microorganism activity will only increase between certain temperatures and that there cannot always be a linear relationship between co2 emission and soil temperature moreover it could be evaluated that co2 emission may tend to increase or decrease with changing the thermal conductivity of the soil depending on cooling of surface soil with water inflow to the soil and increasing of moisture content similarly mancinelli et al 2015 stated the change in soil temperature with water ingress into the soil and expressed that co2 emission may vary according to the temperature in environment on the contrary buragiene et al 2019 indicated that despite of soil temperature and co2 emissions from the soil were not related to each other there was a positive correlation between soil moisture and co2 emissions as a result the moisture balance of soil and moistured duration greatly affect the oxidation of organic carbon and nitrogen in the soil morugan coronado et al 2011 shi and marschner 2014 it is known that re wetting dried soil especially in arid and semi arid regions stimulates microbial activities and increases oscillations lamparter et al 2009 3 3 seasonal co2 emissions per unit area and unit fresh silage yield the effects of irrigation treatments tillage sowing practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on seasonal co2

per unit area in the first year were found higher 4 5 13 6 38 9 and 30 7 in ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments and direct sowing practice respectively fig 6 this may be related to higher irrigation quantity and longer vegetation period in first year considered the mean of two trial year seasonal co2 emission 6376 5 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 was the highest in ww100 treatment and indicated 46 1 34 2 and 85 4 higher emissions than in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively conventional tillage increased seasonal co2 emission 33 6 compared to direct sowing 4052 8 kg co2 ha 1

ww67 treatments respectively conventional tillage 97 9 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 produced 57 9 higher seasonal co2 emission per unit yield compared to direct sowing fig 7 seasonal co2 emissions for 1 kg of fresh silage yield in the second year were found 1 7 11 8 17 0 and 32 7 higher in fw1100 ww100 ww67 and ww33 irrigation treatments respectively compared to the first year the second year emissions in conventional tillage and direct sowing were lower 9 0 and 31 2 respectively fig 7 this can be explained with co2 emissions per unit area were lower in the second year compared to the first year fig 6 and also silage yields were higher in all applications in the second year seasonal co2 emissions per unit yield on the mean of 2020 and 2021 show that ww33 treatment 124 7 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 produced 89 2 43 7 and 55 5 higher values than in fw100 ww100 and ww67 treatments respectively fig 7 compared to direct sowing 76 0 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 conventional tillage caused 35 3 higher co2 emission per unit yield considered irrigation soil cultivation interaction according to the two year average data the lowest co2 emission per unit yield was determined in fw100 treatment in direct sowing practice 55 7 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 the ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments had 31 8 17 8 and 96 4 higher co2 emissions compared to this low value respectively according to the lowest value in conventional tillage also fw100 ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments caused 36 6 79 7 70 4 and 151 2 higher co2 emissions per unit yield were realized respectively fig 7 the ww33 treatment provided the lowest co2 emission per unit area fig 6 while it had the highest co2 emission per unit yield fig 7 as a result of the low silage yield although ww100 treatment in direct sowing produced 9 7 higher co2 emissions per unit area compared to fw100 in conventional tillage as the control treatment fig 6 the co2 emission per unit yield was found to be 3 6 lower due to high silage yield fig 7 it is seen also that the ww67 treatment in direct sowing provided 13 8 less co2 emission per unit yield compared to the full irrigation treatment with freshwater in conventional tillage fig 7 while the co2 emission per unit area was found 21 3 less fig 6 the ww67 treatment in the direct sowing lowered co2 emission by 28 3 per unit area and 10 6 per unit fresh silage yield compared to the full irrigation treatment with wastewater in direct sowing therefore it could be concluded that the ww67 treatment in direct sowing under wastewater irrigation conditions may be more applicable due to both declined co2 emission and saving from the irrigation water very low fresh silage yield in the ww33 treatment table 3 was evaluated as the main reason for the higher co2 emission per unit product although the ww100 treatment had the highest yield the highest co2 emission per unit area fig 6 in wastewater irrigation conditions resulted in a high emission per unit yield in ww67 treatment despite the loss of yield compared to the full irrigation the decrease in co2 emission per unit area decreased the carbon emission per unit yield to a considerable level by following fw100 treatment in many studies conducted on silage maize changed wide range interval of values for annual or seasonal co2 emissions have been determined depending on irrigation fertilization soil cultivation and other practices summarized these study findings it has been seen that co2 emissions increase with irrigation frequency and fertilization and co2 emissions can be reduced with decreasing irrigation amount and direct sowing application in one of these studies ashiq et al 2020 stated that seasonal co2 emissions varied between 5576 kg co2 ha 1 and 7834 kg co2 ha 1 with different dose of fertilization and biochar applications in maize cultivation and n fertilizing caused high seasonal co2 emissions maris et al 2016 in their study investigating co2 emissions caused by irrigation intervals reported that seasonal co2 emissions in frequent irrigation 8416 kg co2 ha 1 were significantly higher than in intermittent irrigation 6045 kg co2 ha 1 pareja s√°nchez et al 2019 examined the effect of n fertilizing in irrigated agriculture on the co2 emission in a maize field and indicated cumulative emissions varied between 2256 kg co2 ha 1and 3255 kg co2 ha 1 however yearly emission of 655 kg co2 ha 1 in maize cultivation were also reported before in the same region under similar conditions al kaisi and yin 2005 maris et al 2015 determined the seasonal co2 emissions as 771 kg co2 ha 1 and 681 kg co2 ha 1 for 100 and 50 irrigation levels in surface drip method respectively and 801 kg co2 ha 1 and 645 kg co2 ha 1 in subsurface drip macharia et al 2020 reported that the cumulative co2 emissions from the maize field where organic inorganic and organic inorganic fertilized were 1391 kg co2 ha 1 1909 kg co2 ha 1 3574 kg co2 ha 1 and 2703 kg co2 ha 1 respectively hou and li 2019 expressed that the cumulative co2 emitted from the soil at different irrigation levels varied between 3581 kg co2 ha 1 and 4805 kg co2 ha 1 in another study examining the effects of deficit irrigation on the co2 emission it was reported that the emissions decreased with increasing water deficit and the yearly co2 emission was 4100 kg co2 ha 1 in full irrigation and 2510 kg co2 ha 1 in 50 deficit irrigation practice zornoza et al 2016 guo et al 2019 determined the seasonal co2 emission from the corn field as 3420 kg co2 ha 1 in direct sowing and 3911 kg co2 ha 1 in conventional tillage 4 conclusions the study investigated reducing effect of deficit irrigation practice in direct sowing on co2 emission in a silage maize field irrigated with wastewater and also correlated the co2 fluxes with changings of soil moisture and temperature air temperature and h2o emission throughout vegetation period less co2 emissions were determined in freshwater irrigation conditions wastewater irrigation significantly increased co2 emission while deficit irrigation treatments decreased it although 33 irrigation level under wastewater irrigation resulted in 46 1 lower co2 emission per unit area compared to full wastewater irrigation 43 7 higher emission per unit yield the lowest co2 emission per unit yield with wastewater irrigation was determined at the irrigation level of 67 direct sowing decreased seasonal co2 emissions by approximately 25 for per unit area and yield of the silage maize compared to the conventional tillage considering three different measurement periods of the vegetation period co2 emission in tillage sowing period was more than doubled in the conventional tillage practice compared to direct sowing and then decreased in freshwater irrigation period and an increase partially again wastewater irrigation period as the longest period in wastewater irrigation period co2 emissions in full irrigation with wastewater exceeded 1 5 times of the value in full irrigation with freshwater increased co2 emission was found positively correlated with the increase in surface soil moisture and temperature and also air temperatures and h2o emissions the results of this study clearly indicated that direct sowing has the potential to achieve carbon emission decreasing in silage maize irrigated with wastewater in a semi arid region the second conclusion was that less emissions per unit yield could be produced from silage maize field irrigated with 33 water deficit in direct sowing in wastewater irrigation conditions the results help us to improve the knowledge on the impact of wastewater application on co2 emissions and also provides to evaluate the environmental effect of carbon emission from low quality water applications over per unit yield and per unit area this work can offer a base for conceptualizing future studies because the findings are expected to improve our knowledge of the impact of agricultural practices on decreasing co2 emission however further investigations are need due to the impact of any soil conservation practice may vary from land to land due to local climatic and environmental conditions and management

9381,it is necessary to understand and measure the impact of tillage and irrigation practices on co2 emissions from the soil with an environmental sensitivity while wastewater irrigation increases crop biomass yield the main objective of the present study was to investigate the changes and reasons in co2 emissions from soil conventional and conservative tillage under different levels of wastewater irrigation the co2 emission from tillage sowing to harvest over the regular measurements with a egm 5 infrared gas analyzer device was investigated with three replicates in three deficit irrigation levels 0 33 and 67 of domestic recycled wastewater in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices binary relationships of co2 emissions with h2o emission air temperature and the soil temperature and moisture measured at three different depths 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm were also investigated and strong p 0 01 positive linear correlations were determined wastewater irrigation and conventional tillage significantly increased co2 emissions compared to freshwater irrigation and direct sowing practice while deficit irrigation practice decreased it the direct sowing reduced seasonal co2 emissions 25 1 and 26 1 for per unit area 1 ha of silage maize and per unit of fresh silage yield 1 kg respectively compared to conventional tillage the lowest co2 emission per unit area and yield was determined in full irrigation treatment with freshwater in direct sowing while in wastewater applications it was determined in irrigation levels 33 per unit area and 67 per unit yield under direct sowing thirty three percent and 67 treatments in direct sowing resulted in less seasonal co2 emissions as 38 7 per unit area and 13 8 per unit fresh silage yield respectively compared to full irrigation treatment with freshwater in conventional tillage mean co2 emissions in these treatments were found lower 17 9 per unit area and higher 17 8 per unit fresh silage yield compared to the full irrigation treatment with freshwater in direct sowing it was concluded that co2 emissions per unit yield could be decreased with 33 water saving under wastewater irrigation conditions and could be achieved environmental additional benefits from more decreasing co2 emission by direct sowing also graphical abstract ga1 keywords co2 emission conventional tillage deficit irrigation direct sowing van turkey wastewater irrigation 1 introduction freshwater as renewable resource is actually a limited resource and this resource is getting polluted gradually with various anthropogenic factors and become inadequate to demand of increased population sahin et al 2016 song et al 2018 tufenkci et al 2021 yerli and sahin 2022 burak and margat 2016 stated that the world s water requirement will increase between 23 and 42 in 2050 while mancosu et al 2015 also stated that the amount of available water should be increased by 53 considering that the agriculture is the sector consumes water at most with a rate of 69 of the world s freshwater use fao 2020 it has become a necessity to save water in agricultural irrigation and to use marginal water resources instead of freshwater wastewater polluted as a result of various uses and whose contents have changed partially or completely compared to freshwater is one of most common usable of the marginal water resources on the world wastewater for irrigation can be generated from several sectors including desalination industry textile industry oil and gas industry food dairy and agriculture panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 panagopoulos 2021 2022 considering that 99 of wastewater is composed of water it has been not considered polluted water source preventing its reuse un 2014 wastewater applications help to increase soil productivity by adding its rich nutrient content into the soil wastewater which reduces the need for fertilizers contributes to environmental sustainability through its disposal also despite of these positive effects soil salinity nutrient discharge eutrophication the pathogen and heavy metal pollution in soil and crop limit the use of wastewater qadir and scott 2010 qadir et al 2015 although wastewater applications to soil results in carbon storing carbon emissions can be induced with the impact of enhanced microbial activity lahlou et al 2022 the carbon and nitrogen cycle transformations in wastewater irrigation influences soil microbial communities and indirectly ghg emission wang et al 2021 carbon as the main component of the organic substances in wastewater are expressed with chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod many domestic wastewaters are characterized as low c n ratios wastewater with a cod n ratio lower than 8 0 is defined as a low c n ratio wastewater zhu et al 2019 a low cod total nitrogen c n ratio can result in significantly increase n2o emission as an end product of denitrification mander et al 2014 ge et al 2017 ntonta et al 2022 also reported that the principal hypothesis of higher emissions at higher n contents was the advanced microbial activity resulting to high decomposition and co2 emissions many studies showed that using of municipal wastewater in irrigation enhanced the nutrients availability in soil and microbial activities could be stimulated by the biodegradable organic matter and nutrients in reclaimed water and increased the activities of soil enzymes yan dong et al 2012 the agricultural sector produces greenhouse gas emissions with agricultural activities such as animal husbandry improper land use irrigation and fertilization paddy fields degradation of forest areas intensive tillage and exhaust gases of agricultural machineries tubiello et al 2015 vurarak and bilgili 2015 biswas and mojid 2018 yerli and sahin 2021 therefore it is contributed to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions between 14 and 30 reynolds and wenzlau 2012 in agriculture sector ch4 emission occurs mostly through animal activities da silva cardoso et al 2019 while n2o emission occurs with nitrification and denitrification processes from n fertilization luo et al 2019 co2 emission also occurs as a result of soil organic matter which is an indicator of soil fertility encountering o2 as a result of various interventions applied to the soil yerli et al 2019 tufenkci et al 2021 yerli and sahin 2021 although the impact of ch4 and n2o on global warming is higher than co2 ipcc 2014 80 share of co2 among other greenhouse gases has made it the most important greenhouse gas epa 2022 co2 emission from soil is controlled by many factors such as soil and air temperature soil water content soil tillage vegetation and soil substrate availability sun et al 2011 rowlings et al 2012 evans and burke 2013 mancinelli et al 2015 the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil also affect the emissions haddaway et al 2017 soil temperature and moisture can increase co2 emission from soil by mineralization of organic matter by increasing microorganism activities temperature increases decomposition of organic matter which leads to mineralization of soil organic carbon and increases release of carbon into the atmosphere das et al 2022 chen et al 2018 du et al 2019 and zhao et al 2020 reported that there are positive linear relationships between soil temperatures and co2 emissions irrigation coupled with conservation tillage practices can have a significant positive influence upon the soil carbon stock enrichment through improving soil moisture content and microbial activities das et al 2022 buragiene et al 2019 expressed that co2 emission from soil showed positive linear correlation with soil moisture content jabro et al 2008 also indicated that co2 emission increases from increased organic matter oxidation with increased soil moisture therefore water deficiency generally results less co2 emissions similarly zornoza et al 2016 sinaie et al 2019 and zhong et al 2021 stated that deficit irrigation reduces co2 emissions soil ph had significant effect on cumulative co2 emissions from crop residues ntonta et al 2022 observed the lowest emissions for strongly acidic soils while the highest emissions were determined in slightly acidic soils due to the liming effect of residues it is known that soil acidity increases as a result of the decomposition of organic acids and organic substances in the soil under wastewater irrigation conditions vaseghi et al 2005 microbial activities in acidic conditions hinders to produce organic matter in soil das et al 2022 limiting the impact on co2 losses from soils via long term conservation of carbon stocks are aimed in land management practices to better management the global carbon cycle chaplot et al 2019 intensive soil tillage has considerable effect on increasing agricultural greenhouse gases abdalla et al 2016 some of the c in soil can be earned from plant residues or exudates and the quantity changes by tillage practices however some part of plant residues can be mineralized and emitted back to the atmosphere as co2 while a considerable proportion can be saved as soil organic matter ntonta et al 2022 intensive tillage practices increase the o2 level of the soil providing a more suitable environment for microbial activities and thus co2 emissions increase protection of organic matter from microbial decomposition within undisturbed soil aggregates from the absence of soil disturbance in no tillage also known as zero tillage or direct sowing are assumed to lower ghg emissions chaplot et al 2015 biland≈æija et al 2016 buragiene et al 2019 and nyambo et al 2020 also reported that intensive tillage causes more co2 emissions from soil than reduced tillage or direct sowing previous studies have reported in the impacts of tillage on soil carbon losses and especially co2 emissions under different soil types cropping systems and climates however despite numerous investigations findings have led to a lack of consensus on the impact on co2 emissions from tilled or no tilled soils irrigated with the wastewater at different levels the understanding the effects of wastewater on soil co2 emissions under improved management practices is a necessity to accurately estimating the budget of regional co2 emissions for per unit area and unit product yield as a second necessity to explain the carbon emission increases seasonal co2 emissions and their correlations with h2o emission soil moisture and air and soil temperatures should have known therefore the hypothesis of this study were 1 direct sowing would be decreased seasonal co2 emission from soil in wastewater irrigation conditions 2 deficit irrigation might contribute to decreasing co2 emission over per unit area and per unit fresh silage yield of silage maize and 3 seasonal co2 emissions would show strong correlations to air temperatures and the h2o emissions soil moisture content and soil temperature which affected by tillage practices 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and soil properties the study was carried out in the experimental field of the faculty of agriculture van yuzuncu

surface drip irrigation system which including driplines with the emitter spacing of 33 cm and 2 3 l h 1 emitter flow rate at 0 1 mpa operation pressure considering soil infiltration rate measured in the study field the driplines with 70 cm intervals for each crop row in the plots were laid on the soil surface with 7 2 m length five driplines in each plot were connected a manifold pipeline and water quantities were measured for controlled irrigation with a water meter installed to each manifold the freshwater used in the study was tap water obtained from university campus the recycled

plot factors including two different tillage sowing practices were conventional tillage and direct sowing and sub plot factors including four different irrigation treatments were irrigation with treated wastewater at 100 ww100 67 ww67 33 ww33 levels and irrigation with freshwater at 100 fw100 control level the wastewater irrigation levels were defined by considering a silage maize study in the region by cakmakci and sahin 2021 totally 24 plots with 5 rows for each were arranged in experimental field with sized of 3 5 m 7 2 m and row and plant spacing were 70 cm and 15 cm respectively the seeds of silage maize cv ossk 644 in study years were sown in may may 15 in 2020 and may 11 in 2021 and harvested in september september 13 in 2020 september 4 in 2021 the conventional tillage plots were ploughed then the clods were broken down by using a cultivator rotary harrow combination and the plots were leveled the seeds were sowed with a precision sowing machine on the same day after soil tillage in direct sowing without tillage the seeds were sowed with a direct sowing machine on the same day with conventional tillage while hoeing was done twice in conventional tillage plots when the crop height was reached to 15 20 cm and 40 50 cm hoeing was not done in direct sowing and herbicide suitable for the weed characteristics of the study area was used in the first year of the experiment as the basal fertilization 100 kg ha 1 urea 45 46 n and 150 kg ha 1 triple super phosphate 43 46 p2o5 were manually applied to all plots during seed sowing period celebi et al 2010 however the fertilization in the second year was applied to only freshwater plots considering residual effect form previous year in wastewater plots and missing doses were completed according to the total n and p2o5 analyzes before sowing in addition in both years of the experiment only the first year in the wastewater plots in the second hoeing period which when the plants reached to 40 50 cm height the second dose of urea fertilizer as equal to the first dose was applied with fertigation celebi et al 2010 irrigations were started with freshwater in all plots and continued with wastewater in wastewater plots for the remainder of the season while with freshwater in freshwater plots therefore maize plants in all plots were equally irrigated with freshwater with 0 30 wetting ratio considering 30 cm soil depth until they get 40 50 cm height from the sowing after this stage irrigations with three different levels 100 67 and of wastewater and 100 level of freshwater were started in each tillage sowing practice and continued until the harvest with 0 65 wetting ratio considering 90 cm soil depth irrigations were applied when the amount of œÉ etc precipitation was reached to 40 of available soil moisture in 30 cm for the first period and in 90 cm soil depth for the second period crop evapotranspiration etc values were calculated by eto multiplied by kc values allen et al 1998 valipour et al 2020 anwar et al 2021 while the crop coefficient kc values were obtained from the last and current study the water consumption guide for irrigated crops in turkey by the turkish ministry of agriculture and forestry tagem 2017 reference evapotranspiration eto values were calculated using cropwat software ver 8 0 the climate data required in the calculations were obtained daily from the climate station located in the experimental area in each irrigation the irrigations quantities were determined separately for two tillage sowing practice considering the amounts enough to bring the decreasing water which determined with gravimetric sampling in effective rooting depth to the field capacity total 13 irrigations were made in the first year while 12 irrigations in the second year in the first and second years while seasonal irrigation quantities of 351 3 mm and 327 3 mm 242 1 mm and 226 3 mm and 129 4 mm and 122 4 mm were applied to the ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively in the conventional tillage irrigation quantities were 318 7 mm and 294 1 mm 220 2 mm and 204 1 mm and 117 7 mm and 111 4 mm in the direct sowing practice total irrigation quantities applied in four irrigations during irrigations with freshwater at the beginning of the season were 20 2 mm in 2020 and 21 5 mm in 2021 2 4 co2 emissions and related measurements the egm 5 infrared gas analyzer device cfx 2 ppsystems stotfold uk was used to measure co2 emissions from soil the measurements in the center region of all plots were made from 3 different points randomly selected between two crops approximately 15 20 cm far from the emitters to ensure complete isolation from the outside environment in the measurements the chamber of the device was hammered into the soil 1 2 cm morell et al 2010 co2 emission measurements were carried out in three different periods throughout the vegetation period namely tillage sowing period irrigation period with freshwater until the plant heights reached to 40 50 cm from tillage sowing and irrigation period with wastewater until the harvest from plant heights of 40 50 cm the first co2 emission measurement was carried out as soon as the tillage sowing was completed 0 h and the subsequent measurements were carried out 4 24 and 48 h after the tillage sowing during the irrigation period with freshwater co2 emissions were measured 1 day before and 1 2 3 days after from irrigation in only freshwater plots of each tillage sowing treatment during the irrigation period with wastewater co2 emissions were measured 1 day before and 1 2 3 days after from irrigation in all plots continuously until the first 4 irrigations and once in two irrigations in the following irrigations in the second year to determine the residual effect of the first year wastewater irrigation co2 emission measurements were made in all plots in both tillage sowing period and freshwater irrigation period soil temperatures and moisture contents at 5 10 20 cm soil depths air temperature and the h2o emissions from soil were measured simultaneously with co2 emission measurements the measurement of h2o emission and air temperature were provided automatically by the egm 5 device while temperature probe connected to the co2 measurement device stp 1 was used in soil temperature measurements soil moisture contents were determined using the tdr probe trime pico iph t3 imko calibrated to the experimental field all measured co2 emission data g m2 h 1 until the harvest from tillage sowing were used to calculate seasonal co2 emission firstly the data arranged with considering changed wetting rates during the vegetation period and then it was converted to the emission per unit area of silage maize kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 seasonal co2 emissions per unit fresh silage yield g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 were calculated by dividing the co2 emissions per unit area g co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 to the fresh silage yield given in table 3 kg ha 1 2 5 data analysis statistical analysis of the data was performed using the general linear model in spss ver 23 program considering variables as fixed factors tillage and irrigation treatments treatment means were separated using duncan multiple comparison test at the 5 level of probability the t test was used to determine the difference arising from tillage sowing in the tillage sowing and freshwater irrigation periods of the first year the statistical analyzes were performed separately for trial years by considering that the co2 emissions can be influenced significantly from instantaneous changes in temperature and humidity furthermore pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate binary relationships of the co2 emission with the h2o emission air temperature and the soil moisture and temperature values measured in 5 10 20 cm soil depths 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 emissions during the vegetation period the co2 emissions measured throughout vegetation period was evaluated in three periods considered tillage sowing irrigation with freshwater and irrigation with wastewater in 2020 tillage sowing period the effect of tillage sowing practices on co2 emission was significant p 0 01 suppl 1 the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage 0 612 g co2 m 2 h 1 was found 107 5 higher than in the direct sowing practice fig 1 and suppl 2 the effects of irrigation and tillage treatments and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on the co2 emission in 2021 tillage sowing period were significant p 0 01 suppl 1 the highest mean co2 emission 0 816 g co2 m 2 h 1 was determined in ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage fig 2 and suppl 2 the mean co2 emission in the ww100 treatment 0 611 g co2 m 2 h 1 was 31 7 20 5 and 80 8 higher than in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage was found 106 4 higher compared to the direct sowing practice 0 313 g co2 m 2 h 1 fig 2 in freshwater irrigation period in 2020 direct sowing practice caused significantly p 0 05 lower co2 emission than in conventional tillage suppl 1 the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage 0 290 g co2 m 2 h 1 was determined 16 higher than in the direct sowing practice fig 1 and suppl 2 the effects of tillage sowing and irrigation practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on the mean co2 emission in freshwater irrigation period in 2021 were significant p 0 01 suppl 1 the highest emission was found in ww100 treatment 0 373 g co2 m 2 h 1 in the conventional tillage fig 3 suppl 2 the mean co2 emission in the ww100 treatment 0 321 g co2 m 2 h 1 were 21 1 30 5 and 57 4 higher than in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively conventional tillage 0 299 g co2 m 2 h 1 emitted as 35 9 higher co2 compared to the direct sowing practice fig 3 in wastewater irrigation period in 2020 the effects of irrigation and tillage sowing treatments and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on the mean co2 emission were found significant p 0 01 and 0 05 suppl 1 the ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage had the highest co2 emission 0 550 g co2 m 2 h 1 fig 4 and suppl 2 the mean co2 emission in the ww100 treatment 0 521 g co2 m 2 h 1 were 52 8 35 0 and 61 3 higher than the fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively the mean co2 emission in conventional tillage 0 408 g co2 m 2 h 1 was found 8 2 higher than in direct sowing practice fig 4 in the wastewater irrigation period in 2021 the effects of irrigation and tillage sowing practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on co2 emissions were found significant p 0 01 suppl 1 it was observed that the highest co2 emission 0 588 g co2 m 2 h 1 was in ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage practice while the lowest emission 0 200 g co2 m 2 h 1 was in ww33 treatment in the direct sowing practice fig 5 and suppl 2 the mean co2 emissions in fw100 and ww67 irrigation treatments were statistically similar considering the mean of co2 emissions ww100 treatment 0 511 g co2 m 2 h 1 caused 69 2 68 7 and 128 1 higher emissions than the fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively compared to direct sowing practice 0 291 g co2 m 2 h 1 the mean co2 emission was 30 2 higher than in conventional tillage fig 5 the higher co2 emission in the wastewater irrigation conditions was due to higher nutritive properties of wastewater table 2 especially the high amount of organic carbon provided by wastewater to the soil can be considered as the main reason of co2 emission after organic carbon accumulated in the soil encounters o2 in the soil it turns into co2 form and leaves the soil and spreads to the atmosphere yerli et al 2019 compared to fw100 the mean content 1 20 of organic carbon in 0 30 cm soil layer in ww100 treatment was found to be 16 5 higher similarly biswas and mojid 2018 expressed that wastewater irrigation increased organic carbon more than 1 2 fold compared to freshwater addition of fresh organic matter present in wastewater may also induce priming of old organic matter fontaine et al 2007 however considerable increase in soil organic carbon in wastewater irrigation conditions could be evaluated in relation to the high bod 23 2 mg l 1 and cod contents 37 5 mg l 1 of the wastewater table 2 rosso and stenstrom 2008 thangarajan et al 2012 and kudal and muftuoglu 2014 also reported that the content of organic carbon in the soil increased the wastewater irrigation with high dissolved organic matter fern√°ndez luque√±o et al 2010 indicated that co2 emission in soils irrigated with wastewater is 2 4 times higher than in soils irrigated with freshwater and that the increase in co2 emissions in wastewater irrigation conditions is associated with a high content of soil organic carbon shakeel et al 2021 also stated that the highest co2 emission is in maize plots irrigated with raw wastewater and the least in irrigated with channel water the increased co2 emission values in wastewater irrigation conditions were reported by nosalewicz et al 2013 and gonzalez mendez et al 2015 as well nitrogen enhances the biological activity in soil and promotes the mineralization of organic matter which increases soil respiration tang et al 2018 the drivers for c and n cycling in soils are microorganisms el hawwary et al 2022 advanced microbial activity at higher n contents was one of the principal mechanism to explain higher co2 emissions and organic matter decomposition ntonta et al 2022 therefore the appropriate c n ratio improves soil microbial activities and promotes co2 emissions from soil yu et al 2014 reported that nitrogen in the soil can be oxidized under suitable and sufficient moisture conditions and trigger co2 emission from the soil the ww100 treatment had the highest total n content 0 132 in surface soil with a 43 5 an increase compared to the freshwater plots mean value therefore the higher nitrogen content provided by the wastewater to the soils with the use of wastewater in irrigation can also be considered as another reason for the increase in co2 emissions it is thought that the increase in co2 emission under full irrigation conditions is related to the increase in the microbial activity of the soil due to the increase in moisture in the soil and thus the increase in the mineralization of the organic matter more water in irrigation can lead to trace gas accumulation with reduce soil water free pore amount and then result in huge amount of co2 emission wang et al 2021 the positive correlations between co2 emissions and the soil moisture contents measured at three soil depths 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm also supports this event table 4 similarly jabro et al 2008 indicated that increased microbial activity due to increased soil moisture causes the decomposition of organic matter and thus increased co2 emission entry et al 2008 determined that the continuous supply of water to the soil provides more organic carbon gain to the soil from plant roots and dead plant residues thus increasing the emission li et al 2010 pointed out that the amount of irrigation affects soil biology and changes the dynamics of organic matter in the soil mancinelli et al 2015 in their study in which they examined the co2 emissions in 100 75 and 50 irrigation water levels they stated that the co2 release from the soil decreased with the decrease in the amount of irrigation similarly sinaie et al 2019 reported that with the decreasing amount of irrigation water microorganism activities slowed down and accordingly co2 emissions decreased and the lowest emission value was found at 50 water deficit in addition many researchers have reported that co2 emissions increase under full irrigation conditions and decrease in co2 emissions due to limited irrigation practices senyigit and akbolat 2010 zornoza et al 2016 zhong et al 2021 carbon fluxes are related to the soil organic carbon stocks in soil and emission is estimated from the loses in stocks over time with the impact of many factors the higher co2 emissions in the conventional tillage compared to direct sowing could be related intensive tillage which increases o2 entry into the soil and thus accelerates the oxidation process of organic matter with a microbial process altikat et al 2012 reported that increasing soil tillage increases aeration resulted in organic carbon decomposition while reduced tillage practices can effectively reduce co2 emissions with conserving soil carbon and soil microbial populations sharif et al 2018 indicated that both emissions decrease and soil organic carbon contents increase with the plant residues on the soil surface in conservation tillage undisturbed soil aggregates protect organic matter from microbial decomposition in no tillage practice absence of soil disturbance chaplot et al 2015 the agricultural practices such as conventional tillage versus conservation tillage can also increase the distribution of fresh c at depth could stimulate loss of this ancient buried carbon fontaine et al 2007 in addition it is thought that the emission values increase with thus the increase in the speed of microbial activities the effect of the breakdown of crop residues and wastes with the physical effect of conventional tillage similarly vurarak and bilgili 2015 stated that tillage creates a suitable environment for microbial activities by both increasing the o2 level of the soil and enabling the surface residues to come into closer contact with the soil particles de oliveira silva et al 2019 emphasized that co2 emissions are triggered due to physical interventions to the soil in soil cultivation practices and the change in soil structure the mean bulk density 1 32 mg m 3 and porosity 51 3 values in surface soil in direct sowing practice were 1 5 higher and 1 5 lower than the conventional tillage respectively this could be evaluated an effect at a minimal level for lower co2 emissions in direct sowing practice mineralization may have been adversely affected due to decreased o2 entry into the soil with increased soil compaction and decreased porosity lower soil porosity and associated reduced oxygen inputs from the atmosphere may limits the development and activity of living organisms and so seen possible explanation of the lower microbial activity decreasing co2 emission chaplot et al 2015 especially the slow soil organic carbon decomposition at lower depths could result from inappropriate conditions for microbes such as a lack of oxygen fontaine et al 2007 barut et al 2012 reported that organic carbon was maintained in the soil and co2 emissions decreased with a declining air movement due to the increased bulk density of the soil in direct sowing buragiene et al 2019 stated that co2 emissions tend to decrease due to the decrease in soil porosity in direct sowing practice feng et al 2003 and gosai et al 2010 indicated that co2 emissions were lower in direct sowing than in other tillage practices on the contrary abdalla et al 2016 and nyambo et al 2020 reported that carbon losses in the soil in intensive tillage practices were enhanced through increased co2 emissions with a result of increasing the speed of microbial activities the effect of increased aeration in the soil akbolat et al 2016 also stated that the emission in conventional tillage is 44 higher than in direct sowing practice similarly talantimur 2014 biland≈æija et al 2016 and buragiene et al 2019 reported higher emissions in intensive tillage 3 2 h2o emissions soil moisture and soil and air temperatures during co2 measurements h2o emissions from the soil air temperatures and the moisture and temperature values at three different soil depths 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm during the tillage sowing and freshwater and wastewater irrigation periods in 2020 and 2021 changed significantly with treatments suppl 3 and 4 considering the mean of measured values in tillage sowing period in 2020 18 more h2o emission was measured in conventional tillage 20 3 g m 2 h 1 compared to direct sowing suppl 3 in freshwater irrigation period conventional tillage and

in the second year tillage sowing period the mean h2o emissions in different irrigation treatments were similar suppl 3 compared to direct sowing 15 9 g m 2 h 1 h2o emission was 23 9 higher in conventional tillage in freshwater irrigation period h2o emission 17 5 g m 2 h 1 in ww100 treatment was higher than other treatments in conventional tillage 18 4 g m 2 h 1 8 2 higher h2o emission was determined compared to direct sowing in wastewater irrigation period h2o emissions were similar in ww100 and fw100 treatments h2o emission 20 4 g m 2 h 1 in ww100 treatment was 5 7 and 10 3 higher than ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively h2o emission 20 0 g m 2 h 1 in conventional tillage was determined 3 6 higher than direct sowing practice suppl 3 soil moisture and temperature values measured at three different depths 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm indicated that the moisture values increased with depth while the temperature values decreased suppl 3 considering moisture contents at 5 cm

ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices the moisture contents were determined as 26 3 and 26 6 respectively suppl 3 in tillage sowing period in the second year the mean moisture contents at 5 cm soil depth for different irrigation treatments varied between 23 6 and 24 0 suppl 3 compared to conventional tillage 23 4 the moisture content was 2 6 higher in direct sowing practice in freshwater irrigation period the mean moisture contents were determined between 27 1 and 27 3 in different irrigation treatments the mean moisture contents in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices were found 27 3 and 27 7 respectively in wastewater irrigation period moisture contents at 5 cm soil depth in ww100 fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments were

moisture contents at 20 cm soil depth in ww100 fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments were 25 0 25 1 25 4 and 25 4 respectively suppl 3 the values were 25 2 in conventional tillage and 25 3 in direct sowing the moisture contents in freshwater irrigation period were found same 28 2 in all irrigation treatments while the values in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices were 28 1 and 28 3 respectively in the irrigation period with wastewater the mean moisture contents at 20 cm soil depth in ww100 fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments were 28 2 28 2 27 6 and 27 1 respectively the mean moisture values were determined 27 7 in conventional tillage and 27 8 in direct sowing practice suppl 3 in tillage sowing period in 2020 conventional tillage and direct sowing practices the mean temperature values at 5 cm soil depth were measured 24 9 c and 25 3 c respectively suppl 3 in freshwater irrigation period the mean temperatures in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices were 23 6 c and 22 9 c respectively in wastewater irrigation period the temperature was 29 3 c in ww100 treatment while the values were determined between 28 8 c and 29 0 c in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments conventional tillage 29 2 c had 1 4 higher soil temperature than direct sowing practice suppl 3 in tillage sowing period in 2021 the mean temperature values at 5 cm soil depth were determined 19 7 c in direct sowing and 19 9 c in conventional tillage suppl 3 the temperature values in different irrigation treatments during the freshwater irrigation period varied between 24 6 c and 24 8 c compared to direct sowing practice 24 6 c mean temperature was found 1 2 higher in conventional tillage in wastewater irrigation period mean soil temperatures in ww100 fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments were determined 30 5 c 30 3 c 30 7 c and 30 8 c respectively soil temperature 30 7 c in conventional tillage was found 1 0 higher than direct sowing practice suppl 3 during the tillage sowing period in the first year the mean temperature values at 10 cm soil depth were 24 5 c and 24 2 c in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices respectively suppl 3 in freshwater irrigation period the mean temperature 23 5 c in conventional tillage was determined 2 6 higher than in direct sowing in the wastewater irrigation period the mean soil temperature in ww100 treatment was 29 1 c while close values were measured as 28 6 c 28 8 c and 28 7 c at fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively in conventional tillage practice the mean temperature value 29 0 c was found 1 4 higher than direct sowing suppl 3 in the tillage sowing period in 2021 the mean temperature values at 10 cm soil depth in different irrigation treatments changed between 19 2 c and 19 6 c and conventional tillage provided 1 6 higher value compared to the direct sowing 19 3 c suppl 3 the temperature values at 10 cm soil depth in freshwater irrigation period were determined between 24 3 c and 24 5 c in different

were determined 30 1 ¬∫c in ww100 and fw100 treatments the values were measured at ww67 and ww33 treatments as 30 4 c and 30 5 c respectively in conventional tillage and direct sowing practices the mean temperatures were determined as 30 4 c and 30 2 c respectively in the first year tillage sowing period the mean temperature values at 20 cm soil depth in conventional tillage and direct sowing

direct sowing practices the mean temperature values at 20 cm soil depth were determined as 30 0 c and 29 9 c respectively the lowest air temperature values in both years of the experiment were recorded in the tillage sowing period and the highest air temperature values were recorded in the wastewater irrigation period suppl 3 higher h2o emissions in full irrigation treatments compared to deficit irrigation could be a result of more water in the soil suppl 3 considering significant p 0 01 positive linear correlations determined between h2o release and the soil moisture contents in three different soil depths table 4 similarly akbolat and senyigit 2012 reported a declining in the h2o emissions the effect of declined soil moisture content with increasing irrigation water shortage in an another study senyiƒüit and akbolat 2010 stated that the h2o emissions were the lowest in drip irrigation which was applied the lowest irrigation quantity among the drip micro sprinkling and surface irrigation methods moreover both soil temperature affected by air temperature and direct air temperature had significant positive linear effect p 0 01 on the h2o emission from the soil table 4 higher soil moisture values in direct sowing practice compared to conventional tillage suppl 3 could be explained by the lower h2o emissions occurred from plant residues left on the soil surface lower soil temperatures suppl 3 in direct sowing could be also seen as another factor that may support the reduction in evaporation crop residues reduces evaporation because of causing lower surface soil temperatures from shielded from solar radiation and reducing the air movement just above the soil surface van donk et al 2010 moreover irrigation treatments with less quantities in direct sowing practice compared to conventional tillage might have contributed to the decrease in h2o emission akbolat et al 2016 determined that the h2o emission in conventional tillage practice was 25 higher than in direct sowing many researchers also have reported that conservation tillage practices increase moisture retention in the soil due to covering effects of residues on the soil surface thus decrease evaporation mkoga et al 2010 gozubuyuk et al 2012 mishra and kushwaha 2016 gozubuyuk et al 2020 burke et al 2021 mitchell et al 2012 also stated that the moisture conservation in the soil increased by 13 due to the covering of the soil surface with plant residues in direct sowing practice higher soil moisture values in direct sowing compared to conventional tillage can be related to the soil microporosity also similarly strudley et al 2008 and subbulakshmi et al 2009 stated that direct sowing application increase microporosity in soil and contribute to the conservation of water in the soil due to the improvement of pore connections between soil layers gozubuyuk et al 2014 also reported that the reason of moisture preservation for a longer period of time in direct sowing was the micropores increase it is evaluated that the decrease in soil temperature after irrigation is due to the cooling effect of water increased in soil similarly mancinelli et al 2015 reported that the water application can create a cooling effect on the soil by increasing the soil moisture the increase in soil temperature under wastewater irrigation treatment could be evaluated with the oxidation of organic matter provided from the wastewater yerli and sahin 2021 stated that the soil temperature increased with the increasing amount of sheep and chicken manure mixed into the soil and the increase was due to the chemical reaction effect during the decomposition process of nitrogen and organic matter simeckova et al 2016 also reported that the fertilizing has a significant effect on soil temperature moreover surface soil temperature might have changed with air temperature significantly the significant p 0 01 positive correlations of air temperature with the temperature values at 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depths of the soil also support this situation table 4 it has been evaluated that the cumulative reflections of all climate data can be represented by the mean air temperature due to the climate data in both years are compatible with each other as can be seen table 1 in the higher soil temperatures in conventional tillage practice compared to direct sowing could be effect air circulation increased in the pores as a result of earlier moisture losses in conventional tillage it can also be stated that the residues left on the soil surface in direct sowing have a significant effect on lowering soil temperature de oliveira silva et al 2019 stated that tillage can change soil structure and thus soil temperature van wie et al 2013 emphasized that tillage practices significantly affect the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the soil by changing the organic matter content bulk density and aggregate stability of the soil licht and al kaisi 2005 reported that lower soil temperatures were observed in direct sowing compared to intensive tillage conditions and this was related to the increased moisture in the soil causes lower soil temperatures shen et al 2018 stated that the soil temperature was lower between 0 and 1 5 c due to the effect of residues left on the soil surface in direct sowing compared to intensive tillage applications salem et al 2015 also indicated that the soil temperature is lower under direct sowing conditions the emission of co2 from the soil is a process that occurs with the combined effect of many factors in addition to soil temperature and moisture evans and burke 2013 hou et al 2020 co2 emissions can be significantly affected by changes in soil physical chemical and biological properties haddaway et al 2017 in this study there were significant p 0 01 positive correlations between co2 emission from the soil and air temperature p 0 05 and also between the co2 emission both h2o emission and the soil temperatures and moisture contents measured at different depths 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm table 4 it could be indicated that the effect of soil temperature and soil moisture on co2 emission is direct and the effect of air temperature is indirect by affecting soil temperature and soil moisture as a result it could be say that emissions were changed with mineralization ratio from moisture and temperature changes affecting soil microorganism activities jabro et al 2008 indicated that soil temperature increased co2 emission by 59 sainju et al 2008 rey et al 2011 nosalewicz et al 2013 chen et al 2018 du et al 2019 and zhao et al 2020 reported that soil temperature which affects the biological activities of the soil is positively correlated with co2 emission however mariko et al 2007 and gonzalez mendez et al 2015 stated that microorganism activity will only increase between certain temperatures and that there cannot always be a linear relationship between co2 emission and soil temperature moreover it could be evaluated that co2 emission may tend to increase or decrease with changing the thermal conductivity of the soil depending on cooling of surface soil with water inflow to the soil and increasing of moisture content similarly mancinelli et al 2015 stated the change in soil temperature with water ingress into the soil and expressed that co2 emission may vary according to the temperature in environment on the contrary buragiene et al 2019 indicated that despite of soil temperature and co2 emissions from the soil were not related to each other there was a positive correlation between soil moisture and co2 emissions as a result the moisture balance of soil and moistured duration greatly affect the oxidation of organic carbon and nitrogen in the soil morugan coronado et al 2011 shi and marschner 2014 it is known that re wetting dried soil especially in arid and semi arid regions stimulates microbial activities and increases oscillations lamparter et al 2009 3 3 seasonal co2 emissions per unit area and unit fresh silage yield the effects of irrigation treatments tillage sowing practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on seasonal co2 emissions per unit area 1 ha in 2020 2021 and 2020 2021 vegetation periods in silage maize production were found significant p 0 01 suppl 5 the highest seasonal co2 emission per unit area was determined in ww100 treatment in the conventional tillage fig 6 in first year seasonal co2 emission per unit area in ww100 treatment 6516 3 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 was 49 4 29 0 and 62 9 higher respectively compared to fw1000 ww67 and ww33 treatments direct sowing practice 4593 2 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 resulted 14 5 lower co2 emission than in conventional tillage fig 6 in the second year seasonal co2 emission per unit area in ww100 treatment 6236 7 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 was 42 8 40 2 and 116 5 higher than in fw1000 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively conventional tillage 5454 7 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 increased 55 3 seasonal co2 emission per unit area compared to direct sowing fig 6 compared to the second year seasonal co2 emissions for per unit area in the first year were found higher 4 5 13 6 38 9 and 30 7 in ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments and direct sowing practice respectively fig 6 this may be related to higher irrigation quantity and longer vegetation period in first year considered the mean of two trial year seasonal co2 emission 6376 5 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 was the highest in ww100 treatment and indicated 46 1 34 2 and 85 4 higher emissions than in fw100 ww67 and ww33 treatments respectively conventional tillage increased seasonal co2 emission 33 6 compared to direct sowing 4052 8 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 fig 6 considered the irrigation tillage interaction over the two year data suppl 5 the lowest seasonal co2 emission per unit area was determined in ww33 treatment in the direct sowing 3065 4 kg co2 ha 1 vegetation period 1 according to this value the fw100 ww100 and ww67 treatments in the direct sowing practice caused 21 8 78 8 and 28 2 higher emissions respectively while the values were higher 63 0 137 2 81 7 and 24 4 in fw100 ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments in conventional tillage practice respectively fig 6 the effect of irrigation tillage sowing practices and tillage sowing irrigation interaction on seasonal co2 emissions per unit yield 1 kg of fresh silage yield in 2020 2021 and 2020 2021vegetation periods was found significant p 0 01 suppl 5 the highest seasonal co2 emission per unit yield was determined in ww33 treatment in the conventional tillage fig 7 seasonal co2 emission per unit product in 2020 in ww33 practice 149 1 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 were 124 5 61 7 and 70 0 higher than in fw100 ww100 ww67 and ww33 practices respectively conventional tillage produced 19 4 higher co2 emission per unit yield compared to direct sowing practice 90 1 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 fig 7 seasonal co2 emission per unit yield in ww33 treatment 100 3 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 in 2021 were 53 6 23 4 and 37 8 higher in fw100 ww100 and ww67 treatments respectively conventional tillage 97 9 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 produced 57 9 higher seasonal co2 emission per unit yield compared to direct sowing fig 7 seasonal co2 emissions for 1 kg of fresh silage yield in the second year were found 1 7 11 8 17 0 and 32 7 higher in fw1100 ww100 ww67 and ww33 irrigation treatments respectively compared to the first year the second year emissions in conventional tillage and direct sowing were lower 9 0 and 31 2 respectively fig 7 this can be explained with co2 emissions per unit area were lower in the second year compared to the first year fig 6 and also silage yields were higher in all applications in the second year seasonal co2 emissions per unit yield on the mean of 2020 and 2021 show that ww33 treatment 124 7 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 produced 89 2 43 7 and 55 5 higher values than in fw100 ww100 and ww67 treatments respectively fig 7 compared to direct sowing 76 0 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 conventional tillage caused 35 3 higher co2 emission per unit yield considered irrigation soil cultivation interaction according to the two year average data the lowest co2 emission per unit yield was determined in fw100 treatment in direct sowing practice 55 7 g co2 kg 1 vegetation period 1 the ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments had 31 8 17 8 and 96 4 higher co2 emissions compared to this low value respectively according to the lowest value in conventional tillage also fw100 ww100 ww67 and ww33 treatments caused 36 6 79 7 70 4 and 151 2 higher co2 emissions per unit yield were realized respectively fig 7 the ww33 treatment provided the lowest co2 emission per unit area fig 6 while it had the highest co2 emission per unit yield fig 7 as a result of the low silage yield although ww100 treatment in direct sowing produced 9 7 higher co2 emissions per unit area compared to fw100 in conventional tillage as the control treatment fig 6 the co2 emission per unit yield was found to be 3 6 lower due to high silage yield fig 7 it is seen also that the ww67 treatment in direct sowing provided 13 8 less co2 emission per unit yield compared to the full irrigation treatment with freshwater in conventional tillage fig 7 while the co2 emission per unit area was found 21 3 less fig 6 the ww67 treatment in the direct sowing lowered co2 emission by 28 3 per unit area and 10 6 per unit fresh silage yield compared to the full irrigation treatment with wastewater in direct sowing therefore it could be concluded that the ww67 treatment in direct sowing under wastewater irrigation conditions may be more applicable due to both declined co2 emission and saving from the irrigation water very low fresh silage yield in the ww33 treatment table 3 was evaluated as the main reason for the higher co2 emission per unit product although the ww100 treatment had the highest yield the highest co2 emission per unit area fig 6 in wastewater irrigation conditions resulted in a high emission per unit yield in ww67 treatment despite the loss of yield compared to the full irrigation the decrease in co2 emission per unit area decreased the carbon emission per unit yield to a considerable level by following fw100 treatment in many studies conducted on silage maize changed wide range interval of values for annual or seasonal co2 emissions have been determined depending on irrigation fertilization soil cultivation and other practices summarized these study findings it has been seen that co2 emissions increase with irrigation frequency and fertilization and co2 emissions can be reduced with decreasing irrigation amount and direct sowing application in one of these studies ashiq et al 2020 stated that seasonal co2 emissions varied between 5576 kg co2 ha 1 and 7834 kg co2 ha 1 with different dose of fertilization and biochar applications in maize cultivation and n fertilizing caused high seasonal co2 emissions maris et al 2016 in their study investigating co2 emissions caused by irrigation intervals reported that seasonal co2 emissions in frequent irrigation 8416 kg co2 ha 1 were significantly higher than in intermittent irrigation 6045 kg co2 ha 1 pareja s√°nchez et al 2019 examined the effect of n fertilizing in irrigated agriculture on the co2 emission in a maize field and indicated cumulative emissions varied between 2256 kg co2 ha 1and 3255 kg co2 ha 1 however yearly emission of 655 kg co2 ha 1 in maize cultivation were also reported before in the same region under similar conditions al kaisi and yin 2005 maris et al 2015 determined the seasonal co2 emissions as 771 kg co2 ha 1 and 681 kg co2 ha 1 for 100 and 50 irrigation levels in surface drip method respectively and 801 kg co2 ha 1 and 645 kg co2 ha 1 in subsurface drip macharia et al 2020 reported that the cumulative co2 emissions from the maize field where organic inorganic and organic inorganic fertilized were 1391 kg co2 ha 1 1909 kg co2 ha 1 3574 kg co2 ha 1 and 2703 kg co2 ha 1 respectively hou and li 2019 expressed that the cumulative co2 emitted from the soil at different irrigation levels varied between 3581 kg co2 ha 1 and 4805 kg co2 ha 1 in another study examining the effects of deficit irrigation on the co2 emission it was reported that the emissions decreased with increasing water deficit and the yearly co2 emission was 4100 kg co2 ha 1 in full irrigation and 2510 kg co2 ha 1 in 50 deficit irrigation practice zornoza et al 2016 guo et al 2019 determined the seasonal co2 emission from the corn field as 3420 kg co2 ha 1 in direct sowing and 3911 kg co2 ha 1 in conventional tillage 4 conclusions the study investigated reducing effect of deficit irrigation practice in direct sowing on co2 emission in a silage maize field irrigated with wastewater and also correlated the co2 fluxes with changings of soil moisture and temperature air temperature and h2o emission throughout vegetation period less co2 emissions were determined in freshwater irrigation conditions wastewater irrigation significantly increased co2 emission while deficit irrigation treatments decreased it although 33 irrigation level under wastewater irrigation resulted in 46 1 lower co2 emission per unit area compared to full wastewater irrigation 43 7 higher emission per unit yield the lowest co2 emission per unit yield with wastewater irrigation was determined at the irrigation level of 67 direct sowing decreased seasonal co2 emissions by approximately 25 for per unit area and yield of the silage maize compared to the conventional tillage considering three different measurement periods of the vegetation period co2 emission in tillage sowing period was more than doubled in the conventional tillage practice compared to direct sowing and then decreased in freshwater irrigation period and an increase partially again wastewater irrigation period as the longest period in wastewater irrigation period co2 emissions in full irrigation with wastewater exceeded 1 5 times of the value in full irrigation with freshwater increased co2 emission was found positively correlated with the increase in surface soil moisture and temperature and also air temperatures and h2o emissions the results of this study clearly indicated that direct sowing has the potential to achieve carbon emission decreasing in silage maize irrigated with wastewater in a semi arid region the second conclusion was that less emissions per unit yield could be produced from silage maize field irrigated with 33 water deficit in direct sowing in wastewater irrigation conditions the results help us to improve the knowledge on the impact of wastewater application on co2 emissions and also provides to evaluate the environmental effect of carbon emission from low quality water applications over per unit yield and per unit area this work can offer a base for conceptualizing future studies because the findings are expected to improve our knowledge of the impact of agricultural practices on decreasing co2 emission however further investigations are need due to the impact of any soil conservation practice may vary from land to land due to local climatic and environmental conditions and management

authors contributed equally to this manuscript handling editor dr b e clothier alternate partial root zone drip irrigation aprd is efficient in improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue however little is known about the coupling effects of irrigation and npk fertilisers on watermelon performance and resource use efficiency under aprd this study investigated the effects of drip irrigation modes conventional drip irrigation cdi aprd coupled with npk fertilisation rates on watermelon growth iwue nutrient use efficiency yield and fruit quality there were five treatments coded as csh cdh cdl adh and adl the capital letters in the codes indicate drip irrigation modes as cdi c or aprd a irrigation amount as sufficient s or deficit d 60 of the total amount of s and npk fertilisation rates as high h or low l 60 of the amount of h the results showed that compared with cdi at the same fertigation level aprd increased the photosynthetic rate by 10 1 plant growth by 25 5 and npk absorption by 29 1 across all growth stages respectively the promotion effect of aprd was more prominent at early growth stages aprd increased watermelon yield by 10 4 thus increased iwue and fertiliser partial productivity at the same extent while decreased the npk use efficiency by 7 0 compared with the cdi counterparts compared with csh aprd increased vitamin c total soluble solids tss and the ratio of tss to total organic acids by 63 2 6 2 and 17 2 respectively additionally the yield didn t decrease in adl whereas it increased in adh leading to an increase in iwue of 67 8 78 7 under aprd treatments compared with csh conclusively aprd could save 40 of total irrigation water and npk fertilisers without yield reduction while improving fruit quality thus it is suggested as a sustainable practice for watermelon production keywords irrigation amount level of fertiliser different growth stages photosynthesis tss ta ratio 1 introduction the global water shortage threatens sustainable agricultural production where approximately 70 of freshwater is utilised in china the water crisis is more serious as there is a need to feed 21 of the world s population with only approximately 6 of total global water resources zhang 2011 additionally the water shortage co exists with low use efficiency of irrigation water in agricultural production developing water saving irrigation technologies is essential and urgent to support the high food demand for the increasing world population under these circumstances alternate partial root zone irrigation apri has received much attention in recent years kang et al 2004 dodd 2009 sezen et al 2019 in apri irrigation is only supplied to half of the root system leaving the other half drying the drying wetting root zones are then switched at the next irrigation event kang et al 2004 by doing this the root growth is promoted and this is conductive to absorb nutrient and water from larger soil volume liu et al 2020 in addition the roots in the non irrigated drying soil could produce root sourced signals including synthesis of abscisic acid aba increase ph of the xylem sap and altere xylem tension kang et al 2004 these signals could be transported to the shoots and reduce the stomatal opening to such an extent that could reduce the transpiration rate substantially while having little effect on photosynthesis and thus may improve water use efficiency wue extensively with little effects on yield kang et al 2004 sezen et al 2019 abboud et al 2021 the advantages of apri have been tested on various crops including tomato cucumber eggplant potato grape and apple kang et al 2004 jovanovic and stikic 2018 cheng et al 2021 the fruit quality lycopene soluble sugar and sugar acid ratio in tomato fruits and the phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of apple were improved under apri zhao et al 2019 ghafari et al 2021 in addition to irrigation fertilisation is considered to be one of the most important and manageable factors in determining plant production however overuse of fertilisers not only reduces fertiliser use efficiency but also produces many environmental problems and results in adverse effects on the quality of vegetables and fruits this problem is more prominent in china where 9 of the arable land accounts for 29 of the world s fertiliser use leading to lower fertiliser use efficiency chen et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to increase irrigation water and fertiliser nutrient use efficiency for agricultural sustainability the coupling effects of irrigation and fertiliser application under apri have received considerable attention numerous studies have shown that apri may reduce nitrate leaching and gaseous loss promote the accumulation of nitrogen in upper soil profile enhance plant absorption of nutrients from soil and increase the use efficiency of both fertiliser and soil residual nitrogen and thus has great potential in saving nitrogen fertilisers wang et al 2014 topak et al 2016 liu et al 2020 qi et al 2020 mehrabi et al 2021 however almost all the above studies were focused on the coupling effects of supplying irrigation water and nitrogen fertiliser in field and pot experiments in recent years several studies with perlite grown soilless cultivation revealed that apri could save 30 50 of nutrient solution including water and nutrients without adverse effect on yield of cucumber tomato and eggplant dasgan et al 2012 2015 dasgan and kirda 2007 so far the main way for applying apri is conducted through alternating furrow irrigation or alternate watering of different sides of the plant sarker et al 2019 qi et al 2020 mehrabi et al 2021 however it is laborious and time consuming to manipulate the furrows or switch the irrigation manually between different sides of the plant thus limiting its adoption by farmers with the popularisation of drip fertigation technology an emerging apri method alternate partial root zone drip irrigation aprd is conducted by combining drip irrigation with alternate partial root zone irrigation which would be easy to implement and potentially has the advantages of both apri and drip irrigation in improving wue and yield topak et al 2016 sezen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 shu et al 2020 watermelon citrullus lanatus thunb matsum nakai is one of the top five most consumed fresh fruits worldwide with a production area of approximately 3 1 million hectares in 2019 fao 2020 watermelon is sensitive to over irrigation even though it is a high water consuming crop zheng et al 2020 the irrigation water use efficiency iwue of watermelon in many regions is low li et al 2018 apri has been approved as an efficient method of saving irrigation water however apri does not always outweigh the conventional deficit irrigation in improving wue and yield indicating that plant responses to apri are affected by crop species plantation conditions soil types and climate conditions kaman et al 2011 lima et al 2015 wu et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are the three macronutrients which have decisive influences on crop growth yield and quality in addition the concomitant supply of n p and k fertilisers is quite common in drip fertigation practice bar yosef 1999 however studies on the effects of aprd including apri coupled with n p and k supply on plant performance are lacking hence the present study was conducted to investigate 1 whether aprd could exert positive effects on saving irrigation water and npk fertilisers for watermelon production and 2 the effect of aprd with npk fertigation on fruit quality the outcome of this study would be of great significance to provide scientific guidance for efficient utilisation of water and fertiliser resources in sustainable agricultural production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in xuji village 116 46 e 33 58 n huaibei china from march to june of 2017 the site has a typical warm temperate humid climate with an annual average air temperature of 14 4 c frost free period of 202 days relative humidity of 71 2316 annual sunshine hours yue et al 2021 and a groundwater table of 5 m the temperature in the greenhouse ranged from 15 35 during the experimental period the soil was sandy loam with a ph h2o of 7 5 organic matter content of 13 7 g kg 1 total n of 1 64 g kg 1 total phosphorus p of 609 mg kg 1 ammonium n of 5 1 mg kg 1 nitrate n of 49 5 mg kg 1 available phosphorus of 16 8 mg kg 1 available potassium of 50 0 mg kg 1 bulk density of 1 33 g cm 3 and field water capacity of 34 1 v v 2 2 experimental treatments the soil was manually ploughed twenty raised planting beds with an area of 6 08 m2 1 50 4 05 m2 each were shaped to prevent water infiltration between the planting beds a plastic film was placed vertically to a depth of 60 cm to isolate the beds on march 23 2017 two rows nine seedlings per row with a total of 18 plants per plot of watermelon taiwang xiaolan a small fruit variety with yellow flesh seedlings with four true leaves in uniform size were transplanted in each bed with a space of 100 cm between rows and 45 cm between plants the planting beds were covered with plastic film to prevent water loss from evaporation and weed growth a total of 11 0 l of water per plant was applied before the start of drip fertigation treatment different drip fertigation treatments were initiated on april 8 fifteen days after transplanting dat and ended on june 8 77 dat 2017 the experimental factors included irrigation amounts drip irrigation modes and n p and k fertilisation rates there were a total of five treatments coded as csh cdh cdl adh adl the detailed experimental design is shown in table 1 because apri has obvious advantages under deficit irrigation conditions kirda et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 shu et al 2020 most of the treatments in the present study were under deficit irrigation each treatment was repeated in four plots with one planting bed for each plot the treatment plots were arranged randomly in the greenhouse a drip irrigation system was installed before the experiment the drip irrigation system was composed of a main pipeline water delivery system and plot water delivery systems as described in our previous study shu et al 2020 some minor modifications were made to the plot water delivery systems i e there were two or four drip lines for each bed for the conventional drip irrigation cdi or aprd treatment respectively fig 1 in addition a 14 l differential pressure fertiliser tank with a filter was installed in each plot head for cdi treatment each row of plants was laid with only one pe drip pipe 3 cm away from the plants fig 1a for aprd treatment each row of plants was laid with two pe drip pipes 15 cm away from the plants at each side fig 1b soil moisture at a depth of 0 60 cm was examined using pre buried tdr tubes 10 cm away from the plants coupled with a portable tdr soil moisture meter trime pico iph tdr imko germany for the 0 20 cm top soil layer due to the wide row spacing 100 cm the area for calculation of the irrigation and fertilisation for one plant was set as 50 45 cm2 thus the soil moisture in this area was monitored the soil moisture content of the top 0 20 cm was averaged from readings from several points within the 50 45 cm2 area around a plant when the soil moisture in csh treatment reached the lower limit of 65 field water capacity all plots were irrigated the calculation of the irrigation amount for the csh treatment was reported in a previous study liu et al 2020 in brief the values used in the computation were as follows the irrigation area was 50 45 18 cm2 wetting proportion was 0 8 and irrigation depths for csh treatment before and after the fruit setting stage may 1 were 20 cm and 30 cm respectively depending on the root development as observed in the field the irrigation duration was calculated by dividing the calculated irrigation amount by the flow rate of the pressure compensated drip emitter 2 l h 1 netafim israel fertilisers were supplied at a rate of 240 kg n ha 1 as urea 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 as potassium dihydrogen phosphate analytical reagent and 150 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate analytical reagent respectively thus the total n p2o5 k2o applied were 108 0 54 0 68 4 g per plot respectively for the high level fertilisation treatment csh cdh adh for the aprd treatments adh adl fertigation was supplied to only one side of the plant at each irrigation event leaving the other side dry then the fertigation was alternated between the previously dried wet sides at subsequent irrigations the interval for drip fertigation was 4 10 days depending on the soil water conditions there were a total of eight fertigation events after the initiation of different treatments all the fertilisers were supplied by drip fertigation after the treatment and evenly distributed to the eight fertigation irrigations after this period may 26 two drip irrigations without fertiliser were supplied totalling five alternate wetting drying cycles in the aprd treatments or ten irrigations in the cdi treatments before plant harvesting on june 8 2017 77 dat the vine of watermelon was hung up and the lateral buds were removed in time to keep only one main vine from may 1 6 the flower close to the 15th leaf of each plant was manually pollinated and the other flowers were excised with only one fruit reserved for each plant thirty leaves were allowed to develop for each plant and the terminal bud was removed after the watermelon fruit was ripe and harvested 30 days after pollination the plants were finally harvested on june 8 2017 the total irrigation amount for each plant was 58 9 l and 34 9 l for sufficient and deficit irrigation treatment respectively including 11 0 l before initiation of fertigation treatments thus 40 7 of irrigation water was saved in treatments with deficit irrigation compared with sufficient irrigation and 40 of n p and k fertilisers were saved in low fertiliser treatments compared with high fertiliser treatment 2 3 sampling measurement and

watermelon fruits were weighted separately for each plant and three of which were taken as samples to measure the dry mass and n p and k content of the fruits the plants were separated into roots stems and leaves the soil around the stems within an area of 50 45 cm2 was excavated to a depth of 0 40 cm and all visible roots were picked out using tweezers the roots were washed with tap water and then deionized water they were then dried with absorbent paper and the fresh weight was recorded separately for each plant proportional sub samples were weighted and oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then 70 c for 3 4 days to constant weight for calculating the biomass of each organ the values for the biomass and yield for the plot were the average of the data measured after the dry biomass was weighted the dry material was ground and sieved to pass a 0 15 mm sieve for determination of n p and k content k content was determined only at the final harvest the plant sample was digested by the h2so4 h2o2 digestion method the total n content was then determined by the kjeldahl method b√ºchi digestion unit k 435 with distillation unit k 355 b√ºchi zurich switzerland the p and k contents were determined by molybdenum antimony colorimetric method and a flame photometer bmw xp bwb technologies ltd uk respectively the n p and k accumulation were calculated by multiplying the macronutrient

results 3 1 effects of aprd on plant growth the shoot biomass of watermelon decreased across all the growth stages while root biomass decreased only at the fruit maturing stage under cdi including cdh cdl compared with csh table 2 decreasing the fertilisation rate under deficit irrigation almost had no significant effects on the root and shoot biomass until the fruit maturing stage cdh vs cdl however under aprd decreasing the fertilisation rate significantly decreased the root and shoot biomass at the vine extension stage and fruit maturing stage but not at the fruit expanding stage compared with cdi at the same fertigation rate aprd increased root and shoot biomass by 34 3 and 25 2 and thus total plant biomass by 25 5 across all growth stages with an increase of total biomass by 31 3 27 3 and 18 0 for the vine extension stage fruit expanding stage and fruit maturing stage respectively table 2 and fig a 1 the increment range decreased with the extension of growth periods for both the root and shoot compared with csh aprd increased root biomass by 27 8 and shoot biomass by 11 2 at the vine extension and fruit expanding stages at the fruit maturing stage adh increased root biomass by 20 2 but had no significant effect on shoot growth while adl decreased both the root and shoot biomass compared with csh table 2 3 2 effects of aprd on n p and k accumulation and use efficiency at the vine extension stage and fruit expanding stage the total accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus decreased in cdh compared with that in csh table 3 cdl decreased the phosphorus accumulation by 11 4 on average but had no significant effects on nitrogen accumulation aprd increased the accumulation of nitrogen by 45 9 and 38 4 and phosphorus by 33 2 and 27 5 at the vine extension stage and fruit expanding stage respectively compared with its cdi counterparts showing a decreased increment under aprd with the extension of the growth period the highest accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus by plants occurred in the adh treatment where the accumulation increased by 20 3 on average compared with csh treatment with the increment ratio being higher in the vine extension stage than in the fruit expanding stage at the fruit maturing stage the accumulation of n p and k by plants decreased significantly with the decrease of irrigation water and fertilisation amount under conventional drip irrigation table 3 the accumulation of n p and k by plants under aprd increased by 17 6 18 0 and 27 1 respectively compared with its cdi counterparts there was no significant difference in n p and k accumulation between the plants treated with adh and csh the highest nutrient use efficiency of accumulated npk in plants occurred in the cdl treatment fig 2a b c aprd decreased the npk use efficiency by 7 0 on average compared with its cdi counterparts however the partial productivity of npk fertiliser in adl was the highest among the treatments and increased by 64 4 compared with that of csh fig 2a b c aprd increased the partial productivity of npk fertilizers by 10 4 compared with its cdi counterparts 3 3 effects of aprd on yield and iwue under cdi watermelon yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation water and fertiliser supply and the yield decreased by 11 7 in cdl compared with csh treatment table 4 aprd increased the watermelon yield on average by 13 3 dry weight and 10 4 fresh weight compared with its cdi counterparts respectively the highest yield among the treatments was seen for adh and csh with the yield of adh tending to be higher than that of csh compared with csh the yield of adl did not decrease significantly although both irrigation water and fertiliser amount decreased by 40 under cdi the highest iwue was observed for cdh and the lowest was observed for csh table 4 the iwue in adh and adl was 10 4 higher on average than their cdi counterparts iwue in adh was the highest among the treatments iwue in adh and adl increased by 78 7 and 67 8 respectively compared with the csh treatment table 4 3 4 effects of aprd on chlorophyll content and photosynthetic traits the chlorophyll content in leaves was the highest at the fruit expanding stage for all treatments fig a 2 chlorophyll content at different growth stages under cdi tended to decrease with the decrease of irrigation water and fertilisation amount chlorophyll content was higher under aprd than its cdi counterparts the chlorophyll content of adh was the highest among all the treatments at different growth stages under cdi the photosynthetic rate tended to decrease with the decrease of irrigation water and or fertiliser supply and showed significant differences among the treatments at the fruit expanding stage fig 3a compared with cdi aprd increased the photosynthetic rate by 15 5 7 8 and 8 5 at the vine extension stage fruit expanding stage and fruit maturing stage respectively with an average increase of 10 1 across different growth stages there was no significant difference in the photosynthetic rate between adh and adl at the vine extension stage and fruit expanding stage the photosynthetic rate of adh increased by 7 0 on average at the vine extension stage and fruit maturing stage while showed no significant difference at the fruit expanding stage compared with that of csh treatment the transpiration rate was the highest at the fruit expanding stage irrespective of the treatment fig 3b the transpiration rate of watermelon plants showed little difference among the treatments at the vine extension stage while the rate decreased with the decrease of water and or fertiliser supply at the fruit expanding stage and fruit maturing stage under cdi compared with cdi the transpiration rate increased at the fruit expanding stage while it decreased at the fruit maturing stage under aprd the transpiration rate of csh was the highest among the treatments after the vine extension stage the variation of the stomatal conductance almost followed the same trends as that of the transpiration rate among different treatments fig 3d the intercellular co2 concentration showed no significant difference among the treatments at the vine extension stage fig 3c compared with csh the intercellular co2 concentration decreased in cdh and cdl at the fruit expanding stage and in cdl at the fruit maturing stage while there were no significant differences in intercellular co2 concentration among the treatments of csh adh and adl at the fruit expanding and maturing stages the instantaneous water use efficiency in leaf scale wuel of adh and adl showed no significant difference at each growth stage but were the highest among all the treatments at the fruit maturing stage fig a 3 3 5 effects of aprd on fruit quality compared with csh cdh decreased the vc and ta content by 14 0 and 9 5 respectively while it had no significant effects on tss content but increased the tss ta ratio by 7 8 table 5 compared with cdh cdl increased the tss ta ratio by 7 2 but had no significant effects on the vc tss and ta contents compared with its cdi counterpart aprd significantly increased vc and tss contents but had no significant effect on ta content leading to an increase of 8 8 in the tss ta ratio under higher fertiliser supply adh vs cdh whereas aprd only increased the vc content with no significant effects on the tss ta contents and tss ta ratio under reduced fertiliser application adl vs cdl compared with csh aprd adh adl increased vc content and tss ta ratio by 63 3 and 17 2 on average respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of aprd on root growth nutrient absorption and use by repeatedly alternating between the drying wetting sides of the root zone soil apri could stimulate root compensatory growth including enhanced lateral root as well as root hair development increased root length density surface area volume and weight hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 even though root growth was promoted under apri the root weight was still lower than or similar to that of the roots of plants under conventional sufficient irrigation hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2020 shu et al 2020 however in the present study the root growth of watermelon under aprd increased by 34 3 compared with its cdi counterparts across all the growth stages table 2 the promotion of root growth was more obvious and increased by 27 6 under adh compared with csh although the amount of irrigation water was reduced by 40 in adh the root growth promotion of watermelon in the present study under aprd was more prominent than that of other crops previously reported this indicated that watermelon root was more sensitive to the repeated alternation of the drying wetting root zones watermelon originated from the tropical african desert zone approximately 4000 years ago and its root growth is generally considered to be highly susceptible to hypoxia induced by waterlogging or heavy irrigation liu et al 2006 zheng et al 2020 in apri one half of the root zone was fully irrigated leaving the other dry the repeated cycles of alternating drying wetting between root zones improved the aeration of irrigated soil kang and zhang 2004 this probably enhanced the compensatory root growth which resulted in the exaggerated response of watermelon root growth to apri compared with other crops however the magnitude of root growth promotion induced by aprd decreased with the extension of the watermelon growth period from 41 6 at the vine extension stage to 28 1 at the fruit maturing stage this was probably due to a wider lateral root extension which was less affected by aprd later in the growth period watermelon has longer lateral roots than other crops the lateral roots of drip fertigated watermelon could extend to bare ground 15 cm to the side of the planting bed at 83 days after planting where 16 3 of the total root length is distributed miller et al 2013 in addition to the enhanced root growth root vigour was also improved at the same time more roots were induced in deeper soil layers under apri including aprd zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 these physiological and morphological improvements induced by apri were conducive for the absorption of nutrients and water from a larger soil volume and thus improved nutritional status of the plants chen et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in the present study the absorption of n p and k the three macronutrients that have decisive effects on plant growth and development increased by 34 0 26 2 and 27 1 in aprd respectively compared with its cdi counterparts the promotion of nutrient absorption under aprd was probably also related to the reduced nitrate leaching promoted mineralization of soil organic matter and release of nutrients to the soil solution wang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 liu et al 2020 however the use efficiency of npk nutrients accumulated in plants decreased under aprd compared with its cdi counterparts indicating that aprd plants accumulate nutrients excessively to ensure its growth and yield formation despite this due to increased yield formation the partial productivity of npk fertiliser increased significantly under aprd compared with the cdi at the same fertigation level fig 2a b c 4 2 effects of aprd on photosynthesis yield and iwue it is known that plants subjected to deficit irrigation could increase wue through physiological and morphological regulation liu et al 2021 in the present study iwue increased by 60 2 under cdh compared with csh although a reduction in plant growth was observed table 4 table 2 fig a 1 in deficit irrigation roots produced abscisic acid aba in response to soil drying to regulate stomatal aperture and induce partial closure of stomata this could reduce the transpiration rate and partially contributed to the restricted shoot growth in the long term additionally this could result in reduced water consumption and improved wue kang et al 2004 in apri some additional specific physiological responses were involved in the adaptation of plants to deficit irrigation kang et al 2004 by repeated alteration of drying wetting root zones of plants root generated aba could be released and sustained in higher concentration which had a stronger regulation in stomatal conductance kang et al 2004 liu et al 2008 liu et al 2021 found that apri outweighed conventional deficit irrigation in decreasing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate while maintaining the photosynthetic rate and leaf water potential however the present study showed that the stomatal conductance did not decrease further while the transpiration rate increased in some cases and the photosynthetic rate increased through the growth stages in aprd compared with the cdi counterparts fig 3 our previous studies also found that apri did not always decrease the transpiration rate and stomatal conductance zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 this is probably attributed to the ameliorated water status of the plants under apri under apri root growth vigour and hydraulic conductivity increased which were conducive for plants to absorb more water from the soil kang et al 2004 chen et al 2016 consistent with this finding increased leaf water potential under apri was observed in several reports shahnazari et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2021 aba acting on stomata originates from the synthesis of aba by roots in drying soil and the lower and older wilting leaves subjected to continued water deficit sobeih et al 2004 du et al 2015 the improved water status under apri including aprd could reduce the synthesis of aba by the lower leaves which restricted the further decrease in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as indicated in the present study fig 3 however the instantaneous water use efficiency in leaf scale wuel increased at fruit maturing stage and finally the iwue increased by 10 9 under aprd compared with the cdi counterparts table 4 fig a 3 previous reports showed that even though the wue could be improved substantially the yield might be maintained or decreased to an extent depending on the reduction of irrigation amount in apri compared with the conventional sufficient irrigation kang et al 2004 topak et al 2016 jovanovic and stikic 2018 shu et al 2020 in a meta analysis it was found that apri performed better with 80 100 of the irrigation amount used in the conventional sufficient irrigation however the yield penalty would be occurred for apri with more water withdraw cheng et al 2021 a 34 42 reduction of irrigation water in apri induced a 9 1 and 18 22 yield loss in tomato and sugar beet respectively topak et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the total fresh mass of pepper fruit decreased by 15 6 19 2 under apri with a reduction of 50 irrigation water after initiation of water treatments compared with conventional sufficient irrigation dorji et al 2005 sezen et al 2019 however the present study showed that the yield was maintained and even had the tendency to increase even though the irrigation amount decreased by 50 after initiation of treatments and 40 in total for adh compared with csh table 4 indicating that watermelon responded positively to aprd 4 3 effects of aprd on fruit quality it is well established that deficit irrigation could improve fruit quality by controlling soil moisture at a moderate level of drought stress yang et al 2016 li et al 2018 the present study showed that the vc content and the tss ta ratio which is a comprehensive fruit quality parameter lu et al 2021 increased significantly under deficit irrigation compared with the sufficient irrigation treatment table 5 it was found that under deficit irrigation water transportation to fruit was decreased leading to a lower dilution of solutes in fruits however the accumulation of assimilates including sugars had not been modified obviously under deficit irrigation zheng et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the tss is an important fruit quality index watermelon is a high water consuming plant species li et al 2018 larger irrigation amounts have been proven to decrease melon fruit quality especially the total soluble solid tss content sensoy et al 2007 however in the present study the tss content showed no significant differences among the cdi treatments though the irrigation amount was different table 5 it was reported that the tss contents in watermelon and hot pepper as well as potato tubers did not always respond positively to different irrigation methods and levels yang et al 2016 sarker et al 2019 variation of fruit quality parameters may relate to the range of water supply crop varieties irrigation methods and soil types zegbe et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 lu et al 2021 at the same amount of irrigation water and fertiliser supply aprd increased fruit quality in terms of increased vc tss content and tss ta ratio in adh compared with cdh table 5 it is intensively reported that apri could improve fruit quality in terms of fruit shape index soluble solid lycopene content and sugar acid ratio especially under moderate water stress or suitable soil moisture content sun et al 2014 jovanovic and stikic 2018 zhao et al 2019 shu et al 2020 however the underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms for the improved quality induced by apri remains unclear jovanovic and stikic 2018 it is postulated that at least two possibilities may be involved sun et al 2014 shu et al 2020 first enhanced starch accumulation in the fruits during the earlier development stage followed by a higher conversion of starch into hexose during fruit ripening might have occurred under apri second the activities of carbohydrate metabolising enzymes could have been enhanced by the apri treatment enhanced photosynthetic rate and plant biomass accumulation under apri were observed in the present study table 2 fig 3 fig a 1 and previous reports shu et al 2020 this could provide more photo assimilates and metabolites for fruit development and quality improvement in addition it is well established that aba concentration in the xylem sap and leaf of maize and tomato was significantly increased under apri compared with conventional irrigation kang et al 2004 kirda et al 2004 it was suggested that elevated aba concentration plays a vital role in enhancing carbon remobilization and grain filling as well as regulating the activities of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate conversion and sugar accumulation processes yang et al 2004 further the amount and relative composition of mineral nutrients such as k ca mg and p also greatly influence fruit quality dorais et al 2001 increased concentration of p k and mg in fruit juice and ca and mg concentrations in fruit dry matter were observed in tomato under apri compared with conventional irrigation sun et al 2014 consistent with these results the present study also found that p and k concentration were also increased under aprd table a 1 however adl treatment did not increase the tss and tss ta but increased the vc content compared with its counterpart cdl table 5 indicating that fruit quality improvement under aprd was limited by lower fertiliser application 5 conclusions compared with the conventional drip fertigation method at the same irrigation level and npk fertiliser supply rate alternate partial root zone drip irrigation aprd promoted the shoot growth by 25 2 and root growth by 34 3 on average across all the growth stages and promoted the absorption of n p and k by 26 2 34 0 the promotion effect decreased at later developmental stages aprd increased watermelon yield and thus increased iwue and fertiliser partial productivity while the npk nutrient use efficiency was decreased compared with its cdi counterparts decreasing the npk supply rate increased the nutrient use efficiency while reduced the nutrient accumulation photosynthesis rate and plant growth at the fruit maturing stage leading to the reduction in yield and iwue in comparison with the treatment with high fertiliser supply irrespective of irrigation methods compared with that of csh adh increased iwue by 78 7 and tss and tss ta ratio by 7 6 and 17 3 respectively while maintaining the yield even though the irrigation water was reduced by 40 in adh adl did not decrease watermelon yield but it increased the iwue by 67 8 and the tss ta ratio by 17 1 at the conditions of saving 40 of both irrigation water and n p k fertilizers in summary watermelon responded positively to aprd especially at earlier growth stages aprd could save up to 40 of total irrigation water and npk fertilisers without yield reduction while exerted positive effects on fruit quality aprd is a very promising fertigation strategy for modern

authors contributed equally to this manuscript handling editor dr b e clothier alternate partial root zone drip irrigation aprd is efficient in improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue however little is known about the coupling effects of irrigation and npk fertilisers on watermelon performance and resource use efficiency under aprd this study investigated the effects of drip irrigation modes conventional drip irrigation cdi aprd coupled with npk fertilisation rates on watermelon growth iwue nutrient use efficiency yield and fruit quality there were five treatments coded as csh cdh cdl adh and adl the capital letters in the codes indicate drip irrigation modes as cdi c or aprd a irrigation amount as sufficient s or deficit d 60 of the total amount of s and npk fertilisation rates as high h or low l 60 of the amount of h the results showed that compared with cdi at the same fertigation level aprd increased the photosynthetic rate by 10 1 plant growth by 25 5 and npk absorption by 29 1 across all growth stages respectively the promotion effect of aprd was more prominent at early growth stages aprd increased watermelon yield by 10 4 thus increased iwue and fertiliser partial productivity at the same extent while decreased the npk use efficiency by 7 0 compared with the cdi counterparts compared with csh aprd increased vitamin c total soluble solids tss and the ratio of tss to total organic acids by 63 2 6 2 and 17 2 respectively additionally the yield didn t decrease in adl whereas it increased in adh leading to an increase in iwue of 67 8 78 7 under aprd treatments compared with csh conclusively aprd could save 40 of total irrigation water and npk fertilisers without yield reduction while improving fruit quality thus it is suggested as a sustainable practice for watermelon production keywords irrigation amount level of fertiliser different growth stages photosynthesis tss ta ratio 1 introduction the global water shortage threatens sustainable agricultural production where approximately 70 of freshwater is utilised in china the water crisis is more serious as there is a need to feed 21 of the world s population with only approximately 6 of total global water resources zhang 2011 additionally the water shortage co exists with low use efficiency of irrigation water in agricultural production developing water saving irrigation technologies is essential and urgent to support the high food demand for the increasing world population under these circumstances alternate partial root zone irrigation apri has received much attention in recent years kang et al 2004 dodd 2009 sezen et al 2019 in apri irrigation is only supplied to half of the root system leaving the other half drying the drying wetting root zones are then switched at the next irrigation event kang et al 2004 by doing this the root growth is promoted and this is conductive to absorb nutrient and water from larger soil volume liu et al 2020 in addition the roots in the non irrigated drying soil could produce root sourced signals including synthesis of abscisic acid aba increase ph of the xylem sap and altere xylem tension kang et al 2004 these signals could be transported to the shoots and reduce the stomatal opening to such an extent that could reduce the transpiration rate substantially while having little effect on photosynthesis and thus may improve water use efficiency wue extensively with little effects on yield kang et al 2004 sezen et al 2019 abboud et al 2021 the advantages of apri have been tested on various crops including tomato cucumber eggplant potato grape and apple kang et al 2004 jovanovic and stikic 2018 cheng et al 2021 the fruit quality lycopene soluble sugar and sugar acid ratio in tomato fruits and the phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of apple were improved under apri zhao et al 2019 ghafari et al 2021 in addition to irrigation fertilisation is considered to be one of the most important and manageable factors in determining plant production however overuse of fertilisers not only reduces fertiliser use efficiency but also produces many environmental problems and results in adverse effects on the quality of vegetables and fruits this problem is more prominent in china where 9 of the arable land accounts for 29 of the world s fertiliser use leading to lower fertiliser use efficiency chen et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to increase irrigation water and fertiliser nutrient use efficiency for agricultural sustainability the coupling effects of irrigation and fertiliser application under apri have received considerable attention numerous studies have shown that apri may reduce nitrate leaching and gaseous loss promote the accumulation of nitrogen in upper soil profile enhance plant absorption of nutrients from soil and increase the use efficiency of both fertiliser and soil residual nitrogen and thus has great potential in saving nitrogen fertilisers wang et al 2014 topak et al 2016 liu et al 2020 qi et al 2020 mehrabi et al 2021 however almost all the above studies were focused on the coupling effects of supplying irrigation water and nitrogen fertiliser in field and pot experiments in recent years several studies with perlite grown soilless cultivation revealed that apri could save 30 50 of nutrient solution including water and nutrients without adverse effect on yield of cucumber tomato and eggplant dasgan et al 2012 2015 dasgan and kirda 2007 so far the main way for applying apri is conducted through alternating furrow irrigation or alternate watering of different sides of the plant sarker et al 2019 qi et al 2020 mehrabi et al 2021 however it is laborious and time consuming to manipulate the furrows or switch the irrigation manually between different sides of the plant thus limiting its adoption by farmers with the popularisation of drip fertigation technology an emerging apri method alternate partial root zone drip irrigation aprd is conducted by combining drip irrigation with alternate partial root zone irrigation which would be easy to implement and potentially has the advantages of both apri and drip irrigation in improving wue and yield topak et al 2016 sezen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 shu et al 2020 watermelon citrullus lanatus thunb matsum nakai is one of the top five most consumed fresh fruits worldwide with a production area of approximately 3 1 million hectares in 2019 fao 2020 watermelon is sensitive to over irrigation even though it is a high water consuming crop zheng et al 2020 the irrigation water use efficiency iwue of watermelon in many regions is low li et al 2018 apri has been approved as an efficient method of saving irrigation water however apri does not always outweigh the conventional deficit irrigation in improving wue and yield indicating that plant responses to apri are affected by crop species plantation conditions soil types and climate conditions kaman et al 2011 lima et al 2015 wu et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are the three macronutrients which have decisive influences on crop growth yield and quality in addition the concomitant supply of n p and k fertilisers is quite common in drip fertigation practice bar yosef 1999 however studies on the effects of aprd including apri coupled with n p and k supply on plant performance are lacking hence the present study was conducted to investigate 1 whether aprd could exert positive effects on saving irrigation water and npk fertilisers for watermelon production and 2 the effect of aprd with npk fertigation on fruit quality the outcome of this study would be of great significance to provide scientific guidance for efficient utilisation of water and fertiliser resources in sustainable agricultural production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in xuji village 116 46 e 33 58 n huaibei china from march to

drip fertigation treatment different drip fertigation treatments were initiated on april 8 fifteen days after transplanting dat and ended on june 8 77 dat 2017 the experimental factors included irrigation amounts drip irrigation modes and n p and k fertilisation rates there were a total of five treatments coded as csh cdh cdl adh adl the detailed experimental design is shown in table 1 because apri has obvious advantages under deficit irrigation conditions kirda et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 shu et al 2020 most of the treatments in the present study were under deficit irrigation each treatment was repeated in four plots with one planting bed for each plot the treatment plots were arranged randomly in the greenhouse a drip irrigation system was installed before the experiment the drip irrigation system was composed of a main pipeline water delivery system and plot water delivery systems as described in our previous study shu et al 2020 some minor modifications were made to the plot water delivery systems i e there were two or four drip lines for each bed for the conventional drip irrigation cdi or aprd treatment respectively fig 1 in addition a 14 l differential pressure fertiliser tank with a filter was installed in each plot head for cdi treatment each row of plants was laid with only one pe drip pipe 3 cm away from the plants fig 1a for aprd treatment each row of plants was laid with two pe drip pipes 15 cm away from the plants at each side fig 1b soil moisture at a depth of 0 60 cm was examined using pre buried tdr tubes 10 cm away from the plants coupled with a portable tdr soil moisture meter trime pico iph tdr imko germany for the 0 20 cm top soil layer due to the wide row spacing 100 cm the area for calculation of the irrigation and fertilisation for one plant was set as 50 45 cm2 thus the soil moisture in this area was monitored the soil moisture content of the top 0 20 cm was averaged from readings from several points within the 50 45 cm2 area around a plant when the soil moisture in csh treatment reached the lower limit of 65 field water capacity all plots were irrigated the calculation of the irrigation amount for the csh treatment was reported in a previous study liu et al 2020 in brief the values used in the computation were as follows the irrigation area was 50 45 18 cm2 wetting proportion was 0 8 and irrigation depths for csh treatment before and after the fruit setting stage may 1 were 20 cm and 30 cm respectively depending on the root development as observed in the field the irrigation duration was calculated by dividing the calculated irrigation amount by the flow rate of the pressure compensated drip emitter 2 l h 1 netafim israel fertilisers were supplied at a rate of 240 kg n ha 1 as urea 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 as potassium dihydrogen phosphate analytical reagent and 150 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate analytical reagent respectively thus the total n p2o5 k2o applied were 108 0 54 0 68 4 g per plot respectively for the high level fertilisation treatment csh cdh adh for the aprd treatments adh adl fertigation was supplied to only one side of the plant at each irrigation event leaving the other side dry then the fertigation was alternated between the previously dried wet sides at subsequent irrigations the interval for drip fertigation was 4 10 days depending on the soil water conditions there were a total of eight fertigation events after the initiation of different treatments all the fertilisers were supplied by drip fertigation after the treatment and evenly distributed to the eight fertigation irrigations after this period may 26 two drip irrigations without fertiliser were supplied totalling five alternate wetting drying cycles in the aprd treatments or ten irrigations in the cdi treatments before plant harvesting on june 8 2017 77 dat the vine of watermelon was hung up and the lateral buds were removed in time to keep only one main vine from may 1 6 the flower close to the 15th leaf of each plant was manually pollinated and the other flowers were excised with only one fruit reserved for each plant thirty leaves were allowed to develop for each plant and the terminal bud was removed after the watermelon fruit was ripe and harvested 30 days after pollination the plants were finally harvested on june 8 2017 the total irrigation amount for each plant was 58 9 l and 34 9 l for sufficient and deficit irrigation treatment respectively including 11 0 l before initiation of fertigation treatments thus 40 7 of irrigation water was saved in treatments with deficit irrigation compared with sufficient irrigation and 40 of n p and k fertilisers were saved in low fertiliser treatments compared with high fertiliser treatment 2 3 sampling measurement and

then deionized water they were then dried with absorbent paper and the fresh weight was recorded separately for each plant proportional sub samples were weighted and oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then 70 c for 3 4 days to constant weight for calculating the biomass of each organ the values for the biomass and yield for the plot were the average of the data measured after the dry biomass was weighted the dry material was ground and sieved to pass a 0 15 mm sieve for determination of n p and k content k content was determined only at the final harvest the plant sample was digested by the h2so4 h2o2 digestion method the total n content was then determined by the kjeldahl method b√ºchi digestion unit k 435 with distillation unit k 355 b√ºchi zurich switzerland the p and k contents were determined by molybdenum antimony colorimetric method and a flame photometer bmw xp bwb technologies ltd uk respectively the n p and k accumulation were calculated by multiplying the macronutrient

results 3 1 effects of aprd on plant growth the shoot biomass of watermelon decreased across all the growth stages while root biomass decreased only at the fruit maturing stage under cdi including cdh cdl compared with csh table 2 decreasing the fertilisation rate under deficit irrigation almost had no significant effects on the root and shoot biomass until the fruit maturing stage cdh vs cdl however under aprd decreasing the fertilisation rate significantly decreased the root and shoot biomass at the vine extension stage and fruit maturing stage but not at the fruit expanding stage compared with cdi at the same fertigation rate aprd increased root and shoot biomass by 34 3 and 25 2 and thus total plant biomass by 25 5 across all growth stages with an increase of total biomass by 31 3 27 3 and 18 0 for the vine extension stage fruit expanding stage and fruit maturing stage respectively table 2 and fig a 1 the increment range decreased with the extension of growth periods for both the root and shoot compared with csh aprd increased root biomass by 27 8 and shoot biomass by 11 2 at the vine extension and fruit expanding stages at the fruit maturing stage adh increased root biomass by 20 2 but had no significant effect on shoot growth while adl decreased both the root and shoot biomass compared with csh table 2 3 2 effects of aprd on n p and k accumulation and use efficiency at the vine extension stage and fruit expanding stage the total accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus decreased in cdh compared with that in csh table 3 cdl decreased the phosphorus accumulation by 11 4 on average but had no significant effects on nitrogen accumulation aprd increased the accumulation of nitrogen by 45 9 and 38 4 and phosphorus by 33 2 and 27 5 at the vine extension stage and fruit expanding stage respectively compared with its cdi counterparts showing a decreased increment under aprd with the extension of the growth period the highest accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus by plants occurred in the adh treatment where the accumulation increased by 20 3 on average compared with csh treatment with the increment ratio being higher in the vine extension stage than in the fruit expanding stage at the fruit maturing stage the accumulation of n p and k by plants decreased significantly with the decrease of irrigation water and fertilisation amount under conventional drip irrigation table 3 the accumulation of n p and k by plants under aprd increased by 17 6 18 0 and 27 1 respectively compared with its cdi counterparts there was no significant difference in n p and k accumulation between the plants treated with adh and csh the highest nutrient use efficiency of accumulated npk in plants occurred in the cdl treatment fig 2a b c aprd decreased the npk use efficiency by 7 0 on average compared with its cdi counterparts however the partial productivity of npk fertiliser in adl was the highest among the treatments and increased by 64 4 compared with that of csh fig 2a b c aprd increased the partial productivity of npk fertilizers by 10 4 compared with its cdi counterparts 3 3 effects of aprd on yield and iwue under cdi watermelon yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation water and fertiliser supply and the yield decreased by 11 7 in cdl compared with csh treatment table 4 aprd increased the watermelon yield on average by 13 3 dry weight and 10 4 fresh weight compared with its cdi counterparts respectively the highest yield among the treatments was seen for adh and csh with the yield of adh tending to be higher than that of csh compared with csh the yield of adl did not decrease significantly although both irrigation water and fertiliser amount decreased by 40 under cdi the highest iwue was observed for cdh and the lowest was observed for csh table 4 the iwue in adh and adl was 10 4 higher on average than their cdi counterparts iwue in adh was the highest among the treatments iwue in adh and adl increased by 78 7 and 67 8 respectively compared with the csh treatment table 4 3 4 effects of aprd on chlorophyll content and photosynthetic traits the chlorophyll content in leaves was the highest at the fruit expanding stage for all treatments fig a 2 chlorophyll content at different growth stages under cdi tended to decrease with the decrease of irrigation water and fertilisation amount chlorophyll content was higher under aprd than its cdi counterparts the chlorophyll content of adh was the highest among all the treatments at different growth stages under cdi the photosynthetic rate tended to decrease with the decrease of irrigation water and or fertiliser supply and showed significant differences among the treatments at the fruit expanding stage fig 3a compared with cdi aprd increased the photosynthetic rate by 15 5 7 8 and 8 5 at the vine extension stage fruit expanding stage and fruit maturing stage respectively with an average increase of 10 1 across different growth stages there was no significant difference in the photosynthetic rate between adh and adl at the vine extension stage and fruit expanding stage the photosynthetic rate of adh increased by 7 0 on average at the vine extension stage and fruit maturing stage while showed no significant difference at the fruit expanding stage compared with that of csh treatment the transpiration rate was the highest at the fruit expanding stage irrespective of the treatment fig 3b the transpiration rate of watermelon plants showed little difference among the treatments at the vine extension stage while the rate decreased with the decrease of water and or fertiliser supply at the fruit expanding stage and fruit maturing stage under cdi compared with cdi the transpiration rate increased at the fruit expanding stage while it decreased at the fruit maturing stage under aprd the transpiration rate of csh was the highest among the treatments after the vine extension stage the variation of the stomatal conductance almost followed the same trends as that of the transpiration rate among different treatments fig 3d the intercellular co2 concentration showed no significant difference among the treatments at the vine extension stage fig 3c compared with csh the intercellular co2 concentration decreased in cdh and cdl at the fruit expanding stage and in cdl at the fruit maturing stage while there were no significant differences in intercellular co2 concentration among the treatments of csh adh and adl at the fruit expanding and maturing stages the instantaneous water use efficiency in leaf scale wuel of adh and adl showed no significant difference at each growth stage but were the highest among all the treatments at the fruit maturing stage fig a 3 3 5 effects of aprd on fruit quality compared with csh cdh decreased the vc and ta content by 14 0 and 9 5 respectively while it had no significant effects on tss content but increased the tss ta ratio by 7 8 table 5 compared with cdh cdl increased the tss ta ratio by 7 2 but had no significant effects on the vc tss and ta contents compared with its cdi counterpart aprd significantly increased vc and tss contents but had no significant effect on ta content leading to an increase of 8 8 in the tss ta ratio under higher fertiliser supply adh vs cdh whereas aprd only increased the vc content with no significant effects on the tss ta contents and tss ta ratio under reduced fertiliser application adl vs cdl compared with csh aprd adh adl increased vc content and tss ta ratio by 63 3 and 17 2 on average respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of aprd on root growth nutrient absorption and use by repeatedly alternating between the drying wetting sides of the root zone soil apri could stimulate root compensatory growth including enhanced lateral root as well as root hair development increased root length density surface area volume and weight hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 even though root growth was promoted under apri the root weight was still lower than or similar to that of the roots of plants under conventional sufficient irrigation hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2020 shu et al 2020 however in the present study the root growth of watermelon under aprd increased by 34 3 compared with its cdi counterparts across all the growth stages table 2 the promotion of root growth was more obvious and increased by 27 6 under adh compared with csh although the amount of irrigation water was reduced by 40 in adh the root growth promotion of watermelon in the present study under aprd was more prominent than that of other crops previously reported this indicated that watermelon root was more sensitive to the repeated alternation of the drying wetting root zones watermelon originated from the tropical african desert zone approximately 4000 years ago and its root growth is generally considered to be highly susceptible to hypoxia induced by waterlogging or heavy irrigation liu et al 2006 zheng et al 2020 in apri one half of the root zone was fully irrigated leaving the other dry the repeated cycles of alternating drying wetting between root zones improved the aeration of irrigated soil kang and zhang 2004 this probably enhanced the compensatory root growth which resulted in the exaggerated response of watermelon root growth to apri compared with other crops however the magnitude of root growth promotion induced by aprd decreased with the extension of the watermelon growth period from 41 6 at the vine extension stage to 28 1 at the fruit maturing stage this was probably due to a wider lateral root extension which was less affected by aprd later in the growth period watermelon has longer lateral roots than other crops the lateral roots of drip fertigated watermelon could extend to bare ground 15 cm to the side of the planting bed at 83 days after planting where 16 3 of the total root length is distributed miller et al 2013 in addition to the enhanced root growth root vigour was also improved at the same time more roots were induced in deeper soil layers under apri including aprd zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 these physiological and morphological improvements induced by apri were conducive for the absorption of nutrients and water from a larger soil volume and thus improved nutritional status of the plants chen et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in the present study the absorption of n p and k the three macronutrients that have decisive effects on plant growth and development increased by 34 0 26 2 and 27 1 in aprd respectively compared with its cdi counterparts the promotion of nutrient absorption under aprd was probably also related to the reduced nitrate leaching promoted mineralization of soil organic matter and release of nutrients to the soil solution wang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 liu et al 2020 however the use efficiency of npk nutrients accumulated in plants decreased under aprd compared with its cdi counterparts indicating that aprd plants accumulate nutrients excessively to ensure its growth and yield formation despite this due to increased yield formation the partial productivity of npk fertiliser increased significantly under aprd compared with the cdi at the same fertigation level fig 2a b c 4 2 effects of aprd on photosynthesis yield and iwue it is known that plants subjected to deficit irrigation could increase wue through physiological and morphological regulation liu et al 2021 in the present study iwue increased by 60 2 under cdh compared with csh although a reduction in plant growth was observed table 4 table 2 fig a 1 in deficit irrigation roots produced abscisic acid aba in response to soil drying to regulate stomatal aperture and induce partial closure of stomata this could reduce the transpiration rate and partially contributed to the restricted shoot growth in the long term additionally this could result in reduced water consumption and improved wue kang et al 2004 in apri some additional specific physiological responses were involved in the adaptation of plants to deficit irrigation kang et al 2004 by repeated alteration of drying wetting root zones of plants root generated aba could be released and sustained in higher concentration which had a stronger regulation in stomatal conductance kang et al 2004 liu et al 2008 liu et al 2021 found that apri outweighed conventional deficit irrigation in decreasing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate while maintaining the photosynthetic rate and leaf water potential however the present study showed that the stomatal conductance did not decrease further while the transpiration rate increased in some cases and the photosynthetic rate increased through the growth stages in aprd compared with the cdi counterparts fig 3 our previous studies also found that apri did not always decrease the transpiration rate and stomatal conductance zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 this is probably attributed to the ameliorated water status of the plants under apri under apri root growth vigour and hydraulic conductivity increased which were conducive for plants to absorb more water from the soil kang et al 2004 chen et al 2016 consistent with this finding increased leaf water potential under apri was observed in several reports shahnazari et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2021 aba acting on stomata originates from the synthesis of aba by roots in drying soil and the lower and older wilting leaves subjected to continued water deficit sobeih et al 2004 du et al 2015 the improved water status under apri including aprd could reduce the synthesis of aba by the lower leaves which restricted the further decrease in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as indicated in the present study fig 3 however the instantaneous water use efficiency in leaf scale wuel increased at fruit maturing stage and finally the iwue increased by 10 9 under aprd compared with the cdi counterparts table 4 fig a 3 previous reports showed that even though the wue could be improved substantially the yield might be maintained or decreased to an extent depending on the reduction of irrigation amount in apri compared with the conventional sufficient irrigation kang et al 2004 topak et al 2016 jovanovic and stikic 2018 shu et al 2020 in a meta analysis it was found that apri performed better with 80 100 of the irrigation amount used in the conventional sufficient irrigation however the yield penalty would be occurred for apri with more water withdraw cheng et al 2021 a 34 42 reduction of irrigation water in apri induced a 9 1 and 18 22 yield loss in tomato and sugar beet respectively topak et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the total fresh mass of pepper fruit decreased by 15 6 19 2 under apri with a reduction of 50 irrigation water after initiation of water treatments compared with conventional sufficient irrigation dorji et al 2005 sezen et al 2019 however the present study showed that the yield was maintained and even had the tendency to increase even though the irrigation amount decreased by 50 after initiation of treatments and 40 in total for adh compared with csh table 4 indicating that watermelon responded positively to aprd 4 3 effects of aprd on fruit quality it is well established that deficit irrigation could improve fruit quality by controlling soil moisture at a moderate level of drought stress yang et al 2016 li et al 2018 the present study showed that the vc content and the tss ta ratio which is a comprehensive fruit quality parameter lu et al 2021 increased significantly under deficit irrigation compared with the sufficient irrigation treatment table 5 it was found that under deficit irrigation water transportation to fruit was decreased leading to a lower dilution of solutes in fruits however the accumulation of assimilates including sugars had not been modified obviously under deficit irrigation zheng et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the tss is an important fruit quality index watermelon is a high water consuming plant species li et al 2018 larger irrigation amounts have been proven to decrease melon fruit quality especially the total soluble solid tss content sensoy et al 2007 however in the present study the tss content showed no significant differences among the cdi treatments though the irrigation amount was different table 5 it was reported that the tss contents in watermelon and hot pepper as well as potato tubers did not always respond positively to different irrigation methods and levels yang et al 2016 sarker et al 2019 variation of fruit quality parameters may relate to the range of water supply crop varieties irrigation methods and soil types zegbe et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 lu et al 2021 at the same amount of irrigation water and fertiliser supply aprd increased fruit quality in terms of increased vc tss content and tss ta ratio in adh compared with cdh table 5 it is intensively reported that apri could improve fruit quality in terms of fruit shape index soluble solid lycopene content and sugar acid ratio especially under moderate water stress or suitable soil moisture content sun et al 2014 jovanovic and stikic 2018 zhao et al 2019 shu et al 2020 however the underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms for the improved quality induced by apri remains unclear jovanovic and stikic 2018 it is postulated that at least two possibilities may be involved sun et al 2014 shu et al 2020 first enhanced starch accumulation in the fruits during the earlier development stage followed by a higher conversion of starch into hexose during fruit ripening might have occurred under apri second the activities of carbohydrate metabolising enzymes could have been enhanced by the apri treatment enhanced photosynthetic rate and plant biomass accumulation under apri were observed in the present study table 2 fig 3 fig a 1 and previous reports shu et al 2020 this could provide more photo assimilates and metabolites for fruit development and quality improvement in addition it is well established that aba concentration in the xylem sap and leaf of maize and tomato was significantly increased under apri compared with conventional irrigation kang et al 2004 kirda et al 2004 it was suggested that elevated aba concentration plays a vital role in enhancing carbon remobilization and grain filling as well as regulating the activities of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate conversion and sugar accumulation processes yang et al 2004 further the amount and relative composition of mineral nutrients such as k ca mg and p also greatly influence fruit quality dorais et al 2001 increased concentration of p k and mg in fruit juice and ca and mg concentrations in fruit dry matter were observed in tomato under apri compared with conventional irrigation sun et al 2014 consistent with these results the present study also found that p and k concentration were also increased under aprd table a 1 however adl treatment did not increase the tss and tss ta but increased the vc content compared with its counterpart cdl table 5 indicating that fruit quality improvement under aprd was limited by lower fertiliser application 5 conclusions compared with the conventional drip fertigation method at the same irrigation level and npk fertiliser supply rate alternate partial root zone drip irrigation aprd promoted the shoot growth by 25 2 and root growth by 34 3 on average across all the growth stages and promoted the absorption of n p and k by 26 2 34 0 the promotion effect decreased at later developmental stages aprd increased watermelon yield and thus increased iwue and fertiliser partial productivity while the npk nutrient use efficiency was decreased compared with its cdi counterparts decreasing the npk supply rate increased the nutrient use efficiency while reduced the nutrient accumulation photosynthesis rate and plant growth at the fruit maturing stage leading to the reduction in yield and iwue in comparison with the treatment with high fertiliser supply irrespective of irrigation methods compared with that of csh adh increased iwue by 78 7 and tss and tss ta ratio by 7 6 and 17 3 respectively while maintaining the yield even though the irrigation water was reduced by 40 in adh adl did not decrease watermelon yield but it increased the iwue by 67 8 and the tss ta ratio by 17 1 at the conditions of saving 40 of both irrigation water and n p k fertilizers in summary watermelon responded positively to aprd especially at earlier growth stages aprd could save up to 40 of total irrigation water and npk fertilisers without yield reduction while exerted positive effects on fruit quality aprd is a very promising fertigation strategy for modern

9383,improving nitrogen use efficiency yield nueyield and crop water productivity cwp simultaneously has been a focus for sustainable wheat production especially for the north china plain which faces challenges with limited water resources and low fertilizer use efficiency with three year wheat field experiments with two irrigation levels rainfed and irrigated at jointing and anthesis and three n rates 0 180 and 270 kg ha 1 we systematically investigated the effect of irrigation and nitrogen management on wheat water consumption at different growth stages and further determined on the relationship between cwp and nueyield simultaneously under different irrigation and nitrogen interactions the results showed that n application and irrigation increased the total crop water consumption 1 2 3 6 and 42 4 44 4 respectively increasing the n rate improved the soil water use 7 5 10 3 and reduced crop dependence on irrigation and precipitation whereas irrigation reduced soil water utilization 54 4 57 8 both irrigation and n application significantly increased the amount percentage and intensity of water consumption especially during the grain filling period there was a significant positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield under different irrigation and nitrogen treatments for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwp nueyield increased by 2 71 11 37 kg kg 1 depending on the n rate and water conditions increasing the n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp after decomposing nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield we found that the positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield was mainly due to the positive response of nupte but not nuteyield to cwp irrigation increased the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by simultaneously increasing both pre anthesis n translocation gnat and post anthesis n assimilation gnaa but increased gnat more significantly than gnaa our results provide a theoretical basis for the efficient management of water and fertilizer in wheat production on the north china plain and offer critical insights for improving the modeling of water nitrogen relationships in wheat keywords winter wheat water consumption grain nitrogen accumulation crop water productivity nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction as the third largest food crop in china wheat accounts for approximately 20 4 of the crop planting area and 24 3 of food crop production national bureau of statistics of china 2020 high and stable wheat yields play an essential role in ensuring food security and social and economic stability jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the north china plain is one of the main winter wheat production areas in china accounting for 55 of the national wheat cultivation area and 70 of the total wheat production national bureau of statistics of china 2018 and occupying a prominent position in wheat production in china the region receives 500 700 mm of precipitation per year mainly in summer with little precipitation during the wheat growing period which is not sufficient for the growth and development of winter wheat qu et al 2019 therefore additional irrigation is required to ensure high wheat yields during the dry winter and spring seasons which negatively impacts the environment due to the deletion of groundwater li et al 2008 furthermore irrigation is accompanied by large amounts of nitrogen application to maintain high yields but this increases nitrogen losses through various pathways chen et al 2014 yang et al 2017 therefore a series of problems including water shortages low water and nitrogen utilization efficiency and environmental pollution threaten the sustainability of current wheat production in the north china plain liang et al 2014 li et al 2019 in addition global climate change has been shown to increase the frequency of extreme droughts and has been projected to exacerbate the negative effects of low and variable precipitation on wheat production especially in northern china piao et al 2010 asseng et al 2015 therefore improving crop water productivity especially irrigation water productivity is essential to ensure sustainable wheat production on the north china plain water is one of the most critical factors limiting wheat growth and development zhang et al 1999 jha et al 2017 the dry matter accumulation and yield of winter wheat are dependent on the timely availability of water kang et al 2002 precipitation irrigation water and soil water storage are the three primary sources of water consumption in winter wheat production appropriate irrigation measures can reduce irrigation water use and to some extent improve crop water productivity cwp while maintaining crop yield jiang et al 2012 ning et al 2010 found that a specific reduction in irrigation had no significant effect on wheat yield but significantly increased cwp in the north china plain of china it has also been shown that moderate deficit irrigation significantly increases cwp without affecting crop yield jiang et al 2012 in addition to an adequate water supply nitrogen is also a critical nutrient that affects crop growth and development plaza bonilla et al 2017 srivastava et al 2018 moderate n application helps to increase wheat yield but when n application exceeds a certain threshold wheat yield begins to decline fan et al 2012 chen et al 2014 axinte et al 2015 yang et al 2017 the risk of n leaching losses is exacerbated by the significant increase in no3 residues in the soil under the current flood irrigation conditions in wheat production in northern china du et al 2019 additionally nitrogen deficiency affects wheat yield and crop water productivity li et al 2021 therefore there is a significant interactive effect of irrigation and nitrogen on wheat growth and development li et al 2009 on the one hand the soil water state influences wheat nitrogen uptake translocation and assimilation shi et al 2012 thus irrigation can significantly affect nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2021 on the other hand the negative effect of soil water deficit on yield can be reduced to some extent by an appropriate increase in n application ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 the crop water productivity of wheat increases with increasing n application under drought or low irrigation conditions sepaskhah et al 2006 lenka et al 2009 as increased n application can improve the soil water storage capacity and decrease the demand for irrigation thus reducing the negative effects of soil water stress on crop growth and development zhang et al 2021 overall irrigation and nitrogen application significantly affect the water consumption characteristics of wheat production systems most of the previous research has focused on the impacts of irrigation or nitrogen application alone on total water consumption in wheat production systems nevertheless the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on water consumption characteristics at different growth stages remain unclear furthermore achieving high yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency simultaneously has been the focus to improve the sustainability of wheat production liu et al 2003 jiang et al 2012 but most of the existing studies have focused on the effects of water and nitrogen interactions on crop water productivity or nitrogen use efficiency individually limited studies have been conducted to quantify the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the coordination between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat production systems in this study we hypothesized that there were significant interactions of water and nitrogen management on the synergistic relationship between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat multiyear field experiments with different irrigation and nitrogen treatments were conducted on the north china plain the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the effects of water and nitrogen interactions on the water consumption characteristics of wheat at different growth stages and 2 investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the synergistic relationship between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat production systems on the north china plain the research results will provide a theoretical basis for the efficient management of water and fertilizer in wheat production on the north china plain and offer critical insights for improving the modeling of nitrogen water relationships in wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design

with irrigation as the main plot and nitrogen application as the subplot irrigation treatments included no irrigation throughout the whole growth period w0 and irrigation at jointing and anthesis w1 standard local practice total amount 1800 m3 ha 1 half of the total irrigation amount 900 m3 ha 1 were applied at jointing stage 20th march in 2017 25th march in 2018 and 2019 and anthesis stage 29th april in 2017 1st may in 2018 and 2019 respectively the specific amount of irrigation was controlled by water meters at sowing and jointing nitrogen was applied at three different rates 0 kg n ha 1 n0

each nitrogen and irrigation combination included three replications for a total of 18 plots fig s1 the plot size was 24 m2 4 m 6 m and the variety was zhoumai 27 which has high production potential and adaptability in the north china plain the wheat was sown on 20th october in 2016 25th october in 2017 and 20th october in 2018 with a row spacing of 20 cm and a seed rate of 225 kg ha 1 and harvested in early june of the following year superphosphate and potassium sulfate at 115 5 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 115 5 kg ha 1 k2o were applied as basal fertilization in each growing season other aspects of field management followed local guidelines 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 meteorological data meteorological data during wheat growing seasons were recorded by em50 digital data loggers decagon devices pullman washington usa total precipitation levels in the wheat growing seasons were 179 4 mm 149 mm and 54 3 mm in 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively fig 1 with the distribution of precipitation varying considerably among growing seasons the minimum temperatures were 1 5 6 0 c in january 2017 4 2 4 1 c in january 2018 and 3 1 6 4 c in january 2019 2 2 2 soil water content before sowing and at each key growth stage soil samples were taken from the 0 80 cm soil layer at 20 cm intervals at three randomly selected points in each plot using a soil auger the fresh soil samples were immediately weighed and heated in an oven at 105 c for 48 h to a constant weight the dry weights were measured and the soil mass water content values were calculated zhao and wang 2017 the soil bulk density and field water capacity of the 0 80 cm soil layer were determined using the ring knife method before sowing cheng et al 2015 2 2 3 plant dry matter and grain yield destructive sampling of wheat plants was carried out at anthesis and maturity of winter wheat with 15 plants sampled from each plot plant samples were separated into leaves stems and ears at anthesis and leaves stems glumes and cobs and grains at maturity all the samples were heated at 105 c for 30 min to inactivate enzymes and other proteins followed by drying at 70 c until constant weight the dried samples were weighed and ground for measuring total nitrogen at harvest plants from three representative 1 m2 samples were selected in each plot threshed and weighed after natural drying to determine the grain yield 2 3 data analysis in this study we first analyzed the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the water consumption characteristics of wheat at different growth stages in addition the relationships between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency under irrigation nitrogen interactions were quantified finally the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on grain nitrogen accumulation were investigated 2 3 1 water consumption characteristics the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the water consumption characteristics of wheat were investigated by analyzing the total water consumption from three different sources irrigation precipitation and soil water and the amount percentage and intensity of water consumption at different growth stages 2 3 1 1 total water consumption water consumption during the wheat growth period was calculated using the water balance method as follows li et al 2021 sun et al 2010 1 et p i d w g r Œ¥sws where et is evapotranspiration mm also known as total water computation p is precipitation during the growth period mm i is irrigation mm d is soil drainage mm w g is the amount of water generated by the crop rising through groundwater capillaries mm r is surface runoff mm and Œ¥sws is the change in soil water storage at a measured soil depth mm for a given period soil water storage was calculated as follows 2 sws Œ∏ i bd st 0 1 where sws is the soil water storage mm Œ∏ i is the soil mass water content bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 and st is the soil thickness cm in this study the plots were separated by a ridge of borders and no surface runoff was observed so r was estimated as zero in addition the depth of groundwater in the study region during winter wheat growth was greater than 5 m so w g was negligible as no extreme precipitation events were observed the depth of precipitation infiltration did not exceed 1 m so the deep water consumption d was negligible as suggested by darcy s law zhang et al 2021 therefore the water balance equation for calculating the water consumption of winter wheat can be simplified as 3 et p i Œ¥ sws 2 3 1 2 water consumption percentage wcp the percentage of water consumption at different growth stages characterizes the distribution of wheat water consumption among growth stages this is calculated as follows 4 wcp et i et 100 where wcp is the percentage of water consumption during a certain wheat growth period et i is the water consumption for a given period mm and et is the total water consumption evapotranspiration mm for the entire growth period 2 3 1 3 water consumption intensity wci water consumption intensity characterizes the average intensity of water consumption at different wheat growth stages this is calculated as follows 5 wci et i gdd i where wci is the intensity of water consumption mm cd 1 and gdd i is the effective growing degree days for a given period cd the calculations are as follows 6 gdd t max t m i n 2 t b where t max and t min is the daily maximum and minimum temperatures c respectively and t b is the basal temperature 0 c for winter wheat 2 3 2 crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency of wheat 2 3 2 1 crop water productivity cwp based on wheat grain yield and water consumption three indicators of crop water productivity were calculated separately as follows fern√°ndez et al 2020 7 cwp gy et 8 cwp i gy i 9 cwp p gy p where cwp is the crop water productivity kg m 3 cwp i is the crop irrigation water productivity kg m 3 cwp p is the crop precipitation water productivity kg m 3 and gy is the grain yield kg ha 1 2 3 2 2 grain nitrogen accumulation gna to determine the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on grain nitrogen accumulation we calculated the two sources of grain nitrogen accumulation pre anthesis nitrogen translocation gna t kg ha 1 and post anthesis nitrogen assimilation gna a kg ha 1 with the following equations koutroubas et al 2012 10 g n a t p n a a n t h e s i s p n a m a t u r i t y v e g 11 gna a gna gan t where pna anthesis and pna maturity veg are the plant nitrogen accumulation at anthesis and the nitrogen accumulation of the vegetative organs at maturity respectively 2 3 2 3 nitrogen use efficiency nueyield based on the grain yield and the amount of nitrogen applied nitrogen use efficiency yield was calculated as follows moll et al 1982 12 nue yield gy n where n represents the total amount of n applied kg ha 1 we did not consider the n from atmospheric n deposition n content of irrigation water biological fixation or mineralized soil n li et al 2019 following the approach described by poter et al 2019 and sadras et al 2016 we further decomposed the nitrogen use efficiency yield nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield based on eqs 13 14 and 15 these parameters were calculated as follows 13 nue yield nupte nute yield 14 nupte gna n 15 nute yield gy gna we quantified the relationship between cwp and nueyield under the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen application first and then further investigated the relationships of cwp with nupte and nuteyield to explain the effects of irrigation nitrogen interactions on the relationship between cwp and nueyield 2 4 statistical analysis all measurements of soil water content and grain nitrogen accumulation were performed three times for each plot all indicators were examined by analysis of variance based on the two factor split plot experimental design spss 20 the least significant difference lsd approach was used to analyze the effects of irrigation nitrogen interactions p 0 05 3 results 3 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen interaction on wheat water consumption 3 1 1 total water consumption and sources of water consumption as shown in fig 2 irrigation and nitrogen significantly affected total water consumption et water consumption from irrigation i precipitation p and soil water storage sws the total water consumption ranged from 248 4 to 366 8 mm during the entire growth period et increased with increasing n application n270 n180 n0 and was 1 2 3 6 higher for the three growing seasons under the n180 and n270 treatments than under n0 p 0 05 under the same n rate irrigation increased et significantly w1 w0 with an average increase of 42 4 44 4 p 0 05 for the three growing seasons compared to w0 indicating that both irrigation and nitrogen were able to increase the water consumption of cropland the soil water storage depletion sws ranged from 51 1 to 129 7 mm for the three growing seasons accounting for 14 3 50 4 of the total water consumption while rainfall accounted for an average of 34 8 51 4 of the total water consumption under the same irrigation conditions sws and its percentage of et increased with increasing n rate n270 n180 n0 by an average of 7 5 10 3 p 0 05 for the three growing seasons while percentages of et represented by p and i both decreased with increasing n rate this suggests that n application increased the soil water use and reduced crop dependence on irrigation and rainfall under the same n rate sws and its percentage of et decreased with increasing irrigation w1 w0 as did the percentage of et represented by p w1 w0 sws was 54 4 57 8 p 0 05 lower under w1 than under w0 this shows that increasing irrigation under a certain n rate reduces the utilization of soil water storage 3 1 2 water consumption at different wheat growth stages irrigation and nitrogen significantly affected the water consumption amount wca water consumption percentage wcp and water consumption intensity wci at different wheat growth stages and there was a significant interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen p 0 05 fig 3 under the w0 condition wca and wcp at different growth stages showed the following patterns sowing turning green jointing anthesis anthesis maturity turning green jointing under irrigation w1 wca and wcp were ranked in the order anthesis maturity sowing turning green jointing anthesis turning green jointing irrigation and nitrogen had different effects on wca and wcp at different growth stages of winter wheat under the same n rate the wcas at the sowing turning green and turning green jointing periods were not significantly different between w1 and w0 while the wcps were significantly lower for w1 than for w0 at the jointing anthesis stage wca was 12 0 19 1 higher under w1 than under w0 while wcp was reduced by an average of 15 5 22 3 p 0 05 both wca and wcp at anthesis maturity increased by 171 6 215 5 and 94 9 128 5 under w1 respectively compared to w0 p 0 05 under the w0 condition increased n application significantly increased wca and wcp only at anthesis maturity under w1 both wca and wcp increased significantly at jointing anthesis and anthesis maturity periods with increasing n application for example wca and wcp at anthesis maturity increased on average by 5 2 10 8 and 3 5 8 8 respectively for n180 and n270 compared to n0 p 0 05 from sowing to maturity the wci tended to increase first and then decrease under the rainfed condition w0 while wci gradually increased under irrigation fig 3 the maximum wci was observed at the turning green jointing period under w0 0 151 0 168 mm cd 1 while it was observed at anthesis maturity under w1 0 181 0 185 mm cd 1 the wci increased with increasing n application after jointing n270 n180 n0 compared to w0 irrigation significantly increased wci at the same n rate the wci under w1 was higher on average by 15 5 24 5 and 190 6 272 4 at the jointing anthesis and anthesis maturity periods respectively compared to w0 p 0 05 overall both irrigation and n application significantly increased water consumption intensity especially during the anthesis maturity period 3 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen interaction on grain yield and crop water productivity irrigation and nitrogen significantly affected the grain yield gy crop water productivity cwp and there was a significant interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen p 0 05 figs s2 and 4 irrigation water productivity cwpi and precipitation water productivity cwpp was also significantly affected by nitrogen fig 4 irrigation increased gy significantly w1 w0 and was 35 5 40 3 higher for averaged over the three growing seasons under irrigation than under rainfed gy increased with increasing fertilizer n rate n270 n180 n0 with an average increase of 25 4 45 7 and 23 9 49 1 respectively p 0 05 under rainfed and irrigated over the three growing seasons compared with n0 cwp cwpi and cwpp increased with increasing n rate n270 n180 n0 compared to n0 cwp cwpi and cwpp under n270 and n180 increased by 21 3 45 0 23 1 48 3 and 25 4 45 3 respectively p 0 05 averaged over the three years cwp decreased with increasing irrigation w1 w0 compared to w0 cwp decreased by 3 1 6 9 averaged over the three growing seasons 3 3 relationships between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency as shown in fig 5 cwp and cwpi during the three growing seasons showed significant positive relationships with nueyield p 0 001 when comparing the slopes of the linear regressions between cwp and nueyield for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwp nueyield at n180 and n270 increased by 11 37 kg kg 1 and 7 39 kg kg 1 under irrigated conditions and the increases in nueyield were 3 05 kg kg 1 and 2 71 kg kg 1 higher than that under rainfed conditions respectively compared to n180 the increase in nueyield per unit increase in cwp at n270 was 35 0 lower under irrigated conditions and 11 1 lower under rainfed conditions for the relationship between cwpi and nueyield for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwpi nueyield under n180 and n270 increased by 10 0 kg kg 1 and 6 67 kg kg 1 respectively and the increase in nueyield under n270 was 33 3 lower than that under n180 this indicated a significant positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield increasing the n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp or cwpi while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp after decomposing nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield we found that there was a significant positive relationship between cwp and nupte fig 6a but no significant relationship between cwp and nuteyield fig 6b for each unit increase in cwp the nupte values at n180 and n270 increased by 0 220 kg kg 1 and 0 169 kg kg 1 respectively under irrigated conditions and by 0 067 kg kg 1 and 0 070 kg kg 1 respectively under rainfed conditions fig 6b similar relationships were found between cwpi and nuteyield and between cwpi and nupte nupte increased significantly by 0 188 kg kg 1 and 0 151 kg kg 1 for each 1 kg m 3 increase in cwpi at n180 and n270 respectively fig 6c in contrast there was no significant linear relationship between cwpi and nuteyield fig 6d this indicates that the positive synergistic relationship between crop water productivity cwp and cwpi and nueyield was mainly due to the positive relationship between crop water productivity and nupte under irrigated conditions increasing n application tended to reduce the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp and cwpi while irrigation increased the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp 3 4 effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on grain nitrogen accumulation grain nitrogen accumulation gna pre anthesis nitrogen translocation gnat and post anthesis nitrogen assimilation gnaa all increased with increasing n rate and irrigation n270 n180 n0 w1 w0 significant linear positive correlations p 0 05 were found for gna gnat and gnaa with post anthesis water consumption etpost fig 7 according to the slopes of the linear regressions between gna and etpost with a per unit increase in etpost gna under w1 increased by 246 3 from 5 4 kg ha 1 to 18 7 kg ha 1 averaged over the three growing seasons compared to w0 this suggested that irrigation increased the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by increasing gna per unit of etpost when comparing the responses of gnat and gnaa to etpost we found that gnat and gnaa increased on average by 268 7 and 165 4 per unit increase in etpost respectively from 3 8 kg ha 1 and 1 7 kg ha 1 to 14 1 kg ha 1 and 4 6 kg ha 1 averaged for three growing seasons this indicates that irrigation improved the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by increasing both gnat and gnaa simultaneously but increasing gnat more substantially than gnaa 4 discussion 4 1 interaction effects of irrigation and nitrogen on wheat water consumption the water consumption of farmland et mainly derives from precipitation irrigation water and soil water storage soil water is an efficient water source and improving soil water use is the key to reducing irrigation water demand and lowering et li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 our results showed that irrigation increased et and decreased the percentages of et accounted for by precipitation and soil water storage by 13 6 14 6 and 36 1 36 5 respectively this is mainly due to the reduction in leaf area and stomatal conductance under water deficit memon et al 2021 and the increase in photosynthetic performance and transpiration rate of wheat with irrigation guo et al 2014 thus increasing et with increased n application the percentages of et resulting from precipitation and irrigation decreased by 0 5 1 6 and 0 7 1 1 respectively and that from soil water storage increased by 1 2 1 8 this may be because n application promotes wheat root growth therefore increasing soil water utilization zhang et al 2016a this suggests that a certain level of n application can improve the crop s ability to utilize soil water storage in regions with insufficient irrigation and thus reduce its dependence on irrigation and precipitation irrigation and n application can regulate et at different stages of wheat growth in this study we systematically investigated the effect of irrigation and nitrogen management on wheat water consumption at different growth stages and this help to explain the crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency under different management practices we found that irrigation significantly increased water consumption at anthesis maturity and n application at jointing increased the percentage of water consumption in the later growth stages of wheat this was mainly because irrigation and n application promoted soil water and nitrogen uptake from roots and plant growth and increased the water demand of wheat plants irrigation at jointing and anthesis increases the percentage of water consumed at anthesis maturity which is conducive to promoting grain filling and increasing grain yield in the reproductive period laying the foundation for improving nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2012 in this study et of wheat in w1 in 2018 2019 is about 300 mm which is lower than those in growing season 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 mostly due to low precipitation sun et al 2010 reported that the et of winter wheat which has similar precipitation amount with 2018 2019 growing season here could exceed 400 mm for the whole season under adequate water conditions in the north china plain this suggests that the wheat plants in w1 suffered water stress however the distribution of precipitation during wheat growing seasons in fig 1 showed that more than 60 of precipitation occurred in the jointing anthesis period in 2018 2019 in wheat the period from jointing to anthesis is the critical period for water requirement and water shortage during this period could have the greatest impact on grain yield xu et al 2011 this means that even though the precipitation were low most of precipitation happened during the critical wheat growth period in 2018 2019 the precipitation plus irrigation could ensure the water stress in 2018 2019 were not severe and this could explain that similar grain yields were observed in growing season 2016 2017 and 2018 2019 4 2 interaction effects of irrigation and nitrogen on crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency crop water productivity cwp is influenced by a variety of environmental conditions light atmospheric humidity soil moisture soil nutrients etc asseng et al 2015 ali et al 2018 proper water and nitrogen management practices can improve water infiltration in the root zone and improve soil water use increasing cwp sun et al 2018 nutrient management especially n effectiveness in the soil is primarily regulated by soil moisture li et al 2021 guo et al 2012 indicated that determining the proper n rate is mainly dependent on precipitation and that water plays a vital role in regulating the soil n cycle and plant n uptake n deficiency can also lead to early crop failure reduce crop leaf area and thus solar radiation capture and reduce crop yield and consequently cwp massignam et al 2009 in the present study under the same water conditions n application increased cwp by 21 3 45 0 averaged over the three years which could be attributed to the capacity for an adequate n supply to promote crop root growth and enhance the root water absorption and ultimately improve cwp zhang et al 2016a in addition wang et al 2018 found that irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat increased yield by 34 5 and that et increased without an increase in cwp however cwp was 3 1 6 9 lower under irrigation at jointing and anthesis in this study than under the rainfed condition this may be due to the increased soil water depletion under rainfed conditions resulting in lower grain yield and greater reduction in actual evapotranspiration thus leading to higher cwp which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2016b that increased depletion of soil water storage can increase cwp this also indicates that the amount of irrigation in this study is still more than the optimal input for cwp great potential remains for synergistically improving water and nitrogen effects by regulating n application levels and irrigation in wheat production on the north china plain in order to optimize the efficiency of agricultural resources it is necessary to clarify the synergies between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency which could achieve effective on farm water and nitrogen management sadras et al 2016 in this study we determined on the relationship between cwp and nueyield simultaneously under different irrigation and nitrogen interactions our results indicated that cwp and cwpi had significant positive relationship with nueyield increasing n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp or cwpi while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp these findings also suggest that under drought conditions the rate of nitrogen application should be reduced with a proportional increase under improved water status this would have important implications for precision water and nitrogen management because sustainable wheat production in regions like the north china plain requires to maximize the efficiency of both irrigation water and nitrogen as well as grain yield therefore these conclusions should be considered in determining the optimal irrigation and nitrogen amount with dynamic models to balance the trade off between grain yield and resources use efficiencies nueyield depends on n uptake ability per unit of n supplied nupte and the grain yield per unit of n uptake nuteyield bingham et al 2012 n uptake translocation and assimilation directly affect grain n accumulation and nueyield in this study nueyield and nupte decreased with increasing n application and increased with increasing irrigation there are contradictory claims regarding the contribution of nupte and nuteyield to nueyield in different studies most studies have shown that nueyield is mainly contributed by nuteyield under high n conditions and by nupte under low n conditions le gouis et al 2000 muurinen et al 2006 however another study suggested that the contribution of nuteyield is higher than that of nupte under low and high n conditions gaju et al 2011 resource utilization efficiencies do not operate in isolation which means that there are interactions between for example a crop s utilization efficiency of water and that of nitrogen poter et al 2019 our study showed that the positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield was mainly due to the positive relationship between cwp and nupte but not nuteyield under irrigated conditions increasing n application tended to reduce the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp while irrigation increased the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp this also reflects the variation in the contributions of nupte and nuteyield to nueyield the observed difference in the contributions of nupte and nuteyield to nueyield may be due to the degree of water and nitrogen stress nuteyield reflects the capacity for grain yield production per unit of n uptake in our study nuteyield decreased significantly with increasing n application which is consistent with results of most studies that have found that improvements in nuteyield developed at the expense of lower grain n content as grain yield increased de oliveira silva et al 2020 ortiz monasterio et al 1997 hence further improvement in nuteyield by increasing yield and grain n content when n uptake levels are moderate may be an effective strategy to obtain higher cwp and nueyield simultaneously de oliveira silva et al 2020 4 3 interaction effects of irrigation and nitrogen on grain nitrogen accumulation there are two sources of grain nitrogen accumulation gna pre anthesis nitrogen translocation gnat and post anthesis nitrogen assimilation gnaa in this study gna gnat and gnaa increased with increasing n rate and decreased due to water stress gnat and gnaa were significantly reduced when water stress occurred especially under high n application consistent with findings of previous studies ercoli et al 2008 this may be because the plant n status changed plant tolerance to water stress the high n treatments were more sensitive to drought than the low fertilization treatments which could be explained by the lower water requirement due to the smaller transpiration area and larger volume of roots in the low n treatments in addition xu et al 2006 reported that moderate soil drought enhanced gnat thereby increasing the contribution of gnat to gna this could be because low and moderate water stress did not substantially alter the pattern of n accumulation in the grain as it has been shown that moderate soil drought does not severely disrupt n translocation through phloem phloem translocation is less susceptible to drought than is leaf photosynthesis yang and zhang 2006 in this study irrigation improved the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by simultaneously increasing gnat and gnaa with the increase of gnat being greater than that of gnaa these findings suggest that the improvement of n translocation at post anthesis and grain n accumulation played an important role in increasing nueyield 4 4 remaining challenges effective management of n and water in a wheat soil system to achieve high crop yield while maintaining desired resource use efficiencies depends on the dynamic match between n and water supply and crop demand crop et is a key element for estimating irrigation water requirements hence this study has examined effects of n fertilizer on soil water balance and crop water productivity and crop et was estimated indirectly with soil water balance including precipitation irrigation and changes in soil water storages nevertheless a reasonable irrigation schedule should be formulated according to precipitation crop demand for water soil water content and actual et accurate and direct measurement of crop et is essential for determination of crop water productivity in agricultural ecosystems in the future study in addition in this study the relationship between nueyield and cwp were built only at two irrigation conditions and three nitrogen levels this could limit the application of these relationship to other irrigation and n fertilizer conditions because different irrigation and nitrogen conditions could change the parameters of these relationships to build general and dynamic relationships between nueyield and cwp for precision management of n and irrigation further understanding the changes in the synergies between cwp and nueyield under various water and n patterns is critical in the future 5 conclusion n application and irrigation increased total crop water consumption 1 2 3 6 and 42 4 44 4 respectively but had different effects on the source of et increasing the n rate improved the soil water use 7 5 10 3 and reduced crop dependence on irrigation and precipitation whereas irrigation under a certain n rate reduced soil water utilization 54 4 57 8 both irrigation and n application significantly increased the water consumption amount wca water consumption percentage wcp and water consumption intensity wci especially during the anthesis maturity period there was a significant positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield under different irrigation and nitrogen treatments for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwp nueyield increased by 2 71 11 37 kg kg 1 depending on the n rate and water condition increasing the n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp after decomposing nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield we found that the positive synergies between crop water productivity and nueyield was mainly due to the positive response of nupte but not nuteyield to crop water productivity irrigation increased the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by increasing both pre anthesis n translocation gnat and post anthesis n assimilation gnaa simultaneously but increasing gnat more substantially than gnaa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9383,improving nitrogen use efficiency yield nueyield and crop water productivity cwp simultaneously has been a focus for sustainable wheat production especially for the north china plain which faces challenges with limited water resources and low fertilizer use efficiency with three year wheat field experiments with two irrigation levels rainfed and irrigated at jointing and anthesis and three n rates 0 180 and 270 kg ha 1 we systematically investigated the effect of irrigation and nitrogen management on wheat water consumption at different growth stages and further determined on the relationship between cwp and nueyield simultaneously under different irrigation and nitrogen interactions the results showed that n application and irrigation increased the total crop water consumption 1 2 3 6 and 42 4 44 4 respectively increasing the n rate improved the soil water use 7 5 10 3 and reduced crop dependence on irrigation and precipitation whereas irrigation reduced soil water utilization 54 4 57 8 both irrigation and n application significantly increased the amount percentage and intensity of water consumption especially during the grain filling period there was a significant positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield under different irrigation and nitrogen treatments for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwp nueyield increased by 2 71 11 37 kg kg 1 depending on the n rate and water conditions increasing the n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp after decomposing nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield we found that the positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield was mainly due to the positive response of nupte but not nuteyield to cwp irrigation increased the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by simultaneously increasing both pre anthesis n translocation gnat and post anthesis n assimilation gnaa but increased gnat more significantly than gnaa our results provide a theoretical basis for the efficient management of water and fertilizer in wheat production on the north china plain and offer critical insights for improving the modeling of water nitrogen relationships in wheat keywords winter wheat water consumption grain nitrogen accumulation crop water productivity nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction as the third largest food crop in china wheat accounts for approximately 20 4 of the crop planting area and 24 3 of food crop production national bureau of statistics of china 2020 high and stable wheat yields play an essential role in ensuring food security and social and economic stability jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the north china plain is one of the main winter wheat production areas in china accounting for 55 of the national wheat cultivation area and 70 of the total wheat production national bureau of statistics of china 2018 and occupying a prominent position in wheat production in china the region receives 500 700 mm of precipitation per year mainly in summer with little precipitation during the wheat growing period which is not sufficient for the growth and development of winter wheat qu et al 2019 therefore additional irrigation is required to ensure high wheat yields during the dry winter and spring seasons which negatively impacts the environment due to the deletion of groundwater li et al 2008 furthermore irrigation is accompanied by large amounts of nitrogen application to maintain high yields but this increases nitrogen losses through various pathways chen et al 2014 yang et al 2017 therefore a series of problems including water shortages low water and nitrogen utilization efficiency and environmental pollution threaten the sustainability of current wheat production in the north china plain liang et al 2014 li et al 2019 in addition global climate change has been shown to increase the frequency of extreme droughts and has been projected to exacerbate the negative effects of low and variable precipitation on wheat production especially in northern china piao et al 2010 asseng et al 2015 therefore improving crop water productivity especially irrigation water productivity is essential to ensure sustainable wheat production on the north china plain water is one of the most critical factors limiting wheat growth and development zhang et al 1999 jha et al 2017 the dry matter accumulation and yield of winter wheat are dependent on the timely availability of water kang et al 2002 precipitation irrigation water and soil water storage are the three primary sources of water consumption in winter wheat production appropriate irrigation measures can reduce irrigation water use and to some extent improve crop water productivity cwp while maintaining crop yield jiang et al 2012 ning et al 2010 found that a specific reduction in irrigation had no significant effect on wheat yield but significantly increased cwp in the north china plain of china it has also been shown that moderate deficit irrigation significantly increases cwp without affecting crop yield jiang et al 2012 in addition to an adequate water supply nitrogen is also a critical nutrient that affects crop growth and development plaza bonilla et al 2017 srivastava et al 2018 moderate n application helps to increase wheat yield but when n application exceeds a certain threshold wheat yield begins to decline fan et al 2012 chen et al 2014 axinte et al 2015 yang et al 2017 the risk of n leaching losses is exacerbated by the significant increase in no3 residues in the soil under the current flood irrigation conditions in wheat production in northern china du et al 2019 additionally nitrogen deficiency affects wheat yield and crop water productivity li et al 2021 therefore there is a significant interactive effect of irrigation and nitrogen on wheat growth and development li et al 2009 on the one hand the soil water state influences wheat nitrogen uptake translocation and assimilation shi et al 2012 thus irrigation can significantly affect nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2021 on the other hand the negative effect of soil water deficit on yield can be reduced to some extent by an appropriate increase in n application ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 the crop water productivity of wheat increases with increasing n application under drought or low irrigation conditions sepaskhah et al 2006 lenka et al 2009 as increased n application can improve the soil water storage capacity and decrease the demand for irrigation thus reducing the negative effects of soil water stress on crop growth and development zhang et al 2021 overall irrigation and nitrogen application significantly affect the water consumption characteristics of wheat production systems most of the previous research has focused on the impacts of irrigation or nitrogen application alone on total water consumption in wheat production systems nevertheless the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on water consumption characteristics at different growth stages remain unclear furthermore achieving high yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency simultaneously has been the focus to improve the sustainability of wheat production liu et al 2003 jiang et al 2012 but most of the existing studies have focused on the effects of water and nitrogen interactions on crop water productivity or nitrogen use efficiency individually limited studies have been conducted to quantify the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the coordination between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat production systems in this study we hypothesized that there were significant interactions of water and nitrogen management on the synergistic relationship between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat multiyear field experiments with different irrigation and nitrogen treatments were conducted on the north china plain the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the effects of water and nitrogen interactions on the water consumption characteristics of wheat at different growth stages and 2 investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the synergistic relationship between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat production systems on the north china plain the research results will provide a theoretical basis for the efficient management of water and fertilizer in wheat production on the north china plain and offer critical insights for improving the modeling of nitrogen water relationships in wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design

fluvo aquic maize was the preceding crop in the experimental field the physical and chemical properties of the 0 80 cm soil layer are shown in table s1 a split design was used for field experiments with irrigation as the main plot and nitrogen application as the subplot irrigation treatments included no irrigation throughout the whole growth period w0 and irrigation at jointing and anthesis w1 standard local practice total amount 1800 m3 ha 1 half of the total irrigation amount 900 m3 ha 1 were applied at jointing stage 20th march in 2017 25th march in 2018 and 2019 and anthesis stage 29th april in 2017 1st may in 2018 and 2019 respectively the specific amount of irrigation was controlled by water meters at sowing and jointing nitrogen was applied at three different rates 0 kg n ha 1 n0 medium nitrogen rate n180 180 kg n ha 1 and high nitrogen rate n270 270 kg n ha 1 the ratio for basal and topdressing n fertilizer was 3 1 for n180 and 2 1 for n270 in 2017 and 1 1 in 2018 and 2019 each nitrogen and irrigation combination included three replications for a total of 18 plots fig s1 the plot size was 24 m2 4 m 6 m and the variety was zhoumai 27 which has high production potential and adaptability in the north china plain the wheat was sown on 20th october in 2016 25th october in 2017 and 20th october in 2018 with a row spacing of 20 cm and a seed rate of 225 kg ha 1 and harvested in early june of the following year superphosphate and potassium sulfate at 115 5 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 115 5 kg ha 1 k2o were applied as basal fertilization in each growing season other aspects of field management followed local guidelines 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 meteorological data meteorological data during wheat growing seasons were recorded by em50 digital data loggers decagon devices pullman washington usa total precipitation levels in the wheat growing seasons were 179 4 mm 149 mm and 54 3 mm in 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively fig 1 with the distribution of precipitation varying considerably among growing seasons the minimum temperatures were 1 5 6 0 c in january 2017 4 2 4 1 c in january 2018 and 3 1 6 4 c in january 2019 2 2 2 soil water content before sowing and at each key growth stage soil samples were taken from the 0 80 cm soil layer at 20 cm intervals at three randomly selected points in each plot using a soil auger the fresh soil samples were immediately weighed and heated in an oven at 105 c for 48 h to a constant weight the dry weights were measured and the soil mass water content values were calculated zhao and wang 2017 the soil bulk density and field water capacity of the 0 80 cm soil layer were determined using the ring knife method before sowing cheng et al 2015 2 2 3 plant dry matter and grain yield destructive sampling of wheat plants was carried out at anthesis and maturity of winter wheat with 15 plants sampled from each plot plant samples were separated into leaves stems and ears at anthesis and leaves stems glumes and cobs and grains at maturity all the samples were heated at 105 c for 30 min to inactivate enzymes and other proteins followed by drying at 70 c until constant weight the dried samples were weighed and ground for measuring total nitrogen at harvest plants from three representative 1 m2 samples were selected in each plot threshed and weighed after natural drying to determine the grain yield 2 3 data analysis in this study we first analyzed the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the water consumption characteristics of wheat at different growth stages in addition the relationships between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency under irrigation nitrogen interactions were quantified finally the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on grain nitrogen accumulation were investigated 2 3 1 water consumption characteristics the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on the water consumption characteristics of wheat were investigated by analyzing the total water consumption from three different sources irrigation precipitation and soil water and the amount percentage and intensity of water consumption at different growth stages 2 3 1 1 total water consumption water consumption during the wheat growth period was calculated using the water balance method as follows li et al 2021 sun et al 2010 1 et p i d w g r Œ¥sws where et is evapotranspiration mm also known as total water computation p is precipitation during the growth period mm i is irrigation mm d is soil drainage mm w g is the amount of water generated by the crop rising through groundwater capillaries mm r is surface runoff mm and Œ¥sws is the change in soil water storage at a measured soil depth mm for a given period soil water storage was calculated as follows 2 sws Œ∏ i bd st 0 1 where sws is the soil water storage mm Œ∏ i is the soil mass water content bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 and st is the soil thickness cm in this study the plots were separated by a ridge of borders and no surface runoff was observed so r was estimated as zero in addition the depth of groundwater in the study region during winter wheat growth was greater than 5 m so w g was negligible as no extreme precipitation events were observed the depth of precipitation infiltration did not exceed 1 m so the deep water consumption d was negligible as suggested by darcy s law zhang et al 2021 therefore the water balance equation for calculating the water consumption of winter wheat can be simplified as 3 et p i Œ¥ sws 2 3 1 2 water consumption percentage wcp the percentage of water consumption at different growth stages characterizes the distribution of wheat water consumption among growth stages this is calculated as follows 4 wcp et i et 100 where wcp is the percentage of water consumption during a certain wheat growth period et i is the water consumption for a given period mm and et is the total water consumption evapotranspiration mm for the entire growth period 2 3 1 3 water consumption intensity wci water consumption intensity characterizes the average intensity of water consumption at different wheat growth stages this is calculated as follows 5 wci et i gdd i where wci is the intensity of water consumption mm cd 1 and gdd i is the effective growing degree days for a given period cd the calculations are as follows 6 gdd t max t m i n 2 t b where t max and t min is the daily maximum and minimum temperatures c respectively and t b is the basal temperature 0 c for winter wheat 2 3 2 crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency of wheat 2 3 2 1 crop water productivity cwp based on wheat grain yield and water consumption three indicators of crop water productivity were calculated separately as follows fern√°ndez et al 2020 7 cwp gy et 8 cwp i gy i 9 cwp p gy p where cwp is the crop water productivity kg m 3 cwp i is the crop irrigation water productivity kg m 3 cwp p is the crop precipitation water productivity kg m 3 and gy is the grain yield kg ha 1 2 3 2 2 grain nitrogen accumulation gna to determine the effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on grain nitrogen accumulation we calculated the two sources of grain nitrogen accumulation pre anthesis nitrogen translocation gna t kg ha 1 and post anthesis nitrogen assimilation gna a kg ha 1 with the following equations koutroubas et al 2012 10 g n a t p n a a n t h e s i s p n a m a t u r i t y v e g 11 gna a gna gan t where pna anthesis and pna maturity veg are the plant nitrogen accumulation at anthesis and the nitrogen accumulation of the vegetative organs at maturity respectively 2 3 2 3 nitrogen use efficiency nueyield based on the grain yield and the amount of nitrogen applied nitrogen use efficiency yield was calculated as follows moll et al 1982 12 nue yield gy n where n represents the total amount of n applied kg ha 1 we did not consider the n from atmospheric n deposition n content of irrigation water biological fixation or mineralized soil n li et al 2019 following the approach described by poter et al 2019 and sadras et al 2016 we further decomposed the nitrogen use efficiency yield nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield based on eqs 13 14 and 15 these parameters were calculated as follows 13 nue yield nupte nute yield 14 nupte gna n 15 nute yield gy gna we quantified the relationship between cwp and nueyield under the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen application first and then further investigated the relationships of cwp with nupte and nuteyield to explain the effects of irrigation nitrogen interactions on the relationship between cwp and nueyield 2 4 statistical analysis all measurements of soil water content and grain nitrogen accumulation were performed three times for each plot all indicators were examined by analysis of variance based on the two factor split plot experimental design spss 20 the least significant difference lsd approach was used to analyze the effects of irrigation nitrogen interactions p 0 05 3 results 3 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen interaction on wheat water consumption 3 1 1 total water consumption and sources of water consumption as shown in fig 2 irrigation and nitrogen significantly affected total water consumption et water consumption from irrigation i precipitation p and soil water storage sws the total water consumption ranged from 248 4 to 366 8 mm during the entire growth period et increased with increasing n application n270 n180 n0 and was 1 2 3 6 higher for the three growing seasons under the n180 and n270 treatments than under n0 p 0 05 under the same n rate irrigation increased et significantly w1 w0 with an average increase of 42 4 44 4 p 0 05 for the three growing seasons compared to w0 indicating that both irrigation and nitrogen were able to increase the water consumption of cropland the soil water storage depletion sws ranged from 51 1 to 129 7 mm for the three growing seasons accounting for 14 3 50 4 of the total water consumption while rainfall accounted for an average of 34 8 51 4 of the total water consumption under the same irrigation conditions sws and its percentage of et increased with increasing n rate n270 n180 n0 by an average of 7 5 10 3 p 0 05 for the three growing seasons while percentages of et represented by p and i both decreased with increasing n rate this suggests that n application increased the soil water use and reduced crop dependence on irrigation and rainfall under the same n rate sws and its percentage of et decreased with increasing irrigation w1 w0 as did the percentage of et represented by p w1 w0 sws was 54 4 57 8 p 0 05 lower under w1 than under w0 this shows that increasing irrigation under a certain n rate reduces the utilization of soil water storage 3 1 2 water consumption at different wheat growth stages irrigation and nitrogen significantly affected the water consumption amount wca water consumption percentage wcp and water consumption intensity wci at different wheat growth stages and there was a significant interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen p 0 05 fig 3 under the w0 condition wca and wcp at different growth stages showed the following patterns sowing turning green jointing anthesis anthesis maturity turning green jointing under irrigation w1 wca and wcp were ranked in the order anthesis maturity sowing turning green jointing anthesis turning green jointing irrigation and nitrogen had different effects on wca and wcp at different growth stages of winter wheat under the same n rate the wcas at the sowing turning green and turning green jointing periods were not significantly different between w1 and w0 while the wcps were significantly lower for w1 than for w0 at the jointing anthesis stage wca was 12 0 19 1 higher under w1 than under w0 while wcp was reduced by an average of 15 5 22 3 p 0 05 both wca and wcp at anthesis maturity increased by 171 6 215 5 and 94 9 128 5 under w1 respectively compared to w0 p 0 05 under the w0 condition increased n application significantly increased wca and wcp only at anthesis maturity under w1 both wca and wcp increased significantly at jointing anthesis and anthesis maturity periods with increasing n application for example wca and wcp at anthesis maturity increased on average by 5 2 10 8 and 3 5 8 8 respectively for n180 and n270 compared to n0 p 0 05 from sowing to maturity the wci tended to increase first and then decrease under the rainfed condition w0 while wci gradually increased under irrigation fig 3 the maximum wci was observed at the turning green jointing period under w0 0 151 0 168 mm cd 1 while it was observed at anthesis maturity under w1 0 181 0 185 mm cd 1 the wci increased with increasing n application after jointing n270 n180 n0 compared to w0 irrigation significantly increased wci at the same n rate the wci under w1 was higher on average by 15 5 24 5 and 190 6 272 4 at the jointing anthesis and anthesis maturity periods respectively compared to w0 p 0 05 overall both irrigation and n application significantly increased water consumption intensity especially during the anthesis maturity period 3 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen interaction on grain yield and crop water productivity irrigation and nitrogen significantly affected the grain yield gy crop water productivity cwp and there was a significant interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen p 0 05 figs s2 and 4 irrigation water productivity cwpi and precipitation water productivity cwpp was also significantly affected by nitrogen fig 4 irrigation increased gy significantly w1 w0 and was 35 5 40 3 higher for averaged over the three growing seasons under irrigation than under rainfed gy increased with increasing fertilizer n rate n270 n180 n0 with an average increase of 25 4 45 7 and 23 9 49 1 respectively p 0 05 under rainfed and irrigated over the three growing seasons compared with n0 cwp cwpi and cwpp increased with increasing n rate n270 n180 n0 compared to n0 cwp cwpi and cwpp under n270 and n180 increased by 21 3 45 0 23 1 48 3 and 25 4 45 3 respectively p 0 05 averaged over the three years cwp decreased with increasing irrigation w1 w0 compared to w0 cwp decreased by 3 1 6 9 averaged over the three growing seasons 3 3 relationships between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency as shown in fig 5 cwp and cwpi during the three growing seasons showed significant positive relationships with nueyield p 0 001 when comparing the slopes of the linear regressions between cwp and nueyield for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwp nueyield at n180 and n270 increased by 11 37 kg kg 1 and 7 39 kg kg 1 under irrigated conditions and the increases in nueyield were 3 05 kg kg 1 and 2 71 kg kg 1 higher than that under rainfed conditions respectively compared to n180 the increase in nueyield per unit increase in cwp at n270 was 35 0 lower under irrigated conditions and 11 1 lower under rainfed conditions for the relationship between cwpi and nueyield for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwpi nueyield under n180 and n270 increased by 10 0 kg kg 1 and 6 67 kg kg 1 respectively and the increase in nueyield under n270 was 33 3 lower than that under n180 this indicated a significant positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield increasing the n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp or cwpi while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp after decomposing nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield we found that there was a significant positive relationship between cwp and nupte fig 6a but no significant relationship between cwp and nuteyield fig 6b for each unit increase in cwp the nupte values at n180 and n270 increased by 0 220 kg kg 1 and 0 169 kg kg 1 respectively under irrigated conditions and by 0 067 kg kg 1 and 0 070 kg kg 1 respectively under rainfed conditions fig 6b similar relationships were found between cwpi and nuteyield and between cwpi and nupte nupte increased significantly by 0 188 kg kg 1 and 0 151 kg kg 1 for each 1 kg m 3 increase in cwpi at n180 and n270 respectively fig 6c in contrast there was no significant linear relationship between cwpi and nuteyield fig 6d this indicates that the positive synergistic relationship between crop water productivity cwp and cwpi and nueyield was mainly due to the positive relationship between crop water productivity and nupte under irrigated conditions increasing n application tended to reduce the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp and cwpi while irrigation increased the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp 3 4 effects of irrigation and nitrogen interactions on grain nitrogen accumulation grain nitrogen accumulation gna pre anthesis nitrogen translocation gnat and post anthesis nitrogen assimilation gnaa all increased with increasing n rate and irrigation n270 n180 n0 w1 w0 significant linear positive correlations p 0 05 were found for gna gnat and gnaa with post anthesis water consumption etpost fig 7 according to the slopes of the linear regressions between gna and etpost with a per unit increase in etpost gna under w1 increased by 246 3 from 5 4 kg ha 1 to 18 7 kg ha 1 averaged over the three growing seasons compared to w0 this suggested that irrigation increased the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by increasing gna per unit of etpost when comparing the responses of gnat and gnaa to etpost we found that gnat and gnaa increased on average by 268 7 and 165 4 per unit increase in etpost respectively from 3 8 kg ha 1 and 1 7 kg ha 1 to 14 1 kg ha 1 and 4 6 kg ha 1 averaged for three growing seasons this indicates that irrigation improved the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by increasing both gnat and gnaa simultaneously but increasing gnat more substantially than gnaa 4 discussion 4 1 interaction effects of irrigation and nitrogen on wheat water consumption the water consumption of farmland et mainly derives from precipitation irrigation water and soil water storage soil water is an efficient water source and improving soil water use is the key to reducing irrigation water demand and lowering et li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 our results showed that irrigation increased et and decreased the percentages of et accounted for by precipitation and soil water storage by 13 6 14 6 and 36 1 36 5 respectively this is mainly due to the reduction in leaf area and stomatal conductance under water deficit memon et al 2021 and the increase in photosynthetic performance and transpiration rate of wheat with irrigation guo et al 2014 thus increasing et with increased n application the percentages of et resulting from precipitation and irrigation decreased by 0 5 1 6 and 0 7 1 1 respectively and that from soil water storage increased by 1 2 1 8 this may be because n application promotes wheat root growth therefore increasing soil water utilization zhang et al 2016a this suggests that a certain level of n application can improve the crop s ability to utilize soil water storage in regions with insufficient irrigation and thus reduce its dependence on irrigation and precipitation irrigation and n application can regulate et at different stages of wheat growth in this study we systematically investigated the effect of irrigation and nitrogen management on wheat water consumption at different growth stages and this help to explain the crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency under different management practices we found that irrigation significantly increased water consumption at anthesis maturity and n application at jointing increased the percentage of water consumption in the later growth stages of wheat this was mainly because irrigation and n application promoted soil water and nitrogen uptake from roots and plant growth and increased the water demand of wheat plants irrigation at jointing and anthesis increases the percentage of water consumed at anthesis maturity which is conducive to promoting grain filling and increasing grain yield in the reproductive period laying the foundation for improving nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2012 in this study et of wheat in w1 in 2018 2019 is about 300 mm which is lower than those in growing season 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 mostly due to low precipitation sun et al 2010 reported that the et of winter wheat which has similar precipitation amount with 2018 2019 growing season here could exceed 400 mm for the whole season under adequate water conditions in the north china plain this suggests that the wheat plants in w1 suffered water stress however the distribution of precipitation during wheat growing seasons in fig 1 showed that more than 60 of precipitation occurred in the jointing anthesis period in 2018 2019 in wheat the period from jointing to anthesis is the critical period for water requirement and water shortage during this period could have the greatest impact on grain yield xu et al 2011 this means that even though the precipitation were low most of precipitation happened during the critical wheat growth period in 2018 2019 the precipitation plus irrigation could ensure the water stress in 2018 2019 were not severe and this could explain that similar grain yields were observed in growing season 2016 2017 and 2018 2019 4 2 interaction effects of irrigation and nitrogen on crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency crop water productivity cwp is influenced by a variety of environmental conditions light atmospheric humidity soil moisture soil nutrients etc asseng et al 2015 ali et al 2018 proper water and nitrogen management practices can improve water infiltration in the root zone and improve soil water use increasing cwp sun et al 2018 nutrient management especially n effectiveness in the soil is primarily regulated by soil moisture li et al 2021 guo et al 2012 indicated that determining the proper n rate is mainly dependent on precipitation and that water plays a vital role in regulating the soil n cycle and plant n uptake n deficiency can also lead to early crop failure reduce crop leaf area and thus solar radiation capture and reduce crop yield and consequently cwp massignam et al 2009 in the present study under the same water conditions n application increased cwp by 21 3 45 0 averaged over the three years which could be attributed to the capacity for an adequate n supply to promote crop root growth and enhance the root water absorption and ultimately improve cwp zhang et al 2016a in addition wang et al 2018 found that irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat increased yield by 34 5 and that et increased without an increase in cwp however cwp was 3 1 6 9 lower under irrigation at jointing and anthesis in this study than under the rainfed condition this may be due to the increased soil water depletion under rainfed conditions resulting in lower grain yield and greater reduction in actual evapotranspiration thus leading to higher cwp which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2016b that increased depletion of soil water storage can increase cwp this also indicates that the amount of irrigation in this study is still more than the optimal input for cwp great potential remains for synergistically improving water and nitrogen effects by regulating n application levels and irrigation in wheat production on the north china plain in order to optimize the efficiency of agricultural resources it is necessary to clarify the synergies between crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency which could achieve effective on farm water and nitrogen management sadras et al 2016 in this study we determined on the relationship between cwp and nueyield simultaneously under different irrigation and nitrogen interactions our results indicated that cwp and cwpi had significant positive relationship with nueyield increasing n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp or cwpi while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp these findings also suggest that under drought conditions the rate of nitrogen application should be reduced with a proportional increase under improved water status this would have important implications for precision water and nitrogen management because sustainable wheat production in regions like the north china plain requires to maximize the efficiency of both irrigation water and nitrogen as well as grain yield therefore these conclusions should be considered in determining the optimal irrigation and nitrogen amount with dynamic models to balance the trade off between grain yield and resources use efficiencies nueyield depends on n uptake ability per unit of n supplied nupte and the grain yield per unit of n uptake nuteyield bingham et al 2012 n uptake translocation and assimilation directly affect grain n accumulation and nueyield in this study nueyield and nupte decreased with increasing n application and increased with increasing irrigation there are contradictory claims regarding the contribution of nupte and nuteyield to nueyield in different studies most studies have shown that nueyield is mainly contributed by nuteyield under high n conditions and by nupte under low n conditions le gouis et al 2000 muurinen et al 2006 however another study suggested that the contribution of nuteyield is higher than that of nupte under low and high n conditions gaju et al 2011 resource utilization efficiencies do not operate in isolation which means that there are interactions between for example a crop s utilization efficiency of water and that of nitrogen poter et al 2019 our study showed that the positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield was mainly due to the positive relationship between cwp and nupte but not nuteyield under irrigated conditions increasing n application tended to reduce the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp while irrigation increased the positive response of nupte to increasing cwp this also reflects the variation in the contributions of nupte and nuteyield to nueyield the observed difference in the contributions of nupte and nuteyield to nueyield may be due to the degree of water and nitrogen stress nuteyield reflects the capacity for grain yield production per unit of n uptake in our study nuteyield decreased significantly with increasing n application which is consistent with results of most studies that have found that improvements in nuteyield developed at the expense of lower grain n content as grain yield increased de oliveira silva et al 2020 ortiz monasterio et al 1997 hence further improvement in nuteyield by increasing yield and grain n content when n uptake levels are moderate may be an effective strategy to obtain higher cwp and nueyield simultaneously de oliveira silva et al 2020 4 3 interaction effects of irrigation and nitrogen on grain nitrogen accumulation there are two sources of grain nitrogen accumulation gna pre anthesis nitrogen translocation gnat and post anthesis nitrogen assimilation gnaa in this study gna gnat and gnaa increased with increasing n rate and decreased due to water stress gnat and gnaa were significantly reduced when water stress occurred especially under high n application consistent with findings of previous studies ercoli et al 2008 this may be because the plant n status changed plant tolerance to water stress the high n treatments were more sensitive to drought than the low fertilization treatments which could be explained by the lower water requirement due to the smaller transpiration area and larger volume of roots in the low n treatments in addition xu et al 2006 reported that moderate soil drought enhanced gnat thereby increasing the contribution of gnat to gna this could be because low and moderate water stress did not substantially alter the pattern of n accumulation in the grain as it has been shown that moderate soil drought does not severely disrupt n translocation through phloem phloem translocation is less susceptible to drought than is leaf photosynthesis yang and zhang 2006 in this study irrigation improved the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by simultaneously increasing gnat and gnaa with the increase of gnat being greater than that of gnaa these findings suggest that the improvement of n translocation at post anthesis and grain n accumulation played an important role in increasing nueyield 4 4 remaining challenges effective management of n and water in a wheat soil system to achieve high crop yield while maintaining desired resource use efficiencies depends on the dynamic match between n and water supply and crop demand crop et is a key element for estimating irrigation water requirements hence this study has examined effects of n fertilizer on soil water balance and crop water productivity and crop et was estimated indirectly with soil water balance including precipitation irrigation and changes in soil water storages nevertheless a reasonable irrigation schedule should be formulated according to precipitation crop demand for water soil water content and actual et accurate and direct measurement of crop et is essential for determination of crop water productivity in agricultural ecosystems in the future study in addition in this study the relationship between nueyield and cwp were built only at two irrigation conditions and three nitrogen levels this could limit the application of these relationship to other irrigation and n fertilizer conditions because different irrigation and nitrogen conditions could change the parameters of these relationships to build general and dynamic relationships between nueyield and cwp for precision management of n and irrigation further understanding the changes in the synergies between cwp and nueyield under various water and n patterns is critical in the future 5 conclusion n application and irrigation increased total crop water consumption 1 2 3 6 and 42 4 44 4 respectively but had different effects on the source of et increasing the n rate improved the soil water use 7 5 10 3 and reduced crop dependence on irrigation and precipitation whereas irrigation under a certain n rate reduced soil water utilization 54 4 57 8 both irrigation and n application significantly increased the water consumption amount wca water consumption percentage wcp and water consumption intensity wci especially during the anthesis maturity period there was a significant positive synergistic relationship between cwp and nueyield under different irrigation and nitrogen treatments for every 1 kg m 3 increase in cwp nueyield increased by 2 71 11 37 kg kg 1 depending on the n rate and water condition increasing the n rate reduced the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp while irrigation increased the positive response of nueyield to increasing cwp after decomposing nueyield into nitrogen uptake efficiency nupte and nitrogen utilization efficiency for yield nuteyield we found that the positive synergies between crop water productivity and nueyield was mainly due to the positive response of nupte but not nuteyield to crop water productivity irrigation increased the grain nitrogen accumulation efficiency by increasing both pre anthesis n translocation gnat and post anthesis n assimilation gnaa simultaneously but increasing gnat more substantially than gnaa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9384,precise nutrient diagnosis is the basis of accurate simulation of maize zea mays l grain yield and high efficient utilization of resources under the changing climate however the combined effects of supplementary irrigation and fertilizer application on plant stoichiometry of various maize cultivars in water limited and nutrient deficient regions are still poorly understood a three consecutive year field experiment 2015 2017 was conducted on two maize cultivars ql14 and zd958 in northwest china with two irrigation treatments rf rain fed and di drip irrigation and two fertilization treatments f0 no fertilization and f1 local fertilization practice the results showed that the radiation use efficiency for biomass yield of ql14 with fertilization under drip irrigation was increased by 7 39 than that of zd958 di 70 19 kg kg 1 and zd958 68 55 kg kg 1 obtained significantly higher physiological efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer than rf 59 52 kg kg 1 and ql14 61 17 kg kg 1 respectively both plant and grain n p ratios under f1 were higher than those under f0 ql14 had significantly higher grain n p ratio 4 64 than zd958 4 26 under dif1 grain yield was increased obviously when grain n p ratio and plant n k stoichiometry were greater than 4 0 and 1 2 respectively the newly released maize cultivar ql14 was highly recommended as forage and cereal crops since ql14 obtained significantly higher leaf and stem dry matter even under severe drought and low soil fertility conditions our study provides an opportunity to achieve high yielding maize systems in northwest china and maybe other regions with similar environments and the data will help inform policies and strategic plans for the effective use of water and fertilizer resources keywords supplementary irrigation grain n p ratio nutrient partitioning intercepted photosynthetically active radiation 1 introduction maize zea mays l is widely cultivated throughout the world due to its importance in human nutrition animal and poultry and also intervened in some industries such as chemical products biofuel and oil chen et al 2013 faloye et al 2019 in china maize production reached 273 million tons in 2021 which produced 24 2 of the global total http www fao org the guanzhong region is an important food producing area in china due to the high temperature and bright sunshine but it is also one of the water resources shortage areas in northwest china wu et al 2017 maize is mainly cultivated in arid and semi arid environments and always suffers from water scarcity and nutrient deficiency debaeke and aboudrare 2004 bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the low and erratic rainfall uneven rainfall distribution during the year and high evapotranspiration frequently result in an imbalance between crop water requirements and water supply ding et al 2019 zheng et al 2018b simultaneously high temperature and draught often accompany with maize sowing and silking which are harmful to maize seedling establishment and yield stability water turns to be an important input and the most dominant factor for achieving high and stable crop yields yang et al 2018 supplementary irrigation has the potential to stabilize maize production in areas with seasonal deficient rainfall by meeting maize water requirements liu et al 2015 yan et al 2022 besides drip irrigation has been shown to be an effective technology for enhancing water and nitrogen use efficiency increasing maize production and improving the sustainable agricultural development in regions with severe water shortages ibragimov et al 2007 kennedy et al 2013 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 therefore the efficient water use by drip irrigation in areas with limited rainfall should be considered for the purposes of saving water and guaranteeing maize growth and production in order to maximize crop yield nitrogen n should be in balance with other macronutrients such as phosphorus p and potassium k and analyzing plant nutrient stoichiometric ratios e g n p and n k ratios is a quite useful approach to understand these balances bƒÖk et al 2016 chen et al 2021 plant stoichiometry is a key measurement to investigate the variations of crop nutrients for a posteriori diagnostic of maize nutrition carciochi et al 2020a 2020b chen et al 2020 and nutrient uptake is a necessary mechanism of nutrient utilization in crops zhang et al 2018 both plant stoichiometry and nutrient uptake may yield new insights into plant nutrient limitations nutrient partitioning and plant responses to climate change elser et al 2010 gargallo garriga et al 2015 yan et al 2021 thereinto n is one of the main limiting factors for plant growth and ultimately for production gallais et al 2006 yang et al 2017 p is essential for various metabolic activities wang et al 2018 and k facilitates the photosynthetic process hafeez et al 2019 leite et al 2016 reported that higher nutrient content and more balanced plant n p 6 1 and plant n k 0 5 1 ratios were found in high yielding sugarcane systems previous researchers pointed out nutrient interactions synergistic or antagonistic can either enhance or reduce nutrient uptake and utilization bƒÖk et al 2016 therefore a better understanding of plant stoichiometry and establishing of relationships between nutrients concentrations in maize provide an important insight for plant nutrient diagnosis which is still a challenge for intensive agricultural development to meet the food demands of an increasing world population in the 21st century improving crop yield has become an ultimate goal of agricultural production which is more challenging under the changing climate smith et al 2018 rotili et al 2020 previous researchers have pointed out that the process of maize grain nitrogen absorption was strongly dependent upon the environmental conditions and genotype weiland and ta 1992 firstly among the environmental conditions solar radiation is one of the most important factors affecting crop yield plant dry matter accumulation depends on the quantity of solar radiation absorbed by canopy zhang et al 2019a the linear correlation was found between greenness and photosynthetically active radiation interception hatfield et al 1984 secondly together with choosing the right cultivar the optimization of nitrogen management could ensure both high grain dry matter and increased protein concentration in maize zhang et al 2020 the concentrations of certain elements in maize grain could be enhanced by optimizing the nitrogen application rate of maize guo et al 2019 therefore it is utterly necessary to explore the effects of supplemental irrigation and fertilization on the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation of different maize cultivars for promoting radiation use efficiency and choosing the right maize cultivar that better adapts to various nutritional and environmental conditions to date the combined effect of supplementary irrigation and fertilizer application on plant stoichiometry of various maize cultivars in water limited areas is still poorly understood this study was thus aimed to i reveal the critical plant stoichiometry that promotes the significant increase in grain yield and ii explore the adaptability of two maize cultivars to various environments for maximizing grain yield and high efficient utilization of resources under drought and low soil fertility conditions this study can help improve maize yield by nutrient elements diagnosis and assessing the reasonable range of nutrient elements for different maize cultivars in water limited areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a three consecutive year field experiment was conducted on maize from 2015 to 2017 at the key laboratory of

conditions during the three experimental seasons are shown in fig 1 daily air temperature followed the same trend over the three growing seasons which maintained a relatively high level from sowing to grain filling stage with daily maximum temperature greater than 30 c for 51 75 and 60 days respectively and it then gradually decreased from the silking stage to maturity daily solar radiation was averaged to 17 5 18 4 and 18 2 mj m 2 during the three seasons respectively the total precipitation during the maize growth season was 274 2 272 0 and 292 7 mm 67 9 40 6 and 83 2 of which occurred during flowering to maturity about august 1st september 30th during the three seasons respectively although the total seasonal precipitation in 2017 was greater than that in 2015 and 2016 the distribution of precipitation was uneven with precipitation lasting for 28 days at the reproductive growth stage the 2017 growing season was affected by a severe drought before flowering and suffered from excessive rainfall afterwards it should be mentioned that heavy rainfall events 48 7 and 64 4 mm occurred at the grain filling stage in 2015 and 2016 and the year of 2015 was characterized by normal rainfall distribution over the maize growing season 3 2 aboveground dry matter accumulation and grain yield dif1 achieved significantly high aboveground dry matter accumulation compared with the other treatments fig 2 p 0 05 the f0 treatments including rff0 and dif0 had lower aboveground dry matter accumulation the newly released maize cultivar of ql14 generally obtained greater aboveground dry matter accumulation than zd958 dry matter of grains was largest compared with those of the other organs except for rff1 and rff0 of both cultivars in 2016 the proportion of grains in total aboveground dry matter under rff1 dif1 rff0 and dif0 were 36 53 38 and 48 in zd958 and 39 48 39 and 44 in ql14 respectively in general ql14 produced greater grain yield than zd958 fig 3 the three year average grain yield under rff1 dif1 rff0 and dif0 were 3 89 10 57 2 68 and 3 91 mg ha 1 in zd958 and 5 59 11 21 3 44 and 4 35 mg ha 1 in ql14 irrigation i fertilization f cultivar c and

days after sowing in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the peak values of dif1 in the three years were 4 86 3 99 and 4 86 m2 m 2 in zd958 and 5 15 4 65 and 5 22 m2 m 2 in ql14 after the peaks lai declined steadily especially under f0 lai under dif1 decreased to 3 09 2 68 and 3 57 m2 m 2 in zd958 and 3 51 3 12 and 3 81 m2 m 2 in ql14 in the three years respectively lai under rff0 however decreased to 0 49 0 31 and 0 55 m2 m 2 in zd958 and 1 09 0 93 and 1 57 m2 m 2 in ql14 in the three years respectively 3 3 2 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and radiation use efficiency average ipar was greater in ql14 than in zd958 although it was not significantly different under dif1 table 1 p 0 05 the greatest and lowest ipar were obtained under dif1 in ql14 646 3 mj m 2 and under rff0 in zd958 472 4 mj m 2 respectively f1 increased ipar by 15 and 17 in zd958 by 13 and 14 in ql14 compared with f0 respectively di increased ipar by 10 and 8 in zd958 by 6 and 5 in ql14 compared with rf respectively the radiation use efficiency for grain yield ruegy under dif1 was significantly greater than that in the other three treatments in the three years table 1 p 0 05 ruegy was greatest under dif1 followed by dif0 in zd958 and rff1 in ql14 f1 increased ruegy by 19 and 55 in zd958 by 29 and 55 in ql14 compared with f0 respectively di increased ruegy by 59 and 26 in zd958 by 47 and 18 in ql14 compared with rf respectively regardless of the cultivars the radiation use efficiency for biomass yield rueby followed the order of dif1 rff1 dif0 rff0 but there was no significant difference between dif0 and rff0 table 1 p 0 05 f1 increased rueby by 26 and 45 in zd958 by 23 and 46 in ql14 compared with f0 respectively di increased rueby by 29 and 4 in zd958 by 31 and 4 in ql14 compared with rf respectively 3 4 nutrient n p and k accumulation the total n absorption in ql14 was greater than that in zd958 table 2 however the total n absorption of rf and di had significant differences under f1 regardless of cultivars the grain absorbed most n at maturity followed by the leaf stem and husk cob unlike n absorption the grain absorbed most p at maturity while the stem absorbed most k ql14 had significantly higher total p and k absorption than zd958 under rf based on the results of f value significance test irrigation fertilization cultivar and the interaction of irrigation and fertilization had significant effects on the n amount absorbed by each organ table 2 only fertilization had significant effect on p amount absorbed by each organ irrigation fertilization cultivar year and interaction between them affected p absorption of husk cob significantly fertilizer and cultivar had significant effects on k amount absorbed by each organ like p absorption irrigation fertilization cultivar year and the interaction between them affected k absorption of husk cob significantly 3 5 nutrient efficiency indexes only irrigation significantly affected npk harvest index nhi phi and khi and npk internal efficiency nie pie and kie table 3 p 0 05 fertilization only had significant effect on nie rf decreased npk harvest index and npk internal efficiency and lower values were obtained in 2016 than in 2015 and 2017 di 70 19 kg kg 1 and zd958 68 55 kg kg 1 had significantly higher physiological efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer npe than rf 59 52 kg kg 1 and ql14 61 17 kg kg 1 respectively fig 5 p 0 05 however there was no significant difference between npe in the three years 3 6 plant n p n k and grain n p stoichiometry rff1 and dif1 of ql14 obtained greater plant n p ratios and insignificantly higher plant n p ratios than rff1 of zd958 table 4 the plant n p ratios were greater under f1 than f0 however rf and di had no significant difference p 0 05 ql14 only had greater plant n p ratios than zd958 under dif1 conversely zd958 tended to have greater plant n k ratios than ql14 except under rff1 the average plant n k ratio of both zd958 and ql14 was greater than 1 2 under difi table 4 the plant n k ratios were greater under f1 than under f0 rf and di showed significant differences p 0 05 except for f0 in ql14 p 0 05 as for the average of grain n p ratio higher values were obtained under f1 than f0 there was no significant difference between rf and di p 0 05 ql14 had significantly higher grain n p ratios than zd958 only under dif1 p 0 05 maize yield was increased obviously when the grain n p ratio was greater than 4 fig 6 the relationships between grain n and p uptake under fertilized and unfertilized conditions were well fitted using the linear equations fig 7 3 7 relationships between aboveground dry matter npk accumulation intercepted photosynthetically active radiation plant n p n k and grain n p stoichiometry and grain yield the relationships between any two of grain yield gy dry matter dm intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar plant npk uptake nut put and kut plant n p plant n k and grain n p ratios were significant fig 8 p 0 01 specifically both grain yield and dry matter had extremely significant relationships with plant npk uptake p 0 01 ipar was significantly related to dry matter the relationship between plant n p and grain n p ratios was significantly positive p 0 01 4 discussion zhang et al 2020 demonstrated that high maize yield was mainly derived from high biomass accumulation an optimum lai representing the good crop production status allows maize to intercept and use solar radiation more efficiently xu et al 2017 it can be concluded that dif1 achieved the largest aboveground dry matter accumulation grain yield and rueby in this study which was consistent with previous studies proposing the advantages of drip irrigation and fertilization in promoting crop growth ierna and mauromicale 2018 sandhu et al 2019 li et al 2021 additionally except for the rain fed treatments in 2016 dry matter of grain at harvest was largest compared with those of the other organs a possible explanation for this might be that the failure of pollination after silking in maize occurred under the influence of long term drought in 2016 ql14 as a newly maize cultivar produced greater aboveground dry matter especially the ratio of the stem and leaf fig 2 grain yield and ipar previous studies revealed that genetic improvements have contributed greatly to increasing the grain yield of maize duvick 2005 or grain dry matter chen et al 2015 it has been widely accepted that both irrigation and fertilization can improve crops nutrient absorption especially npk bindraban et al 2020 similar results were also obtained in this study however drip irrigation helped maize plant absorb significantly more n and k than the rain fed treatment only under local fertilization practice it could be found that suitable fertilization was helpful for drip irrigation to play its role in promoting nutrient absorption furthermore compared to older cultivars newer ones maintained higher leaf n content at maturity chen et al 2015 and high grain protein concentration zhang et al 2020 the reasons were that maize cultivars had different n utilization and n allocation mechanisms to build photosynthetic organs chen et al 2014 yan et al 2014 the roots of ql14 with more carbohydrates had greater absorption capacity for accumulating more n besides bƒÖk et al 2016 found that maize grain yield was mainly determined by the total plant nitrogen accumulation plants that are not deficient in p and k are capable of resisting water deficit and low temperature bƒÖk et al 2016 plant nutrient stoichiometry can be a valuable tool for determining nutrient imbalances and detecting nutrient limitations ciampitti and vyn 2014 tamagno et al 2017 previous studies showed that plant n p ratio declined over time since the functional tissues had different proportions of nutrients kerkhoff et al 2006 greenwood et al 2008 tamagno et al 2017 b√©langer et al 2012 reported that increasing n fertilization not only increased grain n concentration but also improved the grain n p ratio at most site years when grain n p ratio was less than 4 the risk of maize grain yield reduction increased b√©langer et al 2012 mueller et al 2019 the most obvious finding to emerge from the correlation analysis was the significantly positive relationships among grain yield dry matter and plant npk uptake tamagno et al 2017 reported that plant n uptake was strongly related to p and k uptake and plant p uptake increased with yield in the present study strong positive correlations between plant n p ratio and grain n p ratio as well as ipar and dry matter were observed harvest indexes nhi phi and khi are the main variables that explained the yield to uptake for nutrients in maize which are often used to evaluate the nutrient partitioning in agricultural systems tamagno et al 2017 results of this study showed that irrigation had significant effects on harvest indexes but fertilization did not both irrigation and fertilization however affected n internal efficiency nie significantly the reason was that supplementary drip irrigation accelerated n remobilization from leaf at the late grain filling stage and reduced stem n allocation compared to the rain fed treatment gallais et al 2007 mueller et al 2019 moreover drip irrigation significantly increased physiological efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer npe in zd958 the reason may be that newer cultivar was better at accumulating a greater percent of applied n fertilizer especially under sufficient water application which was helpful for producing grain yield per unit of accumulated n more efficiently mueller et al 2019 5 conclusions the variation patterns of nutrient stoichiometry and partitioning as well as photosynthetic capacity of two maize cultivars under supplementary drip irrigation and fertilization were explored in this study the results showed that grain yield was increased obviously when the grain n p stoichiometry was greater than 4 0 there was a linear relationship between grain n and p uptake in fertilized and unfertilized conditions ql14 obtained significantly greater radiation use efficiency for biomass and plant n uptake than zd958 under both fertilization and drip irrigation conditions compared with zd958 ql14 was a more valuable maize cultivar of being promoted as forage or cereal crops since ql14 obtained significantly greater stem and leaf dry matter even under rain fed conditions further studies may focus on investigating the nutrient stoichiometry and partitioning based on soil water status and nutrient availability and the biochemical processes of different genotypes and regions under various agronomic strategies

to stabilize maize production in areas with seasonal deficient rainfall by meeting maize water requirements liu et al 2015 yan et al 2022 besides drip irrigation has been shown to be an effective technology for enhancing water and nitrogen use efficiency increasing maize production and improving the sustainable agricultural development in regions with severe water shortages ibragimov et al 2007 kennedy et al 2013 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 therefore the efficient water use by drip irrigation in areas with limited rainfall should be considered for the purposes of saving water and guaranteeing maize growth and production in order to maximize crop yield nitrogen n should be in balance with other macronutrients such as phosphorus p and potassium k and analyzing plant nutrient stoichiometric ratios e g n p and n k ratios is a quite useful approach to understand these balances bƒÖk et al 2016 chen et al 2021 plant stoichiometry is a key measurement to investigate the variations of crop nutrients for a posteriori diagnostic of maize nutrition carciochi et al 2020a 2020b chen et al 2020 and nutrient uptake is a necessary mechanism of nutrient utilization in crops zhang et al 2018 both plant stoichiometry and nutrient uptake may yield new insights into plant nutrient limitations nutrient partitioning and plant responses to climate change elser et al 2010 gargallo garriga et al 2015 yan et al 2021 thereinto n is one of the main limiting factors for plant growth and ultimately for production gallais et al 2006 yang et al 2017 p is essential for various metabolic activities wang et al 2018 and k facilitates the photosynthetic process hafeez et al 2019 leite et al 2016 reported that higher nutrient content and more balanced plant n p 6 1 and plant n k 0 5 1 ratios were found in high yielding sugarcane systems previous researchers pointed out nutrient interactions synergistic or antagonistic can either enhance or reduce nutrient uptake and utilization bƒÖk et al 2016 therefore a better understanding of plant stoichiometry and establishing of relationships between nutrients concentrations in maize provide an important insight for plant nutrient diagnosis which is still a challenge for intensive agricultural development to meet the food demands of an increasing world population in the 21st century improving crop yield has become an ultimate goal of agricultural production which is more challenging under the changing climate smith et al 2018 rotili et al 2020 previous researchers have pointed out that the process of maize grain nitrogen absorption was strongly dependent upon the environmental conditions and genotype weiland and ta 1992 firstly among the environmental conditions solar radiation is one of the most important factors affecting crop yield plant dry matter accumulation depends on the quantity of solar radiation absorbed by canopy zhang et al 2019a the linear correlation was found between greenness and photosynthetically active radiation interception hatfield et al 1984 secondly together with choosing the right cultivar the optimization of nitrogen management could ensure both high grain dry matter and increased protein concentration in maize zhang et al 2020 the concentrations of certain elements in maize grain could be enhanced by optimizing the nitrogen application rate of maize guo et al 2019 therefore it is utterly necessary to explore the effects of supplemental irrigation and fertilization on the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation of different maize cultivars for promoting radiation use efficiency and choosing the right maize cultivar that better adapts to various nutritional and environmental conditions to date the combined effect of supplementary irrigation and fertilizer application on plant stoichiometry of various maize cultivars in water limited areas is still poorly understood this study was thus aimed to i reveal the critical plant stoichiometry that promotes the significant increase in grain yield and ii explore the adaptability of two maize cultivars to various environments for maximizing grain yield and high efficient utilization of resources under drought and low soil fertility conditions this study can help improve maize yield by nutrient elements diagnosis and assessing the reasonable range of nutrient elements for different maize cultivars in water limited areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a three consecutive year field experiment was conducted on maize from 2015 to 2017 at the key laboratory of

conditions during the three experimental seasons are shown in fig 1 daily air temperature followed the same trend over the three growing seasons which maintained a relatively high level from sowing to grain filling stage with daily maximum temperature greater than 30 c for 51 75 and 60 days respectively and it then gradually decreased from the silking stage to maturity daily solar radiation was averaged to 17 5 18 4 and 18 2 mj m 2 during the three seasons respectively the total precipitation during the maize growth season was 274 2 272 0 and 292 7 mm 67 9 40 6 and 83 2 of which occurred during flowering to maturity about august 1st september 30th during the three seasons respectively although the total seasonal precipitation in 2017 was greater than that in 2015 and 2016 the distribution of precipitation was uneven with precipitation lasting for 28 days at the reproductive growth stage the 2017 growing season was affected by a severe drought before flowering and suffered from excessive rainfall afterwards it should be mentioned that heavy rainfall events 48 7 and 64 4 mm occurred at the grain filling stage in 2015 and 2016 and the year of 2015 was characterized by normal rainfall distribution over the maize growing season 3 2 aboveground dry matter accumulation and grain yield dif1 achieved significantly high aboveground dry matter accumulation compared with the other treatments fig 2 p 0 05 the f0 treatments including rff0 and dif0 had lower aboveground dry matter accumulation the newly released maize cultivar of ql14 generally obtained greater aboveground dry matter accumulation than zd958 dry matter of grains was largest compared with those of the other organs except for rff1 and rff0 of both cultivars in 2016 the proportion of grains in total aboveground dry matter under rff1 dif1 rff0 and dif0 were 36 53 38 and 48 in zd958 and 39 48 39 and 44 in ql14 respectively in general ql14 produced greater grain yield than zd958 fig 3 the three year average grain yield under rff1 dif1 rff0 and dif0 were 3 89 10 57 2 68 and 3 91 mg ha 1 in zd958 and 5 59 11 21 3 44 and 4 35 mg ha 1 in ql14 irrigation i fertilization f cultivar c and

days after sowing in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the peak values of dif1 in the three years were 4 86 3 99 and 4 86 m2 m 2 in zd958 and 5 15 4 65 and 5 22 m2 m 2 in ql14 after the peaks lai declined steadily especially under f0 lai under dif1 decreased to 3 09 2 68 and 3 57 m2 m 2 in zd958 and 3 51 3 12 and 3 81 m2 m 2 in ql14 in the three years respectively lai under rff0 however decreased to 0 49 0 31 and 0 55 m2 m 2 in zd958 and 1 09 0 93 and 1 57 m2 m 2 in ql14 in the three years respectively 3 3 2 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and radiation use efficiency average ipar was greater in ql14 than in zd958 although it was not significantly different under dif1 table 1 p 0 05 the greatest and lowest ipar were obtained under dif1 in ql14 646 3 mj m 2 and under rff0 in zd958 472 4 mj m 2 respectively f1 increased ipar by 15 and 17 in zd958 by 13 and 14 in ql14 compared with f0 respectively di increased ipar by 10 and 8 in zd958 by 6 and 5 in ql14 compared with rf respectively the radiation use efficiency for grain yield ruegy under dif1 was significantly greater than that in the other three treatments in the three years table 1 p 0 05 ruegy was greatest under dif1 followed by dif0 in zd958 and rff1 in ql14 f1 increased ruegy by 19 and 55 in zd958 by 29 and 55 in ql14 compared with f0 respectively di increased ruegy by 59 and 26 in zd958 by 47 and 18 in ql14 compared with rf respectively regardless of the cultivars the radiation use efficiency for biomass yield rueby followed the order of dif1 rff1 dif0 rff0 but there was no significant difference between dif0 and rff0 table 1 p 0 05 f1 increased rueby by 26 and 45 in zd958 by 23 and 46 in ql14 compared with f0 respectively di increased rueby by 29 and 4 in zd958 by 31 and 4 in ql14 compared with rf respectively 3 4 nutrient n p and k accumulation the total n absorption in ql14 was greater than that in zd958 table 2 however the total n absorption of rf and di had significant differences under f1 regardless of cultivars the grain absorbed most n at maturity followed by the leaf stem and husk cob unlike n absorption the grain absorbed most p at maturity while the stem absorbed most k ql14 had significantly higher total p and k absorption than zd958 under rf based on the results of f value significance test irrigation fertilization cultivar and the interaction of irrigation and fertilization had significant effects on the n amount absorbed by each organ table 2 only fertilization had significant effect on p amount absorbed by each organ irrigation fertilization cultivar year and interaction between them affected p absorption of husk cob significantly fertilizer and cultivar had significant effects on k amount absorbed by each organ like p absorption irrigation fertilization cultivar year and the interaction between them affected k absorption of husk cob significantly 3 5 nutrient efficiency indexes only irrigation significantly affected npk harvest index nhi phi and khi and npk internal efficiency nie pie and kie table 3 p 0 05 fertilization only had significant effect on nie rf decreased npk harvest index and npk internal efficiency and lower values were obtained in 2016 than in 2015 and 2017 di 70 19 kg kg 1 and zd958 68 55 kg kg 1 had significantly higher physiological efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer npe than rf 59 52 kg kg 1 and ql14 61 17 kg kg 1 respectively fig 5 p 0 05 however there was no significant difference between npe in the three years 3 6 plant n p n k and grain n p stoichiometry rff1 and dif1 of ql14 obtained greater plant n p ratios and insignificantly higher plant n p ratios than rff1 of zd958 table 4 the plant n p ratios were greater under f1 than f0 however rf and di had no significant difference p 0 05 ql14 only had greater plant n p ratios than zd958 under dif1 conversely zd958 tended to have greater plant n k ratios than ql14 except under rff1 the average plant n k ratio of both zd958 and ql14 was greater than 1 2 under difi table 4 the plant n k ratios were greater under f1 than under f0 rf and di showed significant differences p 0 05 except for f0 in ql14 p 0 05 as for the average of grain n p ratio higher values were obtained under f1 than f0 there was no significant difference between rf and di p 0 05 ql14 had significantly higher grain n p ratios than zd958 only under dif1 p 0 05 maize yield was increased obviously when the grain n p ratio was greater than 4 fig 6 the relationships between grain n and p uptake under fertilized and unfertilized conditions were well fitted using the linear equations fig 7 3 7 relationships between aboveground dry matter npk accumulation intercepted photosynthetically active radiation plant n p n k and grain n p stoichiometry and grain yield the relationships between any two of grain yield gy dry matter dm intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar plant npk uptake nut put and kut plant n p plant n k and grain n p ratios were significant fig 8 p 0 01 specifically both grain yield and dry matter had extremely significant relationships with plant npk uptake p 0 01 ipar was significantly related to dry matter the relationship between plant n p and grain n p ratios was significantly positive p 0 01 4 discussion zhang et al 2020 demonstrated that high maize yield was mainly derived from high biomass accumulation an optimum lai representing the good crop production status allows maize to intercept and use solar radiation more efficiently xu et al 2017 it can be concluded that dif1 achieved the largest aboveground dry matter accumulation grain yield and rueby in this study which was consistent with previous studies proposing the advantages of drip irrigation and fertilization in promoting crop growth ierna and mauromicale 2018 sandhu et al 2019 li et al 2021 additionally except for the rain fed treatments in 2016 dry matter of grain at harvest was largest compared with those of the other organs a possible explanation for this might be that the failure of pollination after silking in maize occurred under the influence of long term drought in 2016 ql14 as a newly maize cultivar produced greater aboveground dry matter especially the ratio of the stem and leaf fig 2 grain yield and ipar previous studies revealed that genetic improvements have contributed greatly to increasing the grain yield of maize duvick 2005 or grain dry matter chen et al 2015 it has been widely accepted that both irrigation and fertilization can improve crops nutrient absorption especially npk bindraban et al 2020 similar results were also obtained in this study however drip irrigation helped maize plant absorb significantly more n and k than the rain fed treatment only under local fertilization practice it could be found that suitable fertilization was helpful for drip irrigation to play its role in promoting nutrient absorption furthermore compared to older cultivars newer ones maintained higher leaf n content at maturity chen et al 2015 and high grain protein concentration zhang et al 2020 the reasons were that maize cultivars had different n utilization and n allocation mechanisms to build photosynthetic organs chen et al 2014 yan et al 2014 the roots of ql14 with more carbohydrates had greater absorption capacity for accumulating more n besides bƒÖk et al 2016 found that maize grain yield was mainly determined by the total plant nitrogen accumulation plants that are not deficient in p and k are capable of resisting water deficit and low temperature bƒÖk et al 2016 plant nutrient stoichiometry can be a valuable tool for determining nutrient imbalances and detecting nutrient limitations ciampitti and vyn 2014 tamagno et al 2017 previous studies showed that plant n p ratio declined over time since the functional tissues had different proportions of nutrients kerkhoff et al 2006 greenwood et al 2008 tamagno et al 2017 b√©langer et al 2012 reported that increasing n fertilization not only increased grain n concentration but also improved the grain n p ratio at most site years when grain n p ratio was less than 4 the risk of maize grain yield reduction increased b√©langer et al 2012 mueller et al 2019 the most obvious finding to emerge from the correlation analysis was the significantly positive relationships among grain yield dry matter and plant npk uptake tamagno et al 2017 reported that plant n uptake was strongly related to p and k uptake and plant p uptake increased with yield in the present study strong positive correlations between plant n p ratio and grain n p ratio as well as ipar and dry matter were observed harvest indexes nhi phi and khi are the main variables that explained the yield to uptake for nutrients in maize which are often used to evaluate the nutrient partitioning in agricultural systems tamagno et al 2017 results of this study showed that irrigation had significant effects on harvest indexes but fertilization did not both irrigation and fertilization however affected n internal efficiency nie significantly the reason was that supplementary drip irrigation accelerated n remobilization from leaf at the late grain filling stage and reduced stem n allocation compared to the rain fed treatment gallais et al 2007 mueller et al 2019 moreover drip irrigation significantly increased physiological efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer npe in zd958 the reason may be that newer cultivar was better at accumulating a greater percent of applied n fertilizer especially under sufficient water application which was helpful for producing grain yield per unit of accumulated n more efficiently mueller et al 2019 5 conclusions the variation patterns of nutrient stoichiometry and partitioning as well as photosynthetic capacity of two maize cultivars under supplementary drip irrigation and fertilization were explored in this study the results showed that grain yield was increased obviously when the grain n p stoichiometry was greater than 4 0 there was a linear relationship between grain n and p uptake in fertilized and unfertilized conditions ql14 obtained significantly greater radiation use efficiency for biomass and plant n uptake than zd958 under both fertilization and drip irrigation conditions compared with zd958 ql14 was a more valuable maize cultivar of being promoted as forage or cereal crops since ql14 obtained significantly greater stem and leaf dry matter even under rain fed conditions further studies may focus on investigating the nutrient stoichiometry and partitioning based on soil water status and nutrient availability and the biochemical processes of different genotypes and regions under various agronomic strategies
