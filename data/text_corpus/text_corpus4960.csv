24800,the campus s model was developed to simulate ground layer vegetation populations in forest ecosystems and their contribution to carbon and nitrogen dynamics the model uses several modeling techniques matrix l systems and cellular automata modeling the genetic species specific features are defined for each ontogenetic stage l systems while their implementation for certain individuals in the course of modeling depends on external conditions cellular automata to implement the variance of the transitions between ontogenetic stages the matrix modeling method is used the spatial resolution of the model is 1 cm2 and the time step is one month the model consists of two submodels a submodel of the plant populations structure and a submodel of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in plants and soil the space in the campus s model is heterogeneous the map of the microrelief is dynamically loaded from an external source according to which the temperature and the moisture of the soil are distributed across space during the simulation to implement the feedback mechanism between plants and soil integration with the romul hum model is performed keywords campus s model population dynamics dwarf shrubs cellular automata l systems matrix models 1 introduction the study of the development of plant populations has been of great interest to researchers throughout the history of mathematical modeling in ecology the mathematical models used in population ecology can be divided into different types on the basis of the mathematical methods used models can be distinguished based on differential equations difference models matrix models optimization models simulation models built on logical rules and simulating real life processes implemented as computer algorithms according to a component based approach and regression models representing functional relationships between input and output variables based on statistical approximations of empirical data and used at the stage of empirical statistical modeling jørgensen 2008 2016 according to the type of representation of space time and population elements the mathematical models used in ecology can be divided into discrete and continuous at present a large number of models of forest ecosystems of various types have been developed including efimod komarov et al 2003a 2007 mixfor olchev et al 2009 jabova botkin et al 1972 formix bossel and krieger 1991 iland seidl et al 2012 picus lexer hönninger 2001 mars baruth et al 2006 and others however in none of the models of forest ecosystems known to the authors the contribution of the vegetation of the forest ground vegetation to the cycle of biophilic elements is explicitly taken into account one of the reasons for this is the fact that the modeling of modular organisms capable of vegetative propagation to which most forest ground vegetation plants belong has a number of specific features in the case of the modeling of plants without vegetative propagation their populations are represented as a group of individuals spatially distributed in accordance with a specific pattern each element of such populations can grow reproduce itself and die at the same time elements of the population are not related to each other a clone may consist of several partial formations a genet or a ramet each of which contains all the organs necessary for separate living activity consideration of a clonal plant as a set of partial formations has been proposed harper and bell 1979 white 1979 sackville hamilton et al 1987 given that each of them has its own life cycle from birth to death moreover the distribution of plants across space is used to represent the growth of new partial formations such an approach has made it possible to move from modeling the spatial structure of a clone to modeling the spatial structure of a population of clonal plants oborny and bartha 1995 komarov et al 2003b as a result over the past three decades a large number of models of population dynamics of clonal plants have been developed tilman and kareiva 1997 czárán 1998 dieckmann et al 2000 berec 2002 komarov et al 2015 individual partial formations of clonal plants can be connected by stolons rhizomes or other structures and consequently exchange nutrients nutrient movements between partial formations in a clone can remarkably alter the spatial distribution of nutrients in soil shumway 1995 alpert 1996 many models have been developed that take into account interactions within and between clones comprising both those with an explicitly defined space oborny et al 2000 2001 herben and suzuki 2002 oborny and kun 2003 2004 magyar et al 2004 2007 koubek and herben 2008 mony et al 2011 komarov et al 2015 and those with an implicitly defined space chesson and peterson 2002 golubski et al 2008 comparing such models magori et al 2003 and crowley et al 2005 concluded that only models with an explicitly defined space are able to simultaneously take into account the interactions between partial formations that are close spatially and those that are close hierarchically in most of the models of forest ground vegetation populations mentioned above the plants did not differ in terms of their size age and so forth in some works the individual development of ramets was modeled as an increase in their size herben and suzuki 2002 tomlinson et al 2007 wildová et al 2007 gardner and mangel 1999 derived an optimal energy distribution graph by means of dynamic programming a common feature of these models is that partial formations can change over time and that the share of involvement of each partial formation into the constructive metabolism inside the unified network may vary depending not only on environmental factors but also on the internal stage of the partial formation itself clonal plants generally have a characteristic branching pattern the direction of the partial formations growth is not accidental but depends on both the species specific characteristics of the plant and the location of the neighboring partial formations in most species branching angles are relatively constant for example sandy sedge carex arenaria l grows straight without branching while giant salvinia salvinia adnata d mitch branches at angles close to 30 this feature is fundamental for modeling clonal plants bell and tomlinson 1980 1984 waller and steingraeber 1985 honda 1971 prusinkiewicz and lindenmayer 1990 although trees are often represented by three dimensional modeling honda 1971 perttunen 2009 olchev et al 2009 hallé et al 2012 the models of ground layer vegetation are mainly two dimensional as far as the authors know currently there are no models that allow clonal plants to be represented as three dimensional objects which is necessary to account for both the above and belowground parts of the plant for modeling clonal plants both spatially discrete lattice models silvertown et al 1992 oborny 1994a b winkler and fischer 2002 oborny and kun 2003 and models with continuous space cain et al 1996 herben and suzuki 2002 wong et al 2011 campillo and champagnat 2012 can be applied continuous space allows growth directions to be modeled much more accurately than its discrete counterpart rotation at any arbitrary angle is possible in continuous space while rotation in discrete space always contains an error resulting from the approximation in space partitioning in continuous space it is much more difficult to take into account the interactions of partial formations with one another as they are represented by arbitrarily allocated points in space law and dieckmann 2000 discrete models as a rule are based on the concept of cell colonization which simplifies the simulation of direct interactions between plants it is usually assumed that if a cell is occupied by one partial formation it becomes unavailable to another winkler and schmid 1995 oborny et al 2000 komarov et al 2015 the most detailed models can consider different branching schemes at different stages of development this feature is most often used in models designed to study single species populations cain 1990 piqueras and klimeš 1998 absolute calendar or relative ontogenetic age can be used as an individual s age when modeling the dynamics of plant populations the use of absolute age is convenient from the point of view of computational algorithms but it does not allow one to estimate the role of an individual in a population unlike animals plants have fixed positions and therefore they compensate for the impossibility of avoiding unfavorable conditions by the high rate of their development the development rate can be regarded as the time span necessary for morphological structures to form for example vegetative shoots or flowers this time span may vary even within the same plant species uranov 1975 plant coenopopulations 1976 therefore plants with a different absolute age can have the same role in population because of their similar ontogenetic stage evidence of why describing plant populations in terms of the ontogenetic stages of plants is more important than knowing their absolute age is presented in komarov et al 2003a modeling of the dynamics of plant populations with regard to their ontogenetic stages was first carried out by zhukova and komarov 1990 the method proved effective in spite of the advantages of using ontogenetic stages as proxies for relative age estimations as far as we know currently there are few models of forest ground vegetation population dynamics based on the concept of discrete description of plant ontogenesis with space represented implicitly logofet 2007 2019 2019 and with space represented explicitly zhukova and komarov 1990 komarov et al 2003 komarov et al 2015 at the same time these models do not allow the interactions between several populations to be simulated and do not take into account the species specific responses of plants to environmental conditions a large number of agroecosystem productivity models have been developed over time williams et al 1989 poluektov 2012 de vries and van laar 1982 the most detailed modeling of the production process of plants is implemented in the wofost family of models van diepen et al 1989 and in the ceres family of models hanks and ritchie 1991 these models allow the biomass increment of herbaceous cultivated plants to be described on the basis of detailed studies of the species specific features of photosynthesis however these models have several disadvantages that do not allow them to be used to model the ground layer vegetation of forest ecosystems first both of these models do not take into account not only the presence of forest litter but also the flow of litterfall at all since in agroecosystems the litter amount is greatly reduced due to biomass withdrawal second these models do not take into account the spatial structure of forest ground vegetation populations because in agroecosystems plants are placed according to a predetermined and usually regular pattern and there are no connections between individual plants the third and perhaps main reason for the impossibility of applying the abovementioned models is the lack of experimental data available with the required level of detail for plants not used in agriculture currently the best known model of forest plant productivity is 3 pg landsberg 1997 this model has a relatively small number of parameters but it makes it possible to assess the impact on the productivity of a complex of external factors air temperature and humidity soil moisture carbon dioxide concentration the amount of mineral nitrogen in soil etc the main advantage of this model is the ease of estimation of its parameters on the basis of experimental data as far as we know 3 pg and its modifications have yet not to be used to simulate the productivity of forest ground vegetation the distribution of biomass increment within a clone by concentration gradient is taken into account in magyar et al 2004 in addition one of the most important parameters of the distribution of biomass increment affecting the rate of decomposition of litterfall is the distribution of growth between organs fractions in each partial formation komarov et al 2013 this approach is used in models describing the dynamics of the tree layer of forest ecosystems komarov et al 2003 but the authors are unaware of models of forest ground vegetation in which this distribution is taken into account the main objective of this paper is to present an approach to construction of a model of the dynamics of forest ground vegetation populations based on the concept of a discrete description of plant ontogenesis which allows to evaluate the dynamics of biophilic elements in plant populations based on species specific features of photosynthesis in a hyper volume of environmental factors using a mass balanced approach model parameterization and validation for two species of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium as well as examples of the application of this model are presented in the second part of the paper frolov et al 2020 2 description of the campus s model 2 1 structure and features of the model the developed model campus s cellular automata model of plants united spread soil is an individual based and spatially explicit discrete simulation model the model combines several modeling techniques cellular automata ca modeling a stage of a cell depends on stages of neighboring cells matrix modeling transitions between ontogenetic stages are described using the modified leslie matrix caswell 2001 and the l systems technique modular development of a clone system a basic notion of the campus s model is that discrete space is represented as a two dimensional grid g i j i 1 n j 1 m unlike classical ca models in which a plant cannot occupy more than one cell the campus s allows a plant to have non zero size and a specific shape following its morphology moreover size and shape are not constant over a plant s life cycle but can change according to the species ontogeny pattern therefore the campus s model can be thought of as a ca model with complex transition rules however to avoid overcomplicating modeling by ca rules we treat the model as an individual based model first we specify the main object of the campus s model which represents a plant fig 1 as the model is intended to be able to treat a dynamics of population of clonal and seeds plants we use the term plant unit pu for either a partial formation i e a shoot together with a rhizome or for an individual plant in the model pu is given as a set of adjusted cells of two types aboveground part a aij and belowground part b bij where the range of indices i and j depends on the plant s morphology for details see section 2 below to be sufficiently realistic for many species of forest ground vegetation the spatial resolution of the campus s model should be no less than 1 1 cm in our simulation experiments we used a grid of size 1000 1000 cells although in our program it was limited only by computer capacity the time step of the model is 1 calendar month which is appropriate for representing all growth phases of plants age stages also need to be considered for the representation of plant development which in the model are based on ontogeny theory evstigneev and korotkov 2016 thus the pu can only be found at one of several species specific ontogenetic stages for which sets a and b should be specified each ontogenetic stage has its own duration and all transitions are described by the probabilistic transition matrix the campus s model consists of two interrelated blocks a a block for modeling the dynamics of plant populations population dynamics submodel based on a population ontogenetic concept and b a block for modeling the dynamics of biophilic elements carbon and nitrogen in forest ground vegetation production submodel based on an ecophysiological approach fig 2 the latter unit is dynamically linked to the model of soil organic matter dynamics romul hum komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b 2 1 1 environmental parameters for each cell illumination under the canopy is set with heterogeneity which is the output parameter of the efimod model komarov et al 2003 expressed in absolute values mol m 2 month 1 the initial amount of soil nitrogen is considered the same for each cell in the simulated area the spatial heterogeneity of soil temperature and moisture at the site is based on microrelief data within the range of variation using the equations 1 t x y t δ t 0 5 δ t λ x y where tx y is the temperature of the forest floor in cell x y t is the average forest floor temperature for the current month δt is the forest floor temperature variation in the simulated area as a portion of t and λx y is the relative height of the cell x y ranging between 0 the lowest point of the site and 1 the highest point where the spatial distribution of soil moisture is simulated as follows 2 w x y w δ w 0 5 δ w 1 λ x y where wx y is the volumetric moisture of the forest floor in cell x y w is the average forest floor volumetric moisture for the current month and δw is the relative variation as portion of w of the forest floor volumetric moisture in the simulated area in the absence of actual microrelief data the spatial distribution is generated by applying the two dimensional interpolation assuming the cells containing stem bases as highest points λ 1 and intercrown areas as lowest points λ 0 after obtaining the patterns of spatial heterogeneity of temperature moisture and illumination at the site the model distributes a given number of genets of all simulated plant species in a stage of seed across the simulation plot the distribution of seeds is random here and below the random distributions and numbers refer to those obtained using the mersenne twister a 623 dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudo random number generator matsumoto and nishimura 1998 the length of the growing season is calculated on the basis of climate data for 12 months starting in january as the number of months with an average monthly forest floor temperature above 5 c for deciduous species and 0 c for evergreen species air temperature is usually used to determine the length of the growing season but the forest floor temperature in terms of monthly averages does not significantly differ from the air temperature for the period with temperatures above 0 bykhovets ans komarov 2002 this makes it possible to apply the soil climate data used in the soil organic matter dynamics model romul hum komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b instead of meteorological data to estimate the duration of the vegetative period 2 2 single step of the campus s model a single step of the model consists of several sub routines 2 2 1 maturing an increase in age is performed for each pu at the same time both absolute and relative age the duration of an individual s stay in a given ontogenetic stage increase by the value reciprocal to the duration of the growing season for example if the growing season is 5 months the age will be increased by 0 2 the use of portions of the growing season instead of months owes to differences in the terminology adopted by various researchers indeed in some papers when describing ontogenesis a year assumes a calendar year while in other studies the same word refers to the vegetation period additionally this approach allows simulation of the population dynamics of species with a broad geographic range growing at different latitudes when the pu reaches the relative age equal to the duration of the current ontogenetic stage the probability of transitioning to another ontogenetic stage is calculated in accordance with the transition matrix if the pu has already remained in the current ontogenetic stage the probability of maintaining the current ontogenetic stage decreases by the value of ϱ eq 3 and the non zero probability of transitioning to the subsequent ontogenetic stage increases by the same value 3 ϱ δ δ e s t where ϱ is the value defining the decrease of the probability of staying in current ontogenetic stage and consequently the increase of the probability of transitioning to the next stage with non zero probability of transition δ is the probability of remaining in the current ontogenetic stage and st is the number of times the pu remained in the current ontogenetic stage when the switching of pu to another ontogenetic stage occurs its relative age is reset to zero 2 2 2 dying off at this sub routine the probability of death of the entire pu or a part of it is checked and various conditions leading to the death are simulated the pu dies off entirely when any of the following conditions are met a the generated random number in a range from 0 to 1 is less than the species specific probability of death for the current ontogenetic stage simulation of accidental death b the age of the pu reaches the maximum life expectancy the sum of the durations of all ontogenetic stages for the given species simulation of death due to natural aging c the pu twice turns into a senile ontogenetic stage simulation of death due to low viability or d the pu occupies an area that is 10 times less than the potential area for a given ontogenetic stage simulation of death when resources are limited including a resource limitation due to competition with other pus the dying off of individual parts of the pu occurs in accordance with the ontogenesis scheme or when the monthly average moisture content of the forest floor in the cell falls outside the species tolerance limits with the death of all parts of the pu it is considered to be dead entirely when the pu or its part dies off the entire stock of carbon and nitrogen belonging to it moves to litterfall 2 2 3 growth and cloning growth is simulated for each pu after performing the two previous sub routines increasing age and mortality if the plant growth direction is yet to be chosen the first step after the formation of the pu it is done so randomly the coordinates of each occupied cell relative to the cell in which the pu was originally populated take one of 8 possible values of dir x y x y x y x y y x y x y x y x where x y are coordinates of the corresponding cell in the ontogenesis scheme the chosen growth direction is preserved for further spreading under the condition that there are no gaps in the ontogenetic stages skipped ontogenetic stages of the pu the coordinates of cells into which it can potentially spread during the current step are calculated using the following equation 4 x y n e w x y b a s e d i r where x y new are the coordinates of the cell whose occupation is potentially possible x y base are the initial coordinates of the pu and dir are the coordinates of the cells corrected in accordance with the previously calculated direction in which spreading may be possible in accordance with the scheme of ontogenesis of the given species occupation of the selected cells by the pu is possible only if two conditions are met the first is that the selected cell must be potentially accessible i e due to the absence of large stones tree trunks etc at a given point of the plot the second condition is that the monthly mean values of volumetric moisture of the forest floor and the light intensity in the selected cell should not fall outside the species tolerance range in addition to the basic conditions listed above any of the following additional conditions must be fulfilled for spreading into the cell a the selected cell is not occupied by another pu b the selected cell is occupied only by the underground part of another pu and c another pu is located in the selected cell but its replacement is possible based on the calculated probability of displacement prep when calculating the probability of displacement the coefficient of optimality of conditions in the cell for which competition occurs and the energy consumption efficiency indices δvit of both pus are taken into account 5 p r e p 1 v i t 0 5 δ v i t 0 5 where ʊ is the priority of the displacing species over being displaced with equal ontogenetic stages and δvit is the energy efficiency index difference zhivotovsky 2001 between displacing and displaced partial formation if the generated random number 0 1 is less than the prep value the pu that previously occupied the cell is displaced simulation of interspecific competition 2 2 4 seed reproduction if the pus in the generative stage are presented on the plot the seeds of the corresponding species in the amount of ͼ are populated in random cells 6 c c 0 g c o u n t where c 0is the average number of seeds produced by one partial formation per year and gcount is the number of generative individuals the survival of seeds is possible only in free cells with environmental conditions that are within the species range of tolerance the probability of seed death βse is also taken into account 2 2 5 biomass increment calculation for each pu the amount of available par is calculated taking into account the area occupied by its aboveground part potential biomass increment is calculated using the michaelis menten equation taking into account losses due to respiration 7 n p p p o t p m a x p a r k m p a r p m a x 0 47 where pmax is the maximum possible photosynthetic rate for the given species par is the amount of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the pu km is the light intensity at which the photosynthesis rate is equal to half of the maximum and 0 47 is the constant characterizing losses for respiration seidl et al 2012 the growth is limited by a complex of environmental factors hence the growth response in the current month to the monthly average values of each of three environmental factors forest floor temperature volumetric moisture and the amount of nitrogen available per pu is calculated to calculate the particular functions of the response of the biomass increment to environmental factors the formula proposed by shabanov 1973 and corresponding to the pearson s type i distribution is applied 8 f φ φ φ m i n φ o p t φ m i n ε φ o p t φ m i n φ m a x φ φ m a x φ o p t ε φ m a x φ o p t where f φ is the relative photosynthetic rate at the current value of factor φ φmin is the minimal necessary value for photosynthesis of factor φ φopt is the value of factor φ at which the photosynthetic rate is maximal φmax is the maximal possible value for photosynthesis of factor φ ε is the parameter determining the rate of change of the intensity of photosynthesis when the value of factor φ is amended to assess the joint effects of several environmental factors it is necessary to take into account the interaction of all of the simulated environmental factors to this end we introduce the concept of the coefficient of optimality of conditions which determines the ratio of the actual photosynthetic rate in these conditions to the maximal possible value of photosynthesis this ratio tends to be calculated in one of three ways first liebig s law can be used liebig 1840 poletaev 1979 komarov et al 2003 9 f y 1 y n min y 1 y n where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn second the multiplication of the particular response functions can be used rodrigo et al 1997 antonopoulos 1999 paul et al 2003 10 f y 1 y n y 1 y n where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn third the harmonic mean of the particular response functions can be used stange 2007 11 f y 1 y n n i 1 n 1 y i where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn and n is the number of environmental factors taken into account however all of these methods have essential drawbacks in the case of liebig s law only the environmental factor is taken into account whose response function has a minimal value its contribution is taken as 1 while other factors are ignored their contribution is taken as 0 in the case of the multiplication of the partial response functions the contributions of all factors are considered as equal consequently if the number of factors tends to infinity the volume of the fundamental niche of the species will tend to 0 which is contrary to modern ideas about the ecological niches of plant species in the case of using of the harmonic mean the contribution of each factor is taken into account but the result of this function is greater than the value of the partial response function to the factor that has the strongest effect this approach is contrary to liebig s law taking into account the above advantages and disadvantages of the existing methods used to calculate the combined influence of several environmental factors a function f y1 yn can be constructed where y1 yn are particular functions of responses to these factors when constructing the formula the following conditions are taken into account 0 f y1 yn 1 if 0 y1 yn 1 f y1 yn min y1 yn f y1 yn must take into account the contribution of each factor to the total impact the constructed function is shown below 12 f y 1 y n a min y 1 y n 1 a y 1 y n where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn and a is the parameter determining the contribution of the factor the response function to which has a minimal value thus this function combines the approaches to the calculation of the coefficient of optimality of conditions on the basis of liebig s law and on the basis of the multiplication of the partial response functions a comparison of the four approaches considered for modeling the joint influence of several environmental factors is presented in fig 3 the actual biomass increment of the pu is calculated as the multiplication of the potential biomass increment and the value of the generalized response function for the simulated environmental factors eq 13 13 i n c m o n t h n p p p o t f t w n where npppot is the potential biomass increment of a given pu and f t w n is the proposed generalized photosynthetic rate response function to the temperature of the forest floor t the volumetric moisture of the forest floor w and the nitrogen amount in the forest floor available to the pu n 2 2 6 distribution of biomass increment the calculated biomass increment of the pu is distributed between the organs of the plant fractions of biomass when the plant organs reach maximum biomass in each growing season the ratio between the biomass of fractions should be maintained in accordance with the distribution of their ranks 14 y i k a k b i where yi is the portion of the mass of the organ in the total mass of the plant i is the organ rank the greater the rank of the organ the smaller the mass attributable to it ka is the coefficient numerically equal to the portion of the organ with a rank of 0 in the total mass of the plant and kb is the empirical coefficient determining the rate of decrease of an organ mass with an increase of its rank at the same time this ratio does not need to be maintained every month as different fractions of plant biomass do not increase and fall simultaneously to comply with both the annual and the monthly distribution we use the following technique for each month a pseudo annual increment of the first approximation is calculated under the assumption that the increments in each month during the growing season will be equal to the increment in the current month 15 i n c p s 1 i i n c m o n t h i l v e g where incps 1 is the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation and lveg is the duration of the growing season the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation is summed with the already existing biomass and the resulting biomass is distributed to the organs 16 m p s i m i n c y e a r k a k b i where mps i is the first approximation mass of the organ i m is the total mass of the pu incyear is the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation and ka kb are the empirical coefficients eq 14 based on the calculated first approximation mass of organs a pseudo annual litterfall is calculated taking into account the fact that the litterfall rate the portion of the organ going to litter during a certain time span of different organs varies 17 f a l l p s i m i n 1 12 f p θ where fallps i is the pseudo annual litterfall of the organ i mi is the first approximation mass of the organ i and fpθ is the litterfall rate of the organ i the pseudo annual increment of the second approximation is considered as the sum of the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation and the pseudo annual litterfall 18 i n c p s 2 i i n c p s 1 i f a l l p s i where incps 2 i is the pseudo annual increment of the second approximation of the organ i incps 1 i is the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation of the organ i and fallps i is the pseudo annual litterfall of the organ i to calculate the actual monthly biomass increments of certain fractions the pseudo annual increments of the second approximation of individual organs are multiplied by the portion of the organ biomass increment in the current month in the case of a discrepancy between the obtained amount of monthly increments of individual fractions and the monthly increment of the entire pu the following adjustment is made 19 i n c m o n t h i i n c p s 2 i η i i n c p s 2 i η i i n c m o n t h where incmonth i is the biomass increment of the organ i in the current month incps 2 i is the pseudo annual increment of the second approximation of the organ i ηi is the portion of the biomass increment of the organ i in the current month in relation to the annual value and incmonth is the increment of the biomass of the pu in the current month in this case compliance with the ratios of monthly increments of biomass fractions and the distribution of annual increments of the biomass of organs is achieved 2 2 7 calculation of nitrogen content for each pu the amount of consumed nitrogen is calculated as the sum of the products of biomass increments of certain organs by the nitrogen concentrations within them in this case the amount of nitrogen consumed by the pu will always be less than or equal to the amount of available nitrogen content in the forest floor in a given cell as this parameter is one of the limiting factors in the calculation of the biomass increment further the amount of consumed nitrogen is summed with the amount of already existing nitrogen in the plant eq 20 20 n i n i 0 n 0 i i n c i κ i 100 where ni is the nitrogen content in the organ i inci is the biomass increment of the organ i in the current month and κi is the nitrogen concentration in the organ i n i 0 is the nitrogen already existing in the plant 2 2 8 calculation of litterfall mass for each pu the mass of litterfall is calculated for each organ if dying off occurs uniformly throughout the growing season θ 1 the litterfall mass is calculated as follows 21 m f a l l i m i l v e g where mfall i is the mass of litterfall of the organ i mi is the biomass of the organ i and lveg is the duration of the growing season if organ litterfall occurs at the end of the growing season θ 2 which is usually used for leafage the litterfall is considered to be equal to the organ biomass for deciduous plants while for evergreen plants the litterfall rate is set as reciprocal of the lifespan of a given organ if the litterfall of the organ occurs only at the dieback of certain parts of the plant during ontogenesis θ 0 the litterfall mass is considered to be equal to 0 the nitrogen content in the litterfall is considered as the multiplication of the mass of the organ litterfall and the nitrogen content in the litterfall if concentrations of nitrogen in a living organ and litterfall do not coincide for example the nitrogen concentration in leaf litterfall may be less than the concentration of nitrogen in a living organ resorption occurs the resorbed nitrogen defined by the difference between the nitrogen content in the living organ and in the litterfall is distributed evenly between the organs the litterfall of which occurs only when individual parts of the plant die off during ontogenesis θ 0 2 2 9 modeling of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in soil to implement the feedback mechanism between plants and soil the campus s model is integrated with the romul hum model komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b the romul hum model describes the mineralization and humification of litter and organic matter in soil as well as carbon dioxide emissions and nitrogen release in mineral forms accessible to plants resulting from the above processes the rate of mineralization and humification in the model depends on the chemical properties of litter the temperature and the volumetric moisture of litter and soil mineral horizons the main feature of the model is that it describes the process of transformation of soil organic matter separately for forest litter and upper mineral soil horizons another important feature of the model is that its coefficients are determined during laboratory experiments regarding the decomposition of different types of litter under controlled conditions as well as in the analysis of other published data chertov 1985 nadporozhskaya 2000 nadporozhskaya et al 2000 komarov et al 2007 the initial values of soil organic matter pools and nitrogen content in these pools are read from the input file when the campus s model is initialized temperature and volumetric moisture of litter and mineral soil at 20 cm depth as well as the amount of incoming aboveground and subsurface litter i e leaves stems rhizomes and fine roots each with their own nitrogen content are transferred from each cell of the campus s model to the romul hum model the output variables of the model are data on pools of soil organic matter and nitrogen as well as carbon dioxide emissions from soil and nitrogen release in forms available to plants the last parameter is passed back to the cell of the campus s model and is used by plants at the next step a schematic block diagram of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in the romul hum model is presented in fig 4 3 example of application due to the large number of interrelated parameters of the model this paper does not provide an analysis of the sensitivity of campus s but rather offers an example of an experiment to demonstrate the features that fundamentally distinguish campus s from other models a a comprehensive approach to modeling the population structure and the productivity of plants for various environmental conditions and b high spatial resolution which allows the dynamics of plant populations of different life forms to be modeled these features of the model can be better manifested in one but complex experiment rather than in several separate ones to conduct the experiment two species of plants of different life forms were selected one of them was a clonal long rhizome plant capable of vegetative propagation the other was a non clonal plant with only seed propagation the ability of a clonal plant to reproduce via seeds was not taken into account in order to exclude the influence of differences in pu sizes on the experimental results the projection area of both the aboveground and underground parts was the same for all ontogenetic stages fig 5 the daughter pu of the clonal plant had a juvenile ontogenetic stage the number of seeds of a non clonal species and the daughter pu of a clonal one were taken as equal 12 seeds each the duration of each ontogenetic stage of both species was equal to one vegetative period the transition matrices between the ontogenetic stages of both species were the same and realized only sequential transitions each stage to the next the production characteristics of both species and their ecological niches were the same both species were deciduous thus the differences between the modeled species were only in the patterns of pu growth during ontogenesis the simulated territory was represented by a square lattice measuring 25 25 m with a cell of 1 1 cm at the time of the beginning of the simulation the space was homogeneous in terms of temperature humidity illumination and soil richness the parameter values of all environmental factors corresponded to the ecological optimum of both species seeds of each species in an amount of 100 pcs m 2 were randomly distributed on the grid such conditions rendered it possible to demonstrate the population dynamics invasion rate and biomass dynamics of the simulated species under equal initial conditions and taking into account intra and interspecific competition modeling was carried out for 200 years with a monthly step at the 1200th step corresponding to the 100th year the heterogeneity of space was introduced by the soil moisture factor moisture in blocks of cells measuring 5 5 cm located in chess order was decreased by 30 but remained within both species tolerance range this experimental design allowed us to evaluate the influence of both environmental factors and spatial growth patterns on pu productivity the experimental results showed that under homogeneous environmental conditions there was a synchronism in the dynamics of cover population density and biomass of simulated species fig 6 both within the same species and between different species the values of these parameters reached a stationary level by the 300th step of modeling i e in 25 years for both species which could be explained by the equal durations of ontogenetic stages for both species further periodic fluctuations in cover and population density were associated with the synchronism of the pu life cycle this synchronism was due to the use of transition matrices implementing only sequential transitions between ontogenetic stages more significant biomass fluctuations in comparison with abundance and projective cover were associated with annual litterfall of 100 of leaves at the end of the growing season the values of cover population density and biomass of simulated species plateaued at different levels the larger values of cover population density and biomass of the clonal plant species could be explained by the fact that due to vegetative propagation the formation of loci of the territory held by this species around the maternal pu occurred similar dynamics have been observed in populations of real plant species in natural conditions zhukova and komarov 1990 with the occurrence of heterogeneous territory the dynamics of the cover and population density of both species did not change this was due to the fact that the changed soil moisture conditions remained within both species tolerance range and therefore did not lead to the death of the pus conversely a change in the dynamics of the biomass of both species was observed the biomass of the population of the clonal species was reduced by 5 10 and by more than 70 in the non clonal species such a discrepancy in the biomass dynamics of the simulated species under heterogeneous environmental conditions can be explained by the fact that despite having the same projection area the pu of clonal species was less compact in this regard the probability that all parts of one pu of a clonal plant species would be in an area with low humidity was lower than that of a more compact non clonal species due to the fact that plants consume soil water from the entire area on which the underground organs are presented as well as due to the flow of water and nutrients within the clone the clonal species reacted more weakly to changes in environmental conditions this experiment has allowed us to demonstrate the influence of the spatial structure of plants to assess not only the dynamics of cover and population density but also the biomass of plant populations of different life forms differences in cover and population density as well as changes in the biomass dynamics of populations of simulated species cannot be predicted without taking into account the spatial structure of the population as they do not differ in other parameters such as the duration of ontogenetic stages the probability of transitions between them ecological niches and production characteristics thus this experiment shows both the possibilities of applying the campus s model in biological and ecological studies and the advantages of combining the techniques of cellular automata matrix modeling l systems and mass balance approach over using only one modeling technique 4 conclusion the developed campus s model is a universal tool for simulating the population dynamics of any plant species as well as the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in multi species communities of forest ground vegetation regardless of life forms this is because its algorithms are based on the basic principles of development of individuals during ontogenesis enabling the model to reproduce the mechanisms of photosynthesis and biomass production common to all vascular plants the developed model has the following application possibilities investigation of interactions between individuals in populations research into competitive interactions between populations in a community depending on morphological rhythmological and other types of developmental variations estimation of the rate of occupation of a territory by plant populations depending on environmental conditions such as humidity soil fertility and illumination assessment of the distribution and productivity of populations under steady state conditions and in a changing environment evaluation of the response of populations to anthropogenic recreation logging ground fires etc and zoogenic influences estimation of the contribution of forest ground vegetation to the turnover of biophilic elements carbon and nitrogen in forest ecosystems under different environmental conditions the model has flexible settings that facilitate its parameterization for different plant species of the grass shrub layer and its subsequent integration into the system of forest ecosystem models capable of simulating the joint dynamics of stand ground layer vegetation and soil pools of biophilic elements despite of its versatile and flexible structure the campus s model has some limitations 1 the impossibility of model application for areas in which the leading limiting factor of plants growth is an availability of biophilic elements other than nitrogen additional response functions should be added in such case 2 due to the fact that the model does not take into account the layering of forest ground vegetation the results of its calculations may not be accurate for areas in which the layering of forest ground vegetation is conspicuous due to the lack of sub routine simulating the light transmittance through the layers of forest ground vegetation 3 the campus s model does not take into account the effect of carbon dioxide concentration on the productivity of forest ground vegetation which can lead to underestimation of plant biomass when modeling climate change scenarios credit authorship contribution statement pavel frolov conceptualization methodology software validation visualization writing

24800,the campus s model was developed to simulate ground layer vegetation populations in forest ecosystems and their contribution to carbon and nitrogen dynamics the model uses several modeling techniques matrix l systems and cellular automata modeling the genetic species specific features are defined for each ontogenetic stage l systems while their implementation for certain individuals in the course of modeling depends on external conditions cellular automata to implement the variance of the transitions between ontogenetic stages the matrix modeling method is used the spatial resolution of the model is 1 cm2 and the time step is one month the model consists of two submodels a submodel of the plant populations structure and a submodel of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in plants and soil the space in the campus s model is heterogeneous the map of the microrelief is dynamically loaded from an external source according to which the temperature and the moisture of the soil are distributed across space during the simulation to implement the feedback mechanism between plants and soil integration with the romul hum model is performed keywords campus s model population dynamics dwarf shrubs cellular automata l systems matrix models 1 introduction the study of the development of plant populations has been of great interest to researchers throughout the history of mathematical modeling in ecology the mathematical models used in population ecology can be divided into different types on the basis of the mathematical methods used models can be distinguished based on differential equations difference models matrix models optimization models simulation models built on logical rules and simulating real life processes implemented as computer algorithms according to a component based approach and regression models representing functional relationships between input and output variables based on statistical approximations of empirical data and used at the stage of empirical statistical modeling jørgensen 2008 2016 according to the type of representation of space time and population elements the mathematical models used in ecology can be divided into discrete and continuous at present a large number of models of forest ecosystems of various types have been developed including efimod komarov et al 2003a 2007 mixfor olchev et al 2009 jabova botkin et al 1972 formix bossel and krieger 1991 iland seidl et al 2012 picus lexer hönninger 2001 mars baruth et al 2006 and others however in none of the models of forest ecosystems known to the authors the contribution of the vegetation of the forest ground vegetation to the cycle of biophilic elements is explicitly taken into account one of the reasons for this is the fact that the modeling of modular organisms capable of vegetative propagation to which most forest ground vegetation plants belong has a number of specific features in the case of the modeling of plants without vegetative propagation their populations are represented as a group of individuals spatially distributed in accordance with a specific pattern each element of such populations can grow reproduce itself and die at the same time elements of the population are not related to each other a clone may consist of several partial formations a genet or a ramet each of which contains all the organs necessary for separate living activity consideration of a clonal plant as a set of partial formations has been proposed harper and bell 1979 white 1979 sackville hamilton et al 1987 given that each of them has its own life cycle from birth to death moreover the distribution of plants across space is used to represent the growth of new partial formations such an approach has made it possible to move from modeling the spatial structure of a clone to modeling the spatial structure of a population of clonal plants oborny and bartha 1995 komarov et al 2003b as a result over the past three decades a large number of models of population dynamics of clonal plants have been developed tilman and kareiva 1997 czárán 1998 dieckmann et al 2000 berec 2002 komarov et al 2015 individual partial formations of clonal plants can be connected by stolons rhizomes or other structures and consequently exchange nutrients nutrient movements between partial formations in a clone can remarkably alter the spatial distribution of nutrients in soil shumway 1995 alpert 1996 many models have been developed that take into account interactions within and between clones comprising both those with an explicitly defined space oborny et al 2000 2001 herben and suzuki 2002 oborny and kun 2003 2004 magyar et al 2004 2007 koubek and herben 2008 mony et al 2011 komarov et al 2015 and those with an implicitly defined space chesson and peterson 2002 golubski et al 2008 comparing such models magori et al 2003 and crowley et al 2005 concluded that only models with an explicitly defined space are able to simultaneously take into account the interactions between partial formations that are close spatially and those that are close hierarchically in most of the models of forest ground vegetation populations mentioned above the plants did not differ in terms of their size age and so forth in some works the individual development of ramets was modeled as an increase in their size herben and suzuki 2002 tomlinson et al 2007 wildová et al 2007 gardner and mangel 1999 derived an optimal energy distribution graph by means of dynamic programming a common feature of these models is that partial formations can change over time and that the share of involvement of each partial formation into the constructive metabolism inside the unified network may vary depending not only on environmental factors but also on the internal stage of the partial formation itself clonal plants generally have a characteristic branching pattern the direction of the partial formations growth is not accidental but depends on both the species specific characteristics of the plant and the location of the neighboring partial formations in most species branching angles are relatively constant for example sandy sedge carex arenaria l grows straight without branching while giant salvinia salvinia adnata d mitch branches at angles close to 30 this feature is fundamental for modeling clonal plants bell and tomlinson 1980 1984 waller and steingraeber 1985 honda 1971 prusinkiewicz and lindenmayer 1990 although trees are often represented by three dimensional modeling honda 1971 perttunen 2009 olchev et al 2009 hallé et al 2012 the models of ground layer vegetation are mainly two dimensional as far as the authors know currently there are no models that allow clonal plants to be represented as three dimensional objects which is necessary to account for both the above and belowground parts of the plant for modeling clonal plants both spatially discrete lattice models silvertown et al 1992 oborny 1994a b winkler and fischer 2002 oborny and kun 2003 and models with continuous space cain et al 1996 herben and suzuki 2002 wong et al 2011 campillo and champagnat 2012 can be applied continuous space allows growth directions to be modeled much more accurately than its discrete counterpart rotation at any arbitrary angle is possible in continuous space while rotation in discrete space always contains an error resulting from the approximation in space partitioning in continuous space it is much more difficult to take into account the interactions of partial formations with one another as they are represented by arbitrarily allocated points in space law and dieckmann 2000 discrete models as a rule are based on the concept of cell colonization which simplifies the simulation of direct interactions between plants it is usually assumed that if a cell is occupied by one partial formation it becomes unavailable to another winkler and schmid 1995 oborny et al 2000 komarov et al 2015 the most detailed models can consider different branching schemes at different stages of development this feature is most often used in models designed to study single species populations cain 1990 piqueras and klimeš 1998 absolute calendar or relative ontogenetic age can be used as an individual s age when modeling the dynamics of plant populations the use of absolute age is convenient from the point of view of computational algorithms but it does not allow one to estimate the role of an individual in a population unlike animals plants have fixed positions and therefore they compensate for the impossibility of avoiding unfavorable conditions by the high rate of their development the development rate can be regarded as the time span necessary for morphological structures to form for example vegetative shoots or flowers this time span may vary even within the same plant species uranov 1975 plant coenopopulations 1976 therefore plants with a different absolute age can have the same role in population because of their similar ontogenetic stage evidence of why describing plant populations in terms of the ontogenetic stages of plants is more important than knowing their absolute age is presented in komarov et al 2003a modeling of the dynamics of plant populations with regard to their ontogenetic stages was first carried out by zhukova and komarov 1990 the method proved effective in spite of the advantages of using ontogenetic stages as proxies for relative age estimations as far as we know currently there are few models of forest ground vegetation population dynamics based on the concept of discrete description of plant ontogenesis with space represented implicitly logofet 2007 2019 2019 and with space represented explicitly zhukova and komarov 1990 komarov et al 2003 komarov et al 2015 at the same time these models do not allow the interactions between several populations to be simulated and do not take into account the species specific responses of plants to environmental conditions a large number of agroecosystem productivity models have been developed over time williams et al 1989 poluektov 2012 de vries and van laar 1982 the most detailed modeling of the production process of plants is implemented in the wofost family of models van diepen et al 1989 and in the ceres family of models hanks and ritchie 1991 these models allow the biomass increment of herbaceous cultivated plants to be described on the basis of detailed studies of the species specific features of photosynthesis however these models have several disadvantages that do not allow them to be used to model the ground layer vegetation of forest ecosystems first both of these models do not take into account not only the presence of forest litter but also the flow of litterfall at all since in agroecosystems the litter amount is greatly reduced due to biomass withdrawal second these models do not take into account the spatial structure of forest ground vegetation populations because in agroecosystems plants are placed according to a predetermined and usually regular pattern and there are no connections between individual plants the third and perhaps main reason for the impossibility of applying the abovementioned models is the lack of experimental data available with the required level of detail for plants not used in agriculture currently the best known model of forest plant productivity is 3 pg landsberg 1997 this model has a relatively small number of parameters but it makes it possible to assess the impact on the productivity of a complex of external factors air temperature and humidity soil moisture carbon dioxide concentration the amount of mineral nitrogen in soil etc the main advantage of this model is the ease of estimation of its parameters on the basis of experimental data as far as we know 3 pg and its modifications have yet not to be used to simulate the productivity of forest ground vegetation the distribution of biomass increment within a clone by concentration gradient is taken into account in magyar et al 2004 in addition one of the most important parameters of the distribution of biomass increment affecting the rate of decomposition of litterfall is the distribution of growth between organs fractions in each partial formation komarov et al 2013 this approach is used in models describing the dynamics of the tree layer of forest ecosystems komarov et al 2003 but the authors are unaware of models of forest ground vegetation in which this distribution is taken into account the main objective of this paper is to present an approach to construction of a model of the dynamics of forest ground vegetation populations based on the concept of a discrete description of plant ontogenesis which allows to evaluate the dynamics of biophilic elements in plant populations based on species specific features of photosynthesis in a hyper volume of environmental factors using a mass balanced approach model parameterization and validation for two species of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium as well as examples of the application of this model are presented in the second part of the paper frolov et al 2020 2 description of the campus s model 2 1 structure and features of the model the developed model campus s cellular automata model of plants united spread soil is an individual based and spatially explicit discrete simulation model the model combines several modeling techniques cellular automata ca modeling a stage of a cell depends on stages of neighboring cells matrix modeling transitions between ontogenetic stages are described using the modified leslie matrix caswell 2001 and the l systems technique modular development of a clone system a basic notion of the campus s model is that discrete space is represented as a two dimensional grid g i j i 1 n j 1 m unlike classical ca models in which a plant cannot occupy more than one cell the campus s allows a plant to have non zero size and a specific shape following its morphology moreover size and shape are not constant over a plant s life cycle but can change according to the species ontogeny pattern therefore the campus s model can be thought of as a ca model with complex transition rules however to avoid overcomplicating modeling by ca rules we treat the model as an individual based model first we specify the main object of the campus s model which represents a plant fig 1 as the model is intended to be able to treat a dynamics of population of clonal and seeds plants we use the term plant unit pu for either a partial formation i e a shoot together with a rhizome or for an individual plant in the model pu is given as a set of adjusted cells of two types aboveground part a aij and belowground part b bij where the range of indices i and j depends on the plant s morphology for details see section 2 below to be sufficiently realistic for many species of forest ground vegetation the spatial resolution of the campus s model should be no less than 1 1 cm in our simulation experiments we used a grid of size 1000 1000 cells although in our program it was limited only by computer capacity the time step of the model is 1 calendar month which is appropriate for representing all growth phases of plants age stages also need to be considered for the representation of plant development which in the model are based on ontogeny theory evstigneev and korotkov 2016 thus the pu can only be found at one of several species specific ontogenetic stages for which sets a and b should be specified each ontogenetic stage has its own duration and all transitions are described by the probabilistic transition matrix the campus s model consists of two interrelated blocks a a block for modeling the dynamics of plant populations population dynamics submodel based on a population ontogenetic concept and b a block for modeling the dynamics of biophilic elements carbon and nitrogen in forest ground vegetation production submodel based on an ecophysiological approach fig 2 the latter unit is dynamically linked to the model of soil organic matter dynamics romul hum komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b 2 1 1 environmental parameters for each cell illumination under the canopy is set with heterogeneity which is the output parameter of the efimod model komarov et al 2003 expressed in absolute values mol m 2 month 1 the initial amount of soil nitrogen is considered the same for each cell in the simulated area the spatial heterogeneity of soil temperature and moisture at the site is based on microrelief data within the range of variation using the equations 1 t x y t δ t 0 5 δ t λ x y where tx y is the temperature of the forest floor in cell x y t is the average forest floor temperature for the current month δt is the forest floor temperature variation in the simulated area as a portion of t and λx y is the relative height of the cell x y ranging between 0 the lowest point of the site and 1 the highest point where the spatial distribution of soil moisture is simulated as follows 2 w x y w δ w 0 5 δ w 1 λ x y where wx y is the volumetric moisture of the forest floor in cell x y w is the average forest floor volumetric moisture for the current month and δw is the relative variation as portion of w of the forest floor volumetric moisture in the simulated area in the absence of actual microrelief data the spatial distribution is generated by applying the two dimensional interpolation assuming the cells containing stem bases as highest points λ 1 and intercrown areas as lowest points λ 0 after obtaining the patterns of spatial heterogeneity of temperature moisture and illumination at the site the model distributes a given number of genets of all simulated plant species in a stage of seed across the simulation plot the distribution of seeds is random here and below the random distributions and numbers refer to those obtained using the mersenne twister a 623 dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudo random number generator matsumoto and nishimura 1998 the length of the growing season is calculated on the basis of climate data for 12 months starting in january as the number of months with an average monthly forest floor temperature above 5 c for deciduous species and 0 c for evergreen species air temperature is usually used to determine the length of the growing season but the forest floor temperature in terms of monthly averages does not significantly differ from the air temperature for the period with temperatures above 0 bykhovets ans komarov 2002 this makes it possible to apply the soil climate data used in the soil organic matter dynamics model romul hum komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b instead of meteorological data to estimate the duration of the vegetative period 2 2 single step of the campus s model a single step of the model consists of several sub routines 2 2 1 maturing an increase in age is performed for each pu at the same time both absolute and relative age the duration of an individual s stay in a given ontogenetic stage increase by the value reciprocal to the duration of the growing season for example if the growing season is 5 months the age will be increased by 0 2 the use of portions of the growing season instead of months owes to differences in the terminology adopted by various researchers indeed in some papers when describing ontogenesis a year assumes a calendar year while in other studies the same word refers to the vegetation period additionally this approach allows simulation of the population dynamics of species with a broad geographic range growing at different latitudes when the pu reaches the relative age equal to the duration of the current ontogenetic stage the probability of transitioning to another ontogenetic stage is calculated in accordance with the transition matrix if the pu has already remained in the current ontogenetic stage the probability of maintaining the current ontogenetic stage decreases by the value of ϱ eq 3 and the non zero probability of transitioning to the subsequent ontogenetic stage increases by the same value 3 ϱ δ δ e s t where ϱ is the value defining the decrease of the probability of staying in current ontogenetic stage and consequently the increase of the probability of transitioning to the next stage with non zero probability of transition δ is the probability of remaining in the current ontogenetic stage and st is the number of times the pu remained in the current ontogenetic stage when the switching of pu to another ontogenetic stage occurs its relative age is reset to zero 2 2 2 dying off at this sub routine the probability of death of the entire pu or a part of it is checked and various conditions leading to the death are simulated the pu dies off entirely when any of the following conditions are met a the generated random number in a range from 0 to 1 is less than the species specific probability of death for the current ontogenetic stage simulation of accidental death b the age of the pu reaches the maximum life expectancy the sum of the durations of all ontogenetic stages for the given species simulation of death due to natural aging c the pu twice turns into a senile ontogenetic stage simulation of death due to low viability or d the pu occupies an area that is 10 times less than the potential area for a given ontogenetic stage simulation of death when resources are limited including a resource limitation due to competition with other pus the dying off of individual parts of the pu occurs in accordance with the ontogenesis scheme or when the monthly average moisture content of the forest floor in the cell falls outside the species tolerance limits with the death of all parts of the pu it is considered to be dead entirely when the pu or its part dies off the entire stock of carbon and nitrogen belonging to it moves to litterfall 2 2 3 growth and cloning growth is simulated for each pu after performing the two previous sub routines increasing age and mortality if the plant growth direction is yet to be chosen the first step after the formation of the pu it is done so randomly the coordinates of each occupied cell relative to the cell in which the pu was originally populated take one of 8 possible values of dir x y x y x y x y y x y x y x y x where x y are coordinates of the corresponding cell in the ontogenesis scheme the chosen growth direction is preserved for further spreading under the condition that there are no gaps in the ontogenetic stages skipped ontogenetic stages of the pu the coordinates of cells into which it can potentially spread during the current step are calculated using the following equation 4 x y n e w x y b a s e d i r where x y new are the coordinates of the cell whose occupation is potentially possible x y base are the initial coordinates of the pu and dir are the coordinates of the cells corrected in accordance with the previously calculated direction in which spreading may be possible in accordance with the scheme of ontogenesis of the given species occupation of the selected cells by the pu is possible only if two conditions are met the first is that the selected cell must be potentially accessible i e due to the absence of large stones tree trunks etc at a given point of the plot the second condition is that the monthly mean values of volumetric moisture of the forest floor and the light intensity in the selected cell should not fall outside the species tolerance range in addition to the basic conditions listed above any of the following additional conditions must be fulfilled for spreading into the cell a the selected cell is not occupied by another pu b the selected cell is occupied only by the underground part of another pu and c another pu is located in the selected cell but its replacement is possible based on the calculated probability of displacement prep when calculating the probability of displacement the coefficient of optimality of conditions in the cell for which competition occurs and the energy consumption efficiency indices δvit of both pus are taken into account 5 p r e p 1 v i t 0 5 δ v i t 0 5 where ʊ is the priority of the displacing species over being displaced with equal ontogenetic stages and δvit is the energy efficiency index difference zhivotovsky 2001 between displacing and displaced partial formation if the generated random number 0 1 is less than the prep value the pu that previously occupied the cell is displaced simulation of interspecific competition 2 2 4 seed reproduction if the pus in the generative stage are presented on the plot the seeds of the corresponding species in the amount of ͼ are populated in random cells 6 c c 0 g c o u n t where c 0is the average number of seeds produced by one partial formation per year and gcount is the number of generative individuals the survival of seeds is possible only in free cells with environmental conditions that are within the species range of tolerance the probability of seed death βse is also taken into account 2 2 5 biomass increment calculation for each pu the amount of available par is calculated taking into account the area occupied by its aboveground part potential biomass increment is calculated using the michaelis menten equation taking into account losses due to respiration 7 n p p p o t p m a x p a r k m p a r p m a x 0 47 where pmax is the maximum possible photosynthetic rate for the given species par is the amount of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the pu km is the light intensity at which the photosynthesis rate is equal to half of the maximum and 0 47 is the constant characterizing losses for respiration seidl et al 2012 the growth is limited by a complex of environmental factors hence the growth response in the current month to the monthly average values of each of three environmental factors forest floor temperature volumetric moisture and the amount of nitrogen available per pu is calculated to calculate the particular functions of the response of the biomass increment to environmental factors the formula proposed by shabanov 1973 and corresponding to the pearson s type i distribution is applied 8 f φ φ φ m i n φ o p t φ m i n ε φ o p t φ m i n φ m a x φ φ m a x φ o p t ε φ m a x φ o p t where f φ is the relative photosynthetic rate at the current value of factor φ φmin is the minimal necessary value for photosynthesis of factor φ φopt is the value of factor φ at which the photosynthetic rate is maximal φmax is the maximal possible value for photosynthesis of factor φ ε is the parameter determining the rate of change of the intensity of photosynthesis when the value of factor φ is amended to assess the joint effects of several environmental factors it is necessary to take into account the interaction of all of the simulated environmental factors to this end we introduce the concept of the coefficient of optimality of conditions which determines the ratio of the actual photosynthetic rate in these conditions to the maximal possible value of photosynthesis this ratio tends to be calculated in one of three ways first liebig s law can be used liebig 1840 poletaev 1979 komarov et al 2003 9 f y 1 y n min y 1 y n where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn second the multiplication of the particular response functions can be used rodrigo et al 1997 antonopoulos 1999 paul et al 2003 10 f y 1 y n y 1 y n where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn third the harmonic mean of the particular response functions can be used stange 2007 11 f y 1 y n n i 1 n 1 y i where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn and n is the number of environmental factors taken into account however all of these methods have essential drawbacks in the case of liebig s law only the environmental factor is taken into account whose response function has a minimal value its contribution is taken as 1 while other factors are ignored their contribution is taken as 0 in the case of the multiplication of the partial response functions the contributions of all factors are considered as equal consequently if the number of factors tends to infinity the volume of the fundamental niche of the species will tend to 0 which is contrary to modern ideas about the ecological niches of plant species in the case of using of the harmonic mean the contribution of each factor is taken into account but the result of this function is greater than the value of the partial response function to the factor that has the strongest effect this approach is contrary to liebig s law taking into account the above advantages and disadvantages of the existing methods used to calculate the combined influence of several environmental factors a function f y1 yn can be constructed where y1 yn are particular functions of responses to these factors when constructing the formula the following conditions are taken into account 0 f y1 yn 1 if 0 y1 yn 1 f y1 yn min y1 yn f y1 yn must take into account the contribution of each factor to the total impact the constructed function is shown below 12 f y 1 y n a min y 1 y n 1 a y 1 y n where f y1 yn is the generalized response function of the photosynthetic rate to environmental factors y1 yn and a is the parameter determining the contribution of the factor the response function to which has a minimal value thus this function combines the approaches to the calculation of the coefficient of optimality of conditions on the basis of liebig s law and on the basis of the multiplication of the partial response functions a comparison of the four approaches considered for modeling the joint influence of several environmental factors is presented in fig 3 the actual biomass increment of the pu is calculated as the multiplication of the potential biomass increment and the value of the generalized response function for the simulated environmental factors eq 13 13 i n c m o n t h n p p p o t f t w n where npppot is the potential biomass increment of a given pu and f t w n is the proposed generalized photosynthetic rate response function to the temperature of the forest floor t the volumetric moisture of the forest floor w and the nitrogen amount in the forest floor available to the pu n 2 2 6 distribution of biomass increment the calculated biomass increment of the pu is distributed between the organs of the plant fractions of biomass when the plant organs reach maximum biomass in each growing season the ratio between the biomass of fractions should be maintained in accordance with the distribution of their ranks 14 y i k a k b i where yi is the portion of the mass of the organ in the total mass of the plant i is the organ rank the greater the rank of the organ the smaller the mass attributable to it ka is the coefficient numerically equal to the portion of the organ with a rank of 0 in the total mass of the plant and kb is the empirical coefficient determining the rate of decrease of an organ mass with an increase of its rank at the same time this ratio does not need to be maintained every month as different fractions of plant biomass do not increase and fall simultaneously to comply with both the annual and the monthly distribution we use the following technique for each month a pseudo annual increment of the first approximation is calculated under the assumption that the increments in each month during the growing season will be equal to the increment in the current month 15 i n c p s 1 i i n c m o n t h i l v e g where incps 1 is the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation and lveg is the duration of the growing season the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation is summed with the already existing biomass and the resulting biomass is distributed to the organs 16 m p s i m i n c y e a r k a k b i where mps i is the first approximation mass of the organ i m is the total mass of the pu incyear is the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation and ka kb are the empirical coefficients eq 14 based on the calculated first approximation mass of organs a pseudo annual litterfall is calculated taking into account the fact that the litterfall rate the portion of the organ going to litter during a certain time span of different organs varies 17 f a l l p s i m i n 1 12 f p θ where fallps i is the pseudo annual litterfall of the organ i mi is the first approximation mass of the organ i and fpθ is the litterfall rate of the organ i the pseudo annual increment of the second approximation is considered as the sum of the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation and the pseudo annual litterfall 18 i n c p s 2 i i n c p s 1 i f a l l p s i where incps 2 i is the pseudo annual increment of the second approximation of the organ i incps 1 i is the pseudo annual increment of the first approximation of the organ i and fallps i is the pseudo annual litterfall of the organ i to calculate the actual monthly biomass increments of certain fractions the pseudo annual increments of the second approximation of individual organs are multiplied by the portion of the organ biomass increment in the current month in the case of a discrepancy between the obtained amount of monthly increments of individual fractions and the monthly increment of the entire pu the following adjustment is made 19 i n c m o n t h i i n c p s 2 i η i i n c p s 2 i η i i n c m o n t h where incmonth i is the biomass increment of the organ i in the current month incps 2 i is the pseudo annual increment of the second approximation of the organ i ηi is the portion of the biomass increment of the organ i in the current month in relation to the annual value and incmonth is the increment of the biomass of the pu in the current month in this case compliance with the ratios of monthly increments of biomass fractions and the distribution of annual increments of the biomass of organs is achieved 2 2 7 calculation of nitrogen content for each pu the amount of consumed nitrogen is calculated as the sum of the products of biomass increments of certain organs by the nitrogen concentrations within them in this case the amount of nitrogen consumed by the pu will always be less than or equal to the amount of available nitrogen content in the forest floor in a given cell as this parameter is one of the limiting factors in the calculation of the biomass increment further the amount of consumed nitrogen is summed with the amount of already existing nitrogen in the plant eq 20 20 n i n i 0 n 0 i i n c i κ i 100 where ni is the nitrogen content in the organ i inci is the biomass increment of the organ i in the current month and κi is the nitrogen concentration in the organ i n i 0 is the nitrogen already existing in the plant 2 2 8 calculation of litterfall mass for each pu the mass of litterfall is calculated for each organ if dying off occurs uniformly throughout the growing season θ 1 the litterfall mass is calculated as follows 21 m f a l l i m i l v e g where mfall i is the mass of litterfall of the organ i mi is the biomass of the organ i and lveg is the duration of the growing season if organ litterfall occurs at the end of the growing season θ 2 which is usually used for leafage the litterfall is considered to be equal to the organ biomass for deciduous plants while for evergreen plants the litterfall rate is set as reciprocal of the lifespan of a given organ if the litterfall of the organ occurs only at the dieback of certain parts of the plant during ontogenesis θ 0 the litterfall mass is considered to be equal to 0 the nitrogen content in the litterfall is considered as the multiplication of the mass of the organ litterfall and the nitrogen content in the litterfall if concentrations of nitrogen in a living organ and litterfall do not coincide for example the nitrogen concentration in leaf litterfall may be less than the concentration of nitrogen in a living organ resorption occurs the resorbed nitrogen defined by the difference between the nitrogen content in the living organ and in the litterfall is distributed evenly between the organs the litterfall of which occurs only when individual parts of the plant die off during ontogenesis θ 0 2 2 9 modeling of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in soil to implement the feedback mechanism between plants and soil the campus s model is integrated with the romul hum model komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b the romul hum model describes the mineralization and humification of litter and organic matter in soil as well as carbon dioxide emissions and nitrogen release in mineral forms accessible to plants resulting from the above processes the rate of mineralization and humification in the model depends on the chemical properties of litter the temperature and the volumetric moisture of litter and soil mineral horizons the main feature of the model is that it describes the process of transformation of soil organic matter separately for forest litter and upper mineral soil horizons another important feature of the model is that its coefficients are determined during laboratory experiments regarding the decomposition of different types of litter under controlled conditions as well as in the analysis of other published data chertov 1985 nadporozhskaya 2000 nadporozhskaya et al 2000 komarov et al 2007 the initial values of soil organic matter pools and nitrogen content in these pools are read from the input file when the campus s model is initialized temperature and volumetric moisture of litter and mineral soil at 20 cm depth as well as the amount of incoming aboveground and subsurface litter i e leaves stems rhizomes and fine roots each with their own nitrogen content are transferred from each cell of the campus s model to the romul hum model the output variables of the model are data on pools of soil organic matter and nitrogen as well as carbon dioxide emissions from soil and nitrogen release in forms available to plants the last parameter is passed back to the cell of the campus s model and is used by plants at the next step a schematic block diagram of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in the romul hum model is presented in fig 4 3 example of application due to the large number of interrelated parameters of the model this paper does not provide an analysis of the sensitivity of campus s but rather offers an example of an experiment to demonstrate the features that fundamentally distinguish campus s from other models a a comprehensive approach to modeling the population structure and the productivity of plants for various environmental conditions and b high spatial resolution which allows the dynamics of plant populations of different life forms to be modeled these features of the model can be better manifested in one but complex experiment rather than in several separate ones to conduct the experiment two species of plants of different life forms were selected one of them was a clonal long rhizome plant capable of vegetative propagation the other was a non clonal plant with only seed propagation the ability of a clonal plant to reproduce via seeds was not taken into account in order to exclude the influence of differences in pu sizes on the experimental results the projection area of both the aboveground and underground parts was the same for all ontogenetic stages fig 5 the daughter pu of the clonal plant had a juvenile ontogenetic stage the number of seeds of a non clonal species and the daughter pu of a clonal one were taken as equal 12 seeds each the duration of each ontogenetic stage of both species was equal to one vegetative period the transition matrices between the ontogenetic stages of both species were the same and realized only sequential transitions each stage to the next the production characteristics of both species and their ecological niches were the same both species were deciduous thus the differences between the modeled species were only in the patterns of pu growth during ontogenesis the simulated territory was represented by a square lattice measuring 25 25 m with a cell of 1 1 cm at the time of the beginning of the simulation the space was homogeneous in terms of temperature humidity illumination and soil richness the parameter values of all environmental factors corresponded to the ecological optimum of both species seeds of each species in an amount of 100 pcs m 2 were randomly distributed on the grid such conditions rendered it possible to demonstrate the population dynamics invasion rate and biomass dynamics of the simulated species under equal initial conditions and taking into account intra and interspecific competition modeling was carried out for 200 years with a monthly step at the 1200th step corresponding to the 100th year the heterogeneity of space was introduced by the soil moisture factor moisture in blocks of cells measuring 5 5 cm located in chess order was decreased by 30 but remained within both species tolerance range this experimental design allowed us to evaluate the influence of both environmental factors and spatial growth patterns on pu productivity the experimental results showed that under homogeneous environmental conditions there was a synchronism in the dynamics of cover population density and biomass of simulated species fig 6 both within the same species and between different species the values of these parameters reached a stationary level by the 300th step of modeling i e in 25 years for both species which could be explained by the equal durations of ontogenetic stages for both species further periodic fluctuations in cover and population density were associated with the synchronism of the pu life cycle this synchronism was due to the use of transition matrices implementing only sequential transitions between ontogenetic stages more significant biomass fluctuations in comparison with abundance and projective cover were associated with annual litterfall of 100 of leaves at the end of the growing season the values of cover population density and biomass of simulated species plateaued at different levels the larger values of cover population density and biomass of the clonal plant species could be explained by the fact that due to vegetative propagation the formation of loci of the territory held by this species around the maternal pu occurred similar dynamics have been observed in populations of real plant species in natural conditions zhukova and komarov 1990 with the occurrence of heterogeneous territory the dynamics of the cover and population density of both species did not change this was due to the fact that the changed soil moisture conditions remained within both species tolerance range and therefore did not lead to the death of the pus conversely a change in the dynamics of the biomass of both species was observed the biomass of the population of the clonal species was reduced by 5 10 and by more than 70 in the non clonal species such a discrepancy in the biomass dynamics of the simulated species under heterogeneous environmental conditions can be explained by the fact that despite having the same projection area the pu of clonal species was less compact in this regard the probability that all parts of one pu of a clonal plant species would be in an area with low humidity was lower than that of a more compact non clonal species due to the fact that plants consume soil water from the entire area on which the underground organs are presented as well as due to the flow of water and nutrients within the clone the clonal species reacted more weakly to changes in environmental conditions this experiment has allowed us to demonstrate the influence of the spatial structure of plants to assess not only the dynamics of cover and population density but also the biomass of plant populations of different life forms differences in cover and population density as well as changes in the biomass dynamics of populations of simulated species cannot be predicted without taking into account the spatial structure of the population as they do not differ in other parameters such as the duration of ontogenetic stages the probability of transitions between them ecological niches and production characteristics thus this experiment shows both the possibilities of applying the campus s model in biological and ecological studies and the advantages of combining the techniques of cellular automata matrix modeling l systems and mass balance approach over using only one modeling technique 4 conclusion the developed campus s model is a universal tool for simulating the population dynamics of any plant species as well as the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in multi species communities of forest ground vegetation regardless of life forms this is because its algorithms are based on the basic principles of development of individuals during ontogenesis enabling the model to reproduce the mechanisms of photosynthesis and biomass production common to all vascular plants the developed model has the following application possibilities investigation of interactions between individuals in populations research into competitive interactions between populations in a community depending on morphological rhythmological and other types of developmental variations estimation of the rate of occupation of a territory by plant populations depending on environmental conditions such as humidity soil fertility and illumination assessment of the distribution and productivity of populations under steady state conditions and in a changing environment evaluation of the response of populations to anthropogenic recreation logging ground fires etc and zoogenic influences estimation of the contribution of forest ground vegetation to the turnover of biophilic elements carbon and nitrogen in forest ecosystems under different environmental conditions the model has flexible settings that facilitate its parameterization for different plant species of the grass shrub layer and its subsequent integration into the system of forest ecosystem models capable of simulating the joint dynamics of stand ground layer vegetation and soil pools of biophilic elements despite of its versatile and flexible structure the campus s model has some limitations 1 the impossibility of model application for areas in which the leading limiting factor of plants growth is an availability of biophilic elements other than nitrogen additional response functions should be added in such case 2 due to the fact that the model does not take into account the layering of forest ground vegetation the results of its calculations may not be accurate for areas in which the layering of forest ground vegetation is conspicuous due to the lack of sub routine simulating the light transmittance through the layers of forest ground vegetation 3 the campus s model does not take into account the effect of carbon dioxide concentration on the productivity of forest ground vegetation which can lead to underestimation of plant biomass when modeling climate change scenarios credit authorship contribution statement pavel frolov conceptualization methodology software validation visualization writing

24801,this study presents an example of the parameterization and validation of the campus s model for the dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium and the results of computational experiments showing the applicability of the model a quantitative analysis of the population dynamics of dwarf shrubs their productivity and contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycling in forest ecosystems was carried out the campus s model takes the morphology ontogenesis developmental stages and physiological features of modeled species into account both in undisturbed environmental conditions and under external natural and anthropogenic impacts including climate change the validation of the model was based on the independent field data and showed a high reliability of the results our simulation experiments showed that species specific properties of dwarf shrubs such as their structural and functional organization flexibility of ontogenesis and tolerance to a range of environmental factors determine the resistance of populations to different kinds of disturbances the speed of occupation of the territory and the ability to hold it we demonstrated that dwarf shrubs have an important contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycles of boreal forest ecosystems via above and belowground litter production keywords campus s model structural functional models bilberry lingonberry flexibility of ontogenesis c and n cycles 1 introduction anthropogenic impacts such as climate change nitrogen deposition and intensive forest management may cause loss of biodiversity in forest ecosystems and lead to their degradation therefore understanding the causes of long term environmental changes of forest ecosystems has become an important task in forest science although there have been advances in the studies on commercial wood and biofuels production in the last decades more knowledge is needed about sustainable use of forests to safeguard their biodiversity and ecosystem services in this study we focus to the dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium including bilberry vaccinium myrtillus l and lingonberry vaccinium vitis idaea l which cover an extensive part of the ground in boreal and tundra regions these species provide many ecosystem services like producing of berries affecting nutrient cycling titlyanova 1979 and colonizing bare soil after disturbances such as tree logging fires floods and recreational activities the effect of tree litterfall on nutrient cycling in the organic and mineral soil has been much studied in the 20th century heath et al 1964 kovda 1973 parton et al 1988 however only in the recent years the role of ground vegetation in carbon and nitrogen cycles in boreal forests has been investigated nilsson and wardle 2005 kolari et al 2006 hilli et al 2010 merilä et al 2013 lehtonen et al 2016 although ground vegetation represents a relatively minor component of the whole biomass of boreal forests it plays an important role in the annual biomass production and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem especially the litter of deciduous dwarf shrubs e g bilberry herbs and grasses has a higher rate of decomposition than the litter from conifers this means that the litter produced by the understory vegetation is likely to has a major impact on soil forming processes clonal growth pattern is common in the northern plant communities dietz and steinlein 2001 clonal plants are formed from genetically identical units ramets modules that enable plants to respond to environmental variation by changing their architecture liu et al 2016 furthermore vegetative reproduction ensures physiological integration between shoots and it is of great importance for recovery and spreading of most species of forest ground vegetation sexual reproduction via spore and seed propagation requires specific conditions while vegetative propagation is possible in conditions that are minimally necessary for the growth of the organism levina 1981 vegetative propagation requires less energy than generative one and does not lead to a decrease in biomass production muir 1995 vegetative organs like rhizomes store large amounts of nutrients that ensure development of dormant bud reserve lortie and aarssen 2000 which enable higher growth rates than seeds maslova 2014 the development of a plant unit pu of the same species may vary evstigneev and korotkov 2016 rabotnov 1969 and his successors uranov 1975 gatzuk et al 1980 created a system for determining the age differentiation of individuals based on the ontogenesis of organisms from birth to death this method provides division of the individual development into periods ontogenetic stages that reflect the biological age of the plant individuals of the same calendar age may be at different stages of ontogenetic development zaugol nova et al 1988 smirnova et al 2002 as a rule asynchronous development of individuals polyvariance of ontogenesis is determined by different living conditions zhukova and komarov 1990 distinguished several classes of polyvariance of development rates normal delayed and accelerated development skipping of ontogenetic stages reversion to earlier stages due to rejuvenation secondary dormancy this feature allows populations to maintain their structure in the changing environmental conditions the polyvariance of ontogenesis of bilberry and lingonberry can be of five types dynamic rhythmological dimensional morphological and polyvariance of the ways of reproduction and dissemination notov and zhukova 2019 climate change affects plant communities and their ecosystem services especially in the northern vegetation zones jägerbrand et al 2011 villén peréz et al 2020 growth of clonal dwarf shrubs and many ecological processes in forests take long time and assessment of ecosystem services requires consideration of a large number of interrelated factors which makes it difficult to conduct controlled experiments to understand how the growth of bilberry and lingonberry will change in the future and how this affects ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services it is necessary to apply simulation techniques the aim of this study is to quantify population dynamics of bilberry and lingonberry and to estimate their contribution to the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in different environmental conditions the results are used in evaluating how well the campus s model frolov et al submitted allows us to simulate the population dynamics and biomass production of plant species in a spatially heterogeneous environment for light temperature moisture and n content in soil the applied model uses several modeling techniques matrix l systems and cellular automata modeling the genetic species specific features are defined for each ontogenetic stage l systems while their implementation for certain individuals in the course of modeling depends on external conditions cellular automata to implement the variance of the transitions between ontogenetic stages the matrix modeling method is used the spatial resolution of the model is 1 cm2 the time step is one month the model consists of two submodels submodel of the plant populations structure and submodel of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in plants and soil we hypothesize that h1 the combination of cellular automata matrix modeling and l system techniques allows us to simulate the population dynamics of dwarf shrubs in a spatially heterogeneous environment and also to take the individual characteristics of organisms in the mass balance approach to predict their productivity into account h2 species specific properties of dwarf shrubs such as their structural organization polyvariance of ontogenesis and tolerance to environmental factors determine resistance of populations to external influences speed of occupation of a territory and an ability to hold it h3 dwarf shrubs have a significant contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycles in forest ecosystems due to high biomass turnover rate and they act as a reserve pool of carbon and nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 parameterization of the campus s model 2 1 1 submodel of the dynamics of plant populations v myrtillus and v vitis idaea are long rhizomatous dwarf shrubs serebryakov 1962 and represent chamaephytes raunkiaer 1905 both species form extensive clones consisting of sets of genetically identical ramets shoots with a piece of belowground rhizome grown vegetatively from the seed born mother plant serebryakova et al 2006 the lifespan of clones according to different estimations varies from 30 flower ellis 1971 even to 120 years shutov 2001 prokopyeva 2006 both bilberry and lingonberry have an intensively branched rhizome system with large number of thin adventitious roots heath et al 1938 the rhizomes of both species are located principally in the upper organic soil layers of forests but under unfavorable conditions they can grow down to deeper mineral soil layers that explain their tolerance to ground fires and sensitivity to waterlogging grelet 2001 both species form orthotropic shoots from buds located on rhizomes but there are many morphological differences between the species thin bilberry leaves are short lived deciduous living less than 10 months flower ellis 1971 while the lifespan of thick lingonberry winter green leaves lasts from 2 5 to 4 years karlsson 1992 the average leaf area and length of shoot internodes corresponding annual growths are quite similar in both species but bilberry stems are thicker than those of lingonberry bilberry stems remain green for at least one year enabling photosynthesis also without leaves welch et al 1994 the height of bilberry shoots generally is 15 30 cm while those of lingonberry are somewhat lower the growth habit of bilberry shoots and rhizomes is sympodial branching from axillary buds the growth of lingonberry shoots is predominantly monopodial with a stronger apical development but only sympodial growth is possible after flowering tolvanen 1995 the distance between the shoots along the rhizome of bilberry is 10 15 cm while that of lingonberry is longer and can reach even 100 150 cm the perennial shoots go through different ontogenetic stages but there could be large size variation within the stages for instance the difference in the shoot height of virginal stage of bilberry can be more than 20 cm depending on their vitality zhukova and zubkova 2016 the development of genets and ramets of bilberry and lingonberry during the ontogenesis is described in polyanskaya et al 2000 shutov 2001 maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 the data used to parameterize the architectural structure and biomass partitioning of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea was obtained from the two data sets 1 area based biomass samples including belowground organs in organic soil layer from boreal spruce and pine forests in finland and 2 complete clones sampled from pine forests in hemi boreal zone of russia in addition we used a large volume of data from experimental studies published in scientific literature to parameterize the two sub models the summary of the used data sources is provided in table 1 and their detailed description is given below for the analysis of architectural structure and ontogenetic stages we excavated complete clones of bilberry and lingonberry as monoliths within soil blocks in depths in which most of rhizomes and roots were located 15 30 cm then the plants were carefully washed so that the structure and mutual arrangement of above and underground organs stayed unchanged we recorded the number of all shoots of a clone and determined the absolute age and ontogenetic stage of individual shoots the projection area of aboveground parts of individual shoots the branching angles of rhizomes and the distance between the dormant buds on rhizomes as an example of the morphological flexibility of bilberry and lingonberry the variation of the distance between shoots on rhizomes has been observed zubkova et al 2016 in that study the distance between the neighboring shoots along rhizomes were measured and three patterns of shoot arrangements were found fig 1 single growing of single shoots at relatively regular distances of 6 11 cm from each other pairwise growing of two shoots as a group on the rhizome at a distance of 0 3 0 5 cm from each other since the two buds were activated simultaneously the shoots were usually of the same age and ontogenetic stage as a rule this pattern was due to the death of the growth tip of the rhizome which according to our observations often occurred in the winter period group growing of 4 shoots for bilberry or 4 8 shoots for lingonberry as a group on the rhizome at a distance of 0 3 0 5 cm from each other in the surveyed area in russia such formations were observed in more fertile conditions as estimated using the species composition of vegetation all three patterns can be observed within the same clone since each of the three patterns leads to different realization of the spatial distribution of pu we used all three shoot patterns to create model schemes for the ontogenesis of bilberry and lingonberry fig 2 dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis can be expressed as age based development of pu at different ontogenetic stages or as stage based transitions of each element from one ontogenetic stage to another we calculated the possible duration of ontogenetic stages of bilberry and lingonberry on the basis of the literature ontogenetic atlas of plants 2013 shutov 2001 prokopyeva 2006 due to the high variability of the data structure some researchers took the winter months into account others omitted them when specifying the age an additional analysis of the ratio of absolute age and ontogenetic stage was required in addition to own data from the moscow region altogether 471 bilberry and 438 lingonberry shoots in pine forests we used the data from the kola peninsula 1457 bilberry and 1389 lingonberry shoots in pine forests maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 to estimate the duration of the ontogenetic stages the stages were estimated in relative terms as parts of the growing period enabling to summarize data across regions with different climatic conditions table 2 we determined the potential transitions between the ontogenetic stages of bilberry and lingonberry using the literature data prokopyeva 2006 shutov 2001 maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 the analysis showed that the potential transitions between the stages of bilberry and lingonberry coincide the parameterization of the transition probabilities between ontogenetic stages was carried out by the exhaustive search method knuth 1997 in the 0 1 probability range with a step of 0 1 as a criterion for the accuracy of the selection of probabilities we used the comparison of the ontogenetic spectra of a model population at the 600 th modeling step 50 th year under constant optimal external conditions with the basic ontogenetic spectrum of populations of the studied species the most common methods for comparing samples are pearson s agreement criterion χ2 and fisher s exact test for r c tables johnson et al 2015 however these methods are not applicable when comparing ontogenetic spectra since ontogenetic states are ordered classes they successively follow each other during the ontogenesis in this connection we used a regression model for ordered classes kleinbaum and klein 2010 in comparing ontogenetic spectrums between observed and modeled populations the resulting probability matrices for transitions between the ontogenetic states of bilberry and lingonberry are presented in table 3 we used data from literature to determine the seed production and germination of the studies species in sweden in pine forests of various ages 50 120 169 years bilberry and lingonberry seeds were found both inside the thick moss and on the border between organic and mineral soil layers which indicates continuous production of seeds by generative individuals granström 1982 the average number of berries per a shoot was 10 15 for bilberry afanas eva and kashin 2015 and 25 30 for lingonberry prokopyeva 2006 one berry of both bilberry and lingonberry contained on average 30 seeds hall and shay 1981 but their germination in laboratory experiments did not exceed 15 and in the natural environment it usually comprises 0 0 05 granström 1982 vander kloet 1988 in the presence of dense moss cover the germination of bilberry and lingonberry seeds was very low and the species reproduce only vegetatively also when some disturbance created gaps in the moss layer grime et al 2014 in this regard the seed germination sexual reproduction of the studied species was not taken into account in the simulation 2 2 2 submodel of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in plants and soil in analyzing the dependence of biomass production of bilberry and lingonberry on environmental factors we used literature data characterizing various aspects of photosynthesis of these species the maximum possible intensity of photosynthesis pmax was calculated by analyzing the literature data on the dependence of the instantaneous gross photosynthetic production gpp on the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation par kolari et al 2006 the instantaneous values were integrated up to the daily sums based on the daily dynamics of par and then converted to monthly values by multiplying by the average number of days in the month fig 3 for lingonberry pmax was 0 0061 mol m 2 mon 1 for bilberry it was 0 014 mol m 2 mon 1 the half saturation constant values km of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea were calculated using non linear regression to determine the quality of the non linear regression equation the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj which uses unbiased estimates of variances was used hereinafter km for bilberry was 90 03 r2 adj 0 99 and for lingonberry it comprised 80 09 r2 adj 0 99 the coefficients of the response functions of the photosynthesis intensity to environmental factors were obtained using nonlinear regression based on literature data the rhizomes and roots of bilberry and lingonberry are usually located at a shallow depth flower ellis 1971 tear 1972 in the forest floor which can be considered as the prevailing source of nutrients for these species although flower ellis noted the possibility of the location of the old rhizomes in the mineral horizons of the soil tear 1972 noted that the development of lingonberry is promoted by the presence of rapidly decomposing organic matter the sources of which can be old stumps and anthills the dependence of the relative photosynthesis intensity of bilberry and lingonberry on the content of available nitrogen in the soil fig 4 was described by ingestad 1973 in this study the photosynthesis intensity of pregenerative ontogenetic stages of bilberry and lingonberry were investigated on a phytotron the given values were recalculated from kg m 3 to kg m 2 for a soil layer of 0 30 cm root inhabited layer for both species the minimum values of the content of mineral nitrogen in soil for both species were 0 0005 kg n m 2 and the optimal values were close 0 0066 kg n m 2 for lingonberry and 0 0071 kg n m 2 for bilberry while the maximum values varied almost 4 fold 0 0457 kg n m 2 for lingonberry and 0 16 kg n m 2 for bilberry the empirical coefficient ε was calculated by non linear regression for v myrtillus it was estimated as 10 05 and for v vitis idaea it comprised 29 87 in both cases r2 adj 0 99 the dependence of the relative photosynthesis intensity of the studied species on air temperature fig 5 is described by nygaard 1975 who studied the acclimatization of the studied species and by skre 1975 who studied co2 exchange in norwegian tundra plants literature data were recalculated from the absolute values of photosynthesis intensity or gas exchange rate into the relative values the minimum temperature required for photosynthesis of bilberry is 5 c and that one for photosynthesis of lingonberry is 5 c the optimum temperatures are 15 and 27 c and the maximum temperatures are 37 and 40 c for bilberry and lingonberry respectively the empirical coefficient ε was estimated by non linear regression for v myrtillus it is 0 1 for v vitis idaea it is 0 08 in both cases r2 adj 0 95 usually when investigating photosynthesis the soil water potential is used to assess the response of photosynthesis intensity to the water availability however calculation of this parameter for the forest floor in which the most of shrub roots are located is difficult due to its high heterogeneity therefore as a criterion of water availability we used the volumetric moisture of the forest floor the parameterization of the dependence of the photosynthesis intensity on the moisture of the root inhabited soil layer fig 6 was carried out on the basis of the study of the photosynthesis of forest ground vegetation kulmala et al 2008 and karlsson s 1985 research on the dependence of the photosynthesis rate of dwarf shrubs of the vaccinium genus on soil moisture the minimum soil moisture content for photosynthesis of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea does not differ 4 the optimal value for bilberry is 65 and for lingonberry it is 34 the maximum volumetric moisture is 81 and 67 for bilberry and lingonberry respectively the empirical coefficient ε was estimated by non linear regression for v myrtillus it is 0 061 r2 adj 0 95 and for v vitis idaea it is 0 07 r2 adj 0 97 to determine the distribution of biomass of bilberry and lingonberry between organs and to calculate the coefficients of the power function equation we used the biomass data sampled from finland and russia the plant biomass was sorted out by organs the obtained samples were dried until reaching the constant mass when analyzing the data the following sequences of biomass fractions with decreased portion of given organ in the total biomass were revealed bilberry 0 rhizomes 1 stems 2 fine roots 3 leaves lingonberry 0 rhizomes 1 stems 2 leaves 3 fine roots for each sample the coefficients of the exponential function equation fig 7 were calculated by the non linear regression method in each case the coefficient r2 adj was more than 0 98 next data for bilberry and lingonberry was averaged over the median biomass of each fraction the averaged data was also used for calculation of the values of the coefficients ka and kb for the exponential function the phenological stage of vegetative growth and flowering of the studied species in different regions has been analyzed shutov 2001 prokopyeva 2006 in general the growth of shoots and leaves occurs during the first 1 2 months in the beginning of the growing season assumed in our study as a period with annual monthly temperature higher than 5 c regardless of its length after which the formation of flowers begins in bilberry partly overlapping with leaf growth the fruits ripen in the middle of the growing season since we found no published information about seasonal development of rhizomes we carried out monthly observations from may to november of the length growth of underground rhizomes in the pineta sylvestris fruticuloso hylocomiosa site russia the growth rate of rhizomes varied from 1 to 6 cm per month up to 17 cm per season and the growth was observed over the entire growing season due to the lack of literature data on the growth of fine roots during the growing season and the inability to conduct field experiments the assumption was made that fine roots grow like rhizomes over the entire growing season when parameterizing the shares of different fractions of litterfall during the growing season we found that only dead stems and rhizomes were detached and fell off zubkova et al 2016 the leaves of both species were shed in the last month of the growing season in bilberry the portion of shed leaves was 100 and in lingonberry 25 holloway 1981 due to the lack of the data on fine root age we assumed that their biomass is completely replaced during the growing season i e the turnover rate was 1 0 year 1 nitrogen concentrations in different organs of the studied species were determined by summarizing the results of various studies lähdesmäki et al 1990 grelet et al 2001 gerdol et al 2004 parzych et al 2010 and own data based on these datasets a summary table table 4 of nitrogen concentrations in organs of bilberry and lingonberry was compiled 2 2 simulation experiments 2 2 1 the analysis of the influence of the clonal spatial structure on the population dynamics the competitive advantages of lingonberry populations with different patterns of the location of daughter shoots on the rhizome morphological variance in the absence of seed propagation were analyzed using the campus s model two patterns occurring in natural populations were considered plants with a close location of daughter shoots at the distance of 1 cm from each other fig 8 a and plants with a sparse arrangement of buds at the distance of 5 6 cm fig 8b other parameters of the model were taken the same the simulation was carried out for 100 years without taking external influences into account 2 2 2 the analysis of the influence of dynamic variance of ontogenesis on the sustainability of population using the campus s model we analyzed the dynamics of two bilberry populations with the same growth patterns during ontogenesis but with different transition matrices between ontogenetic stages both in the absence of external influences and with damage of shoots of varying intensity the impacts were simulated to occur annually every july starting from the 25th year of modeling and the damage intensity the proportion of damaged shoots varied in the range from 5 to 60 the simulation was carried out for 100 years the initial number of seeds was 50 per m2 to avoid random effects related to the different initial arrangement of seeds during different runs of the model the parameters of pseudo random number generator were fixed two different transition probability matrices were used 1 where all transitions between ontogenetic stages occur sequentially only the mainstream type of ontogenesis is realized 2 a transition matrix corresponding to the development of populations observed in nature the dynamic variance of ontogenesis with branching transitions 2 2 3 analysis of dynamics and productivity of bilberry and lingonberry populations in the moscow region in natural conditions the field data for this experiment was obtained from the complex field experiment in pine forests of the moscow region on the rectangular plot of 20 25 m topographic survey was conducted with a resolution 0 2 0 2 m elevation difference within the investigated area was 1 51 m in general the surface falls in the direction from the northeast to southwest corner of the site the resulting map of the microrelief is shown in fig 9 in addition to measuring the microrelief the dominating species of the living ground cover in a square of 0 2 0 2 m was recorded with its center at the point at which the microrelief was measured the areas dominated either by bilberry lower areas or by lingonberry higher areas were identified as well as areas where bilberry and lingonberry co dominated in the lower parts of the site lingonberry was found only on elevations around the tree stems 25 monoliths of 0 25 0 25 m in size were excavated on the same plot along the transect parallel to the longer side at the distance of 5 m from its northern border above and belowground organs of the studied species were separated washed dried at 60 c to an absolutely dry state and weighted additionally the forest floor thickness was measured at each point of the monoliths excavation to estimate the number of shoots per square meter and the ontogenetic spectrum of populations in different parts of the plot with monodominance of bilberry lingonberry and co dominance of both species 16 small plots of 0 25 0 25 m were established at each small plot the projective cover and the number of shoots of each ontogenetic stage were measured the following data set was prepared as input parameters of environmental conditions the microrelief map obtained by mapping the sample plot the dynamic irradiance map at the ground level for each month obtained using the efimod model komarov et al 2003 with extended canopy light transmission sub routine shanin et al 2020 where the allocation of trees was taken according to the field data annual data were interpolated to monthly step taking into account the seasonal dynamics of the daylight hours and the vegetation phases the temperature and moisture of forest floor and mineral soil for this territory from 1942 to 2017 obtained using the scliss model bykhovets and komarov 2002 based on meteorological data the initial values of the pools of soil organic matter carbon and nitrogen content in l f and h pools of forest floor and in mineral soil were parameterized based on data obtained from field experiments the range of the spatial variation of temperature and volumetric moisture of forest floor over the simulated area was 5 c and 10 respectively model runs were performed in 100 fold repetition for 75 years the initial distribution of seeds of both species 100 seeds of each species per m2 was random the size of the modeled area was 20 25 m 500 m2 comparison of the nature data and the results of model simulations were carried out on the basis of 5 parameters the density of populations number of shoots per m2 the projective cover the ontogenetic spectra of populations the spatial distribution of populations over the area the biomass density of populations kg m 2 when comparing the density the projective cover and the biomass of natural and modeled populations of bilberry and lingonberry the same technique was used two statistical hypotheses were tested 1 the mean values of the analyzed parameters for the modeled and natural populations do not differ 2 the distributions of the analyzed parameters for the modeled and natural populations do not differ due to the fact that none of the analyzed parameters of populations both of bilberry and lingonberry followed the normal distribution the shapiro wilk test at a significance level of 0 05 to test the hypothesis of equality of the mean values of the analyzed parameters the wilcoxon s non parametric test was used the distributions of the above parameters were compared using pearson s χ2 test the analysis of the distribution of the ontogenetic spectra of the natural and modeled populations was carried out in several steps the sub samples randomly selected squares of 1 m2 were combined within each sample populations their distributions were summarized and then the homogeneity of the ontogenetic spectra of the samples was checked using the χ2 test during analysis of the spatial distribution of populations data on the location of the shoots of bilberry and lingonberry were combined into blocks of 20 20 cm and divided into 4 groups 1 the blocks with only lingonberry shoots presented 2 the blocks with both bilberry and lingonberry shoots presented 3 the blocks with only bilberry shoots presented 4 the blocks with no shoots of any of these species to compare the spatial arrangement of the modeled and natural populations based on the data obtained in field experiments and with simulations the two dimensional arrays of 100 125 elements were formed each element of the arrays contained a numeric encoding from 1 to 4 of corresponding spatial block then an array of the same size was generated containing the calculated element wise difference between the original arrays 2 2 4 the assessment of the contribution of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium to the productivity of forest ecosystems the simulations were carried out for the territory of the moscow region under three different climatic scenarios stationary climatic conditions moderate climate change and extreme climate change current views on possible climate change scenarios in the 21st century are stated in the 5th assessment report of the ipcc stocker 2014 and the 2nd assessment report of the federal service for hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring of russia roshydromet 2014 they are based on a new family of rcp greenhouse gas emission scenarios in this new family of scenarios of anthropogenic impact on the climate system rcp representative concentration pathways the digital index of scenario characterizes the magnitude of anthropogenic radiation exposure i e an increase in planetary radiation balance achieved by 2100 in w m 2 in the simulations we applied the most widely used scenarios rcp4 5 moderate and rcp8 5 extreme for construction of the local climatic scenarios we used the outputs of the global climate model inmcm4 of the institute of computational mathematics of the russian academy of sciences volodin et al 2013 these data with monthly resolution were obtained from the website of the german climate computing center dkrz knutti 2014a b c one of the world centers of the ipcc climate data the extraction of local series from the large scale netcdf files containing simulation results for the entire globe was carried out using the ncdf4 package pierce 2017 for the statistical programming environment r r core team 2012 the data corresponding to the 4 nodes of the model grid geographically closest to the model site were then extracted with subsequent bilinear interpolation to the specified point the soil climatic scenarios series of temperature and humidity of forest floor table 5 and the upper organo mineral soil horizon were generated using the scliss model bykhovets and komarov 2002 the basic climatic parameters of the scliss model for the south of moscow region were estimated using the data records of the kolomna meteorological station obtained from the website of all russian institute of hydrometeorological information world data center bulygina et al 2018 sherstyukov 2018 soil hydro physical properties were set corresponding to those for sandy podzols as initial conditions data on the microrelief and location of trees obtained from the field experiment in moscow region were used the area of the simulated territory was 500 m2 the modeling was carried out for 200 years 1901 2100 with a monthly step and without simulation of any other disturbances 2 2 5 the influence of dwarf shrubs on soil fertility in the simulation experiment the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in forest floor and mineral soil in pineta sylvestris fruticuloso hylocomiosa forests were estimated the estimation of the initial soil stocks of carbon and nitrogen was made for the soil typical for forests of the prioksko terrasny nature biosphere reserve ivanov et al 2006 and such estimation was based on the morphological description and physicochemical characteristics of the soil profiles presented in zolotareva et al 1983 from the set of soil geobotanical descriptions available in zolotareva et al 1983 a data on sod podzolic gleic sandy loam soil under the pine forest with green moss cover were chosen for this type of soil the data on carbon content in mineral horizons and the granulometric texture were available but there were no data on the nitrogen content and characteristics of forest floor the additional data on the content of nitrogen and the bulk density of different soil horizons were taken from priputina 2016 in the considered soils the thickness of the forest floor was 1 3 cm and the stocks of organic matter and nitrogen in the mineral horizons were allocated mostly down to a depth of 70 80 cm as a result the carbon stock in soil organic layer was estimated as 1 440 kg m 2 and the carbon stock in the mineral soil was estimated as 5 492 kg m 2 the nitrogen stock in forest floor was estimated as 0 029 kg m 2 and in mineral soil it comprised 0 199 kg m 2 to create climate scenarios that are necessary for modeling the dynamics of soil horizons using the soil climate simulator scliss bykhovets and komarov 2002 we used the data on meteorological observations of air temperature and precipitation in 1950 2017 at the baseline monitoring station of the prioksko terrasny nature biosphere reserve and from the kolomna meteorological station sherstyukov 2018 the scenarios of litterfall represent the growth of pure pine stands from the age of 20 years with two forest ground vegetation types green moss and dwarf shrub green moss which were typical for a large area of the prioksko terrasny nature biosphere reserve at the beginning of the conservation regime evaluation 2000 the initial age of the stand was chosen taking into account the average age of the pine forests according to the forest survey data of the 1940s when the reserve has been established when preparing the scenarios it was assumed that in the green moss type the contribution of green mosses to annual litterfall is very small compared to the litter produced by the tree layer and may be not taken into account remezov and pogrebnyak 1965 while the litter of dwarf shrubs is absent in the dwarf shrub green moss type on the contrary the above and belowground litter of v vitis idaea and v myrtillus was taken into account the data of different fractions of tree litter input mass and nitrogen content were obtained by modeling the growth of the corresponding tree stands using efimod model komarov et al 2003 the initial stand characteristics were taken from regional yield tables shvidenko et al 2008 with the initial density of 2000 trees ha 1 species specific nitrogen content in different litter fractions needles branches fine roots stem coarse roots was modeled by efimod taking the stand age and trophic level of forest soils into account komarov et al 2007 the effect of additional nitrogen deposition in precipitation on the growth rate of forest stands komarov and shanin 2012 was also taken into account the quantitative estimates of the dwarf shrubs litterfall were obtained using the campus s model similar to efimod the campus s model takes the species specific differences in nitrogen content for different fractions of bilberry and lingonberry litterfall into account modeling the dynamics of soil organic matter was carried out in the romul hum model komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b the simulation period was 68 years with monthly step 3 results and discussion 3 1 the analysis of the influence of the clonal spatial structure on the population dynamics the computational experiments showed that population consisting of clones with a sparse type of arrangement of daughter shoots along rhizomes have an advantage over the clones with close arrangement of shoots fig 10 this can be explained by lower competition intensity between the newly formed daughter shoots in the sparse pattern which gives better opportunities to capture the territory despite this fact the pattern with close location of shoots can be advantageous under conditions of extreme environmental stress or high between species competition since more favorable local soil conditions accumulation of moisture and organic matter are created inside the clusters for example this kind of clonal structure has been observed in areas with short growing season or industrial pollution salemaa and sievänen 2002 maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 3 2 the analysis of the influence of dynamic variance of ontogenesis on the sustainability of population the computational experiment showed that if only the mainstream type of ontogenesis is realized the death of the whole population occurs at annual damage of 10 and higher of the shoots fig 11 a when the dynamic variance of ontogenesis is realizing the population survives even if more than 50 of shoots are damaged the death of the population occurs only when 60 of shoots are damaged fig 11b the response of plants to external disturbances largely depends on the species and life form of the plant archer and tieszen 1980 bryant et al 1983 in clonal plants physiological integration between shoots can strongly improve the ability of a clone to recover after damage to the shoot system de kroon et al 2005 however the cutting of rhizomes connecting intact and damaged shoots can greatly slow down their recovery mattheis et al 1976 schmid et al 1988 damage may cause a delay in the fruiting of a clonal plant due to the increased consumption of resources necessary for vegetative propagation or the restoration of damaged plant tissue laine 1988 sonesson and callaghan 1991 bilberry and lingonberry populations can withstand trampling emanuelsson 1984 grazing emanuelsson 1984 laine 1988 atlegrim and sjöberg 1996 dahlgren et al 2007 soil freezing havas 1971 sjörs 1989 as well as selective cutting valova 1976 studies on the reaction of bilberry clones to damage to the shoot system were also carried out tolvanen et al 1994 hegland et al 2005 2010 one of the important reasons for the sustainability of bilberry clones is the presence of carbon stocks and nutrients most of which are stored in underground shoots rhizomes flower ellis 1971 pakonen et al 1991 and can be used in the case of damage to certain shoots dahlgren et al 2007 maslova 2014 the main mechanism of recovery of bilberry and lingonberry after damage is the activation of dormant buds located on the rhizomes or shoots emanuelsson 1984 tolvanen et al 1994 this recovery mechanism is especially important for plants growing in northern latitudes where the growing season is short and there is a shortage of nutrients especially nitrogen in the soil and these factors limit the growth and regeneration of plant populations in the boreal zone after damages archer and tieszen 1980 mattson 1980 cargill and jefferies 1984 in this study we show that another important reason for the sustainability of vaccinium populations is the dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis according to the simulation results bilberry populations with the implementation of dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis have higher resistance to external influences than populations representing consistent development of shoots the latter case results in a fragmentary ontogenetic spectrum where there are periods with no shoots of some ontogenetic states fig 12 a in the second case after going through the initial stages of development plants of all ontogenetic stages are presented in the population which is an indicator of its stable existence fig 12b similar population dynamics was observed earlier when modeling the growth of a species representing another life form a short rhizome herb plantago major l zhukova and komarov 1990 3 3 analysis of dynamics and productivity of bilberry and lingonberry populations in the moscow region in natural conditions the analysis showed that there are no differences in the mean values of the density of populations the cover and the biomass density for natural and modeled populations at a significance level of 0 01 no statistically significant differences between the distributions of these parameters for natural and modeled populations were found too table 6 the analysis of the homogeneity of the ontogenetic spectrums of the samples showed that the samples were not statistically significantly different fig 13 comparison of the spatial structure of natural and modeled populations showed that the number of blocks identical for natural and modeled populations was 10 452 while the total number of blocks was 12 500 thus the compliance of the spatial arrangement of the modeled populations with the field data was 83 6 fig 14 the results of this experiment showed correctness and the consistency of the simulated results with the experimental data 3 4 the assessment of the contribution of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium to the productivity of forest ecosystems with stationary climatic conditions the average biomass of bilberry was 0 047 kg m 2 and for lingonberry it was 0 073 kg m 2 climate change resulted in increased portion of lingonberry under the moderate climate change the shoots of bilberry were preserved only in the most humid patches of the simulated plot and as a result the average biomass of bilberry comprised only 0 0028 kg m 2 while the average biomass of lingonberry was 0 090 kg m 2 under the extreme climate change the population of bilberry was completely eliminated after 81 years and the average biomass of lingonberry reached 0 092 kg m 2 fig 15 the extinction of bilberry population under extreme climate change can be explained by the significant difference between the tolerance ranges to the volumetric moisture of forest floor for bilberry and lingonberry due to the increased evaporation from the soil surface with climate change the moisture of forest floor decreased even at the constant amount of precipitation thus becoming the leading limiting factor for the photosynthesis and as a result for the survival of bilberry population the increase of the average biomass of lingonberry can be explained by the fact that the moisture of forest floor is close to the optimal values ingestad 1973 skre 1975 kulmala et al 2008 as well as by the acceleration of the decomposition of organic matter in the soil resulting in increased release of mineral nitrogen available for nutrition by plants and by the absence of competition from the bilberry population 3 5 the influence of dwarf shrubs on soil fertility the litterfall of the dwarf shrub layer has higher nitrogen content in all fractions compared to the litterfall of pine stands vestgarden 2001 in the model estimates accounting of dwarf shrubs litterfall along with tree litterfall leads to decrease in the stocks of organic matter and nitrogen in forest floor and to increase in the stocks of organic matter and nitrogen in mineral horizons of the soil of pine forest with dwarf shrub and green moss cover compared to the pine forest with green moss cover fig 16 this can be explained by the differences in the rates of mineralization of litterfall with different c n ratios which is higher in all cohorts of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium compared to pine litterfall according to the studies the leaf litterfall of bilberry has higher concentrations of nitrogen and decomposes much faster than litter produced by lingonberry nilsson and wardle 2005 changes in the structure of plant communities of boreal forests including the forest ground vegetation can lead to remarkable changes in the quantity and quality of litterfall which in turn has a direct impact on soil carbon accumulation hättenschwiler and gasser 2005 the contribution of the forest ground vegetation to the total carbon and nitrogen cycle in forest ecosystems can reach 30 morén and lindroth 2000 and under some conditions 50 or even more likhanova 2014 lehtonen et al 2016 our research showed that the total contribution of dwarf shrubs to carbon dynamics was estimated as 48 and the corresponding contribution to the nitrogen dynamics was 46 in undisturbed development 4 conclusion the campus s model allows us to evaluate the effect of biological and ecological features of the dwarf shrubs species on their population dynamics and contribution to the nutrient cycling in boreal forest ecosystems the model can predict the population dynamics under ambient conditions and it also works under different external impacts such as ground fires recreational load damage related to cuttings increased nitrogen deposition and climate change the results of simulation experiments showed that morphological and dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis increases the resistance of dwarf shrubs populations to the external impacts furthermore simulations quantitatively confirmed the crucial role of the structural diversity in maintaining the sustainable development of plant populations in addition between species differences in ecological niches were shown to explain the species responses to changing environmental conditions particularly bilberry was predicted to decrease in density as a result of climate change while lingonberry obtained competitive advantage due to the differences in the tolerance ranges to abiotic environmental factors many earlier studies e g titlyanova 1979 morén and lindroth 2000 likhanova 2014 have shown that ground layer vegetation supplies a remarkable part of biomass turnover in forest ecosystems in this study we quantitatively estimated the contribution of vaccinium dwarf shrubs to the carbon and nitrogen cycling and showed that their contribution comprised about a half of the total contribution of boreal forest vegetation although the model parameters for only two plant species were estimated the structure of the model can simulate more complex communities consisting of interacting plants of different life forms if the data required for parameterization become available the combination of several approaches allows estimating the dynamics of plant communities both in terms of structural diversity and plant biomass the campus s model was specially designed to be further included into the upcoming forest ecosystem model which is the consecutive development of the well known model efimod komarov et al 2003 the combination with the dynamic sub models of tree stand and soil will provide a tool for the complex assessment of the response of forest ecosystems to different external impacts that is necessary for the planning of sustainable forest management taking into account the trade offs and synergies between various ecosystem services credit authorship contribution statement pavel frolov conceptualization methodology software validation visualization writing

24801,this study presents an example of the parameterization and validation of the campus s model for the dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium and the results of computational experiments showing the applicability of the model a quantitative analysis of the population dynamics of dwarf shrubs their productivity and contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycling in forest ecosystems was carried out the campus s model takes the morphology ontogenesis developmental stages and physiological features of modeled species into account both in undisturbed environmental conditions and under external natural and anthropogenic impacts including climate change the validation of the model was based on the independent field data and showed a high reliability of the results our simulation experiments showed that species specific properties of dwarf shrubs such as their structural and functional organization flexibility of ontogenesis and tolerance to a range of environmental factors determine the resistance of populations to different kinds of disturbances the speed of occupation of the territory and the ability to hold it we demonstrated that dwarf shrubs have an important contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycles of boreal forest ecosystems via above and belowground litter production keywords campus s model structural functional models bilberry lingonberry flexibility of ontogenesis c and n cycles 1 introduction anthropogenic impacts such as climate change nitrogen deposition and intensive forest management may cause loss of biodiversity in forest ecosystems and lead to their degradation therefore understanding the causes of long term environmental changes of forest ecosystems has become an important task in forest science although there have been advances in the studies on commercial wood and biofuels production in the last decades more knowledge is needed about sustainable use of forests to safeguard their biodiversity and ecosystem services in this study we focus to the dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium including bilberry vaccinium myrtillus l and lingonberry vaccinium vitis idaea l which cover an extensive part of the ground in boreal and tundra regions these species provide many ecosystem services like producing of berries affecting nutrient cycling titlyanova 1979 and colonizing bare soil after disturbances such as tree logging fires floods and recreational activities the effect of tree litterfall on nutrient cycling in the organic and mineral soil has been much studied in the 20th century heath et al 1964 kovda 1973 parton et al 1988 however only in the recent years the role of ground vegetation in carbon and nitrogen cycles in boreal forests has been investigated nilsson and wardle 2005 kolari et al 2006 hilli et al 2010 merilä et al 2013 lehtonen et al 2016 although ground vegetation represents a relatively minor component of the whole biomass of boreal forests it plays an important role in the annual biomass production and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem especially the litter of deciduous dwarf shrubs e g bilberry herbs and grasses has a higher rate of decomposition than the litter from conifers this means that the litter produced by the understory vegetation is likely to has a major impact on soil forming processes clonal growth pattern is common in the northern plant communities dietz and steinlein 2001 clonal plants are formed from genetically identical units ramets modules that enable plants to respond to environmental variation by changing their architecture liu et al 2016 furthermore vegetative reproduction ensures physiological integration between shoots and it is of great importance for recovery and spreading of most species of forest ground vegetation sexual reproduction via spore and seed propagation requires specific conditions while vegetative propagation is possible in conditions that are minimally necessary for the growth of the organism levina 1981 vegetative propagation requires less energy than generative one and does not lead to a decrease in biomass production muir 1995 vegetative organs like rhizomes store large amounts of nutrients that ensure development of dormant bud reserve lortie and aarssen 2000 which enable higher growth rates than seeds maslova 2014 the development of a plant unit pu of the same species may vary evstigneev and korotkov 2016 rabotnov 1969 and his successors uranov 1975 gatzuk et al 1980 created a system for determining the age differentiation of individuals based on the ontogenesis of organisms from birth to death this method provides division of the individual development into periods ontogenetic stages that reflect the biological age of the plant individuals of the same calendar age may be at different stages of ontogenetic development zaugol nova et al 1988 smirnova et al 2002 as a rule asynchronous development of individuals polyvariance of ontogenesis is determined by different living conditions zhukova and komarov 1990 distinguished several classes of polyvariance of development rates normal delayed and accelerated development skipping of ontogenetic stages reversion to earlier stages due to rejuvenation secondary dormancy this feature allows populations to maintain their structure in the changing environmental conditions the polyvariance of ontogenesis of bilberry and lingonberry can be of five types dynamic rhythmological dimensional morphological and polyvariance of the ways of reproduction and dissemination notov and zhukova 2019 climate change affects plant communities and their ecosystem services especially in the northern vegetation zones jägerbrand et al 2011 villén peréz et al 2020 growth of clonal dwarf shrubs and many ecological processes in forests take long time and assessment of ecosystem services requires consideration of a large number of interrelated factors which makes it difficult to conduct controlled experiments to understand how the growth of bilberry and lingonberry will change in the future and how this affects ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services it is necessary to apply simulation techniques the aim of this study is to quantify population dynamics of bilberry and lingonberry and to estimate their contribution to the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in different environmental conditions the results are used in evaluating how well the campus s model frolov et al submitted allows us to simulate the population dynamics and biomass production of plant species in a spatially heterogeneous environment for light temperature moisture and n content in soil the applied model uses several modeling techniques matrix l systems and cellular automata modeling the genetic species specific features are defined for each ontogenetic stage l systems while their implementation for certain individuals in the course of modeling depends on external conditions cellular automata to implement the variance of the transitions between ontogenetic stages the matrix modeling method is used the spatial resolution of the model is 1 cm2 the time step is one month the model consists of two submodels submodel of the plant populations structure and submodel of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in plants and soil we hypothesize that h1 the combination of cellular automata matrix modeling and l system techniques allows us to simulate the population dynamics of dwarf shrubs in a spatially heterogeneous environment and also to take the individual characteristics of organisms in the mass balance approach to predict their productivity into account h2 species specific properties of dwarf shrubs such as their structural organization polyvariance of ontogenesis and tolerance to environmental factors determine resistance of populations to external influences speed of occupation of a territory and an ability to hold it h3 dwarf shrubs have a significant contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycles in forest ecosystems due to high biomass turnover rate and they act as a reserve pool of carbon and nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 parameterization of the campus s model 2 1 1 submodel of the dynamics of plant populations v myrtillus and v vitis idaea are long rhizomatous dwarf shrubs serebryakov 1962 and represent chamaephytes raunkiaer 1905 both species form extensive clones consisting of sets of genetically identical ramets shoots with a piece of belowground rhizome grown vegetatively from the seed born mother plant serebryakova et al 2006 the lifespan of clones according to different estimations varies from 30 flower ellis 1971 even to 120 years shutov 2001 prokopyeva 2006 both bilberry and lingonberry have an intensively branched rhizome system with large number of thin adventitious roots heath et al 1938 the rhizomes of both species are located principally in the upper organic soil layers of forests but under unfavorable conditions they can grow down to deeper mineral soil layers that explain their tolerance to ground fires and sensitivity to waterlogging grelet 2001 both species form orthotropic shoots from buds located on rhizomes but there are many morphological differences between the species thin bilberry leaves are short lived deciduous living less than 10 months flower ellis 1971 while the lifespan of thick lingonberry winter green leaves lasts from 2 5 to 4 years karlsson 1992 the average leaf area and length of shoot internodes corresponding annual growths are quite similar in both species but bilberry stems are thicker than those of lingonberry bilberry stems remain green for at least one year enabling photosynthesis also without leaves welch et al 1994 the height of bilberry shoots generally is 15 30 cm while those of lingonberry are somewhat lower the growth habit of bilberry shoots and rhizomes is sympodial branching from axillary buds the growth of lingonberry shoots is predominantly monopodial with a stronger apical development but only sympodial growth is possible after flowering tolvanen 1995 the distance between the shoots along the rhizome of bilberry is 10 15 cm while that of lingonberry is longer and can reach even 100 150 cm the perennial shoots go through different ontogenetic stages but there could be large size variation within the stages for instance the difference in the shoot height of virginal stage of bilberry can be more than 20 cm depending on their vitality zhukova and zubkova 2016 the development of genets and ramets of bilberry and lingonberry during the ontogenesis is described in polyanskaya et al 2000 shutov 2001 maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 the data used to parameterize the architectural structure and biomass partitioning of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea was obtained from the two data sets 1 area based biomass samples including belowground organs in organic soil layer from boreal spruce and pine forests in finland and 2 complete clones sampled from pine forests in hemi boreal zone of russia in addition we used a large volume of data from experimental studies published in scientific literature to parameterize the two sub models the summary of the used data sources is provided in table 1 and their detailed description is given below for the analysis of architectural structure and ontogenetic stages we excavated complete clones of bilberry and lingonberry as monoliths within soil blocks in depths in which most of rhizomes and roots were located 15 30 cm then the plants were carefully washed so that the structure and mutual arrangement of above and underground organs stayed unchanged we recorded the number of all shoots of a clone and determined the absolute age and ontogenetic stage of individual shoots the projection area of aboveground parts of individual shoots the branching angles of rhizomes and the distance between the dormant buds on rhizomes as an example of the morphological flexibility of bilberry and lingonberry the variation of the distance between shoots on rhizomes has been observed zubkova et al 2016 in that study the distance between the neighboring shoots along rhizomes were measured and three patterns of shoot arrangements were found fig 1 single growing of single shoots at relatively regular distances of 6 11 cm from each other pairwise growing of two shoots as a group on the rhizome at a distance of 0 3 0 5 cm from each other since the two buds were activated simultaneously the shoots were usually of the same age and ontogenetic stage as a rule this pattern was due to the death of the growth tip of the rhizome which according to our observations often occurred in the winter period group growing of 4 shoots for bilberry or 4 8 shoots for lingonberry as a group on the rhizome at a distance of 0 3 0 5 cm from each other in the surveyed area in russia such formations were observed in more fertile conditions as estimated using the species composition of vegetation all three patterns can be observed within the same clone since each of the three patterns leads to different realization of the spatial distribution of pu we used all three shoot patterns to create model schemes for the ontogenesis of bilberry and lingonberry fig 2 dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis can be expressed as age based development of pu at different ontogenetic stages or as stage based transitions of each element from one ontogenetic stage to another we calculated the possible duration of ontogenetic stages of bilberry and lingonberry on the basis of the literature ontogenetic atlas of plants 2013 shutov 2001 prokopyeva 2006 due to the high variability of the data structure some researchers took the winter months into account others omitted them when specifying the age an additional analysis of the ratio of absolute age and ontogenetic stage was required in addition to own data from the moscow region altogether 471 bilberry and 438 lingonberry shoots in pine forests we used the data from the kola peninsula 1457 bilberry and 1389 lingonberry shoots in pine forests maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 to estimate the duration of the ontogenetic stages the stages were estimated in relative terms as parts of the growing period enabling to summarize data across regions with different climatic conditions table 2 we determined the potential transitions between the ontogenetic stages of bilberry and lingonberry using the literature data prokopyeva 2006 shutov 2001 maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 the analysis showed that the potential transitions between the stages of bilberry and lingonberry coincide the parameterization of the transition probabilities between ontogenetic stages was carried out by the exhaustive search method knuth 1997 in the 0 1 probability range with a step of 0 1 as a criterion for the accuracy of the selection of probabilities we used the comparison of the ontogenetic spectra of a model population at the 600 th modeling step 50 th year under constant optimal external conditions with the basic ontogenetic spectrum of populations of the studied species the most common methods for comparing samples are pearson s agreement criterion χ2 and fisher s exact test for r c tables johnson et al 2015 however these methods are not applicable when comparing ontogenetic spectra since ontogenetic states are ordered classes they successively follow each other during the ontogenesis in this connection we used a regression model for ordered classes kleinbaum and klein 2010 in comparing ontogenetic spectrums between observed and modeled populations the resulting probability matrices for transitions between the ontogenetic states of bilberry and lingonberry are presented in table 3 we used data from literature to determine the seed production and germination of the studies species in sweden in pine forests of various ages 50 120 169 years bilberry and lingonberry seeds were found both inside the thick moss and on the border between organic and mineral soil layers which indicates continuous production of seeds by generative individuals granström 1982 the average number of berries per a shoot was 10 15 for bilberry afanas eva and kashin 2015 and 25 30 for lingonberry prokopyeva 2006 one berry of both bilberry and lingonberry contained on average 30 seeds hall and shay 1981 but their germination in laboratory experiments did not exceed 15 and in the natural environment it usually comprises 0 0 05 granström 1982 vander kloet 1988 in the presence of dense moss cover the germination of bilberry and lingonberry seeds was very low and the species reproduce only vegetatively also when some disturbance created gaps in the moss layer grime et al 2014 in this regard the seed germination sexual reproduction of the studied species was not taken into account in the simulation 2 2 2 submodel of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in plants and soil in analyzing the dependence of biomass production of bilberry and lingonberry on environmental factors we used literature data characterizing various aspects of photosynthesis of these species the maximum possible intensity of photosynthesis pmax was calculated by analyzing the literature data on the dependence of the instantaneous gross photosynthetic production gpp on the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation par kolari et al 2006 the instantaneous values were integrated up to the daily sums based on the daily dynamics of par and then converted to monthly values by multiplying by the average number of days in the month fig 3 for lingonberry pmax was 0 0061 mol m 2 mon 1 for bilberry it was 0 014 mol m 2 mon 1 the half saturation constant values km of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea were calculated using non linear regression to determine the quality of the non linear regression equation the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj which uses unbiased estimates of variances was used hereinafter km for bilberry was 90 03 r2 adj 0 99 and for lingonberry it comprised 80 09 r2 adj 0 99 the coefficients of the response functions of the photosynthesis intensity to environmental factors were obtained using nonlinear regression based on literature data the rhizomes and roots of bilberry and lingonberry are usually located at a shallow depth flower ellis 1971 tear 1972 in the forest floor which can be considered as the prevailing source of nutrients for these species although flower ellis noted the possibility of the location of the old rhizomes in the mineral horizons of the soil tear 1972 noted that the development of lingonberry is promoted by the presence of rapidly decomposing organic matter the sources of which can be old stumps and anthills the dependence of the relative photosynthesis intensity of bilberry and lingonberry on the content of available nitrogen in the soil fig 4 was described by ingestad 1973 in this study the photosynthesis intensity of pregenerative ontogenetic stages of bilberry and lingonberry were investigated on a phytotron the given values were recalculated from kg m 3 to kg m 2 for a soil layer of 0 30 cm root inhabited layer for both species the minimum values of the content of mineral nitrogen in soil for both species were 0 0005 kg n m 2 and the optimal values were close 0 0066 kg n m 2 for lingonberry and 0 0071 kg n m 2 for bilberry while the maximum values varied almost 4 fold 0 0457 kg n m 2 for lingonberry and 0 16 kg n m 2 for bilberry the empirical coefficient ε was calculated by non linear regression for v myrtillus it was estimated as 10 05 and for v vitis idaea it comprised 29 87 in both cases r2 adj 0 99 the dependence of the relative photosynthesis intensity of the studied species on air temperature fig 5 is described by nygaard 1975 who studied the acclimatization of the studied species and by skre 1975 who studied co2 exchange in norwegian tundra plants literature data were recalculated from the absolute values of photosynthesis intensity or gas exchange rate into the relative values the minimum temperature required for photosynthesis of bilberry is 5 c and that one for photosynthesis of lingonberry is 5 c the optimum temperatures are 15 and 27 c and the maximum temperatures are 37 and 40 c for bilberry and lingonberry respectively the empirical coefficient ε was estimated by non linear regression for v myrtillus it is 0 1 for v vitis idaea it is 0 08 in both cases r2 adj 0 95 usually when investigating photosynthesis the soil water potential is used to assess the response of photosynthesis intensity to the water availability however calculation of this parameter for the forest floor in which the most of shrub roots are located is difficult due to its high heterogeneity therefore as a criterion of water availability we used the volumetric moisture of the forest floor the parameterization of the dependence of the photosynthesis intensity on the moisture of the root inhabited soil layer fig 6 was carried out on the basis of the study of the photosynthesis of forest ground vegetation kulmala et al 2008 and karlsson s 1985 research on the dependence of the photosynthesis rate of dwarf shrubs of the vaccinium genus on soil moisture the minimum soil moisture content for photosynthesis of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea does not differ 4 the optimal value for bilberry is 65 and for lingonberry it is 34 the maximum volumetric moisture is 81 and 67 for bilberry and lingonberry respectively the empirical coefficient ε was estimated by non linear regression for v myrtillus it is 0 061 r2 adj 0 95 and for v vitis idaea it is 0 07 r2 adj 0 97 to determine the distribution of biomass of bilberry and lingonberry between organs and to calculate the coefficients of the power function equation we used the biomass data sampled from finland and russia the plant biomass was sorted out by organs the obtained samples were dried until reaching the constant mass when analyzing the data the following sequences of biomass fractions with decreased portion of given organ in the total biomass were revealed bilberry 0 rhizomes 1 stems 2 fine roots 3 leaves lingonberry 0 rhizomes 1 stems 2 leaves 3 fine roots for each sample the coefficients of the exponential function equation fig 7 were calculated by the non linear regression method in each case the coefficient r2 adj was more than 0 98 next data for bilberry and lingonberry was averaged over the median biomass of each fraction the averaged data was also used for calculation of the values of the coefficients ka and kb for the exponential function the phenological stage of vegetative growth and flowering of the studied species in different regions has been analyzed shutov 2001 prokopyeva 2006 in general the growth of shoots and leaves occurs during the first 1 2 months in the beginning of the growing season assumed in our study as a period with annual monthly temperature higher than 5 c regardless of its length after which the formation of flowers begins in bilberry partly overlapping with leaf growth the fruits ripen in the middle of the growing season since we found no published information about seasonal development of rhizomes we carried out monthly observations from may to november of the length growth of underground rhizomes in the pineta sylvestris fruticuloso hylocomiosa site russia the growth rate of rhizomes varied from 1 to 6 cm per month up to 17 cm per season and the growth was observed over the entire growing season due to the lack of literature data on the growth of fine roots during the growing season and the inability to conduct field experiments the assumption was made that fine roots grow like rhizomes over the entire growing season when parameterizing the shares of different fractions of litterfall during the growing season we found that only dead stems and rhizomes were detached and fell off zubkova et al 2016 the leaves of both species were shed in the last month of the growing season in bilberry the portion of shed leaves was 100 and in lingonberry 25 holloway 1981 due to the lack of the data on fine root age we assumed that their biomass is completely replaced during the growing season i e the turnover rate was 1 0 year 1 nitrogen concentrations in different organs of the studied species were determined by summarizing the results of various studies lähdesmäki et al 1990 grelet et al 2001 gerdol et al 2004 parzych et al 2010 and own data based on these datasets a summary table table 4 of nitrogen concentrations in organs of bilberry and lingonberry was compiled 2 2 simulation experiments 2 2 1 the analysis of the influence of the clonal spatial structure on the population dynamics the competitive advantages of lingonberry populations with different patterns of the location of daughter shoots on the rhizome morphological variance in the absence of seed propagation were analyzed using the campus s model two patterns occurring in natural populations were considered plants with a close location of daughter shoots at the distance of 1 cm from each other fig 8 a and plants with a sparse arrangement of buds at the distance of 5 6 cm fig 8b other parameters of the model were taken the same the simulation was carried out for 100 years without taking external influences into account 2 2 2 the analysis of the influence of dynamic variance of ontogenesis on the sustainability of population using the campus s model we analyzed the dynamics of two bilberry populations with the same growth patterns during ontogenesis but with different transition matrices between ontogenetic stages both in the absence of external influences and with damage of shoots of varying intensity the impacts were simulated to occur annually every july starting from the 25th year of modeling and the damage intensity the proportion of damaged shoots varied in the range from 5 to 60 the simulation was carried out for 100 years the initial number of seeds was 50 per m2 to avoid random effects related to the different initial arrangement of seeds during different runs of the model the parameters of pseudo random number generator were fixed two different transition probability matrices were used 1 where all transitions between ontogenetic stages occur sequentially only the mainstream type of ontogenesis is realized 2 a transition matrix corresponding to the development of populations observed in nature the dynamic variance of ontogenesis with branching transitions 2 2 3 analysis of dynamics and productivity of bilberry and lingonberry populations in the moscow region in natural conditions the field data for this experiment was obtained from the complex field experiment in pine forests of the moscow region on the rectangular plot of 20 25 m topographic survey was conducted with a resolution 0 2 0 2 m elevation difference within the investigated area was 1 51 m in general the surface falls in the direction from the northeast to southwest corner of the site the resulting map of the microrelief is shown in fig 9 in addition to measuring the microrelief the dominating species of the living ground cover in a square of 0 2 0 2 m was recorded with its center at the point at which the microrelief was measured the areas dominated either by bilberry lower areas or by lingonberry higher areas were identified as well as areas where bilberry and lingonberry co dominated in the lower parts of the site lingonberry was found only on elevations around the tree stems 25 monoliths of 0 25 0 25 m in size were excavated on the same plot along the transect parallel to the longer side at the distance of 5 m from its northern border above and belowground organs of the studied species were separated washed dried at 60 c to an absolutely dry state and weighted additionally the forest floor thickness was measured at each point of the monoliths excavation to estimate the number of shoots per square meter and the ontogenetic spectrum of populations in different parts of the plot with monodominance of bilberry lingonberry and co dominance of both species 16 small plots of 0 25 0 25 m were established at each small plot the projective cover and the number of shoots of each ontogenetic stage were measured the following data set was prepared as input parameters of environmental conditions the microrelief map obtained by mapping the sample plot the dynamic irradiance map at the ground level for each month obtained using the efimod model komarov et al 2003 with extended canopy light transmission sub routine shanin et al 2020 where the allocation of trees was taken according to the field data annual data were interpolated to monthly step taking into account the seasonal dynamics of the daylight hours and the vegetation phases the temperature and moisture of forest floor and mineral soil for this territory from 1942 to 2017 obtained using the scliss model bykhovets and komarov 2002 based on meteorological data the initial values of the pools of soil organic matter carbon and nitrogen content in l f and h pools of forest floor and in mineral soil were parameterized based on data obtained from field experiments the range of the spatial variation of temperature and volumetric moisture of forest floor over the simulated area was 5 c and 10 respectively model runs were performed in 100 fold repetition for 75 years the initial distribution of seeds of both species 100 seeds of each species per m2 was random the size of the modeled area was 20 25 m 500 m2 comparison of the nature data and the results of model simulations were carried out on the basis of 5 parameters the density of populations number of shoots per m2 the projective cover the ontogenetic spectra of populations the spatial distribution of populations over the area the biomass density of populations kg m 2 when comparing the density the projective cover and the biomass of natural and modeled populations of bilberry and lingonberry the same technique was used two statistical hypotheses were tested 1 the mean values of the analyzed parameters for the modeled and natural populations do not differ 2 the distributions of the analyzed parameters for the modeled and natural populations do not differ due to the fact that none of the analyzed parameters of populations both of bilberry and lingonberry followed the normal distribution the shapiro wilk test at a significance level of 0 05 to test the hypothesis of equality of the mean values of the analyzed parameters the wilcoxon s non parametric test was used the distributions of the above parameters were compared using pearson s χ2 test the analysis of the distribution of the ontogenetic spectra of the natural and modeled populations was carried out in several steps the sub samples randomly selected squares of 1 m2 were combined within each sample populations their distributions were summarized and then the homogeneity of the ontogenetic spectra of the samples was checked using the χ2 test during analysis of the spatial distribution of populations data on the location of the shoots of bilberry and lingonberry were combined into blocks of 20 20 cm and divided into 4 groups 1 the blocks with only lingonberry shoots presented 2 the blocks with both bilberry and lingonberry shoots presented 3 the blocks with only bilberry shoots presented 4 the blocks with no shoots of any of these species to compare the spatial arrangement of the modeled and natural populations based on the data obtained in field experiments and with simulations the two dimensional arrays of 100 125 elements were formed each element of the arrays contained a numeric encoding from 1 to 4 of corresponding spatial block then an array of the same size was generated containing the calculated element wise difference between the original arrays 2 2 4 the assessment of the contribution of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium to the productivity of forest ecosystems the simulations were carried out for the territory of the moscow region under three different climatic scenarios stationary climatic conditions moderate climate change and extreme climate change current views on possible climate change scenarios in the 21st century are stated in the 5th assessment report of the ipcc stocker 2014 and the 2nd assessment report of the federal service for hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring of russia roshydromet 2014 they are based on a new family of rcp greenhouse gas emission scenarios in this new family of scenarios of anthropogenic impact on the climate system rcp representative concentration pathways the digital index of scenario characterizes the magnitude of anthropogenic radiation exposure i e an increase in planetary radiation balance achieved by 2100 in w m 2 in the simulations we applied the most widely used scenarios rcp4 5 moderate and rcp8 5 extreme for construction of the local climatic scenarios we used the outputs of the global climate model inmcm4 of the institute of computational mathematics of the russian academy of sciences volodin et al 2013 these data with monthly resolution were obtained from the website of the german climate computing center dkrz knutti 2014a b c one of the world centers of the ipcc climate data the extraction of local series from the large scale netcdf files containing simulation results for the entire globe was carried out using the ncdf4 package pierce 2017 for the statistical programming environment r r core team 2012 the data corresponding to the 4 nodes of the model grid geographically closest to the model site were then extracted with subsequent bilinear interpolation to the specified point the soil climatic scenarios series of temperature and humidity of forest floor table 5 and the upper organo mineral soil horizon were generated using the scliss model bykhovets and komarov 2002 the basic climatic parameters of the scliss model for the south of moscow region were estimated using the data records of the kolomna meteorological station obtained from the website of all russian institute of hydrometeorological information world data center bulygina et al 2018 sherstyukov 2018 soil hydro physical properties were set corresponding to those for sandy podzols as initial conditions data on the microrelief and location of trees obtained from the field experiment in moscow region were used the area of the simulated territory was 500 m2 the modeling was carried out for 200 years 1901 2100 with a monthly step and without simulation of any other disturbances 2 2 5 the influence of dwarf shrubs on soil fertility in the simulation experiment the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in forest floor and mineral soil in pineta sylvestris fruticuloso hylocomiosa forests were estimated the estimation of the initial soil stocks of carbon and nitrogen was made for the soil typical for forests of the prioksko terrasny nature biosphere reserve ivanov et al 2006 and such estimation was based on the morphological description and physicochemical characteristics of the soil profiles presented in zolotareva et al 1983 from the set of soil geobotanical descriptions available in zolotareva et al 1983 a data on sod podzolic gleic sandy loam soil under the pine forest with green moss cover were chosen for this type of soil the data on carbon content in mineral horizons and the granulometric texture were available but there were no data on the nitrogen content and characteristics of forest floor the additional data on the content of nitrogen and the bulk density of different soil horizons were taken from priputina 2016 in the considered soils the thickness of the forest floor was 1 3 cm and the stocks of organic matter and nitrogen in the mineral horizons were allocated mostly down to a depth of 70 80 cm as a result the carbon stock in soil organic layer was estimated as 1 440 kg m 2 and the carbon stock in the mineral soil was estimated as 5 492 kg m 2 the nitrogen stock in forest floor was estimated as 0 029 kg m 2 and in mineral soil it comprised 0 199 kg m 2 to create climate scenarios that are necessary for modeling the dynamics of soil horizons using the soil climate simulator scliss bykhovets and komarov 2002 we used the data on meteorological observations of air temperature and precipitation in 1950 2017 at the baseline monitoring station of the prioksko terrasny nature biosphere reserve and from the kolomna meteorological station sherstyukov 2018 the scenarios of litterfall represent the growth of pure pine stands from the age of 20 years with two forest ground vegetation types green moss and dwarf shrub green moss which were typical for a large area of the prioksko terrasny nature biosphere reserve at the beginning of the conservation regime evaluation 2000 the initial age of the stand was chosen taking into account the average age of the pine forests according to the forest survey data of the 1940s when the reserve has been established when preparing the scenarios it was assumed that in the green moss type the contribution of green mosses to annual litterfall is very small compared to the litter produced by the tree layer and may be not taken into account remezov and pogrebnyak 1965 while the litter of dwarf shrubs is absent in the dwarf shrub green moss type on the contrary the above and belowground litter of v vitis idaea and v myrtillus was taken into account the data of different fractions of tree litter input mass and nitrogen content were obtained by modeling the growth of the corresponding tree stands using efimod model komarov et al 2003 the initial stand characteristics were taken from regional yield tables shvidenko et al 2008 with the initial density of 2000 trees ha 1 species specific nitrogen content in different litter fractions needles branches fine roots stem coarse roots was modeled by efimod taking the stand age and trophic level of forest soils into account komarov et al 2007 the effect of additional nitrogen deposition in precipitation on the growth rate of forest stands komarov and shanin 2012 was also taken into account the quantitative estimates of the dwarf shrubs litterfall were obtained using the campus s model similar to efimod the campus s model takes the species specific differences in nitrogen content for different fractions of bilberry and lingonberry litterfall into account modeling the dynamics of soil organic matter was carried out in the romul hum model komarov et al 2017 chertov et al 2017a b the simulation period was 68 years with monthly step 3 results and discussion 3 1 the analysis of the influence of the clonal spatial structure on the population dynamics the computational experiments showed that population consisting of clones with a sparse type of arrangement of daughter shoots along rhizomes have an advantage over the clones with close arrangement of shoots fig 10 this can be explained by lower competition intensity between the newly formed daughter shoots in the sparse pattern which gives better opportunities to capture the territory despite this fact the pattern with close location of shoots can be advantageous under conditions of extreme environmental stress or high between species competition since more favorable local soil conditions accumulation of moisture and organic matter are created inside the clusters for example this kind of clonal structure has been observed in areas with short growing season or industrial pollution salemaa and sievänen 2002 maznaya and lyanguzova 2010 3 2 the analysis of the influence of dynamic variance of ontogenesis on the sustainability of population the computational experiment showed that if only the mainstream type of ontogenesis is realized the death of the whole population occurs at annual damage of 10 and higher of the shoots fig 11 a when the dynamic variance of ontogenesis is realizing the population survives even if more than 50 of shoots are damaged the death of the population occurs only when 60 of shoots are damaged fig 11b the response of plants to external disturbances largely depends on the species and life form of the plant archer and tieszen 1980 bryant et al 1983 in clonal plants physiological integration between shoots can strongly improve the ability of a clone to recover after damage to the shoot system de kroon et al 2005 however the cutting of rhizomes connecting intact and damaged shoots can greatly slow down their recovery mattheis et al 1976 schmid et al 1988 damage may cause a delay in the fruiting of a clonal plant due to the increased consumption of resources necessary for vegetative propagation or the restoration of damaged plant tissue laine 1988 sonesson and callaghan 1991 bilberry and lingonberry populations can withstand trampling emanuelsson 1984 grazing emanuelsson 1984 laine 1988 atlegrim and sjöberg 1996 dahlgren et al 2007 soil freezing havas 1971 sjörs 1989 as well as selective cutting valova 1976 studies on the reaction of bilberry clones to damage to the shoot system were also carried out tolvanen et al 1994 hegland et al 2005 2010 one of the important reasons for the sustainability of bilberry clones is the presence of carbon stocks and nutrients most of which are stored in underground shoots rhizomes flower ellis 1971 pakonen et al 1991 and can be used in the case of damage to certain shoots dahlgren et al 2007 maslova 2014 the main mechanism of recovery of bilberry and lingonberry after damage is the activation of dormant buds located on the rhizomes or shoots emanuelsson 1984 tolvanen et al 1994 this recovery mechanism is especially important for plants growing in northern latitudes where the growing season is short and there is a shortage of nutrients especially nitrogen in the soil and these factors limit the growth and regeneration of plant populations in the boreal zone after damages archer and tieszen 1980 mattson 1980 cargill and jefferies 1984 in this study we show that another important reason for the sustainability of vaccinium populations is the dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis according to the simulation results bilberry populations with the implementation of dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis have higher resistance to external influences than populations representing consistent development of shoots the latter case results in a fragmentary ontogenetic spectrum where there are periods with no shoots of some ontogenetic states fig 12 a in the second case after going through the initial stages of development plants of all ontogenetic stages are presented in the population which is an indicator of its stable existence fig 12b similar population dynamics was observed earlier when modeling the growth of a species representing another life form a short rhizome herb plantago major l zhukova and komarov 1990 3 3 analysis of dynamics and productivity of bilberry and lingonberry populations in the moscow region in natural conditions the analysis showed that there are no differences in the mean values of the density of populations the cover and the biomass density for natural and modeled populations at a significance level of 0 01 no statistically significant differences between the distributions of these parameters for natural and modeled populations were found too table 6 the analysis of the homogeneity of the ontogenetic spectrums of the samples showed that the samples were not statistically significantly different fig 13 comparison of the spatial structure of natural and modeled populations showed that the number of blocks identical for natural and modeled populations was 10 452 while the total number of blocks was 12 500 thus the compliance of the spatial arrangement of the modeled populations with the field data was 83 6 fig 14 the results of this experiment showed correctness and the consistency of the simulated results with the experimental data 3 4 the assessment of the contribution of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium to the productivity of forest ecosystems with stationary climatic conditions the average biomass of bilberry was 0 047 kg m 2 and for lingonberry it was 0 073 kg m 2 climate change resulted in increased portion of lingonberry under the moderate climate change the shoots of bilberry were preserved only in the most humid patches of the simulated plot and as a result the average biomass of bilberry comprised only 0 0028 kg m 2 while the average biomass of lingonberry was 0 090 kg m 2 under the extreme climate change the population of bilberry was completely eliminated after 81 years and the average biomass of lingonberry reached 0 092 kg m 2 fig 15 the extinction of bilberry population under extreme climate change can be explained by the significant difference between the tolerance ranges to the volumetric moisture of forest floor for bilberry and lingonberry due to the increased evaporation from the soil surface with climate change the moisture of forest floor decreased even at the constant amount of precipitation thus becoming the leading limiting factor for the photosynthesis and as a result for the survival of bilberry population the increase of the average biomass of lingonberry can be explained by the fact that the moisture of forest floor is close to the optimal values ingestad 1973 skre 1975 kulmala et al 2008 as well as by the acceleration of the decomposition of organic matter in the soil resulting in increased release of mineral nitrogen available for nutrition by plants and by the absence of competition from the bilberry population 3 5 the influence of dwarf shrubs on soil fertility the litterfall of the dwarf shrub layer has higher nitrogen content in all fractions compared to the litterfall of pine stands vestgarden 2001 in the model estimates accounting of dwarf shrubs litterfall along with tree litterfall leads to decrease in the stocks of organic matter and nitrogen in forest floor and to increase in the stocks of organic matter and nitrogen in mineral horizons of the soil of pine forest with dwarf shrub and green moss cover compared to the pine forest with green moss cover fig 16 this can be explained by the differences in the rates of mineralization of litterfall with different c n ratios which is higher in all cohorts of dwarf shrubs of the genus vaccinium compared to pine litterfall according to the studies the leaf litterfall of bilberry has higher concentrations of nitrogen and decomposes much faster than litter produced by lingonberry nilsson and wardle 2005 changes in the structure of plant communities of boreal forests including the forest ground vegetation can lead to remarkable changes in the quantity and quality of litterfall which in turn has a direct impact on soil carbon accumulation hättenschwiler and gasser 2005 the contribution of the forest ground vegetation to the total carbon and nitrogen cycle in forest ecosystems can reach 30 morén and lindroth 2000 and under some conditions 50 or even more likhanova 2014 lehtonen et al 2016 our research showed that the total contribution of dwarf shrubs to carbon dynamics was estimated as 48 and the corresponding contribution to the nitrogen dynamics was 46 in undisturbed development 4 conclusion the campus s model allows us to evaluate the effect of biological and ecological features of the dwarf shrubs species on their population dynamics and contribution to the nutrient cycling in boreal forest ecosystems the model can predict the population dynamics under ambient conditions and it also works under different external impacts such as ground fires recreational load damage related to cuttings increased nitrogen deposition and climate change the results of simulation experiments showed that morphological and dynamic flexibility of ontogenesis increases the resistance of dwarf shrubs populations to the external impacts furthermore simulations quantitatively confirmed the crucial role of the structural diversity in maintaining the sustainable development of plant populations in addition between species differences in ecological niches were shown to explain the species responses to changing environmental conditions particularly bilberry was predicted to decrease in density as a result of climate change while lingonberry obtained competitive advantage due to the differences in the tolerance ranges to abiotic environmental factors many earlier studies e g titlyanova 1979 morén and lindroth 2000 likhanova 2014 have shown that ground layer vegetation supplies a remarkable part of biomass turnover in forest ecosystems in this study we quantitatively estimated the contribution of vaccinium dwarf shrubs to the carbon and nitrogen cycling and showed that their contribution comprised about a half of the total contribution of boreal forest vegetation although the model parameters for only two plant species were estimated the structure of the model can simulate more complex communities consisting of interacting plants of different life forms if the data required for parameterization become available the combination of several approaches allows estimating the dynamics of plant communities both in terms of structural diversity and plant biomass the campus s model was specially designed to be further included into the upcoming forest ecosystem model which is the consecutive development of the well known model efimod komarov et al 2003 the combination with the dynamic sub models of tree stand and soil will provide a tool for the complex assessment of the response of forest ecosystems to different external impacts that is necessary for the planning of sustainable forest management taking into account the trade offs and synergies between various ecosystem services credit authorship contribution statement pavel frolov conceptualization methodology software validation visualization writing

24802,a model framework for national greenhouse gas emission and removal estimation for canadian peatlands camp v2 0 was developed and tested it provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest generic carbon budget model gcbm developed to eventually replace the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector cbm cfs3 as the core model in canada s national forest carbon monitoring accounting and reporting system the camp v2 0 provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories it tracks the growth turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components foliage branches stems and roots of trees shrubs sedges and mosses it uses a q10 relationship to model peat c pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth the camp takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally available canadian fire weather index drought code to predict long term and annual water table depth the camp v2 0 provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version model behavior and sensitivity were assessed and evaluated against observed flux data results suggest that the camp v2 0 provides an appropriate structure for large spatial and temporal scale estimation of emissions owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g c ha 1 y 1 n 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites and by 8 g c ha 1 y 1 when weighted by site location n 12 sites 3 years of data per site the model overestimated net ecosystem exchange nee by 20 g c ha 1 y 1 n 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites and by 2 g c ha 1 y 1 when weighted by site location n 11 sites 3 years of data per site and results demonstrate that inter site variation is greater than temporal variation across nee measures several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer scale emission estimates recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize npp rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types as well as developing a national annual scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature q10 decay relationship currently used in the camp v2 0 data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual scale meta data future work is required to include permafrost dynamics as well as additional natural and anthropogenic disturbances keywords ghg inventory generic carbon budget model national scale peatland fire 1 introduction there are growing international requirements for

al 2017 and natural wieder et al 2009 thompson et al 2015 disturbances on peatland c emissions northern boreal peatlands have been studied extensively in relation to factors affecting their c balance e g roulet et al 2007 limpens et al 2008 yu 2012 and have been modeled widely at many different scales farmer et al 2011 from site level process based models working at hourly time steps e g pcars frolking et al 2002 mwm st hilaire et al 2010 to large scale regional models of peat accumulation at century scales eg peatbalance schuldt et al 2013 chaudhary et al 2017 however none of these models can be easily applied at the national scale in canada because of the limited data available for model parameterization furthermore existing peatland c models are generally independent from upland forest c estimation models therefore there are no or few tools available to integrate c emissions and removals across the landscape that provide a consistent and unified approach to modeling both upland and peatland systems there are only three existing estimates of national ghg emissions from peatlands in canada roulet et al 2000 kurz et al 1992 webster et al 2018 the first two roulet et al 2000 kurz et al 1992 use constant rates of c accumulation co2 and ch4 net emissions for all peatland types and multiply them by the total peatland area in canada in order to improve on these methods webster et al 2018 took a more comprehensive approach by developing a peatland map to define the areas covered by different peatland types across canada and compiling nee and ch4 emission rates for each peatland type and region from the literature all of these methods make the simplifying assumption that one or a few value s can represent large areas over static climate conditions these empirical estimates also cannot project emissions from natural disturbances land use change and the potential effects of climate change thus a framework for a more dynamic approach to peatland c accounting is needed the canadian model for peatlands camp was developed to address the need for national c estimation and reporting in peatlands within canada an early version of the model was described by shaw et al 2016 here we present a fully implemented working version of the camp v2 0 the camp v2 0 has been developed as a module for the upland forest generic carbon budget model gcbm which is the next generation of the cbm cfs3 the carbon science in the gcbm is identical to that of the cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 and only some of the implementation details have changed in the gcbm therefore throughout the manuscript we reference the cbm cfs3 literature for c science understanding this applies equally to the gcbm the main differences and advantage of using the gcbm framework is that it can use spatially explicit data layers for input variables and will allow for seamless modeling of upland and peatland c dynamics because of its modular design the gcbm is built on a collaborative open source data integration framework the full lands integration tool flint developed by members of the moja global team http moja global the camp was developed to be consistent with modeling of moss c dynamics in moss c bona et al 2016 a module for the cbm cfs3 to represent c dynamics of thick moss layers in upland forests that can occur in site types transitional between upland forests and peatlands the camp has been built to require a minimal amount of inputs so that it can be applied broadly across different peatland categories in canada ultimately emission estimates from the camp can be used for national ghg emission estimates when used in combination with a national map product already developed webster et al 2018 that defines the land units classified as each peatland category used within the camp model outputs are intended to be consistent with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc tables for international reporting purposes table 2 in kurz et al 2009 this version v2 0 of the camp is built to simulate peatland ghg fluxes to the atmosphere co2 ch4 and other flux indicators such as net ecosystem exchange nee and heterotrophic respiration rh on the basis of a predicted long term water table position as well as annual fluctuation in the water table productivity of different vegetation layers decay and c transfers between pools although the current version of the camp does not include permafrost thaw anthropogenic disturbances natural disturbances other than wildfire and some more complex finer scale climatic and edaphic factors its framework was developed so that they can be included in future versions once data limitations are overcome in this paper we describe the camp v2 0 beginning with spatial representation of land and peatland categories modeling of biomass and dead organic matter dynamics including ch4 emissions and decay response to temperature and a fluctuating water table model initialization including use of wildfire disturbances in the spin up calibration of decay in the acrotelm and catotelm peat layers model behavior and sensitivity model evaluation and ending with identification of data gaps and recommendations for improvements in a future model version a prototype version was implemented tested and calibrated using the r software r core team 2017 and then implemented as camp v2 0 module in c 11 within the gcbm framework 2 spatial representation of the camp peatland categories the basic modeling unit in the cbm cfs3 is the forest stand kurz et al 2009 that is defined by combinations of classifiers such as forest age land class productivity forest type and site quality kurz et al 2009 the analogue modeling unit in the camp is the peatland site that is classified by a unique combination of ecozone province or territory and peatland category eleven peatland categories are used in the camp framework that are defined by combinations of two ecosystem characteristics wetland type hydrologic regime and tree cover type table 1 wetland types modeled in the camp are comprised of the dominant peatland types in canada s forested area bog precipitation is the only hydrological input poor fen minor groundwater inputs rich fen significant groundwater inputs and swamp seasonal or riparian water inputs as defined by the canadian wetland classification system national wetlands working group 1997 peat swamps were included in the modules framework but due to the current lack of data to parameterize or calibrate the swamp class the camp v2 0 was not developed for swamps marshes and shallow water types are not included in the camp v2 0 as all wetland categories included had to meet the definition of a peatland i e having greater than 40 cm of peat development national wetlands working group 1997 each wetland class is combined with three tree cover types open treed and forested taken from canada s definition of forest land that is consistent with the ipcc standards as implemented for canada s national and international reporting stinson et al 2011 forested peatland categories only include sites with large trees potential height 5 m and 25 cover at maturity such as the camp forested bog category that includes sites that are potentially transitional to upland black spruce sites with shallow peat layers broadly treed peatland camp categories are dominated by small trees potential height 5 m 10 25 cover and the open peatland camp categories are dominated by a shrub or sedge layer that can contain tree species and sparse small trees potential height 5 m 10 cover table 1 minimum inputs required for each site are area ha peatland category and location with polygon boundaries required if results are to be mapped default model parameters are provided for each peatland category that captures large scale variation in growth turnover and decomposition these default parameters were estimated based on literature cited values from 186 peatland study sites compiled into the peatland decomposition and productivity parameter database bona et al 2018 the camp is structured so that users can specify their own model parameters for combinations of peatland category and jurisdiction province or territory and ecozone eswg ecological stratification working group 1995 if they have the appropriate data to do so this structure will also allow camp developers to include finer resolution default model parameters when more data become available in the future for climate parameters the finest resolution data available are used depending on the variable in

turnover mortality transfer and decomposition sequentially in annual time steps the following text describes the peatland c pools transfers between those pools and c emitted to the atmosphere over the course of peatland development in the absence of a disturbance 3 1 pools the camp tracks a total of 18 pools seven live biomass and 11 dead organic matter pools fig 1 biomass pools represent three different vegetation categories woody vegetation trees and shrubs sedges and mosses biomass c pools transition to appropriate litter pools e g live sedge foliage c is transferred to dead sedge foliage c at pool specific turnover rates after some decomposition litter pools are deemed buried as peat and transferred into the acrotelm pools eventually transferring into the catotelm pools the camp shrub vegetation includes small evergreen shrubs such as ledum groenlandicum oeder hulten small deciduous shrubs such as salix pedicellaris pursh and tall deciduous shrubs such as alnus crispa aiton pursh the shrub vegetation category is split between different plant components to form three pools foliage stems and branches and roots sedges such as carex rostrata stokes are split between foliage which includes all aboveground parts and roots mosses in the camp are split between two different groups sphagnum spp mosses such as sphagnum fuscum schump klinggr and feather mosses such as pleurozium schreberi brid mitt the feather moss category conceptually includes all peat forming mosses with the exception of sphagnum mosses that are modelled separately feather moss was kept separate in order to facilitate the transition between the cbm cfs3 moss c module that also keeps track of both sphagnum and feather moss bona et al 2016 as two c functional groups bona et al 2013 due to the differences in litter quality which affects peat physical and chemical properties turetsky et al 2003 turetsky et al 2008 decomposition rates fenton et al 2010 and fire consumption rates shetler et al 2008 the gcbm is used to simulate small 5 m height potential and large 5 m height potential live tree biomass growth for treed and forested peatlands respectively table 1 the annual litter fall and mortality transfers from the live tree pools generated within gcbm are calculated and the c is transferred into the appropriate camp dead woody pool where decomposition is simulated within the camp module fresh litter from each of the live pools is transferred to a corresponding dead pool dead tree and shrub foliage dead fine woody debris dead coarse woody debris dead tree and shrub roots dead sedge foliage dead sedge roots and dead feather moss these dead pools act as transition pools that decay relatively quickly in comparison to the less labile peat in the acrotelm and catotelm pools conceptually the c in these pools is ready to transfer to the acrotelm once it is deemed buried by mosses and sufficiently incorporated into the peat determined by the pool s turnover time the sphagnum moss category is the only live pool which is transferred directly to the acrotelm because sphagnum mosses bury themselves as they grow making it difficult to clearly define a dead sphagnum moss pool in a peatland the physical split between the acrotelm and the catotelm layer is generally defined as the split between oxic and anoxic conditions for consistency and for modeling purposes see section 3 2 water table depth we used the well regarded definition of the acrotelm from ingram 1978 1982 where the acrotelm depth is expressed as the maximum water table depth i e the water table at the lowest position under drought conditions such that the acrotelm is the oxic layer or at least periodically oxic and the catotelm is the consistently water saturated anoxic layer in the camp we use an operational definition of drought being the driest summer conditions found every 5 years 80th percentile of water table depth corresponding to moderate drought in the north american drought monitor framework svoboda et al 2002 this definition is supported by morris et al 2011 who suggested annual maximum not extreme i e 100 years maxima water depths as being appropriate for the acrotelm definition and suggested a time frame of circa 5 years is most fitting the degree of water saturation has a large impact on the decomposition rates of these pools beer and blodau 2007 the camp models two conceptual water tables the long term climatic water table depth 100 8000 years as well as the estimated annual water table depth when the model is run annually for contemporary c estimation the long term water table is used to determine the lasting boundary between the acrotelm and catotelm which ultimately impacts the litter quality between these layers and their resulting decomposition rates the annual water table depth is used to track the fluctuation in inter annual water table and the resulting level of water saturation that also significantly impacts decay to accomplish this the model first predicts the long term water table depth that is used to determine the oxic acrotelm and anoxic catotelm pools the module then tracks the movement of the annual water table across these pools by using temporary holding pools such that c that is under water within the acrotelm for a particular year is placed in the anoxic acrotelm holding pool and similarly c that is exposed to oxygen within the catotelm is placed in the oxic catotelm holding pool for that year we are aware that because the anoxic catotelm pool is defined by the 80th percentile of the long term water table depth it will have an oxic portion present only once in every five years corresponding to a moderate drought under the north american drought monitor framework lawrimore et al 2002 regardless an oxic portion of the catotelm was included in order to account for drought years outside the upper range of long term weather conditions which may be of particular importance in a changing climate or peatland drainage scenario 3 2 water table depth water table depth in the camp is calculated as a function of the canadian fire weather index drought code dc which has been shown to approximate water table decline in peatlands as it follows a simple one dimensional water balance approach precipitation and evaporation that mirrors the water balance of peatlands waddington et al 2012 the relationship used for the camp was based not on the small sample of peatland water table time series from waddington et al 2012 but rather on single water table measurements for many n 296 sites from zoltai et al 2000 where both records of precise peatland type and drought code from nearby weather stations are available these single measurements of peatland water table per site were then related back to long term dc values for the sampling date to yield a simple linear model eq 1 describing the relationship between water table wt depth cm and dc in different peatland categories 1 w t 0 045 d c b w c where b cm varies by the peatland sites wetland class bog poor fen rich fen w and canopy class c as follows 12 5 for open bogs 25 9 for treed bogs 29 2 for forested bogs 0 7 for open poor fen 12 7 for treed poor fen 16 for forested poor fen 5 6 for open rich fen 7 8 for treed rich fen and 11 1 for forested rich fen this model explains 52 of the variance in water table depth has a residual standard error of 13 cm and is highly significant p 0 001 as the acrotelm can be approximated by the peat layers exposed to aerobic conditions during periods of deep water table decline we calculated the annual maximum dc for every point in the forested area of canada using a 9 km weather grid to compute dc from the narr reanalysis jain et al 2018 from 1979 2015 the 80th percentile of the maximum dc value was used to compute the water table using eq 1 and that distance below the surface was taken as the acrotelm thickness note that the relationship eq 1 used to predict water table depths only predicts a range of estimated annual minimum water table depths table a14 that correspond to the observed range of potential drought codes 78 5 to 411 8 for canada at the time of the peatland water table observation supplement s1 we acknowledge that a more complex approach to water table modeling could have been employed via advanced and surface models such as that described by bechtold et al 2019 that can simulate daily to monthly decline in water table depth but this was deemed too detailed and parameter heavy for the first stage of the camp model framework development in addition the model of bechtold et al 2019 was not available when the camp model design was created instead we chose to start with a peatland type and weather driven model of water table depth but more sophisticated process based models could be explored for use in future versions 3 3 carbon density curves the c that is transferred to the oxic catotelm and anoxic acrotelm holding pools as the annual water table fluctuates is calculated based on standardized c density curves for each peatland category carbon density curves were modeled on 336 peat cores with 5017 core segments with bulk density data from zoltai et al 2000 relationships from bauer et al 2006 were used to convert bulk density to c density the zoltai database sites were classified into the 11 camp peatland categories based on vegetation observations and peat properties sites where more than one peat core was collected were treated as fully independent as these sites were sampled across different topographic forms e g strings or flarks of a patterned fen peat samples at differing depths from the same core are not truly independent samples so linear mixed effects models should be used treat et al 2016 morris et al 2015 in studies of peat properties to accounted for within core effects therefore we used linear mixed effect modeling via the lme4 package in r bates et al 2015 with depth wetland class and tree cover class as fixed effects to model c density both the core as well as sampling year were included as random effects in the model depth class number of 15 cm intervals from the surface was transformed by the natural logarithm to account for the large increase in bulk density just below the surface in most peatland ecosystems thompson and waddington 2014 a leave one out cross validation analysis was used on individual samples n 4096 but excluding any samples from the same core in the cross validation predictions of c density at 15 cm increments down to 3 0 m depth were made for each of the 11 peatland categories using the complete version of the linear mixed effect model note that we do not limit the depth of the peat profile to 3 0 m elsewhere in the camp and that the c density curves limit of 3 0 m is irrelevant because curves are used to calculate transfers between oxic and anoxic pools and the annual water table depth never approaches a 3 0 m depth both instantaneous c density per 15 cm depth interval by peat class and cumulative top down c density were calculated instantaneous c density kg c m 3 from the linear mixed effects models was fitted to a continuous function to facilitate predictions for depth increments different than the 15 cm used in the model 2 c w d z d l n z e where w d and z represent the wetland class canopy cover class and depth interval respectively the coefficients d and e were fitted using a non linear least squares procedure from the r package nls with the median and standard error of each parameter estimate recorded table 2 similarly cumulative c density was fit to the simple exponential function 3 c w d z a z b a 95 confidence interval for the fitted functions was calculated for cumulative c load up to 3 0 m and compared to other peatland types in order to determine meaningful differences in standard density curves between peatland types table 3 individual c density curve functions table 2 3 using eqs 2 and 3 above had very low standard errors for the parameters a through d owing to the use of model prediction data in the curve fitting rather than the population of cores from the 336 cores used to build the linear mixed effects model cumulative c density curves generally followed nutrient gradients with open bogs have the lowest c loading 154 19 7 kg c m 2 compared with the aggregate of all rich fens and swamps which as an aggregate had a c loading between 178 and 211 kg c m 2 table 3 fig 2 3 4 growth 3 4 1 tree layer growth the gcbm uses merchantable stemwood volume yield curves as input to simulate stand level merchantable sized 5 m height potential tree growth over time then allometric equations are used to calculate other aboveground tree biomass pools boudewyn et al 2007 as a function of stem volume kurz et al 2009 we use the following default types of curves for each forested peatland category but in the future users will have the ability to provide their own yield curves for the forested bog peatland category we use a default pure black spruce picea mariana mill b s p yield curve for poor fens we use a black spruce forest type curve which assumed black spruce as a lead species but includes a small proportion of larch larix laricina du roi k koch and for forested rich fens we use a larch forest type curve which includes a small proportion of black spruce penner et al 2008 small tree growth 5m height potential was simulated in gcbm similarly to merchantable sized trees except that total tree volume yield curves were used instead of merchantable wood volume yield curves plot data from stands located on peatlands in northern alberta were compiled for total stem volume and an empirical volume over age yield curve was developed using a model based on hoerl s special function daniel and wood 1980 3 4 2 shrub layer growth in keeping with the cbm cfs3 framework the camp models shrub layer growth using simple shrub net growth curves where aboveground mass increases linearly to a maximum value and then levels off values estimated for maximum biomass g biomass m 2 vary by peatland category and were calculated as the mean of values reported in the literature bona et al 2018 table a1 tall shrub maximum biomass data were not available for each peatland category therefore a mean for all peatland categories was used and scaled for each peatland category by multiplying the mean biomass per unit area by the relative cover of tall shrubs for each peatland category from zoltai et al 2000 tables a2 a3 it is assumed that the maximum biomass after establishment is reached at three years for low shrubs johnston et al 2015 table a1 and at 20 years for tall shrubs wieder et al 2009 table a2 a3 the aboveground shrub c is split between the shrub stems and branches pool and the shrub foliage pool by using a foliage to aboveground biomass ratio set at a default value of 0 265 calculated as a mean from bona et al 2018 this ratio is used for all shrubs although it is based solely on low shrubs since data to calculate a tall shrub value were not available net shrub layer root growth was calculated as a function of shrub layer stems and branches using eq 4 from murphy et al 2009 4 root production a stem biomass b where a 0 75 and b 0 02 r2 0 62 this equation was chosen because it does not vary by water table or site type and included fine roots as well as some coarse roots similar allometric equations by murphy and moore 2010 that were derived for the mer bleue bog were tested because of geographical proximity but eventually were rejected in favor of a function from a study in finland murphy et al 2009 because the mer bleue study did not include coarse roots 3 4 2 sedge growth annual net sedge growth was calculated as an adjusted and scaled npp value anpps based on a review of peatland sedge dynamics first a total mean maximum standing crop biomass of 220 g biomass m 2 for open bogs and fens was calculated using the data in bona et al 2018 there were few data for treed systems so they were not included in this mean instead values for treed systems were calculated as a mean maximum standing crop biomass resulting from scaling the total mean maximum standing crop biomass 220 g biomass m 2 using percent ground cover values from zoltai et al 2000 for each camp peatland category table a4 the scaled standing crop biomass was then multiplied by an adjustment factor currently set at a default value of 1 1 bernard and hankinson 1979 this adjustment factor is used to correct for intra annual mortality authors bernard and hankinson 1979 found that the quadrat method for sampling sedge biomass the method used for all compiled data in bona et al 2018 only accounts for live biomass in the growing season of the measurement year however since a portion of the sedge crop grows and then dies during that season one must not only account for the observed growth but also the growth from sedges that have grown and died within the growing season to get a true measure of npp in accounting for this the biomass productivity ratio increases from 0 85 to 1 1 bernard and hankinson et al 1979 carex rostrada and in another study of carex lucustris authors cited an increase from 0 82 to 1 5 bernard and macdonald 1973 these studies were conducted in marshes but no similar studies were found for bogs and fens so the default value for bogs and fens is based on the reported values for marshes an adjustment factor of 1 1 is used in the camp to adjust the scaled mean live sedge standing crop biomass c assuming that intra seasonal mortality for carex rostrata and other sedge species is similar within fens and bogs to calculate the net growth of sedge roots anpps is divided by a mean aboveground to belowground ratio for sedges found in the literature initially set at a default value of 0 3 this was estimated from a range of literature cited values 0 09 0 56 where most studies observed that roots contribute a relatively large portion to the total npp bona et al 2018 3 4 3 moss growth mean npp for sphagnum and feather mosses by peatland category were estimated using data compiled in bona et al 2018 table a5 and used to model moss growth these baseline npp rates were scaled for some peatland categories e g rich fens because field studies citing moss npp rates in the literature were not scaled up to the plot level estimates of npp from field studies for bogs and poor fens were used without scaling because in these sites peat mosses cover a large portion of the ground and are more spatially homogenous therefore making them relatively accurate estimates of the plot level npp however for peatland categories where mosses typically have low ground cover baseline npp rates were scaled table a6 by multiplying them by the relative cover values calculated from zoltai et al 2000 3 5 biomass turnover as in the cbm cfs3 the camp represents biomass mortality and litterfall using an annual turnover rate mortality yr 1 that determines the amount of c transferred annually from each live pool into the appropriate dead pool the shrub branches and stem pool turnover rate is calculated based on the assumption that the net growth of shrub branch and stems would reduce to zero after being established i e after three years for low shrubs and after 20 years for tall shrubs net growth is equal to npp minus mortality so when net growth equals zero then annual npp should approximately equal the annual mortality rate for any mature site therefore annual npp rates from bona et al 2018 were averaged for each peatland category table a7 and assumed equal to annual mortality these mortality rates by peatland category were then divided by mean biomass values for branches and stem biomass in bona et al 2018 for each peatland category to solve for the annual turnover rate mortality yr 1 for each of these biomass components shrub root mortality was set at a default value of 0 56 from the study by authors laiho et al 2003 litterfall from the shrub foliage pool is also simulated annually by the camp the proportion of evergreen to non evergreen foliage was calculated as a mean of ratios in bona et al 2018 for each camp peatland category table a8 the current default in the camp is that 100 of non evergreen leaves and 25 of evergreen leaves aerts et al 1989 transfer to dead pools annually the camp sedge turnover rate is currently set to a default value of 0 61 yr 1 cited by authors saarinen et al 1996 that is also similar to the turnover rate of 0 6 yr 1 cited in grigal et al 1985 the camp assumes that c accumulated in the live sphagnum and feather moss pools in the previous year t 1 is completely transferred as litter to the acrotelm in the next year t the assumption that total aboveground moss npp is equal to moss litter input is also used in other peatland models e g frolking et al 2002 2010 3 6 decay dynamics as in the cbm cfs3 the camp has a built in temperature dependent decay rate that calculates the amount of organic matter that decomposes in each dead pool annually the applied decay rate ak of any dead pool is calculated using eq 5 5 a k k tempmod where k is the base decay rate for each dead pool at the reference temperature of 10 c and tempmod is a temperature modifier tempmod is calculated using eq 6 6 tempmod e mati reftemp ln q 10 0 1 where mat is the mean annual temperature for the ith spatial unit mati reftemp is the reference temperature 10 c and q10 is the temperature coefficient exponential decay rates y 1 for different litter types were compiled bona et al 2018 table a9 a13 appropriate q10 values were difficult to determine from the literature especially since the q10 value for peat have been shown to vary greatly between sites between 2 2 and 19 in chapman and thurlow 1998 and to vary with changing water table depth silvola et al 1996 therefore decay rates and q10 values for the acrotelm and catotelm pools were estimated using an bayesian markov chain monte carlo technique to find values of decay rates and q10 that maximized the likelihood function which was expressed as a function of the difference between modeled and measured estimates of c stocks in each of these pools see section 6 calibration of peat decay parameters after the amount of decayed c in each dead pool is calculated a proportion of the c is transferred to the atmosphere patm and the rest is transferred to the appropriate pool of lesser chemical potential energy as humified material pt the proportion of c released to the atmosphere due to decomposition is split into co2 and ch4 3 7 methane emission modeling peatland ch4 emissions posed a significant challenge because flux rates reported in the literature have high spatial and temporal variability and are dependent on highly complex dynamics arneth et al 2010 wania et al 2010 the amount of ch4 that reaches the atmosphere from any peatland is a function of how much of it becomes oxidized while being transported through the peat column edwards et al 1998 this transport process can be very complex and depends on factors such as the rate of diffusion moore et al 1990 ebullition shannon and white 1994 and plant mediated transport schimel 1995 taking into account these complex dynamics in a process based ch4 model across several regions in canada would require a large number of parameters that are not available instead for the camp v2 0 we use the approach described in a meta analysis study by turetsky et al 2014 whereby an optimal water table depth that corresponds to maximum ch4 flux f ch4max is defined for each wetland type bog poor fen rich fen the optimal water table depths and their corresponding f ch4max rates grouped by wetland type bog rich fen and poor fen within the boreal described by turetsky et al 2014 are used here data from a peatland drainage study by strack et al 2010 are then used to model response to deviations from the optimal water table depths which we refer to as the f 10 the f 10 value is analogous to a q 10 value such that it solves for a decrease in ch4 production within a system that corresponds to a 10 cm decrease or increase in water table depth in the camp v2 0 we assume a symmetrical response for all peatland categories and use two f 10 values one for water table increase from optimum 0 32 and one for water table decrease 2 6 based on within site responses to water table change from strack et al 2010 rather than the between site water table ch4 production responses from turetsky et al 2014 initially the ch4 model used regionally specific f ch 4max rates collected from the literature for each ecozone ecological stratification working group 1996 and wetland type in order to improve expression of regional variation however this version of the model consistently underestimated ch4 likely because of low sample sizes to estimate f ch4max rates for each wetland type bog poor fen rich fen and ecoregion combination so the decision was made to use the f ch4max rates reported in turetsky et al 2014 for the entire boreal until more data can be compiled the drawback of using this approach is that the values provided by turetsky et al 2014 are based on daily measures of both water table and ch4 flux to make them useful for the camp the flux rates had to be scaled to annual rates following the method of webster et al 2018 on a daily scale water table varies significantly more than on an annual scale meaning that daily optimal water table depths sometimes fall outside the range of the mean annual water table positions supplement s1 the result is that optimal water table depths for maximum ch4 flux used here daily for poor fen and rich fen systems 2 cm 16 cm are never reached within the range of potential annual water table depths for these systems that correspond to the annual minimum water table 3 to 35 and 3 to 30 respectively appendix table a14 though the peatland systems can be observed at water tables above the surface supplement s1 despite this issue the ch4 scheme used in the camp v2 0 provided better results on a large scale than any other schemes we tested including a simple linear relationship with water table depth defined in the original camp design document shaw et al 2016 4 model initialization before running a camp simulation c pools need to be given initial c stock values which in the camp v2 0 are the steady state c stocks with the exception of the catotelm pool adjusted for the effects of the last stand replacing wildfire in the cbm cfs3 c pools are initialized by simulating repeated cycles of forest stand development until pools reach a semi equilibrium where the annual change in soil pools is less than 1 kurz et al 2009 for the camp we calculate the steady state c pools analytically because it would be too computationally taxing and require too long to spin up the peat pools with repeated disturbance cycles due to low decay rates of the peat pools following the logic in weng et al 2012 c dynamics across all ecosystem compartments can be expressed as 7 d x t d t u t a k x t f s m x t where x t is a row vector of c pools in ecosystem compartments u t is a row vector of c inputs to live pools tree leaves wood and roots sedges feather and sphagnum mosses a is a matrix of c partitioning coefficients among the ecosystem compartments k is a matrix of c turnover rates f is the frequency of the stand replacing fires s is the diagonal matrix of the fractions of c pools removed by a stand replacing fire and m is a matrix of c partitioning coefficients that allocates c that was lost from a donor pool as a result of fire among the receiving pools e g when fire kills the aboveground biomass live roots or a donor pool are transferred to a litter pool which is a receiving pool to obtain steady state xss we first calculated steady state c inputs uss from gcbm simulations of tree foliage woody and root pools feather moss and sphagnum npp s table a5 and npp derived from steady state shrub biomass table a1 2 and associated partitioning coefficients and biomass turnover rates afterwards we set the values in the vector d x t d t which represented the annual changes in c pools to 0 set u t to uss and solved eq 7 for xss as described in xia et al 2012 afterwards the catotelm pool was adjusted to represent the c pool size after 8000 years of c accumulation that is the approximate time since peatland vegetation initiated in canada koropchak et al 2012 as for other pools dynamics for the catotelm pool is formulated as 8 d x d t c i n s s k f s x where x is the c pool c in ss is the steady stead c input from the donor pools k is the decay rate of the pool f is the frequency of disturbance and s is the severity of disturbance of the given pool expressed as a fraction ranging from 0 to 1 eq 8 is a separable differential equation and therefore can be analytically solved for x at the time t yielding 9 x t c i n s s k f s e k f s t c o n s t where c i n s s k f s is the steady state pool size and e k f s t c o n s t is the correction to the steady state pool to obtain the pool at the given time t because initial pool size or pool size when t 0 for the catotelm is 0 econst will equal to the steady state pool size c i n s s k f s therefore the new expression for x t becomes 10 x t c i n s s k f s 1 e k f s t from eq 10 it follows that the time it takes for the given pool to reach a value within 0 1 of its equilibrium is dependent on the decay rate of the given pool as well as the frequency and severity of disturbances unlike for other pools in the camp which reach equilibrium after less than 4400 years it takes more than 8000 years for catotelm c pool to reach equilibrium because the catotelm is assumed to remain undisturbed after fire s 0 and its decay rates are extremely slow see table 5 for k magnitudes therefore to avoid overestimation of the catotelm c pool we needed to adjust the steady state estimate for the catotelm in the calculated vector xss as follows 11 x s s c a t o t e l m x s s c a t o t e l m 1 e k c a t o t e l m 8 000 lastly once all c pools in xss were obtained we simulated a stand replacing wildfire ran the model forward to the time since the last stand replacing disturbance assigned to the site and used the x age as the initial values for model simulations this accelerated initialization method was validated by running the model for 30 000 annual time steps including fire at the appropriate fire return interval and comparing the steady state values from the solution with the spin up values from the method used in the cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 but applied in the camp v2 0 5 wildfire disturbance in the camp v2 0 wildfire is the only disturbance type included at this time that affects biomass turnover and transfers between dead pools as well as the atmosphere each time a fire is simulated a wildfire disturbance matrix is applied that determines the amount of c transferred from one pool to another or emitted from a pool to the atmosphere as co2 co or ch4 a disturbance matrix is a table where columns are designated for each potential c source pool in the model e g live sedge foliage or dead sedge roots and rows are assigned to each potential sink pool e g anoxic catotelm or atmosphere pool and the intersection of the source and sink column row defines the proportion of c moved from source to sink for a given disturbance event such as fire in this case kurz et al 2009 kurz et al 1992 we assume that the live sedge roots and live shrub roots will not be combusted by fire because all or most of them will be protected by water saturated peat layers instead 100 of live shrub roots are assumed to die and directly transfer to the acrotelm c pool while live sedge roots remain alive all other live pools are assumed to be combusted by fire live shrub stems and branches live shrub foliage live sedge foliage live sphagnum and live feather moss dead pools that are easily consumed by fire such as dead tree and shrub foliage dead sedge foliage and dead feather moss shetler et al 2008 are completely combusted and the c emitted to the atmosphere the oxic acrotelm and oxic catotelm holding pool is assumed to be only partially combusted at a rate of 12 5 for bogs and 11 4 for poor and rich fens rates were calculated based on data from lukenbach et al 2015 and turetsky et al 2011 table 4 other dead pools that are assumed to be partially combusted by a fire at the same rate as the oxic peat are dead fine woody debris dead coarse woody debris dead tree and shrub roots and dead sedge roots none of the anoxic catotelm or anoxic acrotelm pool is combusted by fire since it is water saturated and protected from burning each time c in a camp pool is combusted by a wildfire simulation the c is emitted to the atmosphere as either co2 co or ch4 the ratio determining the split between these three gases depends on whether the pool is assumed to combust in a flaming or smouldering fire dead tree and shrub sedge foliage and dead fine woody debris pools are assumed to burn in the flaming combustion phase and emit at a ratio of co co2 by mass t ha 1 of 0 0499 and ch4 co2 by mass t ha 1 of 0 00194 ottmar 2014 the rest of the dead and live pools are assumed to smoulder and emit at a ratio of co co2 by mass t ha 1 at 0 254 and the ch4 co2 by mass t ha 1 at 0 038 kohlenburg et al 2018 these emission ratios were converted to molar ratios of c in a series of calculations such that the total amount of c emitted is multiplied by a factor of 0 8788 0 1083 0 01285 to solve for the amount of c emitted as co2 co and ch4 respectively for flaming and 0 523 0 327 and 0 149 to solve for the amount of c emitted as co2 co and ch4 respectively for smouldering 6 calibration of peat decay parameters decomposition rates for the acrotelm and catotelm pools are rarely measured because these data are extremely limited the exponential decay rates y 1 and q10 values for these pools were calibrated table 5 using peat profile c stock data parameters were calibrated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo technique that was previously used to calibrate decay parameters for the cbm cfs3 hararuk et al 2017 to calibrate parameters for the camp acrotelm and catotelm observed and modeled acrotelm and catotelm c stocks were compared across several thousands of iterations to generate a posterior distribution for each parameter value prior parameter distributions were assumed to be uniform and bound by minimum and maximum values obtained from the literature bona et al 2018 and calibration runs were continued until posterior parameter distributions became stable hararuk et al 2017 we recognize that since the camp is built for the purpose of generating estimates of c emissions and not c stocks that calibrating against c stock changes instead of one time c stock pool data would be ideal however because flux data are not split between acrotelm and catotelm peat pools they could not be used for calibration and were instead reserved for model validation the purpose of this calibration procedure is to parameterize the decomposition rates of the long term acrotelm and catotelm pools therefore the calibration procedure was conducted using the initialization spin up of the camp see section 4 model initialization where long term water table is used instead of annual water table fluctuations over the long timeframe required to calibrate decomposition of peat only large scale temporal variation in parameters such as water table is required the calibration dataset was comprised mainly of 370 peatland sites from zoltai et al 2000 where sufficient data were available to estimate acrotelm and catotelm c stocks and enough vegetation and wetland metadata were available to classify the sites into the appropriate camp peatland category because the data of zoltai et al 2000 are mainly from western canada additional data from eastern canada quebec and ontario originating from various peatland researchers unpublished data were included to fully represent peatlands across canada garneau unpublished data packalen unpublished data tarnocai unpublished data 7 model sensitivity and behavior model sensitivity and behavior were assessed by examining the responses of emission co2 ch4 estimates and initial peatland c stock estimates to spatial input variables that are either directly mat or indirectly fire return interval fri dc related to climate carbon dioxide emission rates are affected through two separate mechanisms in the model one that helps to determine the size of the initial peat c stock resulting from the model initialization affected by mat and fri the other determines the annual proportion of the peat c stock that is decomposed and then either released to the atmosphere or transferred to another pool affected by mat see section 3 6 decay dynamics and by the annual water table depth methane emissions are primarily driven by water table depth that is predicted by dc a theoretical spatial test grid was developed to represent the full range of values where peatlands occur in canada for each spatial variable fire return intervals ranged between 35 and 500 years mats between 10 1 c and 7 8 c and the long term and annual dcs between 78 5 and 411 8 corresponding to a different range of predicted water table depths for each peatland category appendix table a14 readers are reminded that the camp v2 0 does not include frozen soils typical of regions with mat of 10 1 and that this sensitivity test is being used to understand the limits of the current model s response to the full range of extremes in climatic variables observed in canada when a single variable was tested all other spatial variables were held constant at their mid range value we used nee net ecosystem exchange of co2 to assess co2 emissions estimates for ease of comparison to observed flux measures that are commonly reported in peatland c dynamics studies we also assessed the 100 year global warming potential gwp of total heterotrophic respiration t rh calculated as the sum of co2 and ch4 emissions after conversion to co2 equivalents co2e using a conversion factor of 1 for co2 and 25 for ch4 myhre et al 2013 7 1 sensitivity of initial c stocks to mat and fri the mat is applied to the base annual decomposition rates of each of the dead pools using a q1o relationship see section 3 6 decay dynamics which will directly influence the amount of c emitted to the atmosphere annually the same approach is used to arrive at an applied decay rate to use in the model initialization i e spin up procedure in the camp mat can have a large effect on the amount of initial c in each of the peat pools within a peatland type table 6 this in turn can affect emissions estimates as pools with larger stocks will tend to have larger emissions the absolute differences in c stocks between the highest 7 8 c and lowest 10 1 c mat tested across peatland types ranged from 240 to 1641 mg c ha 1 for the acrotelm and from 163 to 1677 mg c ha 1 for the catotelm table 6 in general peat pool c stocks were highest at the lowest mat and lowest and the highest mat this relationship is consistent with that of another large scale global peatland soil organic c model wania et al 2009 that uses a similar initialization procedure wania et al 2009 report a predicted range of total soil organic c stocks from approximately 400 mg ha 1 at mat 8 7 c to 2000 mg ha 1 at mat 6 7 c when testing a mat range of 8 7 c to 6 7 c camp predicts a similar but higher range in total peat c when the same range in mat is tested 520 mg ha 1 at mat 8 7 c to 3365 2 mg ha 1 at mat 6 7 c wania et al 2009 caution that their estimates tend to be lower than those found in the literature they attribute the low values to limiting the analytical solution for their spin up to 1000 years whereas we assume that the catotelm never reaches a true equilibrium and use a factor of 8000 years in the initialization of the catotelm pool see section 4 model initialization while our total c stocks reach higher values than reported by wania et al 2009 they are within the range of field measurements reported in the literature that were compiled here for model calibration which ranged from 385 to 4300 mg ha 1 zoltai et al 2000 garneau unpublished data tarnocai unpublished data packalen unpublished data in summary the camp is demonstrating expected model behavior by having a consistent correlation between organic matter accumulation and mat that is in general agreement with others wania et al 2009 clymo et al 1998 other relevant studies which examined peatland sensitivity to temperature generally focused on peat soil temperature rather than air temperature demonstrating a strong correlation between co2 leroy et al 2017 and ch4 hargreaves and fowler 1998 leroy et al 2017 fluxes to peat temperature this relationship has been shown to decrease with peat profile depth jusczak et al 2013 which is consistent with our calibrated q10 values which were uniformly smaller for catotelm deeper pools than for acrotelm pools table 5 the model s initial c stocks for peat pools also demonstrate an expected relationship with fri stocks are decreasing with increased fire frequency and visa versa keeping all other spatial variables constant at mid range values mat 1 15 annual and long term dc 300 7 initial total peat pool c stock shifts from a mean of 1500 mg c ha 1 at fri 35 to 1872 mg c ha 1 at fri 500 the acrotelm c is least sensitive to changes in fri shifting from 180 mg c ha 1 at fri 35 to 185 mg c ha 1 at fri 500 whereas the catotelm c has a larger shift from 1320 at fri 35 to 1687 at fri 500 because the oxic acrotelm is partially consumed by fire whereas the anoxic catotelm is untouched one might assume that the acrotelm should be more sensitive to fri however that is only the case for shorter term contemporary or forward looking simulations here we are examining the result from the 8000 year spin up of the model initialization the fri has a larger impact on the catotelm pool than on the acrotelm pool during initialization because the rate at which the acrotelm transfers c to the catotelm is proportionally larger when the acrotelm pool is larger and because this transfer rate has significant weight in determining the c stock of the catotelm given that the decay rate within the anoxic catotelm is almost zero table 5 on average the rich fen total initial peat pool c tended to be least sensitive to shifts in fri 14 difference between fri 35 and 500 followed by poor fens 21 difference between fri 35 and 500 and then bogs being the most sensitive 33 difference between fri 35 and 500 7 2 sensitivity of nee and total rh to mat and water table depth overall the model s simulation of nee is more sensitive to differences in mat table 6 than it is to changes in annual water table position table 7 whereas the opposite is true for total heterotrophic respiration t rh this result is expected when the model is behaving correctly since co2 emissions are highly dependent on the applied annual decay rates defined by a q10 relationship with mat whereas t rh also included ch4 emissions that are generally higher than co2 emissions once converted to co2e and are dependent on annual water table position a comparison of the relative shift in t rh and nee table 7 in response to the range of annual dcs corresponding to different typical ranges of water tables for each peatland category table a14 shows that ch4 emission is the driving force of the sensitivity of t rh to water table movement this is especially evident once the global warming potential of ch4 is taken into account and ch4 emissions are converted to co2e fig 3 the bog sites shown here reach their maximum ch4 emission potential since the optimal ch4 flux water table depth for bogs are reached 26 cm within the full range of dcs tested whereas the optimal depths for poor fen 1 6 cm and rich fen 16 3 cm sites are not see section 9 for further discussion in order to assess model behavior in response to changes in dc and the resulting shifts in water table depth a set of seven year simulations with different combinations of long term and annual water table depths was tested we present two examples fig 4 open bog fig 5 open rich fen from these scenarios where the annual water table starts above the long term average water table dips below the long term average typical of a drought or peatland drainage scenario and then climbs back up above the long term water table depth figs 4a and 5a in both examples figs 4b and 5b c is transferred into the acrotelm anoxic holding pool when the annual water table is above the long term water table position and c is also transferred into the catotelm oxic holding pool when water table dips below the long term water table position this dip results in a change in decay dynamics and co2 emissions from rh however it is a small contributor to the change in t rh that is dominated by the change in ch4 flux figs 4c and 5c especially after the global warming potential of ch4 is taken into account figs 4d and 5d again the maximum ch4 potential flux rate f ch4 max employed here is reached in the bog site at the optimal water table of 26 cm which explains the symmetrical peaks in ch4 at that water table depth fig 4c for the bog site which is not evident in the rich fen site fig 5c the trends in these results are consistent with our understanding of ch4 and nee dynamics in peatlands and with the literature for instance updegraff et al 2001 demonstrated that co2 was insensitive to water table movement and only responded significantly to soil temperature methane however is shown to be highly sensitive to water table movement but is also impacted by a host of other variables such as soil temperature plant productivity and n cycling dynamics updegraff et al 2001 that we do not currently account for in this version of camp it is clear that emissions from some peatland types are more sensitivite to changes in mat such as forested bogs and forested poor fens than others such as treed poor fens and treed rich fens table 6 the reason for these differences are difficult to isolate because they do not depend solely on mat but other parameters including annual applied decay rate the amount of initial c in each peat pool input rates from upstream pools npp and turnover rates for each vegetation layer that vary by peatland category in general peatland categories that are more sensitive to changes in mat have higher c inputs and larger initial c pools when decay rates and q10 s are similar between peatland categories table 5 8 model evaluation the camp v2 0 is the first version of a comprehensive framework for modeling peatland c emissions and removals for canada the initial challenge in developing the model was to be able to represent the range of peatland types in canada and to compile existing data and synthesize the best available knowledge to develop the basic model the main goal of this evaluation is to assess how much variation is explained with the camps base model structure to consider the distribution and overall mean model residuals for large scale estimation and to identify and prioritize issues needing improvement this evaluation of the camp v2 0 compared estimates from the model to those arrived at using data from peatland sample sites in 16 different locations across canada with ghg flux measurements for multiple years or seasons eleven of the sites had data for ch4 emission rates and 12 of the sites had data for nee for co2 either from eddy covariance flux towers or chamber measurements measured data were reported as daily or seasonal rates so we converted them to annual rates for comparison to annual rates predicted by the model assuming winter emissions equaled 15 of growing season emissions tier 1 emission factors in the ipcc wetland supplement see webster et al 2018 for more details on conversions peatland sample sites were mainly located in the provinces of quebec ontario alberta and manitoba with one from nova scotia and were located across the mixedwood plains hudson plains boreal shield boreal plains and taiga shield ecozones ecological land classification group elcg 2005 each site was classified according to a camp peatland category to the best of our ability with the information that was available for nee comparisons sites were mainly open bog n 3 and open poor fen n 5 sites along with two open rich fen sites and one of each treed bog and treed rich fen none of the sites with nee data were classified as forested based on the available information for the ch4 comparisons sites were mainly open bogs n 4 open rich fens n 3 or open poor fens n 3 and one site of each treed bog forested bog and treed poor fen 8 1 overall model fit overall mean model residuals predicted observed for ch4 and nee are reasonably small 6 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and 20 g cco2 m 2 y 1 respectively suggesting that on average the model is well calibrated for large scale applications a comparison of the distribution of observed and predicted ch4 annual emissions shows that the camp is able to capture the full range of variation in ch4 emissions observed sd 15 range from 2 to 58 g cch4 m 2 y 1 vs predicted sd 21 range from 2 to 73 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and that observed and predicted measures of central dispersion compare well observed mean 15 and median 9 vs predicted mean 21 and median 11 fig 6 a this result suggests that the symmetrical scheme used to model ch4 emissions where mean maximum ch4 emission values f ch4 max are associated with optimal ch4 water table depths see section 3 7 methane emission is well calibrated and performs well on average for large scale analyses especially considering the high complexity of ch4 dynamics that complicates both prediction see section 3 7 methane emission and measurement of ch4 emissions see section 9 for further discussion a comparison of the distribution of observed and predicted annual nee did not agree as well as for ch4 overall the camp overestimates nee observed mean 39 g cco2 m 2 y 1 and median 58 g cco2 m 2 y 1 vs predicted mean 19 g cco2 m 2 y 1 and median 21 g cco2 m 2 y 1 indicating that the camp needs improvement in expressing the full variation in nee observed values have a much wider range and higher standard deviation range from 145 to 61 s 67 compared to predicted values range from 21 to 61 s 21 fig 6b this result suggests that in future versions of the model efforts must be made either to increase the variation expressed in npp and turnover rates for different regions and peatland categories or increase the variation in annual applied decay rates or most likely both in the current version of the camp v2 0 npp is modeled as a constant for each peatland category however we know that npp is not static vitt et al 2003 thormann et al 1997 upgaff et al 2001 furthermore we have already identified in the model behavior and sensitivity analysis that a simple q10 relationship with mat is likely insufficient to capture a realistic response in emissions and that a response to soil temperature rather than air temperature would likely lead to better results upgaff et al 2001 leroy et al 2017 see section 9 for further discussion the annualized measured and predicted emission rates for both ch4 and nee were not significantly correlated despite the relatively decent fit of the distribution of observed and predicted values for ch4 and low overall model residuals for both ch4 and nee we attribute this to several different factors such as the lack of soil temperature in the model the need to increase variation in npp rates as discussed above lack of confidence in scaled up measured ch4 emissions insufficient data for model calibration and parameterization for certain peatland categories that will be discussed further in section 9 future steps towards model improvement 8 2 model fit by peatland category the camp was designed to model c dynamics for each of the different peatland categories that occur across canada this will enable the model to take full advantage of existing data and knowledge and to easily integrate new peatland science as it becomes available because some peatland categories are better studied than others some categories are better calibrated and parameterized in the camp to evaluate the model s ability to estimate ch4 emissions and nee for different peatland categories mean model residuals were split between peatland categories figs 7 and 8 even though the sample sizes for each peatland type are very low given the high temporal and spatial variation within measured data available tables 8 and 9 the analysis can be helpful to inform future work especially in identifying data gaps the analysis demonstrates that the model is overestimating ch4 in both open bogs and open poor fens and possibly treed bogs small sample fig 7 the opposite was found for open rich fens and possibly forested bogs small sample size fig 7 the underestimation of ch4 emissions for rich fens is likely due to issues arising from the use of f ch4max and its corresponding optimal water table depth 2 cm taken from turetsky et al 2014 that was based on a daily time scale when this relationship is applied in our annual time scale model the optimal water table corresponding to f ch4 max is never reached see section 3 7 methane emission ideally a new dataset with annual water table depths and annual f ch4max values should be developed to improve camp predictions underestimation of ch4 emissions for open bogs and open poor fens likely results from the need to adjust the f10 response to changes in water table that could be implemented using data from peatland drainage studies in open bogs and poor fens also the open bogs and poor fens in this analysis are mainly located in the relatively small 3 47 106 km2 mixedwood plains ecozone nine out of twelve years of data for open bogs and four out of eight years of data for poor fens in southern canada which is not representative of the spatial extent of open bogs and poor fen systems in the majority of canada that are mainly located in northern continental boreal ecozones webster et al 2018 only 0 3 of canada s bog area and 0 003 of canada s poor fen area are found in the mixedwood plains ecozone webster et al 2018 model residuals by peatland category for nee show that the camp overestimates nee for open rich fens and open bogs and possibly treed bogs small sample fig 8 and underestimates it for open poor fens and possibly treed rich fens small sample fig 8 it is difficult to assess whether these biases are related to unexpressed variation in npp or decay rates but is likely a combination of both where the relative importance of npp or decay differ between peatland categories because the data for model parameterization of npp rates for mosses shrubs and sedges was more comprehensive for open bog sites than the other peatland types it is safe to assume that for open bog systems the quality and accuracy of npp rates are relatively high so it is likely that it is the decay rates that need improvement and probably need to be reduced the reason that open bog decay rates could have turned out too high is that in the calibration process they had to be combined with open poor fen sites to create a large enough sample size table 5 to calibrate decay rates it is likely that the grouping also caused a similar but opposite bias for poor fens meaning that the open poor fen decay rate likely needs to be higher which would improve the current underestimation of nee in open poor fen systems in general data to parameterize npp rates for vegetation layers in both poor fen and rich fen systems were limited bona et al 2018 this data gap needs to be addressed lastly introducing soil temperature to the decay function rather than the current relationship with air temperature mat would likely improve these results but since we did not have access to measured soil temperature in our observed database we could not test this hypothesis 8 3 site level model fit we have shown that on average means of observed and predicted emission rates are in agreement and for national scale estimation this is adequate however understanding finer scale variation will lead to overall improved accuracy in estimates and allow for future application of the model at finer scales for this reason we performed an individual site level evaluation of model fit temporal and spatial variation among observed values at fine scales tables 8 and 9 is very high we do not expect this version of the camp to be able to express this high degree of variation but a comparison will inform future research for development of the camp by showing where it succeeds or fails at this fine spatial scale first we examined spatial inter site level accuracy to reduce the effect of inter annual temporal variation only site locations with more than three years of data were used data were averaged over time and compared to averaged model predictions for the same years tables 8 and 9 methane was relatively well estimated by the model when averaged over a 4 to 9 year period for four different sites residuals ranging from 0 7 to 18 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and the variation expressed was similar compare sd values in table 8 it is also notable that the more northerly sites that are more representative of ecozones in canada that have large areas of peatlands are better predicted by the model for example the churchill site occurs in the hudson plains ecozone where peatlands make up an estimated 134 1 103 km2 webster et al 2018 and thompson manitoba site occurs in the boreal shield ecozone where peatlands make up an estimated 275 6 103 km2 webster et al 2018 were better simulated by the model mean residuals between 0 7 and 7 g cch4 m 2 y 1 as compared to the two southern sites mer bleue and st charles de bellechasse mean model residuals between 15 and 18 g cch4 m 2 y 1 in the quebec mixedwood plains ecozone where peatlands areas are relatively small and occupy only 1 045 103 km2 webster et al 2018 making them much less significant at the national scale overall the total average model residual for ch4 is low whether averaged by site location 8 g cch4 m 2 y 1 or not 6 g cch4 m 2 y 1 which suggests that spatial and temporal variation of ch4 is of similar magnitude this is supported by similar average observed intra site temporal sd ranging from 2 2 to 24 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and inter site spatial sd 11 g cch4 m 2 y 1 variation table 8 the site level analysis for co2 emissions showed patterns for over and under estimation that are similar to those for ch4 emissions however interestingly when the sites are averaged by site location the overall mean model residual is reduced to 2 0 g cco2 m 2 y 1 from the previous mean when rates were not weighted by location of 20 g cco2 m 2 y 1 this result demonstrates that spatial variation across different sites is higher than temporal variation for co2 emissions which is confirmed by the observed inter site variation of sd 58 g cco2 m 2 y 1 which tends to be higher than the observed intra site temporal variation range of 15 45 g cco2 m 2 y 1 this further supports the idea that including mean annual soil temperature in the peat decay function a variable that generally correlates with a north to south gradient provides a good opportunity to improve explained variation in nee emissions higher spatial variation in observed nee rates also supports the idea that npp rates for different regions whereas most npp rates do not currently vary by region due to lack of data available provides another opportunity for model improvement 9 future steps towards model improvement the camp v2 0 was developed as a first step towards a dynamic c estimation framework for peatlands for application at the national scale in canada the challenge was to build a simple model framework applicable to diverse peatland types and regions occurring across canada by synthesizing expert knowledge and compiling the best available existing data for model parameterization and calibration the results of the model evaluation demonstrate that although the modeling framework is appropriate for large scale ghg emission and removal estimates it will require further work and new data collected at finer scales to provide inputs and refine parameters for the model to enable explanation of fine scale variation the guidance of the ipcc states that uncertainties have to be identified quantified and reduced as far as is practicable ipcc 2003 here we summarize and discuss areas within camp v2 0 that have been identified as needing improvement as well as data requirements and gaps to help inform development of future versions of the camp table 10 although the overall mean model residual of nee was reasonably low for large scale estimation it was evident that the model requires work to express the full variation in observed nee since nee is the balance of npp and decomposition there are several approaches that can be taken to improve the explained variation in model estimates first we recommend the integration of mean annual soil temperature rather than mat into peat decomposition dynamics table 10 since co2 emissions have been shown to be correlated more strongly with soil temperature than air temperature upgaff et al 2001 leroy et al 2017 it is known that air temperature does not have a simple direct relationship with soil temperature in peatland systems weis et al 2006 because of the thermally insulative properties of peat zhao and bingcheng 2019 and a dependence on snow depth and precipitation zhang et al 2005 therefore in order to integrate soil temperature into the camp a canada wide national model for soil temperature in peatlands at an annual time scale would need to be developed one approach could be to use an existing peatland soil temperature model once scaled to the appropriate level for interaction with camp model s such as the northern ecosystem soil temperature model nest zhang et al 2003 that rely not only on air temperature as climate data but also precipitation wind speed and solar radiation would be appropriate since the nest model focuses on active peat layer depth and permafrost thaw having a nest module could also support the integration of permafrost dynamics into the camp table 10 second we recommend increasing the complexity of modelled decay dynamics and therefore the amount of explained variation in modeled nee by improving calibration of peat decomposition rates table 10 we are aware that the model calibration method is only as good as the input data to provide a sufficiently large set of input data for calibration of decomposition rates peatland categories and therefore input data used for calibration were combined into fewer groups because there were not enough data to calibrate each peatland category separately table 5 model evaluation revealed that combining open poor fens and open bogs resulted in an averaged calibrated decay rate that introduced bias since the evaluation suggested a lower decay rate for open bogs and a higher decay rate for poor fens would improve model estimation of nee for each of these peatland categories the canadian forest service peatland profile database that was used for model calibration is still being expanded data are continuously being added to the database as new studies emerge and further collaborations with other teams of peatland scientists are formed however even with continued efforts to add to the database it is evident that there is currently a lack of peat core data on poor fen systems considering that poor fens are significant peatland type comprising approximately 20 of the total area covered by peatlands in canada webster et al 2018 it is likely new data will need to be collected to improve calibration of their peat decay rates more variation in modeled nee may be explained by improving model estimation of npp rates for different vegetation e g shrubs mosses sedges categories bona et al 2018 the base structure of camp v2 0 uses static npp rates for combinations of vegetation layer and peatland category where sufficient data were available we know that npp is not static and has been shown to vary with ph chapin et al 2006 and nutrient availability vitt et al 2003 chapin et al 2006 graminoids in a lacustrine sedge fen have been shown to increase productivity in response to water table rise while bog productivity has been shown to respond to changes in temperature thormann et al 1997 and water table depth upgaff et al 2001 introducing dynamic relationships between npp and these controlling variables such as water table depth or temperature should increase the variation in modeled nee and improve the model s ability to predict the effects of climatic changes in the future because development of these relationships will require time to execute new studies and to synthesize results from existing and new studies improvements could be achieved in the short term by trying to expand and update the database of bona et al 2018 in particular more data are required on sedge productivity tree productivity low shrub productivity and especially tall shrub productivity included only in 28 27 46 and 14 respectively of studies in the parameter database as opposed to more readily reported moss npp rates included in 77 of study sites within the database and attempting to develop separate rates for each peatland category as previously mentioned for the decomposition rate calibration there is a lack of poor fen data comprising 14 of the sites within the parameter database whereas data on bogs tend to be more comprehensive 27 of sites included in the database the results of the model evaluation showed that for large scale estimation the camp was better at estimating ch4 emissions than nee as evidenced by the very small overall mean residuals and site level residuals for ch4 the bell shaped relationship between maximum ch4 flux and optimal ch4 flux water table depths used in camp to predict ch4 flux rates based on water table depth worked well but requires refinement to explain more variation the main challenge with ch4 lies in the high spatial and temporal variability such that the level of confidence in scaled up numbers is low dinsmore et al 2009 therefore when a residual is high for any one year it is difficult to determine if the model requires adjusting or if the measured annualized values are inaccurate the ch4 sub model used in this version of camp employed optimal water table depth values taken from the literature turetsky et al 2014 these were daily values rather than annual values that would be more appropriate for the camp and should be developed ideally the ch4 sub model should be calibrated for annual scale estimation by using data for annual wtd with corresponding ch4 emission rates table 10 however we found that annual water table depths were rarely reported in studies providing ch4 fluxes so this is a data gap that should be filled in order to improve accuracy of ch4 emission estimates from the camp instrumentation for ch4 flux tower measurement has only become readily available in the past decade olsen et al 2013 which explains why data are relatively sparse and inconsistently scaled as compared to co2 flux data knox et al 2019 therefore new programs such as the global carbon project s ch4 fluxnet are vital to setting global standards for gap filling meta data and properly scaling ch4 flux data inopportunely ch4 fluxnet does not plan to set a standard and account for winter emissions when only seasonal data are collected which we argue is an important aspect to creating usable datasets for annual scale and long term projections still continued funding and growth of programs such as these will work to expand datasets and baseline data collection and reporting standards that will greatly help to advance ch4 science furthermore we advocate for more funding towards flux towers in regions that are more representative of areas where peatlands are widespread in canada such as in the boreal plains and boreal shield ecozones webster et al 2018 the current model s evaluation did not reveal any significant difference in model accuracy between peatlands in western and eastern canada that being said we acknowledge that the data used to generate the c density curves as well as much of the data for model calibration were taken from western canada zoltai et al 2000 as previously mentioned the canadian forest service is currently compiling more data in their peat profile c database and much of this work is focused on improving representation of eastern canada this additional data will be used to test and if needed re calibrate the c density model for eastern canada while the camp v2 0 framework includes swamps as a wetland category as stated previously we lacked data to calibrate or evaluate the swamp class and it was therefore omitted from this study additionally authors webster et al 2018 who built the map product designed to apply the camp nationally did not include the swamp category stating that it was too difficult to map mainly because of regional variation in overstory vegetation although swamps do not make up a large area of land nationally we acknowledge that they can be important regionally e g southern ontario future work is required both to improve swamp mapping as well as c profile and emission estimates for swamp ecosystems by region table 10 in order to calibrate and assess the performance of camp for swamps the camp v2 0 only includes wildfire as a potential disturbance type and uses average depth of burn in order make use of the camp to estimate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ghg emission projections future versions of camp need to include more disturbance types requiring the development of wildfire disturbance matrices representing differing fire severities and timber and peat harvest disturbance matrices for each peatland type timber harvest on peatlands is of particular importance in the claybelt of quebec and ontario where a significant portion of harvest takes place on lowland or transition sites haavisto and jeglum 1991 a literature review to address the development of harvest disturbances has been conducted but there are gaps in data for depth and amount of c disturbed and for effects on water table depth depending on the harvest method and associated disturbances e g all season vs temporary roads other disturbance types that must be addressed in a future version of camp are those associated with oil and gas development a workshop attended by experts was held in november 2018 to develop a suite of 14 different disturbance matrices for the effect of oil and gas development on peatlands that could be used to model 21 different disturbance types including well pads pipelines seismic lines and surface mining the next step is to run these disturbance matrices with the camp v2 0 in an appropriate region of canada and test their application by comparing modeled estimates to observed data however we know that appropriate observed data for this type of comparison are extremely limited and this represents another vital data gap that will need to be addressed table 10 10 summary and conclusion a model framework for national ghg emission and removal estimation for canadian peatlands camp v2 0 was built and tested it provides the national forest carbon monitoring and reporting system with a module that can work in tandem with the newly developed gcbm for upland forests to provide a more complete approach to c reporting in canada the purpose of camp v2 0 was to provide a simple model foundation that could be widely applied across several peatland types and regions in canada and to evaluate different aspects of the model s structure and parameterization in order to inform the second phase of model development the camp takes a novel approach to modelling peatland hydrology at a large spatial scale by using the nationally available fire weather index drought code to predict long term and annual water table depth the task of model parameterization and calibration was supported by compiling two large databases bona et al 2018 zoltai et al 2000 garneau unpublished data tarnocai unpublished data packalen unpublished data a simple sub model for ch4 was also tested and performed relatively well considering the high complexity of ch4 emission dynamics and the high spatial and temporal variability in measured ch4 fluxes the camp s sensitivity to climatic variables was assessed and the model was evaluated against observed data results suggest that the camp v2 0 structure is appropriate for large spatial and temporal scale estimation and behaves as expected in relation to environmental variables but that several areas require further attention in order to increase the amount of finer scale explained variation in nee co2 and ch4 emissions table 10 future steps include expanding existing peatland databases to re calibrate decay rates and better parameterize npp rates for certain peatland classes and regions we recommend that a national soil temperature module that fits within the camp framework be built in order to replace the current simple air temperature q10 relationship for peat decomposition doing this will also facilitate inclusion of permafrost dynamics in the camp by modeling an active and non active layer and permafrost thaw several data gaps were identified that must be addressed table 10 in particular we emphasize the importance of standardizing annual scaled ch4 flux rates and the inclusion of basic meta data around flux tower sites such as annual water table depth in order to improve the science on modeling ch4 at large temporal and spatial scales future steps are also planned to include a wide array of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the camp credit authorship contribution

24802,a model framework for national greenhouse gas emission and removal estimation for canadian peatlands camp v2 0 was developed and tested it provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest generic carbon budget model gcbm developed to eventually replace the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector cbm cfs3 as the core model in canada s national forest carbon monitoring accounting and reporting system the camp v2 0 provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories it tracks the growth turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components foliage branches stems and roots of trees shrubs sedges and mosses it uses a q10 relationship to model peat c pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth the camp takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally available canadian fire weather index drought code to predict long term and annual water table depth the camp v2 0 provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version model behavior and sensitivity were assessed and evaluated against observed flux data results suggest that the camp v2 0 provides an appropriate structure for large spatial and temporal scale estimation of emissions owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g c ha 1 y 1 n 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites and by 8 g c ha 1 y 1 when weighted by site location n 12 sites 3 years of data per site the model overestimated net ecosystem exchange nee by 20 g c ha 1 y 1 n 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites and by 2 g c ha 1 y 1 when weighted by site location n 11 sites 3 years of data per site and results demonstrate that inter site variation is greater than temporal variation across nee measures several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer scale emission estimates recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize npp rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types as well as developing a national annual scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature q10 decay relationship currently used in the camp v2 0 data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual scale meta data future work is required to include permafrost dynamics as well as additional natural and anthropogenic disturbances keywords ghg inventory generic carbon budget model national scale peatland fire 1 introduction there are growing international requirements for

frolking et al 2002 mwm st hilaire et al 2010 to large scale regional models of peat accumulation at century scales eg peatbalance schuldt et al 2013 chaudhary et al 2017 however none of these models can be easily applied at the national scale in canada because of the limited data available for model parameterization furthermore existing peatland c models are generally independent from upland forest c estimation models therefore there are no or few tools available to integrate c emissions and removals across the landscape that provide a consistent and unified approach to modeling both upland and peatland systems there are only three existing estimates of national ghg emissions from peatlands in canada roulet et al 2000 kurz et al 1992 webster et al 2018 the first two roulet et al 2000 kurz et al 1992 use constant rates of c accumulation co2 and ch4 net emissions for all peatland types and multiply them by the total peatland area in canada in order to improve on these methods webster et al 2018 took a more comprehensive approach by developing a peatland map to define the areas covered by different peatland types across canada and compiling nee and ch4 emission rates for each peatland type and region from the literature all of these methods make the simplifying assumption that one or a few value s can represent large areas over static climate conditions these empirical estimates also cannot project emissions from natural disturbances land use change and the potential effects of climate change thus a framework for a more dynamic approach to peatland c accounting is needed the canadian model for peatlands camp was developed to address the need for national c estimation and reporting in peatlands within canada an early version of the model was described by shaw et al 2016 here we present a fully implemented working version of the camp v2 0 the camp v2 0 has been developed as a module for the upland forest generic carbon budget model gcbm which is the next generation of the cbm cfs3 the carbon science in the gcbm is identical to that of the cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 and only some of the implementation details have changed in the gcbm therefore throughout the manuscript we reference the cbm cfs3 literature for c science understanding this applies equally to the gcbm the main differences and advantage of using the gcbm framework is that it can use spatially explicit data layers for input variables and will allow for seamless modeling of upland and peatland c dynamics because of its modular design the gcbm is built on a collaborative open source data integration framework the full lands integration tool flint developed by members of the moja global team http moja global the camp was developed to be consistent with modeling of moss c dynamics in moss c bona et al 2016 a module for the cbm cfs3 to represent c dynamics of thick moss layers in upland forests that can occur in site types transitional between upland forests and peatlands the camp has been built to require a minimal amount of inputs so that it can be applied broadly across different peatland categories in canada ultimately emission estimates from the camp can be used for national ghg emission estimates when used in combination with a national map product already developed webster et al 2018 that defines the land units classified as each peatland category used within the camp model outputs are intended to be consistent with the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc tables for international reporting purposes table 2 in kurz et al 2009 this version v2 0 of the camp is built to simulate peatland ghg fluxes to the atmosphere co2 ch4 and other flux indicators such as net ecosystem exchange nee and heterotrophic respiration rh on the basis of a predicted long term water table position as well as annual fluctuation in the water table productivity of different vegetation layers decay and c transfers between pools although the current version of the camp does not include permafrost thaw anthropogenic disturbances natural disturbances other than wildfire and some more complex finer scale climatic and edaphic factors its framework was developed so that they can be included in future versions once data limitations are overcome in this paper we describe the camp v2 0 beginning with spatial representation of land and peatland categories modeling of biomass and dead organic matter dynamics including ch4 emissions and decay response to temperature and a fluctuating water table model initialization including use of wildfire disturbances in the spin up calibration of decay in the acrotelm and catotelm peat layers model behavior and sensitivity model evaluation and ending with identification of data gaps and recommendations for improvements in a future model version a prototype version was implemented tested and calibrated using the r software r core team 2017 and then implemented as camp v2 0 module in c 11 within the gcbm framework 2 spatial representation of the camp peatland categories the basic modeling unit in the cbm cfs3 is the forest stand kurz et al 2009 that is defined by combinations of classifiers such as forest age land class productivity forest type and site quality kurz et al 2009 the analogue modeling unit in the camp is the peatland site that is classified by a unique combination of ecozone province or territory and peatland category eleven peatland categories are used in the camp framework that are defined by combinations of two ecosystem characteristics wetland type hydrologic regime and tree cover type table 1 wetland types modeled in the camp are comprised of the dominant peatland types in canada s forested area bog precipitation is the only hydrological input poor fen minor groundwater inputs rich fen significant groundwater inputs and swamp seasonal or riparian water inputs as defined by the canadian wetland classification system national wetlands working group 1997 peat swamps were included in the modules framework but due to the current lack of data to parameterize or calibrate the swamp class the camp v2 0 was not developed for swamps marshes and shallow water types are not included in the camp v2 0 as all wetland categories included had to meet the definition of a peatland i e having greater than 40 cm of peat development national wetlands working group 1997 each wetland class is combined with three tree cover types open treed and forested taken from canada s definition of forest land that is consistent with the ipcc standards as implemented for canada s national and international reporting stinson et al 2011 forested peatland categories only include sites with large trees potential height 5 m and 25 cover at maturity such as the camp forested bog category that includes sites that are potentially transitional to upland black spruce sites with shallow peat layers broadly treed peatland camp categories are dominated by small trees potential height 5 m 10 25 cover and the open peatland camp categories are dominated by a shrub or sedge layer that can contain tree species and sparse small trees potential height 5 m 10 cover table 1 minimum inputs required for each site are area ha peatland category and location with polygon boundaries required if results are to be mapped default model parameters are provided for each peatland category that captures large scale variation in growth turnover and decomposition these default parameters were estimated based on literature cited values from 186 peatland study sites compiled into the peatland decomposition and productivity parameter database bona et al 2018 the camp is structured so that users can specify their own model parameters for combinations of peatland

turnover mortality transfer and decomposition sequentially in annual time steps the following text describes the peatland c pools transfers between those pools and c emitted to the atmosphere over the course of peatland development in the absence of a disturbance 3 1 pools the camp tracks a total of 18 pools seven live biomass and 11 dead organic matter pools fig 1 biomass pools represent three different vegetation categories woody vegetation trees and shrubs sedges and mosses biomass c pools transition to appropriate litter pools e g live sedge foliage c is transferred to dead sedge foliage c at pool specific turnover rates after some decomposition litter pools are deemed buried as peat and transferred into the acrotelm pools eventually transferring into the catotelm pools the camp shrub vegetation includes small evergreen shrubs such as ledum groenlandicum oeder hulten small deciduous shrubs such as salix pedicellaris pursh and tall deciduous shrubs such as alnus crispa aiton pursh the shrub vegetation category is split between different plant components to form three pools foliage stems and branches and roots sedges such as carex rostrata stokes are split between foliage which includes all aboveground parts and roots mosses in the camp are split between two different groups sphagnum spp mosses such as sphagnum fuscum schump klinggr and feather mosses such as pleurozium schreberi brid mitt the feather moss category conceptually includes all peat forming mosses with the exception of sphagnum mosses that are modelled separately feather moss was kept separate in order to facilitate the transition between the cbm cfs3 moss c module that also keeps track of both sphagnum and feather moss bona et al 2016 as two c functional groups bona et al 2013 due to the differences in litter quality which affects peat physical and chemical properties turetsky et al 2003 turetsky et al 2008 decomposition rates fenton et al 2010 and fire consumption rates shetler et al 2008 the gcbm is used to simulate small 5 m height potential and large 5 m height potential live tree biomass growth for treed and forested peatlands respectively table 1 the annual litter fall and mortality transfers from the live tree pools generated within gcbm are calculated and the c is transferred into the appropriate camp dead woody pool where decomposition is simulated within the camp module fresh litter from each of the live pools is transferred to a corresponding dead pool dead tree and shrub foliage dead fine woody debris dead coarse woody debris dead tree and shrub roots dead sedge foliage dead sedge roots and dead feather moss these dead pools act as transition pools that decay relatively quickly in comparison to the less labile peat in the acrotelm and catotelm pools conceptually the c in these pools is ready to transfer to the acrotelm once it is deemed buried by mosses and sufficiently incorporated into the peat determined by the pool s turnover time the sphagnum moss category is the only live pool which is transferred directly to the acrotelm because sphagnum mosses bury themselves as they grow making it difficult to clearly define a dead sphagnum moss pool in a peatland the physical split between the acrotelm and the catotelm layer is generally defined as the split between oxic and anoxic conditions for consistency and for modeling purposes see section 3 2 water table depth we used the well regarded definition of the acrotelm from ingram 1978 1982 where the acrotelm depth is expressed as the maximum water table depth i e the water table at the lowest position under drought conditions such that the acrotelm is the oxic layer or at least periodically oxic and the catotelm is the consistently water saturated anoxic layer in the camp we use an operational definition of drought being the driest summer conditions found every 5 years 80th percentile of water table depth corresponding to moderate drought in the north american drought monitor framework svoboda et al 2002 this definition is supported by morris et al 2011 who suggested annual maximum not extreme i e 100 years maxima water depths as being appropriate for the acrotelm definition and suggested a time frame of circa 5 years is most fitting the degree of water saturation has a large impact on the decomposition rates of these pools beer and blodau 2007 the camp models two conceptual water tables the long term climatic water table depth 100 8000 years as well as the estimated annual water table depth when the model is run annually for contemporary c estimation the long term water table is used to determine the lasting boundary between the acrotelm and catotelm which ultimately impacts the litter quality between these layers and their resulting decomposition rates the annual water table depth is used to track the fluctuation in inter annual water table and the resulting level of water saturation that also significantly impacts decay to accomplish this the model first predicts the long term water table depth that is used to determine the oxic acrotelm and anoxic catotelm pools the module then tracks the movement of the annual water table across these pools by using temporary holding pools such that c that is under water within the acrotelm for a particular year is placed in the anoxic acrotelm holding pool and similarly c that is exposed to oxygen within the catotelm is placed in the oxic catotelm holding pool for that year we are aware that because the anoxic catotelm pool is defined by the 80th percentile of the long term water table depth it will have an oxic portion present only once in every five years corresponding to a moderate drought under the north american drought monitor framework lawrimore et al 2002 regardless an oxic portion of the catotelm was included in order to account for drought years outside the upper range of long term weather conditions which may be of particular importance in a changing climate or peatland drainage scenario 3 2 water table depth water table depth in the camp is calculated as a function of the canadian fire weather index drought code dc which has been shown to approximate water table decline in peatlands as it follows a simple one dimensional water balance approach precipitation and evaporation that mirrors the water balance of peatlands waddington et al 2012 the relationship used for the camp was based not on the small sample of peatland water table time series from waddington et al 2012 but rather on single water table measurements for many n 296 sites from zoltai et al 2000 where both records of precise peatland type and drought code from nearby weather stations are available these single measurements of peatland water table per site were then related back to long term dc values for the sampling date to yield a simple linear model eq 1 describing the relationship between water table wt depth cm and dc in different peatland categories 1 w t 0 045 d c b w c where b cm varies by the peatland sites wetland class bog poor fen rich fen w and canopy class c as follows 12 5 for open bogs 25 9 for treed bogs 29 2 for forested bogs 0 7 for open poor fen 12 7 for treed poor fen 16 for forested poor fen 5 6 for open rich fen 7 8 for treed rich fen and 11 1 for forested rich fen this model explains 52 of the variance in water table depth has a residual standard error of 13 cm and is highly significant p 0 001 as the acrotelm can be approximated by the peat layers exposed to aerobic conditions during periods of deep water table decline we calculated the annual maximum dc for every point in the forested area of canada using a 9 km weather grid to compute dc from the narr reanalysis jain et al 2018 from 1979 2015 the 80th percentile of the maximum dc value was used to compute the water table using eq 1 and that distance below the surface was taken as the acrotelm thickness note that the relationship eq 1 used to predict water table depths only predicts a range of estimated annual minimum water table depths table a14 that correspond to the observed range of potential drought codes 78 5 to 411 8 for canada at the time of the peatland water table observation supplement s1 we acknowledge that a more complex approach to water table modeling could have been employed via advanced and surface models such as that described by bechtold et al 2019 that can simulate daily to monthly decline in water table depth but this was deemed too detailed and parameter heavy for the first stage of the camp model framework development in addition the model of bechtold et al 2019 was not available when the camp model design was created instead we chose to start with a peatland type and weather driven model of water table depth but more sophisticated process based models could be explored for use in future versions 3 3 carbon density curves the c that is transferred to the oxic catotelm and anoxic acrotelm holding pools as the annual water table fluctuates is calculated based on standardized c density curves for each peatland category carbon density curves were modeled on 336 peat cores with 5017 core segments with bulk density data from zoltai et al 2000 relationships from bauer et al 2006 were used to convert bulk density to c density the zoltai database sites were classified into the 11 camp peatland categories based on vegetation observations and peat properties sites where more than one peat core was collected were treated as fully independent as these sites were sampled across different topographic forms e g strings or flarks of a patterned fen peat samples at differing depths from the same core are not truly independent samples so linear mixed effects models should be used treat et al 2016 morris et al 2015 in studies of peat properties to accounted for within core effects therefore we used linear mixed effect modeling via the lme4 package in r bates et al 2015 with depth wetland class and tree cover class as fixed effects to model c density both the core as well as sampling year were included as random effects in the model depth class number of 15 cm intervals from the surface was transformed by the natural logarithm to account for the large increase in bulk density just below the surface in most peatland ecosystems thompson and waddington 2014 a leave one out cross validation analysis was used on individual samples n 4096 but excluding any samples from the same core in the cross validation predictions of c density at 15 cm increments down to 3 0 m depth were made for each of the 11 peatland categories using the complete version of the linear mixed effect model note that we do not limit the depth of the peat profile to 3 0 m elsewhere in the camp and that the c density curves limit of 3 0 m is irrelevant because curves are used to calculate transfers between oxic and anoxic pools and the annual water table depth never approaches a 3 0 m depth both instantaneous c density per 15 cm depth interval by peat class and cumulative top down c density were calculated instantaneous c density kg c m 3 from the linear mixed effects models was fitted to a continuous function to facilitate predictions for depth increments different than the 15 cm used in the model 2 c w d z d l n z e where w d and z represent the wetland class canopy cover class and depth interval respectively the coefficients d and e were fitted using a non linear least squares procedure from the r package nls with the median and standard error of each parameter estimate recorded table 2 similarly cumulative c density was fit to the simple exponential function 3 c w d z a z b a 95 confidence interval for the fitted functions was calculated for cumulative c load up to 3 0 m and compared to other peatland types in order to determine meaningful differences in standard density curves between peatland types table 3 individual c density curve functions table 2 3 using eqs 2 and 3 above had very low standard errors for the parameters a through d owing to the use of model prediction data in the curve fitting rather than the population of cores from the 336 cores used to build the linear mixed effects model cumulative c density curves generally followed nutrient gradients with open bogs have the lowest c loading 154 19 7 kg c m 2 compared with the aggregate of all rich fens and swamps which as an aggregate had a c loading between 178 and 211 kg c m 2 table 3 fig 2 3 4 growth 3 4 1 tree layer growth the gcbm uses merchantable stemwood volume yield curves as input to simulate stand level merchantable sized 5 m height potential tree growth over time then allometric equations are used to calculate other aboveground tree biomass pools boudewyn et al 2007 as a function of stem volume kurz et al 2009 we use the following default types of curves for each forested peatland category but in the future users will have the ability to provide their own yield curves for the forested bog peatland category we use a default pure black spruce picea mariana mill b s p yield curve for poor fens we use a black spruce forest type curve which assumed black spruce as a lead species but includes a small proportion of larch larix laricina du roi k koch and for forested rich fens we use a larch forest type curve which includes a small proportion of black spruce penner et al 2008 small tree growth 5m height potential was simulated in gcbm similarly to merchantable sized trees except that total tree volume yield curves were used instead of merchantable wood volume yield curves plot data from stands located on peatlands in northern alberta were compiled for total stem volume and an empirical volume over age yield curve was developed using a model based on hoerl s special function daniel and wood 1980 3 4 2 shrub layer growth in keeping with the cbm cfs3 framework the camp models shrub layer growth using simple shrub net growth curves where aboveground mass increases linearly to a maximum value and then levels off values estimated for maximum biomass g biomass m 2 vary by peatland category and were calculated as the mean of values reported in the literature bona et al 2018 table a1 tall shrub maximum biomass data were not available for each peatland category therefore a mean for all peatland categories was used and scaled for each peatland category by multiplying the mean biomass per unit area by the relative cover of tall shrubs for each peatland category from zoltai et al 2000 tables a2 a3 it is assumed that the maximum biomass after establishment is reached at three years for low shrubs johnston et al 2015 table a1 and at 20 years for tall shrubs wieder et al 2009 table a2 a3 the aboveground shrub c is split between the shrub stems and branches pool and the shrub foliage pool by using a foliage to aboveground biomass ratio set at a default value of 0 265 calculated as a mean from bona et al 2018 this ratio is used for all shrubs although it is based solely on low shrubs since data to calculate a tall shrub value were not available net shrub layer root growth was calculated as a function of shrub layer stems and branches using eq 4 from murphy et al 2009 4 root production a stem biomass b where a 0 75 and b 0 02 r2 0 62 this equation was chosen because it does not vary by water table or site type and included fine roots as well as some coarse roots similar allometric equations by murphy and moore 2010 that were derived for the mer bleue bog were tested because of geographical proximity but eventually were rejected in favor of a function from a study in finland murphy et al 2009 because the mer bleue study did not include coarse roots 3 4 2 sedge growth annual net sedge growth was calculated as an adjusted and scaled npp value anpps based on a review of peatland sedge dynamics first a total mean maximum standing crop biomass of 220 g biomass m 2 for open bogs and fens was calculated using the data in bona et al 2018 there were few data for treed systems so they were not included in this mean instead values for treed systems were calculated as a mean maximum standing crop biomass resulting from scaling the total mean maximum standing crop biomass 220 g biomass m 2 using percent ground cover values from zoltai et al 2000 for each camp peatland category table a4 the scaled standing crop biomass was then multiplied by an adjustment factor currently set at a default value of 1 1 bernard and hankinson 1979 this adjustment factor is used to correct for intra annual mortality authors bernard and hankinson 1979 found that the quadrat method for sampling sedge biomass the method used for all compiled data in bona et al 2018 only accounts for live biomass in the growing season of the measurement year however since a portion of the sedge crop grows and then dies during that season one must not only account for the observed growth but also the growth from sedges that have grown and died within the growing season to get a true measure of npp in accounting for this the biomass productivity ratio increases from 0 85 to 1 1 bernard and hankinson et al 1979 carex rostrada and in another study of carex lucustris authors cited an increase from 0 82 to 1 5 bernard and macdonald 1973 these studies were conducted in marshes but no similar studies were found for bogs and fens so the default value for bogs and fens is based on the reported values for marshes an adjustment factor of 1 1 is used in the camp to adjust the scaled mean live sedge standing crop biomass c assuming that intra seasonal mortality for carex rostrata and other sedge species is similar within fens and bogs to calculate the net growth of sedge roots anpps is divided by a mean aboveground to belowground ratio for sedges found in the literature initially set at a default value of 0 3 this was estimated from a range of literature cited values 0 09 0 56 where most studies observed that roots contribute a relatively large portion to the total npp bona et al 2018 3 4 3 moss growth mean npp for sphagnum and feather mosses by peatland category were estimated using data compiled in bona et al 2018 table a5 and used to model moss growth these baseline npp rates were scaled for some peatland categories e g rich fens because field studies citing moss npp rates in the literature were not scaled up to the plot level estimates of npp from field studies for bogs and poor fens were used without scaling because in these sites peat mosses cover a large portion of the ground and are more spatially homogenous therefore making them relatively accurate estimates of the plot level npp however for peatland categories where mosses typically have low ground cover baseline npp rates were scaled table a6 by multiplying them by the relative cover values calculated from zoltai et al 2000 3 5 biomass turnover as in the cbm cfs3 the camp represents biomass mortality and litterfall using an annual turnover rate mortality yr 1 that determines the amount of c transferred annually from each live pool into the appropriate dead pool the shrub branches and stem pool turnover rate is calculated based on the assumption that the net growth of shrub branch and stems would reduce to zero after being established i e after three years for low shrubs and after 20 years for tall shrubs net growth is equal to npp minus mortality so when net growth equals zero then annual npp should approximately equal the annual mortality rate for any mature site therefore annual npp rates from bona et al 2018 were averaged for each peatland category table a7 and assumed equal to annual mortality these mortality rates by peatland category were then divided by mean biomass values for branches and stem biomass in bona et al 2018 for each peatland category to solve for the annual turnover rate mortality yr 1 for each of these biomass components shrub root mortality was set at a default value of 0 56 from the study by authors laiho et al 2003 litterfall from the shrub foliage pool is also simulated annually by the camp the proportion of evergreen to non evergreen foliage was calculated as a mean of ratios in bona et al 2018 for each camp peatland category table a8 the current default in the camp is that 100 of non evergreen leaves and 25 of evergreen leaves aerts et al 1989 transfer to dead pools annually the camp sedge turnover rate is currently set to a default value of 0 61 yr 1 cited by authors saarinen et al 1996 that is also similar to the turnover rate of 0 6 yr 1 cited in grigal et al 1985 the camp assumes that c accumulated in the live sphagnum and feather moss pools in the previous year t 1 is completely transferred as litter to the acrotelm in the next year t the assumption that total aboveground moss npp is equal to moss litter input is also used in other peatland models e g frolking et al 2002 2010 3 6 decay dynamics as in the cbm cfs3 the camp has a built in temperature dependent decay rate that calculates the amount of organic matter that decomposes in each dead pool annually the applied decay rate ak of any dead pool is calculated using eq 5 5 a k k tempmod where k is the base decay rate for each dead pool at the reference temperature of 10 c and tempmod is a temperature modifier tempmod is calculated using eq 6 6 tempmod e mati reftemp ln q 10 0 1 where mat is the mean annual temperature for the ith spatial unit mati reftemp is the reference temperature 10 c and q10 is the temperature coefficient exponential decay rates y 1 for different litter types were compiled bona et al 2018 table a9 a13 appropriate q10 values were difficult to determine from the literature especially since the q10 value for peat have been shown to vary greatly between sites between 2 2 and 19 in chapman and thurlow 1998 and to vary with changing water table depth silvola et al 1996 therefore decay rates and q10 values for the acrotelm and catotelm pools were estimated using an bayesian markov chain monte carlo technique to find values of decay rates and q10 that maximized the likelihood function which was expressed as a function of the difference between modeled and measured estimates of c stocks in each of these pools see section 6 calibration of peat decay parameters after the amount of decayed c in each dead pool is calculated a proportion of the c is transferred to the atmosphere patm and the rest is transferred to the appropriate pool of lesser chemical potential energy as humified material pt the proportion of c released to the atmosphere due to decomposition is split into co2 and ch4 3 7 methane emission modeling peatland ch4 emissions posed a significant challenge because flux rates reported in the literature have high spatial and temporal variability and are dependent on highly complex dynamics arneth et al 2010 wania et al 2010 the amount of ch4 that reaches the atmosphere from any peatland is a function of how much of it becomes oxidized while being transported through the peat column edwards et al 1998 this transport process can be very complex and depends on factors such as the rate of diffusion moore et al 1990 ebullition shannon and white 1994 and plant mediated transport schimel 1995 taking into account these complex dynamics in a process based ch4 model across several regions in canada would require a large number of parameters that are not available instead for the camp v2 0 we use the approach described in a meta analysis study by turetsky et al 2014 whereby an optimal water table depth that corresponds to maximum ch4 flux f ch4max is defined for each wetland type bog poor fen rich fen the optimal water table depths and their corresponding f ch4max rates grouped by wetland type bog rich fen and poor fen within the boreal described by turetsky et al 2014 are used here data from a peatland drainage study by strack et al 2010 are then used to model response to deviations from the optimal water table depths which we refer to as the f 10 the f 10 value is analogous to a q 10 value such that it solves for a decrease in ch4 production within a system that corresponds to a 10 cm decrease or increase in water table depth in the camp v2 0 we assume a symmetrical response for all peatland categories and use two f 10 values one for water table increase from optimum 0 32 and one for water table decrease 2 6 based on within site responses to water table change from strack et al 2010 rather than the between site water table ch4 production responses from turetsky et al 2014 initially the ch4 model used regionally specific f ch 4max rates collected from the literature for each ecozone ecological stratification working group 1996 and wetland type in order to improve expression of regional variation however this version of the model consistently underestimated ch4 likely because of low sample sizes to estimate f ch4max rates for each wetland type bog poor fen rich fen and ecoregion combination so the decision was made to use the f ch4max rates reported in turetsky et al 2014 for the entire boreal until more data can be compiled the drawback of using this approach is that the values provided by turetsky et al 2014 are based on daily measures of both water table and ch4 flux to make them useful for the camp the flux rates had to be scaled to annual rates following the method of webster et al 2018 on a daily scale water table varies significantly more than on an annual scale meaning that daily optimal water table depths sometimes fall outside the range of the mean annual water table positions supplement s1 the result is that optimal water table depths for maximum ch4 flux used here daily for poor fen and rich fen systems 2 cm 16 cm are never reached within the range of potential annual water table depths for these systems that correspond to the annual minimum water table 3 to 35 and 3 to 30 respectively appendix table a14 though the peatland systems can be observed at water tables above the surface supplement s1 despite this issue the ch4 scheme used in the camp v2 0 provided better results on a large scale than any other schemes we tested including a simple linear relationship with water table depth defined in the original camp design document shaw et al 2016 4 model initialization before running a camp simulation c pools need to be given initial c stock values which in the camp v2 0 are the steady state c stocks with the exception of the catotelm pool adjusted for the effects of the last stand replacing wildfire in the cbm cfs3 c pools are initialized by simulating repeated cycles of forest stand development until pools reach a semi equilibrium where the annual change in soil pools is less than 1 kurz et al 2009 for the camp we calculate the steady state c pools analytically because it would be too computationally taxing and require too long to spin up the peat pools with repeated disturbance cycles due to low decay rates of the peat pools following the logic in weng et al 2012 c dynamics across all ecosystem compartments can be expressed as 7 d x t d t u t a k x t f s m x t where x t is a row vector of c pools in ecosystem compartments u t is a row vector of c inputs to live pools tree leaves wood and roots sedges feather and sphagnum mosses a is a matrix of c partitioning coefficients among the ecosystem compartments k is a matrix of c turnover rates f is the frequency of the stand replacing fires s is the diagonal matrix of the fractions of c pools removed by a stand replacing fire and m is a matrix of c partitioning coefficients that allocates c that was lost from a donor pool as a result of fire among the receiving pools e g when fire kills the aboveground biomass live roots or a donor pool are transferred to a litter pool which is a receiving pool to obtain steady state xss we first calculated steady state c inputs uss from gcbm simulations of tree foliage woody and root pools feather moss and sphagnum npp s table a5 and npp derived from steady state shrub biomass table a1 2 and associated partitioning coefficients and biomass turnover rates afterwards we set the values in the vector d x t d t which represented the annual changes in c pools to 0 set u t to uss and solved eq 7 for xss as described in xia et al 2012 afterwards the catotelm pool was adjusted to represent the c pool size after 8000 years of c accumulation that is the approximate time since peatland vegetation initiated in canada koropchak et al 2012 as for other pools dynamics for the catotelm pool is formulated as 8 d x d t c i n s s k f s x where x is the c pool c in ss is the steady stead c input from the donor pools k is the decay rate of the pool f is the frequency of disturbance and s is the severity of disturbance of the given pool expressed as a fraction ranging from 0 to 1 eq 8 is a separable differential equation and therefore can be analytically solved for x at the time t yielding 9 x t c i n s s k f s e k f s t c o n s t where c i n s s k f s is the steady state pool size and e k f s t c o n s t is the correction to the steady state pool to obtain the pool at the given time t because initial pool size or pool size when t 0 for the catotelm is 0 econst will equal to the steady state pool size c i n s s k f s therefore the new expression for x t becomes 10 x t c i n s s k f s 1 e k f s t from eq 10 it follows that the time it takes for the given pool to reach a value within 0 1 of its equilibrium is dependent on the decay rate of the given pool as well as the frequency and severity of disturbances unlike for other pools in the camp which reach equilibrium after less than 4400 years it takes more than 8000 years for catotelm c pool to reach equilibrium because the catotelm is assumed to remain undisturbed after fire s 0 and its decay rates are extremely slow see table 5 for k magnitudes therefore to avoid overestimation of the catotelm c pool we needed to adjust the steady state estimate for the catotelm in the calculated vector xss as follows 11 x s s c a t o t e l m x s s c a t o t e l m 1 e k c a t o t e l m 8 000 lastly once all c pools in xss were obtained we simulated a stand replacing wildfire ran the model forward to the time since the last stand replacing disturbance assigned to the site and used the x age as the initial values for model simulations this accelerated initialization method was validated by running the model for 30 000 annual time steps including fire at the appropriate fire return interval and comparing the steady state values from the solution with the spin up values from the method used in the cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 but applied in the camp v2 0 5 wildfire disturbance in the camp v2 0 wildfire is the only disturbance type included at this time that affects biomass turnover and transfers between dead pools as well as the atmosphere each time a fire is simulated a wildfire disturbance matrix is applied that determines the amount of c transferred from one pool to another or emitted from a pool to the atmosphere as co2 co or ch4 a disturbance matrix is a table where columns are designated for each potential c source pool in the model e g live sedge foliage or dead sedge roots and rows are assigned to each potential sink pool e g anoxic catotelm or atmosphere pool and the intersection of the source and sink column row defines the proportion of c moved from source to sink for a given disturbance event such as fire in this case kurz et al 2009 kurz et al 1992 we assume that the live sedge roots and live shrub roots will not be combusted by fire because all or most of them will be protected by water saturated peat layers instead 100 of live shrub roots are assumed to die and directly transfer to the acrotelm c pool while live sedge roots remain alive all other live pools are assumed to be combusted by fire live shrub stems and branches live shrub foliage live sedge foliage live sphagnum and live feather moss dead pools that are easily consumed by fire such as dead tree and shrub foliage dead sedge foliage and dead feather moss shetler et al 2008 are completely combusted and the c emitted to the atmosphere the oxic acrotelm and oxic catotelm holding pool is assumed to be only partially combusted at a rate of 12 5 for bogs and 11 4 for poor and rich fens rates were calculated based on data from lukenbach et al 2015 and turetsky et al 2011 table 4 other dead pools that are assumed to be partially combusted by a fire at the same rate as the oxic peat are dead fine woody debris dead coarse woody debris dead tree and shrub roots and dead sedge roots none of the anoxic catotelm or anoxic acrotelm pool is combusted by fire since it is water saturated and protected from burning each time c in a camp pool is combusted by a wildfire simulation the c is emitted to the atmosphere as either co2 co or ch4 the ratio determining the split between these three gases depends on whether the pool is assumed to combust in a flaming or smouldering fire dead tree and shrub sedge foliage and dead fine woody debris pools are assumed to burn in the flaming combustion phase and emit at a ratio of co co2 by mass t ha 1 of 0 0499 and ch4 co2 by mass t ha 1 of 0 00194 ottmar 2014 the rest of the dead and live pools are assumed to smoulder and emit at a ratio of co co2 by mass t ha 1 at 0 254 and the ch4 co2 by mass t ha 1 at 0 038 kohlenburg et al 2018 these emission ratios were converted to molar ratios of c in a series of calculations such that the total amount of c emitted is multiplied by a factor of 0 8788 0 1083 0 01285 to solve for the amount of c emitted as co2 co and ch4 respectively for flaming and 0 523 0 327 and 0 149 to solve for the amount of c emitted as co2 co and ch4 respectively for smouldering 6 calibration of peat decay parameters decomposition rates for the acrotelm and catotelm pools are rarely measured because these data are extremely limited the exponential decay rates y 1 and q10 values for these pools were calibrated table 5 using peat profile c stock data parameters were calibrated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo technique that was previously used to calibrate decay parameters for the cbm cfs3 hararuk et al 2017 to calibrate parameters for the camp acrotelm and catotelm observed and modeled acrotelm and catotelm c stocks were compared across several thousands of iterations to generate a posterior distribution for each parameter value prior parameter distributions were assumed to be uniform and bound by minimum and maximum values obtained from the literature bona et al 2018 and calibration runs were continued until posterior parameter distributions became stable hararuk et al 2017 we recognize that since the camp is built for the purpose of generating estimates of c emissions and not c stocks that calibrating against c stock changes instead of one time c stock pool data would be ideal however because flux data are not split between acrotelm and catotelm peat pools they could not be used for calibration and were instead reserved for model validation the purpose of this calibration procedure is to parameterize the decomposition rates of the long term acrotelm and catotelm pools therefore the calibration procedure was conducted using the initialization spin up of the camp see section 4 model initialization where long term water table is used instead of annual water table fluctuations over the long timeframe required to calibrate decomposition of peat only large scale temporal variation in parameters such as water table is required the calibration dataset was comprised mainly of 370 peatland sites from zoltai et al 2000 where sufficient data were available to estimate acrotelm and catotelm c stocks and enough vegetation and wetland metadata were available to classify the sites into the appropriate camp peatland category because the data of zoltai et al 2000 are mainly from western canada additional data from eastern canada quebec and ontario originating from various peatland researchers unpublished data were included to fully represent peatlands across canada garneau unpublished data packalen unpublished data tarnocai unpublished data 7 model sensitivity and behavior model sensitivity and behavior were assessed by examining the responses of emission co2 ch4 estimates and initial peatland c stock estimates to spatial input variables that are either directly mat or indirectly fire return interval fri dc related to climate carbon dioxide emission rates are affected through two separate mechanisms in the model one that helps to determine the size of the initial peat c stock resulting from the model initialization affected by mat and fri the other determines the annual proportion of the peat c stock that is decomposed and then either released to the atmosphere or transferred to another pool affected by mat see section 3 6 decay dynamics and by the annual water table depth methane emissions are primarily driven by water table depth that is predicted by dc a theoretical spatial test grid was developed to represent the full range of values where peatlands occur in canada for each spatial variable fire return intervals ranged between 35 and 500 years mats between 10 1 c and 7 8 c and the long term and annual dcs between 78 5 and 411 8 corresponding to a different range of predicted water table depths for each peatland category appendix table a14 readers are reminded that the camp v2 0 does not include frozen soils typical of regions with mat of 10 1 and that this sensitivity test is being used to understand the limits of the current model s response to the full range of extremes in climatic variables observed in canada when a single variable was tested all other spatial variables were held constant at their mid range value we used nee net ecosystem exchange of co2 to assess co2 emissions estimates for ease of comparison to observed flux measures that are commonly reported in peatland c dynamics studies we also assessed the 100 year global warming potential gwp of total heterotrophic respiration t rh calculated as the sum of co2 and ch4 emissions after conversion to co2 equivalents co2e using a conversion factor of 1 for co2 and 25 for ch4 myhre et al 2013 7 1 sensitivity of initial c stocks to mat and fri the mat is applied to the base annual decomposition rates of each of the dead pools using a q1o relationship see section 3 6 decay dynamics which will directly influence the amount of c emitted to the atmosphere annually the same approach is used to arrive at an applied decay rate to use in the model initialization i e spin up procedure in the camp mat can have a large effect on the amount of initial c in each of the peat pools within a peatland type table 6 this in turn can affect emissions estimates as pools with larger stocks will tend to have larger emissions the absolute differences in c stocks between the highest 7 8 c and lowest 10 1 c mat tested across peatland types ranged from 240 to 1641 mg c ha 1 for the acrotelm and from 163 to 1677 mg c ha 1 for the catotelm table 6 in general peat pool c stocks were highest at the lowest mat and lowest and the highest mat this relationship is consistent with that of another large scale global peatland soil organic c model wania et al 2009 that uses a similar initialization procedure wania et al 2009 report a predicted range of total soil organic c stocks from approximately 400 mg ha 1 at mat 8 7 c to 2000 mg ha 1 at mat 6 7 c when testing a mat range of 8 7 c to 6 7 c camp predicts a similar but higher range in total peat c when the same range in mat is tested 520 mg ha 1 at mat 8 7 c to 3365 2 mg ha 1 at mat 6 7 c wania et al 2009 caution that their estimates tend to be lower than those found in the literature they attribute the low values to limiting the analytical solution for their spin up to 1000 years whereas we assume that the catotelm never reaches a true equilibrium and use a factor of 8000 years in the initialization of the catotelm pool see section 4 model initialization while our total c stocks reach higher values than reported by wania et al 2009 they are within the range of field measurements reported in the literature that were compiled here for model calibration which ranged from 385 to 4300 mg ha 1 zoltai et al 2000 garneau unpublished data tarnocai unpublished data packalen unpublished data in summary the camp is demonstrating expected model behavior by having a consistent correlation between organic matter accumulation and mat that is in general agreement with others wania et al 2009 clymo et al 1998 other relevant studies which examined peatland sensitivity to temperature generally focused on peat soil temperature rather than air temperature demonstrating a strong correlation between co2 leroy et al 2017 and ch4 hargreaves and fowler 1998 leroy et al 2017 fluxes to peat temperature this relationship has been shown to decrease with peat profile depth jusczak et al 2013 which is consistent with our calibrated q10 values which were uniformly smaller for catotelm deeper pools than for acrotelm pools table 5 the model s initial c stocks for peat pools also demonstrate an expected relationship with fri stocks are decreasing with increased fire frequency and visa versa keeping all other spatial variables constant at mid range values mat 1 15 annual and long term dc 300 7 initial total peat pool c stock shifts from a mean of 1500 mg c ha 1 at fri 35 to 1872 mg c ha 1 at fri 500 the acrotelm c is least sensitive to changes in fri shifting from 180 mg c ha 1 at fri 35 to 185 mg c ha 1 at fri 500 whereas the catotelm c has a larger shift from 1320 at fri 35 to 1687 at fri 500 because the oxic acrotelm is partially consumed by fire whereas the anoxic catotelm is untouched one might assume that the acrotelm should be more sensitive to fri however that is only the case for shorter term contemporary or forward looking simulations here we are examining the result from the 8000 year spin up of the model initialization the fri has a larger impact on the catotelm pool than on the acrotelm pool during initialization because the rate at which the acrotelm transfers c to the catotelm is proportionally larger when the acrotelm pool is larger and because this transfer rate has significant weight in determining the c stock of the catotelm given that the decay rate within the anoxic catotelm is almost zero table 5 on average the rich fen total initial peat pool c tended to be least sensitive to shifts in fri 14 difference between fri 35 and 500 followed by poor fens 21 difference between fri 35 and 500 and then bogs being the most sensitive 33 difference between fri 35 and 500 7 2 sensitivity of nee and total rh to mat and water table depth overall the model s simulation of nee is more sensitive to differences in mat table 6 than it is to changes in annual water table position table 7 whereas the opposite is true for total heterotrophic respiration t rh this result is expected when the model is behaving correctly since co2 emissions are highly dependent on the applied annual decay rates defined by a q10 relationship with mat whereas t rh also included ch4 emissions that are generally higher than co2 emissions once converted to co2e and are dependent on annual water table position a comparison of the relative shift in t rh and nee table 7 in response to the range of annual dcs corresponding to different typical ranges of water tables for each peatland category table a14 shows that ch4 emission is the driving force of the sensitivity of t rh to water table movement this is especially evident once the global warming potential of ch4 is taken into account and ch4 emissions are converted to co2e fig 3 the bog sites shown here reach their maximum ch4 emission potential since the optimal ch4 flux water table depth for bogs are reached 26 cm within the full range of dcs tested whereas the optimal depths for poor fen 1 6 cm and rich fen 16 3 cm sites are not see section 9 for further discussion in order to assess model behavior in response to changes in dc and the resulting shifts in water table depth a set of seven year simulations with different combinations of long term and annual water table depths was tested we present two examples fig 4 open bog fig 5 open rich fen from these scenarios where the annual water table starts above the long term average water table dips below the long term average typical of a drought or peatland drainage scenario and then climbs back up above the long term water table depth figs 4a and 5a in both examples figs 4b and 5b c is transferred into the acrotelm anoxic holding pool when the annual water table is above the long term water table position and c is also transferred into the catotelm oxic holding pool when water table dips below the long term water table position this dip results in a change in decay dynamics and co2 emissions from rh however it is a small contributor to the change in t rh that is dominated by the change in ch4 flux figs 4c and 5c especially after the global warming potential of ch4 is taken into account figs 4d and 5d again the maximum ch4 potential flux rate f ch4 max employed here is reached in the bog site at the optimal water table of 26 cm which explains the symmetrical peaks in ch4 at that water table depth fig 4c for the bog site which is not evident in the rich fen site fig 5c the trends in these results are consistent with our understanding of ch4 and nee dynamics in peatlands and with the literature for instance updegraff et al 2001 demonstrated that co2 was insensitive to water table movement and only responded significantly to soil temperature methane however is shown to be highly sensitive to water table movement but is also impacted by a host of other variables such as soil temperature plant productivity and n cycling dynamics updegraff et al 2001 that we do not currently account for in this version of camp it is clear that emissions from some peatland types are more sensitivite to changes in mat such as forested bogs and forested poor fens than others such as treed poor fens and treed rich fens table 6 the reason for these differences are difficult to isolate because they do not depend solely on mat but other parameters including annual applied decay rate the amount of initial c in each peat pool input rates from upstream pools npp and turnover rates for each vegetation layer that vary by peatland category in general peatland categories that are more sensitive to changes in mat have higher c inputs and larger initial c pools when decay rates and q10 s are similar between peatland categories table 5 8 model evaluation the camp v2 0 is the first version of a comprehensive framework for modeling peatland c emissions and removals for canada the initial challenge in developing the model was to be able to represent the range of peatland types in canada and to compile existing data and synthesize the best available knowledge to develop the basic model the main goal of this evaluation is to assess how much variation is explained with the camps base model structure to consider the distribution and overall mean model residuals for large scale estimation and to identify and prioritize issues needing improvement this evaluation of the camp v2 0 compared estimates from the model to those arrived at using data from peatland sample sites in 16 different locations across canada with ghg flux measurements for multiple years or seasons eleven of the sites had data for ch4 emission rates and 12 of the sites had data for nee for co2 either from eddy covariance flux towers or chamber measurements measured data were reported as daily or seasonal rates so we converted them to annual rates for comparison to annual rates predicted by the model assuming winter emissions equaled 15 of growing season emissions tier 1 emission factors in the ipcc wetland supplement see webster et al 2018 for more details on conversions peatland sample sites were mainly located in the provinces of quebec ontario alberta and manitoba with one from nova scotia and were located across the mixedwood plains hudson plains boreal shield boreal plains and taiga shield ecozones ecological land classification group elcg 2005 each site was classified according to a camp peatland category to the best of our ability with the information that was available for nee comparisons sites were mainly open bog n 3 and open poor fen n 5 sites along with two open rich fen sites and one of each treed bog and treed rich fen none of the sites with nee data were classified as forested based on the available information for the ch4 comparisons sites were mainly open bogs n 4 open rich fens n 3 or open poor fens n 3 and one site of each treed bog forested bog and treed poor fen 8 1 overall model fit overall mean model residuals predicted observed for ch4 and nee are reasonably small 6 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and 20 g cco2 m 2 y 1 respectively suggesting that on average the model is well calibrated for large scale applications a comparison of the distribution of observed and predicted ch4 annual emissions shows that the camp is able to capture the full range of variation in ch4 emissions observed sd 15 range from 2 to 58 g cch4 m 2 y 1 vs predicted sd 21 range from 2 to 73 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and that observed and predicted measures of central dispersion compare well observed mean 15 and median 9 vs predicted mean 21 and median 11 fig 6 a this result suggests that the symmetrical scheme used to model ch4 emissions where mean maximum ch4 emission values f ch4 max are associated with optimal ch4 water table depths see section 3 7 methane emission is well calibrated and performs well on average for large scale analyses especially considering the high complexity of ch4 dynamics that complicates both prediction see section 3 7 methane emission and measurement of ch4 emissions see section 9 for further discussion a comparison of the distribution of observed and predicted annual nee did not agree as well as for ch4 overall the camp overestimates nee observed mean 39 g cco2 m 2 y 1 and median 58 g cco2 m 2 y 1 vs predicted mean 19 g cco2 m 2 y 1 and median 21 g cco2 m 2 y 1 indicating that the camp needs improvement in expressing the full variation in nee observed values have a much wider range and higher standard deviation range from 145 to 61 s 67 compared to predicted values range from 21 to 61 s 21 fig 6b this result suggests that in future versions of the model efforts must be made either to increase the variation expressed in npp and turnover rates for different regions and peatland categories or increase the variation in annual applied decay rates or most likely both in the current version of the camp v2 0 npp is modeled as a constant for each peatland category however we know that npp is not static vitt et al 2003 thormann et al 1997 upgaff et al 2001 furthermore we have already identified in the model behavior and sensitivity analysis that a simple q10 relationship with mat is likely insufficient to capture a realistic response in emissions and that a response to soil temperature rather than air temperature would likely lead to better results upgaff et al 2001 leroy et al 2017 see section 9 for further discussion the annualized measured and predicted emission rates for both ch4 and nee were not significantly correlated despite the relatively decent fit of the distribution of observed and predicted values for ch4 and low overall model residuals for both ch4 and nee we attribute this to several different factors such as the lack of soil temperature in the model the need to increase variation in npp rates as discussed above lack of confidence in scaled up measured ch4 emissions insufficient data for model calibration and parameterization for certain peatland categories that will be discussed further in section 9 future steps towards model improvement 8 2 model fit by peatland category the camp was designed to model c dynamics for each of the different peatland categories that occur across canada this will enable the model to take full advantage of existing data and knowledge and to easily integrate new peatland science as it becomes available because some peatland categories are better studied than others some categories are better calibrated and parameterized in the camp to evaluate the model s ability to estimate ch4 emissions and nee for different peatland categories mean model residuals were split between peatland categories figs 7 and 8 even though the sample sizes for each peatland type are very low given the high temporal and spatial variation within measured data available tables 8 and 9 the analysis can be helpful to inform future work especially in identifying data gaps the analysis demonstrates that the model is overestimating ch4 in both open bogs and open poor fens and possibly treed bogs small sample fig 7 the opposite was found for open rich fens and possibly forested bogs small sample size fig 7 the underestimation of ch4 emissions for rich fens is likely due to issues arising from the use of f ch4max and its corresponding optimal water table depth 2 cm taken from turetsky et al 2014 that was based on a daily time scale when this relationship is applied in our annual time scale model the optimal water table corresponding to f ch4 max is never reached see section 3 7 methane emission ideally a new dataset with annual water table depths and annual f ch4max values should be developed to improve camp predictions underestimation of ch4 emissions for open bogs and open poor fens likely results from the need to adjust the f10 response to changes in water table that could be implemented using data from peatland drainage studies in open bogs and poor fens also the open bogs and poor fens in this analysis are mainly located in the relatively small 3 47 106 km2 mixedwood plains ecozone nine out of twelve years of data for open bogs and four out of eight years of data for poor fens in southern canada which is not representative of the spatial extent of open bogs and poor fen systems in the majority of canada that are mainly located in northern continental boreal ecozones webster et al 2018 only 0 3 of canada s bog area and 0 003 of canada s poor fen area are found in the mixedwood plains ecozone webster et al 2018 model residuals by peatland category for nee show that the camp overestimates nee for open rich fens and open bogs and possibly treed bogs small sample fig 8 and underestimates it for open poor fens and possibly treed rich fens small sample fig 8 it is difficult to assess whether these biases are related to unexpressed variation in npp or decay rates but is likely a combination of both where the relative importance of npp or decay differ between peatland categories because the data for model parameterization of npp rates for mosses shrubs and sedges was more comprehensive for open bog sites than the other peatland types it is safe to assume that for open bog systems the quality and accuracy of npp rates are relatively high so it is likely that it is the decay rates that need improvement and probably need to be reduced the reason that open bog decay rates could have turned out too high is that in the calibration process they had to be combined with open poor fen sites to create a large enough sample size table 5 to calibrate decay rates it is likely that the grouping also caused a similar but opposite bias for poor fens meaning that the open poor fen decay rate likely needs to be higher which would improve the current underestimation of nee in open poor fen systems in general data to parameterize npp rates for vegetation layers in both poor fen and rich fen systems were limited bona et al 2018 this data gap needs to be addressed lastly introducing soil temperature to the decay function rather than the current relationship with air temperature mat would likely improve these results but since we did not have access to measured soil temperature in our observed database we could not test this hypothesis 8 3 site level model fit we have shown that on average means of observed and predicted emission rates are in agreement and for national scale estimation this is adequate however understanding finer scale variation will lead to overall improved accuracy in estimates and allow for future application of the model at finer scales for this reason we performed an individual site level evaluation of model fit temporal and spatial variation among observed values at fine scales tables 8 and 9 is very high we do not expect this version of the camp to be able to express this high degree of variation but a comparison will inform future research for development of the camp by showing where it succeeds or fails at this fine spatial scale first we examined spatial inter site level accuracy to reduce the effect of inter annual temporal variation only site locations with more than three years of data were used data were averaged over time and compared to averaged model predictions for the same years tables 8 and 9 methane was relatively well estimated by the model when averaged over a 4 to 9 year period for four different sites residuals ranging from 0 7 to 18 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and the variation expressed was similar compare sd values in table 8 it is also notable that the more northerly sites that are more representative of ecozones in canada that have large areas of peatlands are better predicted by the model for example the churchill site occurs in the hudson plains ecozone where peatlands make up an estimated 134 1 103 km2 webster et al 2018 and thompson manitoba site occurs in the boreal shield ecozone where peatlands make up an estimated 275 6 103 km2 webster et al 2018 were better simulated by the model mean residuals between 0 7 and 7 g cch4 m 2 y 1 as compared to the two southern sites mer bleue and st charles de bellechasse mean model residuals between 15 and 18 g cch4 m 2 y 1 in the quebec mixedwood plains ecozone where peatlands areas are relatively small and occupy only 1 045 103 km2 webster et al 2018 making them much less significant at the national scale overall the total average model residual for ch4 is low whether averaged by site location 8 g cch4 m 2 y 1 or not 6 g cch4 m 2 y 1 which suggests that spatial and temporal variation of ch4 is of similar magnitude this is supported by similar average observed intra site temporal sd ranging from 2 2 to 24 g cch4 m 2 y 1 and inter site spatial sd 11 g cch4 m 2 y 1 variation table 8 the site level analysis for co2 emissions showed patterns for over and under estimation that are similar to those for ch4 emissions however interestingly when the sites are averaged by site location the overall mean model residual is reduced to 2 0 g cco2 m 2 y 1 from the previous mean when rates were not weighted by location of 20 g cco2 m 2 y 1 this result demonstrates that spatial variation across different sites is higher than temporal variation for co2 emissions which is confirmed by the observed inter site variation of sd 58 g cco2 m 2 y 1 which tends to be higher than the observed intra site temporal variation range of 15 45 g cco2 m 2 y 1 this further supports the idea that including mean annual soil temperature in the peat decay function a variable that generally correlates with a north to south gradient provides a good opportunity to improve explained variation in nee emissions higher spatial variation in observed nee rates also supports the idea that npp rates for different regions whereas most npp rates do not currently vary by region due to lack of data available provides another opportunity for model improvement 9 future steps towards model improvement the camp v2 0 was developed as a first step towards a dynamic c estimation framework for peatlands for application at the national scale in canada the challenge was to build a simple model framework applicable to diverse peatland types and regions occurring across canada by synthesizing expert knowledge and compiling the best available existing data for model parameterization and calibration the results of the model evaluation demonstrate that although the modeling framework is appropriate for large scale ghg emission and removal estimates it will require further work and new data collected at finer scales to provide inputs and refine parameters for the model to enable explanation of fine scale variation the guidance of the ipcc states that uncertainties have to be identified quantified and reduced as far as is practicable ipcc 2003 here we summarize and discuss areas within camp v2 0 that have been identified as needing improvement as well as data requirements and gaps to help inform development of future versions of the camp table 10 although the overall mean model residual of nee was reasonably low for large scale estimation it was evident that the model requires work to express the full variation in observed nee since nee is the balance of npp and decomposition there are several approaches that can be taken to improve the explained variation in model estimates first we recommend the integration of mean annual soil temperature rather than mat into peat decomposition dynamics table 10 since co2 emissions have been shown to be correlated more strongly with soil temperature than air temperature upgaff et al 2001 leroy et al 2017 it is known that air temperature does not have a simple direct relationship with soil temperature in peatland systems weis et al 2006 because of the thermally insulative properties of peat zhao and bingcheng 2019 and a dependence on snow depth and precipitation zhang et al 2005 therefore in order to integrate soil temperature into the camp a canada wide national model for soil temperature in peatlands at an annual time scale would need to be developed one approach could be to use an existing peatland soil temperature model once scaled to the appropriate level for interaction with camp model s such as the northern ecosystem soil temperature model nest zhang et al 2003 that rely not only on air temperature as climate data but also precipitation wind speed and solar radiation would be appropriate since the nest model focuses on active peat layer depth and permafrost thaw having a nest module could also support the integration of permafrost dynamics into the camp table 10 second we recommend increasing the complexity of modelled decay dynamics and therefore the amount of explained variation in modeled nee by improving calibration of peat decomposition rates table 10 we are aware that the model calibration method is only as good as the input data to provide a sufficiently large set of input data for calibration of decomposition rates peatland categories and therefore input data used for calibration were combined into fewer groups because there were not enough data to calibrate each peatland category separately table 5 model evaluation revealed that combining open poor fens and open bogs resulted in an averaged calibrated decay rate that introduced bias since the evaluation suggested a lower decay rate for open bogs and a higher decay rate for poor fens would improve model estimation of nee for each of these peatland categories the canadian forest service peatland profile database that was used for model calibration is still being expanded data are continuously being added to the database as new studies emerge and further collaborations with other teams of peatland scientists are formed however even with continued efforts to add to the database it is evident that there is currently a lack of peat core data on poor fen systems considering that poor fens are significant peatland type comprising approximately 20 of the total area covered by peatlands in canada webster et al 2018 it is likely new data will need to be collected to improve calibration of their peat decay rates more variation in modeled nee may be explained by improving model estimation of npp rates for different vegetation e g shrubs mosses sedges categories bona et al 2018 the base structure of camp v2 0 uses static npp rates for combinations of vegetation layer and peatland category where sufficient data were available we know that npp is not static and has been shown to vary with ph chapin et al 2006 and nutrient availability vitt et al 2003 chapin et al 2006 graminoids in a lacustrine sedge fen have been shown to increase productivity in response to water table rise while bog productivity has been shown to respond to changes in temperature thormann et al 1997 and water table depth upgaff et al 2001 introducing dynamic relationships between npp and these controlling variables such as water table depth or temperature should increase the variation in modeled nee and improve the model s ability to predict the effects of climatic changes in the future because development of these relationships will require time to execute new studies and to synthesize results from existing and new studies improvements could be achieved in the short term by trying to expand and update the database of bona et al 2018 in particular more data are required on sedge productivity tree productivity low shrub productivity and especially tall shrub productivity included only in 28 27 46 and 14 respectively of studies in the parameter database as opposed to more readily reported moss npp rates included in 77 of study sites within the database and attempting to develop separate rates for each peatland category as previously mentioned for the decomposition rate calibration there is a lack of poor fen data comprising 14 of the sites within the parameter database whereas data on bogs tend to be more comprehensive 27 of sites included in the database the results of the model evaluation showed that for large scale estimation the camp was better at estimating ch4 emissions than nee as evidenced by the very small overall mean residuals and site level residuals for ch4 the bell shaped relationship between maximum ch4 flux and optimal ch4 flux water table depths used in camp to predict ch4 flux rates based on water table depth worked well but requires refinement to explain more variation the main challenge with ch4 lies in the high spatial and temporal variability such that the level of confidence in scaled up numbers is low dinsmore et al 2009 therefore when a residual is high for any one year it is difficult to determine if the model requires adjusting or if the measured annualized values are inaccurate the ch4 sub model used in this version of camp employed optimal water table depth values taken from the literature turetsky et al 2014 these were daily values rather than annual values that would be more appropriate for the camp and should be developed ideally the ch4 sub model should be calibrated for annual scale estimation by using data for annual wtd with corresponding ch4 emission rates table 10 however we found that annual water table depths were rarely reported in studies providing ch4 fluxes so this is a data gap that should be filled in order to improve accuracy of ch4 emission estimates from the camp instrumentation for ch4 flux tower measurement has only become readily available in the past decade olsen et al 2013 which explains why data are relatively sparse and inconsistently scaled as compared to co2 flux data knox et al 2019 therefore new programs such as the global carbon project s ch4 fluxnet are vital to setting global standards for gap filling meta data and properly scaling ch4 flux data inopportunely ch4 fluxnet does not plan to set a standard and account for winter emissions when only seasonal data are collected which we argue is an important aspect to creating usable datasets for annual scale and long term projections still continued funding and growth of programs such as these will work to expand datasets and baseline data collection and reporting standards that will greatly help to advance ch4 science furthermore we advocate for more funding towards flux towers in regions that are more representative of areas where peatlands are widespread in canada such as in the boreal plains and boreal shield ecozones webster et al 2018 the current model s evaluation did not reveal any significant difference in model accuracy between peatlands in western and eastern canada that being said we acknowledge that the data used to generate the c density curves as well as much of the data for model calibration were taken from western canada zoltai et al 2000 as previously mentioned the canadian forest service is currently compiling more data in their peat profile c database and much of this work is focused on improving representation of eastern canada this additional data will be used to test and if needed re calibrate the c density model for eastern canada while the camp v2 0 framework includes swamps as a wetland category as stated previously we lacked data to calibrate or evaluate the swamp class and it was therefore omitted from this study additionally authors webster et al 2018 who built the map product designed to apply the camp nationally did not include the swamp category stating that it was too difficult to map mainly because of regional variation in overstory vegetation although swamps do not make up a large area of land nationally we acknowledge that they can be important regionally e g southern ontario future work is required both to improve swamp mapping as well as c profile and emission estimates for swamp ecosystems by region table 10 in order to calibrate and assess the performance of camp for swamps the camp v2 0 only includes wildfire as a potential disturbance type and uses average depth of burn in order make use of the camp to estimate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ghg emission projections future versions of camp need to include more disturbance types requiring the development of wildfire disturbance matrices representing differing fire severities and timber and peat harvest disturbance matrices for each peatland type timber harvest on peatlands is of particular importance in the claybelt of quebec and ontario where a significant portion of harvest takes place on lowland or transition sites haavisto and jeglum 1991 a literature review to address the development of harvest disturbances has been conducted but there are gaps in data for depth and amount of c disturbed and for effects on water table depth depending on the harvest method and associated disturbances e g all season vs temporary roads other disturbance types that must be addressed in a future version of camp are those associated with oil and gas development a workshop attended by experts was held in november 2018 to develop a suite of 14 different disturbance matrices for the effect of oil and gas development on peatlands that could be used to model 21 different disturbance types including well pads pipelines seismic lines and surface mining the next step is to run these disturbance matrices with the camp v2 0 in an appropriate region of canada and test their application by comparing modeled estimates to observed data however we know that appropriate observed data for this type of comparison are extremely limited and this represents another vital data gap that will need to be addressed table 10 10 summary and conclusion a model framework for national ghg emission and removal estimation for canadian peatlands camp v2 0 was built and tested it provides the national forest carbon monitoring and reporting system with a module that can work in tandem with the newly developed gcbm for upland forests to provide a more complete approach to c reporting in canada the purpose of camp v2 0 was to provide a simple model foundation that could be widely applied across several peatland types and regions in canada and to evaluate different aspects of the model s structure and parameterization in order to inform the second phase of model development the camp takes a novel approach to modelling peatland hydrology at a large spatial scale by using the nationally available fire weather index drought code to predict long term and annual water table depth the task of model parameterization and calibration was supported by compiling two large databases bona et al 2018 zoltai et al 2000 garneau unpublished data tarnocai unpublished data packalen unpublished data a simple sub model for ch4 was also tested and performed relatively well considering the high complexity of ch4 emission dynamics and the high spatial and temporal variability in measured ch4 fluxes the camp s sensitivity to climatic variables was assessed and the model was evaluated against observed data results suggest that the camp v2 0 structure is appropriate for large spatial and temporal scale estimation and behaves as expected in relation to environmental variables but that several areas require further attention in order to increase the amount of finer scale explained variation in nee co2 and ch4 emissions table 10 future steps include expanding existing peatland databases to re calibrate decay rates and better parameterize npp rates for certain peatland classes and regions we recommend that a national soil temperature module that fits within the camp framework be built in order to replace the current simple air temperature q10 relationship for peat decomposition doing this will also facilitate inclusion of permafrost dynamics in the camp by modeling an active and non active layer and permafrost thaw several data gaps were identified that must be addressed table 10 in particular we emphasize the importance of standardizing annual scaled ch4 flux rates and the inclusion of basic meta data around flux tower sites such as annual water table depth in order to improve the science on modeling ch4 at large temporal and spatial scales future steps are also planned to include a wide array of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the camp credit authorship contribution

24803,accurate estimation of grassland net primary productivity npp is one of the most important steps in monitoring and further analysing the status of the grassland ecosystem however the quality of regional or even global grassland npp estimations are commonly limited by the two most important input datasets photosynthetic active radiation par and climatic data which make the npp estimate unrepresentative or even inaccurate this paper uses a light use efficiency with vegetation photosynthesis model lue vpm to estimate the high quality grassland npp in zeku by using the par data derived from high resolution dem products and the improved land surface temperature data the npp produced by lue vpm shows that it is statistically the same as in situ converted npp with a p value of t test equalling 0 90 the rmse between the two is 97 77 gc m2 while modis npp in zeku is statically different from the all the in situ sampling results with a p value of t text smaller than 0 03 the results of this paper provided a better estimate than modis npp and lue vpm can be used for the high quality regional grassland npp estimation when the quality of par data and climatic data improved keywords

data was limited statistical models associate climate factors precipitation temperature sunshine ye et al 2013 and flux of radiation zhou et al 1995 etc with plant dry matter production through a simple mathematical regression to estimate npp lieth and whittaker 1975 the advantage of statistical models is the high availability of meteorological data and that the result of them can truly reveal the climate affected patterns of npp but npp is also affected by other factors e g soil conditions or water conditions geruo et al 2020 therefore this kind of models are too simple to represent the true npp distribution and are not suitable for large scale spatial and or pixel specific modelling in addition the temporal resolutions are relatively low usually on a yearly basis compared with the other three pems are commonly based on the theory that the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation fpar absorbed by terrestrial vegetation can be derived from remote sensing data kumar and monteith 1982 a predefined conversion efficiency or an optimum value considering other environmental factors is used in such estimation they are also called diagnostic models as remote sensing derived vegetation indices are employed in the calculation however the value of conversion efficiency varies from vegetation types and local environments such as temperature and vapour pressure deficit vpd prince and goward 1995 ecosystem process models epms are bottom up orientated they are commonly modelled at the level of each ecosystem process phenology leaf thickness minimum stomatal conductance photosynthetic pathway allocation rooting depth based on the structural characteristics of the vegetation woodward and cramer 1996 then integrated through the canopy with biochemical fluxes co2 water and energy exchange cramer et al 1999 however such models are commonly complicated and involve lots of species specific parameter estimation work while in cpms the estimation process is basically the same as pems or epms they are more focused on the leaf level plant photosynthesis and usually integrated with the seasonal canopy dynamics typically lai dynamics during the year and biochemical exchanges cramer et al 1999 cpms are called process models because they evolved from ecosystem or crop models which have processes for individual plant growth explicitly the significant difference between cpms and pems is that remote sensing measurements are not necessary for cpms for this reason cpms have the ability to produce results for future climate scenarios and they are prognostic models as well ruimy et al 1999a however cpms depend highly on the vegetation seasonal parameters which would be different across different vegetation types both pems and cpms are the lue based models which concentrate on the conversion processes of solar radiation to carbon mass or biomass pems have the advantage of using remote sensing data to quantify the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation fpar while cpms consider the photosynthesis processes of vegetation leaves and the exchange of carbon and water based on which the conversion of carbon mass from photosynthetic active radiation par can be calculated other ecosystem process models simulate the structure of vegetation and biogeochemical fluxes although there are numerous models available for npp estimation the low spatial resolution par data or the lack of species specific data lead to the inaccurate estimation of regional grassland npp in addition climatic factors zheng et al 2020 also increase the uncertainty in explaining the variation of npp wang et al 2019 the models represent the dynamics of vegetation and herbivore via either biophysical process chemical cycling eco functioning or energy flows which make them capable and available to simulate lots of diversified grassland systems but the values of the parameters are usually site dependant under certainty spatial or temporal scale which means the models may be difficult to apply in new conditions though they may work fine in the case study areas where they have been applied in some area the lack of par data make current lue models unable to be applied in addition climate data are commonly used as a driving force behind the growth of the vegetation but the errors propagated from the uncertainty of such data are rarely reported therefore the npp estimation still a problem for regional grassland especially in the npp estimation of moderate and high spatial resolution this paper presents an improved estimation of grassland npp by using high quality climatic data and radiation data then the results will be compared with moids npp products and the in situ observed data the choose of parameter values when applying vue models to regional studies will also be discussed the main reason for choosing the vpm model is data availability since there is no access to the daily climatic data provided by gmao nasa and the spatial resolution 0 5 latitude degree by 0 67 longitude degree of gmao nasa climatic data is too low thus cannot be used one pixel of gmao nasa data could cover all the area of zeku and could result in the homogeneity of local ε which is not true in reality the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd chen 2011 has provided high spatial resolution climatic data for every three hours from 1979 to 2012 this is also the main reason for this thesis choosing 2003 2012 as a case study period from 2003 the grasslands have also been contracted to individual households by aggregating the three hour temperature data to the daytime temperature data of cmfd the effect of temperature on ɛ max can be quantified basically the vpm uses the following equation to calculate ɛ at the daily scale xiao et al 2004 the objective of this paper is to develop a more suitable consider data availability and accurate grassland npp model 2 data source and pre processing 2 1 image data four image datasets were used in lue vpm modis lai globalland30 dem and earth surface reflectance modis lai was from modis collection 6 lai mod15a2h with a spatial resolution about 463 m 463 m for every 8 days myneni et al 2015 it was reprocessed by yu et al 2018 s method which fills in non good quality data mainly affected by clouds by a new growth grazing function globalland30 data was from the 30 m global land cover dataset chen et al 2015 which was resampled to about 463 m before calculating shortwave radiation the elevation data is from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem aster 2005 with a spatial resolution of 30 m and resized to about 463 m surface reflectance data was from the modis terra mod09a1 version 6 product which provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of terra modis bands 1 7 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering vermote 2013 these image datasets were projected to krasovsky 1940 albers with central meridian 105 standard parallel 25 and 47 the projection kept the projected land area the same as that of the earth s surface which is important for the ground validation 2 2 climatic data daily temperature data which was downloaded from the high resolution china meteorological forcing dataset hrcmfd dataset with 0 1 spatial resolution for every 3 h from 2003 to 2012 he and yang 2011 we used the mean value to downscale the climatic data the average maximum and minimum temperature were calculated and resampled to the same spatial resolution as modis lai the daily average maximum and minimum temperature of zeku during 2003 2012 is shown in fig 1 the maximum temperature is below 20 c 3 3 validation data the case study area is zeku county qinghai china there are 14 national grassland monitoring sites in zeku 2012 the locations are shown in fig 2 these in situ grass fresh weight data were provided by the grassland and livestock husbandry bureau of zeku there were 15 grassland sampling sites and 4 samples were taken for each site and the size was 1 m2 for each sample these are the chinese national grassland monitoring sites which were chosen depending on the representativeness of the overall grass growth we used the average fresh weight for each sampling site these fresh grass weight g m2 data were converted to npp gc m2 the relation between aboveground dry matter adm and npp can be described as maselli et al 2013 running 2015b 1 npp adm r o o t l e a f r a t i o 1 0 5 where the multiplier r o o t l e a f r a t i o 1 converts the above ground dry matter to whole plant dry matter both above ground mass and below ground mass this value is taken as 0 28 following running 2015b the 0 5 multiplier accounts for the conversion from dry matter to carbon maselli et al 2013 the ratio of adm to above ground fresh grass weight in zeku is 0 37 according to lai et al 2008 another comparison dataset was the mod17a2h version 6 gross primary productivity gpp product it is a cumulative 8 day composite of values with 500 metre pixel size the data product includes information about gross primary productivity gpp and net photosynthesis psn the psn band values are the gpp minus the maintenance respiration mr running 2015a the npp was calculated by the eqs 18 and 19 in addition the photosynthetic active radiation par measured in 2012 was collected to validate the par estimated from dem 3 method the lue vpm model consists of photosynthetic active radiation par estimation light use efficiency lue calculation and vegetation photosynthesis simulation by vpm the daily maintenance respiration is considered simply as the same as modis npp algorithm running and zhao 2015 the flowchart of lue vpm is shown in fig 3 after calculating the shortwave irradiance si by a viewshed model the photosynthetic active radiation par was derived from the empirical coefficient of the local area the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation fpar was quantified by beers law and then the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation apar was calculated by multiplying fpar and par a vegetation photosynthesis model vpm was used for quantifying the effect of temperature water and leaf phenology on the light use efficiency of vegetation the gross primary productivity gpp was calculated through apar and light use efficiency ɛ in addition the allometry growth above ground and under ground growth of grass was considered by leaf mass and fine root mass calculation together with the daily maintenance respiration mr the accumulated daily npp was then calculated we will now explain each sub model of lue vpm 3 1 par estimation from solar shortwave irradiance solar radiation is also called solar shortwave irradiance si compared with terrestrial radiation longwave irradiance mani 1980 the si can be calculated through a viewshed model fu and rich 2002 rich et al 1994 which includes two key parameters diffuse ratio and transmissivity generally when solar radiation travels from the sun through the atmosphere to the top of the canopy it is inevitably affected by astronomical and meteorological factors brock 1981 there are three components actually arriving at the top of the canopy direct diffuse and reflected insolation direct radiation is the main component of solar radiation it is not reflected or scattered and reaches the surface directly while diffuse radiation is the second largest component it is the scattered radiation that reaches the ground reflected radiation from surrounding landscapes reflected from the ground onto the inclined receiver generally accounts for a small proportion of total incident solar radiation and usually can be neglected hofierka and suri 2002 in northwest china the value of diffuse ratio was set to 0 31 according to fu et al 2015 s research considering the effect of the solar altitude atmospheric water vapour content dust content ozone content and any other radiation depletion a transmission coefficient for direct and diffuse radiation were proposed by liu and jordan 1960 it was also referred to as either the clearness index or cloudiness index it is a very attractive parameter for estimating the response of solar radiation to different atmospheric conditions using this the diffuse ratio can be calculated by using the global transmissivity of the atmosphere carroll 1985 the transmissivity is set to 0 72 based on regional figures given by pan et al 2013 the solar radiation tool in arcmap was used to calculate si based on dem data fig 4 and the calculation interval was 30 min slope and aspect were from the dem and 32 different incident radiation directions were calculated par can be calculated by using si at the top of the atmosphere and a conversion ratio which can be expressed as 2 par φ si where φ accounts for the ratio of par to the solar shortwave radiation si stands for the solar shortwave radiation the observed standard deviation is 0 004 at the monthly level with a mean value of 0 446 in tibet li et al 2010 we used 0 446 as the default value for φ 3 2 the lue model the lue models are based on the rationale that daily photosynthesis is proportional to the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation apar according to the monteith theory monteith 1972 monteith and moss 1977 which proposed a linear relationship between aboveground photosynthesis and apar for barley potatoes sugar beet and apples in britain later a similar linear relationship has been found for cereals gallagher and biscoe 1978 and tropical trees harrington and fownes 1995 thus light use efficiency has been widely used to quantify the amount of apar in energy units converted into vegetation biomass in carbon units gpp odum 2013 3 gpp ε apar where ɛ is known as light use efficiency lue and it represents the conversion efficiency of solar radiation to carbon mass a detailed theoretical analysis of eq 3 was discussed in haxeltine and prentice 1996 the value of ɛ has been estimated both theoretically and experimentally for various species landsberg et al 1997 medlyn 1998 ruimy et al 1994 it depends on the local environmental conditions water nitrogen and temperature hunt jr and running 1992 ruimy et al 1999b wright et al 1993 but one of the key uncertainties in this equation is the spatial and temporal variation of the daily ɛ max value goetz and prince 1999 turner et al 2002 therefore in the npp calculation especially in regional or local areas smaller scale calculations the value of ɛ max would be different goetz et al 1999 in this thesis the value of ɛ max is 0 0006 gc m 2 mj when calculating the npp based on ground measurement in qinghai tibet li et al 2012 solar radiation is the key factor in vegetation growth providing the essential energy for the photosynthetic activities monteith 1972 solar radiation has a variety of wavelengths but only the wavelengths between 0 4 μm and 0 7 μm can be used by vegetation for photosynthetic activities that is photosynthetically active radiation par mccree 1972 apar absorbed par describes the amount of par received by the vegetation canopy and used for photosynthesis it varies with the change in day length due to axial tilt and the daily cloud over the aerosol attenuation of solar radiation odum 2013 as well as the upwelling radiance reflected by the land surface roujean and breon 1995 therefore it is also an important component of any analysis of the global carbon balance through the estimation of vegetation photosynthetic carbon sink tucker et al 1986 in addition apar implicitly indicates how much leaf area the vegetation lai is exposed to absorb solar radiation and it follows the form 4 a p a r f p a r p a r where par is photosynthetic active radiation par which is part of the solar radiation within the spectral range of 400 700 nm for vegetation photosynthesis which controls the accumulation of npp and the carbon fixation on the earth frouin and pinker 1995 it plays an important role in evaluating global productivity change and carbon balance li et al 2015 incoming photosynthetically active radiation it is the potential radiation that could be absorbed to do photosynthetic work not all this light is used and fpar is the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation the actual proportion used is known as the apar basically all the methods of fpar estimation are based on the relationship between vegetation indices and vegetation canopy properties for example fpar was calculated by quantifying the linear relationship with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sims et al 2006 fpar 1 24ndvi 0 168 or the linear relationship with the enhanced vegetation index evi fisher et al 2008 fpar 1 2evi the modis fpar product has used a more advanced vegetation index which consists of three or four wavelengths odum 2013 amongst all those calculations the relationship between fpar and lai which is known as beer s law is the most widely used one hu et al 2013 which follows 5 f p a r 0 95 1 e x p k l a i where fpar is the fraction of incident par absorbed by the canopy k is the light extinction coefficient lai is the leaf area per ground area similar to the other light use efficiency models the light absorption here integrates leaf photosynthesis to the canopy ruimy et al 1999b the value for k is 0 5 in this paper which has been extensively validated for both herbaceous crops varlet grancher et al 1980 forest jarvis and leverenz 1983 and grass zhang et al 2014 3 3 the general process of vpm basically the vpm uses the following equation to calculate ɛ at the daily scale xiao et al 2004 6 ε ε m a x t s c a l a r w s c a l a r p s c a l a r where ɛ max is maximum light use efficiency and tscalar wscalar and pscalar are the downward regulation scalars for the effect of temperature water and leaf phenology on the light use efficiency of vegetation respectively tscalar is estimated at each time step using the equation developed for the terrestrial ecosystem model raich et al 1991 7 t s c a l a r t t m i n t t m a x t t m i n t t m a x t t o p t 2 where tmin tmax and topt are minimum maximum and optimal temperature for vegetation photosynthesis if air temperature falls below tmin when the temperature is beyond the minimum temperature for vegetation photosynthesis the photosynthesis is at a low rate or there is no photosynthesis and tscalar is set to zero the value of tmin tmin and tmin are different according to the vegetation types in the research of qinghai tibet alpine ecosystems the values for these three parameters are 0 20 and 35 c respectively li et al 2007 the main contribution of the vpm model is that it considers the effects of both water stress and vegetation phenology on ɛ in the vpm a water sensitive vegetation index lswi was utilized to capture the effects of water stress and phenology on light use efficiency 8 l s w i ρ n i r ρ s w i r ρ n i r ρ s w i r where ρnir is the surface reflectance band intensity between 841 nm and 876 nm near infrared band and ρswir is the surface reflectance band from 1628 nm to 1652 nm short infrared band both of the data can be derived from the modis reflectance dataset mod09a1 vermote 2015 then the effect of water on plant photosynthesis wscalar can be calculated as 9 w scalar 1 lswi 1 lsw i max where lswi max is the maximum lswi within the plant growth season finally pscalar is included in the vpm model to account for the effect of leaf phenology leaf age on photosynthesis at the canopy level 10 p scalar 1 lswi 2 during bud burst to leaf full expansion p scalar was set to be 1 after leaf full expansion 3 4 daily maintenance respiration maintenance respiration costs mr for leaves and fine roots were considered in the lue vpm model fig 3 they were also calculated on a daily basis leaf mass kgc was calculated as running 2015b 11 l e a f m a s s l a i s l a where lai is the leaf area index and sla is the specific leaf area projected leaf area kg c fine root mass is then estimated by 12 f i n e r o o t m a s s l e a f m a s s f r o o t l e a f r a t i o leaf maintenance respiration is calculated as 13 l e a f m r l e a f m a s s l e a f m r b a s e q 10 t a v g 20 10 tavg is the average daily temperature c q 10 describes the short term temperature dependence of the rates of biological processes widely used amongst biologists which could affect the respiration of vegetation tjoelker et al 2001b wager 1941 q 10 is calculated through the equation which developed by tjoelker et al 2001a 14 q 10 3 22 0 046 t a v g similarly the maintenance respiration of the fine root mass can be calculated as 15 r o o t m r r o o t m a s s f r o o t m r b a s e q 10 t a v g 20 10 and finally the net photosynthesis can be calculated 16 p s n n e t g p p l e a f m r r o o t m r in addition for the energy cost for constructing organic compounds fixed by photosynthesis which is empirically parameterized as 25 of npp the modis npp algorithm simply uses a fixed percentage of npp to calculate energy cost for constructing organic compounds fixed by photosynthesis that is 17 n p p g p p r m r g g p p r m 0 25 n p p where rm is the plant maintenance respiration and 0 25 npp represents calculate energy cost for constructing organic compounds fixed by photosynthesis therefore the npp can be calculated by 18 n p p 0 8 g p p r m w h e n g p p r m 0 a n d 19 n p p 0 w h e n g p p r m 0 up to this point the daily npp can be calculated the effect of increased temperature on the npp will also be evaluated by the simulations with the increase of temperature for 1 5 c and 2 0 c and keeping all the other parameter values the same the daily npp was accumulated from the start of the year to the end of the year to get the annual npp the key parameter values are listed in appendix b 4 results 4 1 npp using the above estimation methods the year round aggregated npp maps are shown in fig 5 the value of npp ranges from 43 66 gcm 2 to 664 39 gcm 2 the average npp is 380 09 gcm 2 for the whole region we can see obvious spatial heterogeneity in the npp distribution with the high productivity concentrating to the southeast of zeku the low productivity areas are mainly distributed in the northern mountainous areas see dem figure in fig 4 notice that there are some black points in the figures these are the points where the improved lai cannot be calculated non linear regression cannot find a solution for the new growth function the total number of these black points is 45 considering a total of 29 423 pixels in zeku these black points have no noticeable influence on the npp calculation 4 2 validation the r2 between measured par and the par estimated from dem is 0 94 rsme 36 46 mj m2 with regards to the model accuracy table 1 shows the validation results with three determents the paired t test shows there is no significant difference between npp calculated by lue vpm and in situ npp with a p value equalling 0 901 conversely the p value between in situ npp and the modis npp product is 0 028 indicating the modis npp product for zeku is significantly different from the in situ measured data the results of tukey s honest significance test tukeyhsd test tukey 1949 table 2 shows there is no significant difference between npp calculated by lue vpm based on improved lai and converted in situ measured carbon mass conversely modis npp product for zeku is significantly different from the in situ measured data when keeping all the parameters of lue vpm the samein addition from table 2 the average converted npp from in situ measured data is 262 32 gcm 2 while the npp calculated by lue vpm based on our improved lai is 266 83 gcm 2 and if all the lue vpm parameters are kept the same the average recalculated npp by lue vpm based on modis lai is 236 42 gcm 2 which indicates that the improved lai estimate has improved the accuracy of the npp calculations on average 5 discussion in this paper we developed lue vpm model to estimate the grassland npp in zeku the value of npp ranges from 43 66 gcm 2 to 664 39 gcm 2 this spatial pattern is quite similar to that of fan et al 2010b and modis npp products running and zhao 2015 and the results produced in this paper are more close to the ground measured npp but there still exist uncertainties in the model 5 1 the uncertainty of npp estimation model is a simplification or abstraction of the real system due to an imperfect representation of the model structure inadequate information or knowledge of the parameters or input data and the uncertainty in measuring the observation data output uncertainty exists in almost every model a complete uncertainty analysis of the lue vpm should consider all sources of uncertainty that contribute to the modelling process and to the indicators or statistical properties of the model output however it is difficult to give a comprehensive uncertainty analysis of the npp produced by the lue vpm although the uncertainty of the lai estimation has been clarified through a numerical simulation analysis there are other components involved in the npp calculation that may also affect the accuracy of npp outputs in appendix a the source for those uncertainties includes inaccurate assignment of the biological parameters for example seasonal difference in the value of light use efficiency error in the remote sensing measurement uncertainty of surface reflectance data in vpm model bias in situ measurement and the structure uncertainty of the model this paper is not able to determine the overall effect of all those uncertainties on npp calculation because of a lack of data obtaining sufficient data would require a collaborative scientific effort from numerous different research communities modis npp products were produced by the combination of pem and an ecosystem process model by using the biome specific ecosystem process model biome bgc the maximum value for the conversion efficiency ɛ max for each land type can be derived however while ɛ max is the potential maximum convert efficiency for specific land type the value of ɛ max varies to different local environmental conditions mainly temperature and atmospheric moisture in the modis npp algorithm the vapour pressure deficit vpd model was employed to calculate the final conversion efficiency ɛ the main purpose of this calculation is to convert the maximum radiation conversion efficiency ɛ max to the local instantaneous radiation conversion efficiency ɛ on a daily basis vpd reflects the effect of water on the radiation conversion efficiency the value range is from 1 to 0 the default value of ɛ max can be obtained from the biome property look up table bplut see running 2015b however the value of ɛ max varies in different biome types and by local environmental conditions landsberg and waring 1997 the value of ɛ max for grassland in the modis npp products calculation is 0 00086 gc m 2 mj running et al 2000 but one of the key uncertainties is the spatial and temporal variation of the daily ɛ max value goetz and prince 1999 turner et al 2002 therefore in the npp calculation especially in regional or local areas smaller scale calculations the value of ɛ max would be different goetz et al 1999 in this paper the value of ɛ max is 0 0006 gc m 2 mj when calculating the npp based on ground measurement in qinghai tibet li et al 2012 5 2 uncertainty of par estimation par is affected by atmospheric conditions water vapour and ozone amounts surface visibility aerosol type and cloud optical thickness frouin and pinker 1995 and radiation geometry solar zenith angle myneni et al 1997 however numerous studies have confirmed there is a robust linear relationship between par and solar shortwave irradiance si britton and dodd 1976 papaioannou et al 1993 if both the diffuse and global solar radiation is known diffuse ratio the direct component of solar radiation can be obtained through simple subtraction tuller 1976 however the diffuse ratio varies inversely with cloudiness the value of this ratio ranging from 0 to 0 35 has been observed tuller 1976 unfortunately in the algorithm used for calculating the modis daily npp mod17a2 a3 products par was estimated from data provided by the global modelling and assimilation office in the national aeronautics and space administration gmao nasa the spatial resolution of this shortwave radiance data is in increments of 2 3 latitude and 1 4 longitude masuda 2004 which is not suitable for estimating npp at a 0 463 km spatial resolution in addition the modis method does not consider the shadow effect of hills elevation on the total incoming shortwave radiation therefore we can see an even statistical different results between npp produced by modis and in situ observed npp table 1 in addition studies have found that the value of φ varied according to weather conditions the early most commonly used value of φ was 0 44 moon 1940 under clear sky conditions the value of φ changed from 0 47 to 0 5 while under cloudy or rainy conditions the range was 0 47 0 59 mccree 1966 in the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model φ is a constant value which accounts for the fact that approximately half of the si can be considered as par potter et al 1993 for practical purposes the ratio of photosynthetically useful radiation has been suggested to be half of the si monteith and reifsnyder 1974 in barrow alaska the value was found to be 0 45 and similar results have been revealed in jerusalem israel and rockville maryland u s a goldberg and klein 1977 although the value ranged from 0 45 to 0 47 in ultuna sweden rodskjer 1983 the results for california state university fresno site indicated that φ varied from 0 458 in july to 0 446 in april blackburn and proctor 1983 while in china especially in the qinghai tibet regions the value of φ has been extensively investigated a comparison of observed and modelled φ was shown in li et al 2010 s results 6 conclusions in this paper a lue vpm model was employed to estimate the grassland npp in qinghai tibet region it consists of shortwave irradiance estimation light use efficiency quantification and the photosynthesis and respiration of grass the values of parameters were all derived from localized studies and the input datasets were derived from high resolution satellite images and high resolution climate data it found that with the improvement of the parameter values and the quality of the input datasets the lue vpm produced more accurate npp products than the modis npp estimations in the qinghai tibet area in addition the use of par estimated from high resolution dem data will be particularly useful in npp estimation for the regions where the solar irradiance data and water vapour pressure data are scarce in addition the comparisons of modis npp products in zeku with in situ measurements shown that they were statistical different indicating that we should be cautious when applying global npp products in the local regional npp related studies funding this research was

24803,accurate estimation of grassland net primary productivity npp is one of the most important steps in monitoring and further analysing the status of the grassland ecosystem however the quality of regional or even global grassland npp estimations are commonly limited by the two most important input datasets photosynthetic active radiation par and climatic data which make the npp estimate unrepresentative or even inaccurate this paper uses a light use efficiency with vegetation photosynthesis model lue vpm to estimate the high quality grassland npp in zeku by using the par data derived from high resolution dem products and the improved land surface temperature data the npp produced by lue vpm shows that it is statistically the same as in situ converted npp with a p value of t test equalling 0 90 the rmse between the two is 97 77 gc m2 while modis npp in zeku is statically different from the all the in situ sampling results with a p value of t text smaller than 0 03 the results of this paper provided a better estimate than modis npp and lue vpm can be used for the high quality regional grassland npp estimation when the quality of par data and climatic data improved keywords net primary productivity climate change grassland productivity modis npp improved modis lai 1 introduction net primary productivity npp is defined as the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere into green plants odum 1971 as an ecosystem structural and functional indicator the amount of npp is commonly used to measure the consumption of herbivory gignoux et al 2001 npp provides an energy and matter basis for ecosystems it is also an important indicator showing the health of ecosystems and ecological balance a key element for estimating carbon storage which can be used as an indicator of the amount of forage grassland can provide fan et al 2010a and the regulation of the ecological processes odum 1971 estimation of grassland productivity is crucial to the management of grassland grazing as well as allowing the quantification of the carbon balance for both regional and global sustainable grassland development estimation of vegetation productivity is crucial to the management of grassland grazing as well as allowing the quantification of the carbon balance for both regional and global sustainable grassland development deng et al 2017 song et al 2015 yin et al 2014 essentially there are four major categories of land productivity models canopy photosynthesis models cpms production efficiency models pems ecosystem process models epms and statistical models when data was limited statistical models associate climate factors precipitation temperature sunshine ye et al 2013 and flux of radiation zhou et al 1995 etc with plant dry matter production through a simple mathematical regression to estimate npp lieth and whittaker 1975 the advantage of statistical models is the high availability of meteorological data and that the result of them can truly reveal the climate affected patterns of npp but npp is also affected by other factors e g soil conditions or water conditions geruo et al 2020 therefore this kind of models are too simple to represent the true npp distribution and are not suitable for large scale spatial and or pixel specific modelling in addition the temporal resolutions are relatively low usually on a yearly basis compared with the other three pems are commonly based on the theory that the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation fpar absorbed by terrestrial vegetation can be derived from remote sensing data kumar and monteith 1982 a predefined conversion efficiency or an optimum value considering other environmental factors is used in such estimation they are also called diagnostic models as remote sensing derived vegetation indices are employed in the calculation however the value of conversion efficiency varies from vegetation types and local environments such as temperature and vapour pressure deficit vpd

photosynthetic pathway allocation rooting depth based on the structural characteristics of the vegetation woodward and cramer 1996 then integrated through the canopy with biochemical fluxes co2 water and energy exchange cramer et al 1999 however such models are commonly complicated and involve lots of species specific parameter estimation work while in cpms the estimation process is basically the same as pems or epms they are more focused on the leaf level plant photosynthesis and usually integrated with the seasonal canopy dynamics typically lai dynamics during the year and biochemical exchanges cramer et al 1999 cpms are called process models because they evolved from ecosystem or crop models which have processes for individual plant growth explicitly the significant difference between cpms and pems is that remote sensing measurements are not necessary for cpms for this reason cpms have the ability to produce results for future climate scenarios and they are prognostic models as well ruimy et al 1999a however cpms depend highly on the vegetation seasonal parameters which would be different across different vegetation types both pems and cpms are the lue based models which concentrate on the conversion processes of solar radiation to carbon mass or biomass pems have the advantage of using remote sensing data to quantify the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation fpar while cpms consider the photosynthesis processes of vegetation leaves and the exchange of carbon and water based on which the conversion of carbon mass from photosynthetic active radiation par can be calculated other ecosystem process models simulate the structure of vegetation and biogeochemical fluxes although there are numerous models available for npp estimation the low spatial resolution par data or the lack of species specific data lead to the inaccurate estimation of regional grassland npp in addition climatic factors zheng et al 2020 also increase the uncertainty in explaining the variation of npp wang et al 2019 the models represent the dynamics of vegetation and herbivore via either biophysical process chemical cycling eco functioning or energy flows which make them capable and available to simulate lots of diversified grassland systems but the values of the parameters are usually site dependant under certainty spatial or temporal scale which means the models may be difficult to apply in new conditions though they may work fine in the case study areas where they have been applied in some area the lack of par data make current lue models unable to be applied in addition climate data are commonly used as a driving force behind the growth of the vegetation but the errors propagated from the uncertainty of such data are rarely reported therefore the npp estimation still a problem for regional grassland especially in the npp estimation of moderate and high spatial resolution this paper presents an improved estimation of grassland npp by using high quality climatic data and radiation data then the results will be compared with moids npp products and the in situ observed data the choose of parameter values when applying vue models to regional studies will also be discussed the main reason for choosing the vpm model is data availability since there is no access to the daily climatic data provided by gmao nasa and the spatial resolution 0 5 latitude degree by 0 67 longitude degree of gmao nasa climatic data is too low thus cannot be used one pixel of gmao nasa data could cover all the area of zeku and could result in the homogeneity of local ε which is not true in reality the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd chen 2011 has provided high spatial resolution climatic data for every three hours from 1979 to 2012 this is also the main reason for this thesis choosing 2003 2012 as a case study period from 2003 the grasslands have also been contracted to individual households by aggregating the three hour temperature data to the daytime temperature data of cmfd the effect of temperature on ɛ max can be quantified basically the vpm uses the following equation to calculate ɛ at the daily scale xiao et al 2004 the objective of this paper is to develop a more suitable consider data availability and accurate grassland npp model 2 data source and pre processing 2 1 image data four image datasets were used in lue vpm modis lai globalland30 dem and earth surface reflectance modis lai was from modis collection 6 lai mod15a2h with a spatial resolution about 463 m 463 m for every 8 days myneni et al 2015 it was reprocessed by yu et al 2018 s method which fills in non good quality data mainly affected by clouds by a new growth grazing function globalland30 data was from the 30 m global land cover dataset chen et al 2015 which was resampled to about 463 m before calculating shortwave radiation the elevation data is from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem aster 2005 with a spatial resolution of 30 m and resized to about 463 m surface reflectance data was from the modis terra mod09a1 version 6 product which provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of terra modis bands 1 7 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering vermote 2013 these image datasets were projected to krasovsky 1940 albers with central meridian 105 standard parallel 25 and 47 the projection kept the projected land area the same as that of the earth s surface which is important for the ground validation 2 2 climatic data daily temperature data which was downloaded from the high resolution china meteorological forcing dataset hrcmfd dataset with 0 1 spatial resolution for every 3 h from 2003 to 2012 he and yang 2011 we used the mean value to downscale the climatic data the average maximum and minimum temperature were calculated and resampled to the same spatial resolution as modis lai the daily average maximum and minimum temperature of zeku during 2003 2012 is shown in fig 1 the maximum temperature is below 20 c 3 3 validation data the case study area is zeku county qinghai china there are 14 national grassland monitoring sites in zeku 2012 the locations are shown in fig 2 these in situ grass fresh weight data were provided by the grassland and livestock husbandry bureau of zeku there were 15 grassland sampling sites and 4 samples were taken for each site and the size was 1 m2 for each sample these are the chinese national grassland monitoring sites which were chosen depending on the representativeness of the overall grass growth we used the average fresh weight for each sampling site these fresh grass weight g m2 data were converted to npp gc m2 the relation between aboveground dry matter adm and npp can be described as maselli et al 2013 running 2015b 1 npp adm r o o t l e a f r a t i o 1 0 5 where the multiplier r o o t l e a f r a t i o 1 converts the above ground dry matter to whole plant dry matter both above ground mass and below ground mass this value is taken as 0 28 following running 2015b the 0 5 multiplier accounts for the conversion from dry matter to carbon maselli et al 2013 the ratio of adm to above ground fresh grass weight in zeku is 0 37 according to lai et al 2008 another comparison dataset was the mod17a2h version 6 gross primary productivity gpp product it is a cumulative 8 day composite of values with 500 metre pixel size the data product includes information about gross primary productivity gpp and net photosynthesis psn the psn band values are the gpp minus the maintenance respiration mr running 2015a the npp was calculated by the eqs 18 and 19 in addition the photosynthetic active radiation par measured in 2012 was collected to validate the par estimated from dem 3 method the lue vpm model consists of photosynthetic active radiation par estimation light use efficiency lue calculation and vegetation photosynthesis simulation by vpm the daily maintenance respiration is considered simply as the same as modis npp algorithm running and zhao 2015 the flowchart of lue vpm is shown in fig 3 after calculating the shortwave irradiance si by a viewshed model the photosynthetic active radiation par was derived from the empirical coefficient of the local area the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation fpar was quantified by beers law and then the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation apar was calculated by multiplying fpar and par a vegetation photosynthesis model vpm was used for quantifying the effect of temperature water and leaf phenology on the light use efficiency of vegetation the gross primary productivity gpp was calculated through apar and light use efficiency ɛ in addition the allometry growth above ground and under ground growth of grass was considered by leaf mass and fine root mass calculation together with the daily maintenance respiration mr the accumulated daily npp was then calculated we will now explain each sub model of lue vpm 3 1 par estimation from solar shortwave irradiance solar radiation is also called solar shortwave irradiance si compared with terrestrial radiation longwave irradiance mani 1980 the si can be calculated through a viewshed model fu and rich 2002 rich et al 1994 which includes two key parameters diffuse ratio and transmissivity generally when solar radiation travels from the sun through the atmosphere to the top of the canopy it is inevitably affected by astronomical and meteorological factors brock 1981 there are three components actually arriving at the top of the canopy direct diffuse and reflected insolation direct radiation is the main component of solar radiation it is not reflected or scattered and reaches the surface directly while diffuse radiation is the second largest component it is the scattered radiation that reaches the ground reflected radiation from surrounding landscapes reflected from the ground onto the inclined receiver generally accounts for a small proportion of total incident solar radiation and usually can be neglected hofierka and suri 2002 in northwest china the value of diffuse ratio was set to 0 31 according to fu et al 2015 s research considering the effect of the solar altitude atmospheric water vapour content dust content ozone content and any other radiation depletion a transmission coefficient for direct and diffuse radiation were proposed by liu and jordan 1960 it was also referred to as either the clearness index or cloudiness index it is a very attractive parameter for estimating the response of solar radiation to different atmospheric conditions using this the diffuse ratio can be calculated by using the global transmissivity of the atmosphere carroll 1985 the transmissivity is set to 0 72 based on regional figures given by pan et al 2013 the solar radiation tool in arcmap was used to calculate si based on dem data fig 4 and the calculation interval was 30 min slope and aspect were from the dem and 32 different incident radiation directions were calculated par can be calculated by using si at the top of the atmosphere and a conversion ratio which can be expressed as 2 par φ si where φ accounts for the ratio of par to the solar shortwave radiation si stands for the solar shortwave radiation the observed standard deviation is 0 004 at the monthly level with a mean value of 0 446 in tibet li et al 2010 we used 0 446 as the default value for φ 3 2 the lue model the lue models are based on the rationale that daily photosynthesis is proportional to the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation apar according to the monteith theory monteith 1972 monteith and moss 1977 which proposed a linear relationship between aboveground photosynthesis and apar for barley potatoes sugar beet and apples in britain later a similar linear relationship has been found for cereals gallagher and biscoe 1978 and tropical trees harrington and fownes 1995 thus light use efficiency has been widely used to quantify the amount of apar in energy units converted into vegetation biomass in carbon units gpp odum 2013 3 gpp ε apar where ɛ is known as light use efficiency lue and it represents the conversion efficiency of solar radiation to carbon mass a detailed theoretical analysis of eq 3 was discussed in haxeltine and prentice 1996 the value of ɛ has been estimated both theoretically and experimentally for various species landsberg et al 1997 medlyn 1998 ruimy et al 1994 it depends on the local environmental conditions water nitrogen and temperature hunt jr and running 1992 ruimy et al 1999b wright et al 1993 but one of the key uncertainties in this equation is the spatial and temporal variation of the daily ɛ max value goetz and prince 1999 turner et al 2002 therefore in the npp calculation especially in regional or local areas smaller scale calculations the value of ɛ max would be different goetz et al 1999 in this thesis the value of ɛ max is 0 0006 gc m 2 mj when calculating the npp based on ground measurement in qinghai tibet li et al 2012 solar radiation is the key factor in vegetation growth providing the essential energy for the photosynthetic activities monteith 1972 solar radiation has a variety of wavelengths but only the wavelengths between 0 4 μm and 0 7 μm can be used by vegetation for photosynthetic activities that is photosynthetically active radiation par mccree 1972 apar absorbed par describes the amount of par received by the vegetation canopy and used for photosynthesis it varies with the change in day length due to axial tilt and the daily cloud over the aerosol attenuation of solar radiation odum 2013 as well as the upwelling radiance reflected by the land surface roujean and breon 1995 therefore it is also an important component of any analysis of the global carbon balance through the estimation of vegetation photosynthetic carbon sink tucker et al 1986 in addition apar implicitly indicates how much leaf area the vegetation lai is exposed to absorb solar radiation and it follows the form 4 a p a r f p a r p a r where par is photosynthetic active radiation par which is part of the solar radiation within the spectral range of 400 700 nm for vegetation photosynthesis which controls the accumulation of npp and the carbon fixation on the earth frouin and pinker 1995 it plays an important role in evaluating global productivity change and carbon balance li et al 2015 incoming photosynthetically active radiation it is the potential radiation that could be absorbed to do photosynthetic work not all this light is used and fpar is the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation the actual proportion used is known as the apar basically all the methods of fpar estimation are based on the relationship between vegetation indices and vegetation canopy properties for example fpar was calculated by quantifying the linear relationship with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sims et al 2006 fpar 1 24ndvi 0 168 or the linear relationship with the enhanced vegetation index evi fisher et al 2008 fpar 1 2evi the modis fpar product has used a more advanced vegetation index which consists of three or four wavelengths odum 2013 amongst all those calculations the relationship between fpar and lai which is known as beer s law is the most widely used one hu et al 2013 which follows 5 f p a r 0 95 1 e x p k l a i where fpar is the fraction of incident par absorbed by the canopy k is the light extinction coefficient lai is the leaf area per ground area similar to the other light use efficiency models the light absorption here integrates leaf photosynthesis to the canopy ruimy et al 1999b the value for k is 0 5 in this paper which has been extensively validated for both herbaceous crops varlet grancher et al 1980 forest jarvis and leverenz 1983 and grass zhang et al 2014 3 3 the general process of vpm basically the vpm uses the following equation to calculate ɛ at the daily scale xiao et al 2004 6 ε ε m a x t s c a l a r w s c a l a r p s c a l a r where ɛ max is maximum light use efficiency and tscalar wscalar and pscalar are the downward regulation scalars for the effect of temperature water and leaf phenology on the light use efficiency of vegetation respectively tscalar is estimated at each time step using the equation developed for the terrestrial ecosystem model raich et al 1991 7 t s c a l a r t t m i n t t m a x t t m i n t t m a x t t o p t 2 where tmin tmax and topt are minimum maximum and optimal temperature for vegetation photosynthesis if air temperature falls below tmin when the temperature is beyond the minimum temperature for vegetation photosynthesis the photosynthesis is at a low rate or there is no photosynthesis and tscalar is set to zero the value of tmin tmin and tmin are different according to the vegetation types in the research of qinghai tibet alpine ecosystems the values for these three parameters are 0 20 and 35 c respectively li et al 2007 the main contribution of the vpm model is that it considers the effects of both water stress and vegetation phenology on ɛ in the vpm a water sensitive vegetation index lswi was utilized to capture the effects of water stress and phenology on light use efficiency 8 l s w i ρ n i r ρ s w i r ρ n i r ρ s w i r where ρnir is the surface reflectance band intensity between 841 nm and 876 nm near infrared band and ρswir is the surface reflectance band from 1628 nm to 1652 nm short infrared band both of the data can be derived from the modis reflectance dataset mod09a1 vermote 2015 then the effect of water on plant photosynthesis wscalar can be calculated as 9 w scalar 1 lswi 1 lsw i max where lswi max is the maximum lswi within the plant growth season finally pscalar is included in the vpm model to account for the effect of leaf phenology leaf age on photosynthesis at the canopy level 10 p scalar 1 lswi 2 during bud burst to leaf full expansion p scalar was set to be 1 after leaf full expansion 3 4 daily maintenance respiration maintenance respiration costs mr for leaves and fine roots were considered in the lue vpm model fig 3 they were also calculated on a daily basis leaf mass kgc was calculated as running 2015b 11 l e a f m a s s l a i s l a where lai is the leaf area index and sla is the specific leaf area projected leaf area kg c fine root mass is then estimated by 12 f i n e r o o t m a s s l e a f m a s s f r o o t l e a f r a t i o leaf maintenance respiration is calculated as 13 l e a f m r l e a f m a s s l e a f m r b a s e q 10 t a v g 20 10 tavg is the average daily temperature c q 10 describes the short term temperature dependence of the rates of biological processes widely used amongst biologists which could affect the respiration of vegetation tjoelker et al 2001b wager 1941 q 10 is calculated through the equation which developed by tjoelker et al 2001a 14 q 10 3 22 0 046 t a v g similarly the maintenance respiration of the fine root mass can be calculated as 15 r o o t m r r o o t m a s s f r o o t m r b a s e q 10 t a v g 20 10 and finally the net photosynthesis can be calculated 16 p s n n e t g p p l e a f m r r o o t m r in addition for the energy cost for constructing organic compounds fixed by photosynthesis which is empirically parameterized as 25 of npp the modis npp algorithm simply uses a fixed percentage of npp to calculate energy cost for constructing organic compounds fixed by photosynthesis that is 17 n p p g p p r m r g g p p r m 0 25 n p p where rm is the plant maintenance respiration and 0 25 npp represents calculate energy cost for constructing organic compounds fixed by photosynthesis therefore the npp can be calculated by 18 n p p 0 8 g p p r m w h e n g p p r m 0 a n d 19 n p p 0 w h e n g p p r m 0 up to this point the daily npp can be calculated the effect of increased temperature on the npp will also be evaluated by the simulations with the increase of temperature for 1 5 c and 2 0 c and keeping all the other parameter values the same the daily npp was accumulated from the start of the year to the end of the year to get the annual npp the key parameter values are listed in appendix b 4 results 4 1 npp using the above estimation methods the year round aggregated npp maps are shown in fig 5 the value of npp ranges from 43 66 gcm 2 to 664 39 gcm 2 the average npp is 380 09 gcm 2 for the whole region we can see obvious spatial heterogeneity in the npp distribution with the high productivity concentrating to the southeast of zeku the low productivity areas are mainly distributed in the northern mountainous areas see dem figure in fig 4 notice that there are some black points in the figures these are the points where the improved lai cannot be calculated non linear regression cannot find a solution for the new growth function the total number of these black points is 45 considering a total of 29 423 pixels in zeku these black points have no noticeable influence on the npp calculation 4 2 validation the r2 between measured par and the par estimated from dem is 0 94 rsme 36 46 mj m2 with regards to the model accuracy table 1 shows the validation results with three determents the paired t test shows there is no significant difference between npp calculated by lue vpm and in situ npp with a p value equalling 0 901 conversely the p value between in situ npp and the modis npp product is 0 028 indicating the modis npp product for zeku is significantly different from the in situ measured data the results of tukey s honest significance test tukeyhsd test tukey 1949 table 2 shows there is no significant difference between npp calculated by lue vpm based on improved lai and converted in situ measured carbon mass conversely modis npp product for zeku is significantly different from the in situ measured data when keeping all the parameters of lue vpm the samein addition from table 2 the average converted npp from in situ measured data is 262 32 gcm 2 while the npp calculated by lue vpm based on our improved lai is 266 83 gcm 2 and if all the lue vpm parameters are kept the same the average recalculated npp by lue vpm based on modis lai is 236 42 gcm 2 which indicates that the improved lai estimate has improved the accuracy of the npp calculations on average 5 discussion in this paper we developed lue vpm model to estimate the grassland npp in zeku the value of npp ranges from 43 66 gcm 2 to 664 39 gcm 2 this spatial pattern is quite similar to that of fan et al 2010b and modis npp products running and zhao 2015 and the results produced in this paper are more close to the ground measured npp but there still exist uncertainties in the model 5 1 the uncertainty of npp estimation model is a simplification or abstraction of the real system due to an imperfect representation of the model structure inadequate information or knowledge of the parameters or input data and the uncertainty in measuring the observation data output uncertainty exists in almost every model a complete uncertainty analysis of the lue vpm should consider all sources of uncertainty that contribute to the modelling process and to the indicators or statistical properties of the model output however it is difficult to give a comprehensive uncertainty analysis of the npp produced by the lue vpm although the uncertainty of the lai estimation has been clarified through a numerical simulation analysis there are other components involved in the npp calculation that may also affect the accuracy of npp outputs in appendix a the source for those uncertainties includes inaccurate assignment of the biological parameters for example seasonal difference in the value of light use efficiency error in the remote sensing measurement uncertainty of surface reflectance data in vpm model bias in situ measurement and the structure uncertainty of the model this paper is not able to determine the overall effect of all those uncertainties on npp calculation because of a lack of data obtaining sufficient data would require a collaborative scientific effort from numerous different research communities modis npp products were produced by the combination of pem and an ecosystem process model by using the biome specific ecosystem process model biome bgc the maximum value for the conversion efficiency ɛ max for each land type can be derived however while ɛ max is the potential maximum convert efficiency for specific land type the value of ɛ max varies to different local environmental conditions mainly temperature and atmospheric moisture in the modis npp algorithm the vapour pressure deficit vpd model was employed to calculate the final conversion efficiency ɛ the main purpose of this calculation is to convert the maximum radiation conversion efficiency ɛ max to the local instantaneous radiation conversion efficiency ɛ on a daily basis vpd reflects the effect of water on the radiation conversion efficiency the value range is from 1 to 0 the default value of ɛ max can be obtained from the biome property look up table bplut see running 2015b however the value of ɛ max varies in different biome types and by local environmental conditions landsberg and waring 1997 the value of ɛ max for grassland in the modis npp products calculation is 0 00086 gc m 2 mj running et al 2000 but one of the key uncertainties is the spatial and temporal variation of the daily ɛ max value goetz and prince 1999 turner et al 2002 therefore in the npp calculation especially in regional or local areas smaller scale calculations the value of ɛ max would be different goetz et al 1999 in this paper the value of ɛ max is 0 0006 gc m 2 mj when calculating the npp based on ground measurement in qinghai tibet li et al 2012 5 2 uncertainty of par estimation par is affected by atmospheric conditions water vapour and ozone amounts surface visibility aerosol type and cloud optical thickness frouin and pinker 1995 and radiation geometry solar zenith angle myneni et al 1997 however numerous studies have confirmed there is a robust linear relationship between par and solar shortwave irradiance si britton and dodd 1976 papaioannou et al 1993 if both the diffuse and global solar radiation is known diffuse ratio the direct component of solar radiation can be obtained through simple subtraction tuller 1976 however the diffuse ratio varies inversely with cloudiness the value of this ratio ranging from 0 to 0 35 has been observed tuller 1976 unfortunately in the algorithm used for calculating the modis daily npp mod17a2 a3 products par was estimated from data provided by the global modelling and assimilation office in the national aeronautics and space administration gmao nasa the spatial resolution of this shortwave radiance data is in increments of 2 3 latitude and 1 4 longitude masuda 2004 which is not suitable for estimating npp at a 0 463 km spatial resolution in addition the modis method does not consider the shadow effect of hills elevation on the total incoming shortwave radiation therefore we can see an even statistical different results between npp produced by modis and in situ observed npp table 1 in addition studies have found that the value of φ varied according to weather conditions the early most commonly used value of φ was 0 44 moon 1940 under clear sky conditions the value of φ changed from 0 47 to 0 5 while under cloudy or rainy conditions the range was 0 47 0 59 mccree 1966 in the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model φ is a constant value which accounts for the fact that approximately half of the si can be considered as par potter et al 1993 for practical purposes the ratio of photosynthetically useful radiation has been suggested to be half of the si monteith and reifsnyder 1974 in barrow alaska the value was found to be 0 45 and similar results have been revealed in jerusalem israel and rockville maryland u s a goldberg and klein 1977 although the value ranged from 0 45 to 0 47 in ultuna sweden rodskjer 1983 the results for california state university fresno site indicated that φ varied from 0 458 in july to 0 446 in april blackburn and proctor 1983 while in china especially in the qinghai tibet regions the value of φ has been extensively investigated a comparison of observed and modelled φ was shown in li et al 2010 s results 6 conclusions in this paper a lue vpm model was employed to estimate the grassland npp in qinghai tibet region it consists of shortwave irradiance estimation light use efficiency quantification and the photosynthesis and respiration of grass the values of parameters were all derived from localized studies and the input datasets were derived from high resolution satellite images and high resolution climate data it found that with the improvement of the parameter values and the quality of the input datasets the lue vpm produced more accurate npp products than the modis npp estimations in the qinghai tibet area in addition the use of par estimated from high resolution dem data will be particularly useful in npp estimation for the regions where the solar irradiance data and water vapour pressure data are scarce in addition the comparisons of modis npp products in zeku with in situ measurements shown that they were statistical different indicating that we should be cautious when applying global npp products in the local regional npp related studies funding this research was

24804,rapid population growth and urban expansion in metropolitan areas have led to a dramatic increase in food demand in most cases urban sprawl occurs in unplanned ways forcing peri urban agriculture to adopt detrimental practices for biodiversity conservation and metabolic efficiency i e landscape homogenization and dependence on non renewable external inputs facing the food biodiversity dilemma in order to ameliorate these negative effects over the metropolitan socioecological system researchers have focused on developing comprehensive indicators to support sustainable urban expansion in metropolitan areas in this paper we use these indicators to develop an energy landscape optimization e lo a nonlinear model designed for land use planning by means of considering biophysical constraints then we test the model in a representative mediterranean bio cultural landscape in the barcelona metropolitan area spain the e lo results allow us to propose different land use configurations for both conventional and organic agriculture taking into account the associated socio metabolic balances and the related landscape functional structures with the aim to meet different societal objectives we have fruitfully tested three settings i to increase conditions to host farm associated biodiversity ii to increase agricultural production and iii to minimize dependence on non renewable external inputs according to these socioecological objectives we have obtained the best landscape metabolism integration which is a useful methodology for sustainable land use policy this socioecological perspective is necessary for the new paradigm on agroecosystem management and landscape planning and can help advancing towards functional green infrastructures in metropolitan areas especially in the climate change and agroecological transition global context keywords energy landscape integrated analysis landscape agro ecology land use policy agro ecological transition optimisation modelling 1 introduction global human driven land use and cover change lucc have spread the so called anthropogenic habitats in many regions of the world thus determining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in human transformed landscapes for centuries as in the mediterranean grove and rackham 2001 however increasing landscape transformation linked to fuel energy consumption giampietro et al 2013 have driven to unprecedented levels of affectation of ecosystem functioning at landscape and regional scales sterling and ducharne 2008 ellis et al 2008 the past century was witness to particularly severe lucc which affected habitat and biodiversity conservation newbold et al 2015 un ipbes 2019 these effects lead to biotic homogenization in most human transformed regions like metropolitan areas mckinney 2006 in any case human transformed landscapes are the outcome of a shifting interplay between spatial patterns of land use types their associated ecological processes and their socio metabolic energy flows driven by human activity haberl 2001 wrbka et al 2004 the human population has continued growing in the last decades and the huge increase in global food production through increasingly industrialized and globalized production systems has provoked many serious socio ecological impacts and conflicts tilman et al 2002 mayer et al 2015 the dilemma that land use planners and agroecosystem managers are facing today is between increasing the efficiency of land trying to provide the demanded food and products at the cost of losing important features of landscape and trying to keep the sustainability of the agroecosystem which means limiting the production per unit area of land nair 2014 the main strategies to respond to the growing food demand are i to increase production per unit area of land ii to increase the land used for food production one of the most common ways used in industrialized agriculture to increase the production per unit area of land or increasing the efficiency of the land is using fertilizers pesticides and other non renewable inputs although in the short run these options seem desirable the long term effects are disastrous due to the loss in biodiversity soil nutrition and other reproductive characteristics of agroecosystems that we call funds giampietro 1997 hence there is an urgent need for tools that support the designing of sustainable agroecosystems where socioecological goals i e food production biodiversity conservation ecosystem service provisioning are optimized while they operate within a framework of constrained reproductive imperatives padró et al 2019a to solve this food biodiversity dilemma cardinale et al 2012 a deeper research on how landscape ecological functionality is kept in different land use patterns is required according to the quantity and quality of the human disturbance that farmers carry out across the landscape marull et al 2018 the aim of this research is to find optimal scenarios for land use management in the barcelona metropolitan area bma that maximize key reproductive characteristics of agroecosystems padró et al 2019 such are metabolic efficiency landscape ecological functionality biodiversity and associated ecosystem services and also climate change mitigation and adaptation marull et al 2020 padró et al forthcoming to that aim the objective of this paper is to develop an energy landscape optimization e lo nonlinear modelling based on the energy landscape integrated analysis elia marull et al 2016 to find the optimal land uses that lead to a sustainable agroecosystem then we test the e lo model by applying three optimization scenarios in a mediterranean bio cultural landscape of the bma considering different lucc under both conventional and organic agricultural practices the e lo is designed to help land use policy makers and agroecosystem managers to advance towards a socioecological transition taking into account societal priorities and environmental constrains in a human transformed landscape 2 material and methods the methodology considered for the e lo model is based on applying an optimization procedure to the elia marull et al 2016 the latter is a socio metabolic and landscape ecology methodology that brings together landscape patterns and processes and describes how agrarian flows such as energy fertilizers or production are distributed amongst the landscape this tool is particularly useful to represent complex performances of cultural landscapes as human nature co evolutionary systems 2 1 energy landscape integrated analysis elia 2 1 1 agroecosystem energy flows from a landscape ecology standpoint elia summarizes human coproduction with nature marull et al 2016 through the connection between energy flows fig 1 coming from solar radiation through the photosynthesis vertical axis and coming from outside the landscape left side of the horizontal axis both energy flows interact across a landscape functional structure to give rise to a final product extracted from it right side of the horizontal axis the elia graph expresses this network of energy flows across the agroecosystem which are partially recirculating internally to keep its own reproduction and partially open externally to sustain the agri food chains of human society β i s are the incoming outgoing energy flows coefficients the phytomass obtained from solar radiation through autotrophic production by plants is the actual net primary production nppact vitousek et al 1986 the biomass included in nppact that becomes available for heterotrophic species splits into unharvested biomass ub and the share of net primary production harvested by farmers npph ub generally remains in the same place where it has been originally growing and can feed farm associated biodiversity it becomes a source of agroecosystem total turnover att which closes the cycle of the natural subsystem fig 1 this natural subsystem allows maintaining the farm associated biodiversity and in turn the nppact again through the trophic net of non domesticated species either aboveground or in the soil such as decomposer organisms npph splits into biomass reused br inside the agroecosystem and farmland final produce ffp that goes outside br is an important flow that remains within the agroecosystem as the farmers investment directly or indirectly addressed to maintain two basic fund elements livestock and soil fertility hence br closes the farmland subsystem fig 1 then br splits into the livestock subsystem fig 1 that goes to feed and bed the domesticated animals as livestock biomass reused lbr which is added to the livestock total inputs lti and farmland biomass reused fbr in turn these flows add up to farmland total inputs fti as seeds green manure and other vegetal fertilizers these energy linkages in the elia graph enable us to see to what extent the land use management is integrated or not within the surrounding agroecosystem afterwards domestic animals perform bioconversions and then the lti is converted into livestock final produce lfp and internal livestock services ls lfp includes a wide range of food and fibre products and ls services include manure together they make up livestock produce and services lps the farmland and livestock subsystems are partially closed within the agroecosystem since they offer a final produce fp to be consumed outside as well as receive external inputs ei therefore ub br and ls regulate the internal flows that lead to a higher or lower internal circularity in the pattern of energy networks of the agroecosystem fig 1 they constitute important flows of recirculating biomass that contribute to the maintenance of the agroecosystem funds landscape processes and associated biodiversity soil fertility and livestock marull et al 2016 the internal circularity of energy flows is kept within the agroecosystem because the outputs of one subsystem serve as inputs for the next subsystem allowing the storage of energy carriers and information within its dissipative structure ho and ulanowicz 2005 there is an exception to this rule though when some energy carriers circulating inside the agroecosystem imply losses as opportunity costs because of farmers mismanagement into what odum 1993 named a resource out of place i e a waste we consider wastes as energy flows that cannot be integrated by farm systems either because they exceed the carrying capacity or they are not correctly disposed for the agroecosystem funds according to societal goals douglas 1966 sometimes a fraction of nppact can be wasted such as crop stubble or tree pruning that are burnt on the field instead of being used as it often was in the past for bedding straw home heating branches or animal feed leaves the same may happen with a fraction of the lps such as dung slurry coming from agro industrial feedlots that is spread out in excess of cropland carrying capacity and finally contaminates the water table if they exist farmland waste fw and livestock waste lw do not contribute to the renewal of the agroecosystem s funds they neither enhance its reproduction nor meet human needs 2 1 2 agroecosystem energy flows and landscape ecology integration elia combines three indicators the energy storage performed through the internal cycles of agroecosystems energy reinvestment e the information embedded in the energy network of flows energy redistribution i and the landscape functional structure energy imprint l the circularity of energy carriers driven by farmers through ub br and ls flows fig 1 is a metric of e and i which contributes to the energy potentially available for trophic chains existing in agroecosystems 2 1 2 1 measuring energy storage as reinvestment of energy cycles e we understand agroecosystem complexity as the differentiation of dissipative structures metabolic cycles allowing for diverse potential ranges in their behaviour tainter 1990 the more complex the space time differentiation of these structures the more energy is stored within a living system ho and ulanowicz 2005 hence higher mean values of even βi s fig 1 entail that agroecosystems are increasing in complexity because the different cycles are coupled to each other and the residence time of the stored energy increases thanks to a greater number of interlinked energy transformations circulating inside accordingly our way of calculating the energy stored e to keep the agroecosystem s funds functioning goes as follows eq 1 1 e β 2 β 4 2 k 1 β 6 β 8 2 k 2 β 10 β 12 2 k 3 k 1 u b u b b r l s k 2 b r u b b r l s k 3 l s u b b r l s where the coefficients k 1 k 2 k 3 account for the share of reusing energy flows that are circulating through each of the three subsystems fig 1 which allows differentiating the agroecosystems fund composition and making their energy patterns comparable e remains within the range 0 1 e close to 0 implies low reuse of energy flows usually associated with industrial farm systems which are highly dissipative and dependant on external inputs e close to 1 implies the existence of internal cycles only usually translating into land abandonment i e loss of cultural landscapes or to a simple extractive use of the land i e foraging or hunting e assesses the amount of all the energy flows that go back inside the agroecosystem when we account for the three subsystems altogether natural farmland and livestock we are adopting a landscape agroecology standpoint this allows linking farming energy analysis with landscape ecology assessment 2 1 2 2 measuring information as complexity of energy flow patterns i agroecosystems have a quantity of information embedded in the network structure through which their reproduction takes place over time this way of information accounting can be seen as a measure of uncertainty or the degree of freedom for the system to behave and evolve prigogine 1996 it is called information message and registers the likelihood of the occurrence of a pair of events passet 1996 ulanowicz 2001 the energy information i is always site specific which becomes an important trait from a cultural standpoint barthel et al 2013 font et al 2020 in general when a balanced agroecosystem registers a decrease of i some important parts of the agroecosystem functioning are then no longer controlled at the landscape level but linked to increasingly globalised agri food chains mcmichael 2011 tello and gonzález de molina 2017 this work used a shannon wiener index adaptation over each pair of βi s fig 1 so that this indicator shows whether the βi s pairs are evenly distributed or not this measure of i accounts for the equi proportionality of pairwise energy flows that exit from each node in every sub process eq 2 2 i 1 6 i 1 12 β i log 2 β i γ f γ l α f α l γ f u b n p p h 2 u b n p p h f w γ l l s l f p 2 l s l f p l w α f f e i r 2 f e i r f e i n r α l l e i r 2 l e i r l e i n r base 2 logarithms are applied as the probability is dichotomous the introduction of the information loss coefficients γf γl ensures that i remains lower than 1 when the agroecosystem presents farm and or livestock waste the coefficients αf αl act as a penalization for the use of non renewable external inputs which entail an internal information loss given that the agroecosystem functioning is no longer self reproductive i values close to 1 are those with an equi distribution of incoming and outgoing energy flows where the information message embedded in the agroecosystem structure is high whereas i values close to 0 mean patterns of probability far from equi distribution which endow less information these lower i values correspond to an industrialised farm system or by contrast to an almost natural turnover with no external inputs and no harvests conversely agroecosystems with i equal to 1 are the ones with equi distributed incoming and outgoing energy flows in each sub process that probably correspond to a mixed farming in which external inputs play a balanced role integrated with local energy recirculation tello et al 2016 therefore e measures the energy reinvested and temporarily stored in the agroecosystem and i assesses how the farmers redistribute this energy in the landscape needless to say the more complex i e internally differentiated and interlinked an agroecosystem is the greater the farming information required to manage it 2 1 2 3 measuring energy imprint as landscape structure l in order to measure the energy imprinted l in the landscape we introduce a land metric we use l to account for landscape heterogeneity which reveals the capacity of differentiated land cover mosaics to circulate the energy flows and offer a range of habitats that sustain biodiversity harper et al 2005 the underlying assumption is that species richness associated with agricultural landscapes depends on both energy availability and landscape heterogeneity measured at scales larger than the farm level loreau et al 2003 eq 3 3 l i 1 k p i log k 1 p i where k is the number of different land covers potential habitats and there are k 1 possible land covers in each unit of analysis we consider that the existence of urban land cover results in a loss of potential habitats thus pi is the proportion of land covers i into every unit of analysis these l values can be seen as a proxy for the spatial insurance of farm associated biodiversity so that species whose populations are disturbed by agriculture can find safe haunts nearby by activating their own dispersal abilities tscharntke et al 2012 2 1 2 4 measuring the energy landscape integrated analysis elia after having defined the three elia indicators e i and l we are going to analyse their relationship we surmise that the interplay between e and i jointly leads to complexity understood as a balanced level of intermediate self organisation gershenson and fernández 2012 we assume that the agroecosystems complexity of energy flows e i are related to more heterogeneous landscapes where the ecological patterns and processes that sustain farm associated biodiversity become stronger marull et al 2016 therefore elia combines the agro ecological landscape functional structure with the complexity of the interlinking pattern of energy flows as a proxy for the agroecosystem s biodiversity marull et al 2019 eq 4 4 e l i a e i l m a x e i a 1 3 where e is the energy storage i is the information carried by the network structure of energy flows and l is the heterogeneity of land covers seen as the energy imprint in the landscape structure the equilibrated m a x e i e 0 6169 k i 1 3 implies subsystems equilibrium and no waste when there is no such equilibrium the absolute m a x e i a 0 7420 k i 1 even though this last combination is unlikely in an agroecosystem it is possible in a theoretical mathematic case hence elia theoretically ranges from 0 to 1 for any value of the parameters considered in order to understand the relationship between the stored energy e the information it contains i and its imprint on the landscape l we have to consider a three dimensional model elia can be interpreted in the sense that it is culture which allows farmers to manage the energy entering the system to meet their needs and goals while taking care of the agroecosystem funds reproduction and biodiversity conservation marull et al 2019 this calls for an integrated research of coupled human natural systems aimed at revealing the functioning of complex structures and processes liu et al 2007 2 2 energy landscape optimization e lo 2 2 1 case study databases this work uses data of land covers and the associated energy flows of sant climent de llobregat fig 2 a rural municipality of the bma this municipality has been chosen because it consists of a complex land matrix land use mosaic that can be a good representative of the mediterranean bio cultural landscapes land covers are classified into 13 categories namely orchards greenhouses dry herbaceous crops irrigated herbaceous crops dry fruit trees irrigated fruit trees dry olive trees vineyards scrubs grazing areas flat leaved forests coniferous forests and urban areas the land cover thematic map 2015 used in this study have been provided by creaf https www creaf uab es mcsc for each current land cover the surface in hectares covered by each category is given we call this parameter xi currentcover which is an array of size i 13 and defines the input land use pattern to be modified for each land cover there is a set of energy flows coming from the socio metabolic pattern of the municipality marull et al 2020 metabolic flows are calculated from land cover and farming databases on agriculture

http www ccpae org index php option com frontpage itemid 1 lang en see table 1 2 2 2 energy flows definition the energy flows are essentially the nodes of the elia graph previously seen in fig 1 in fact we have the values for 12 of the primary flows while the values of the other 10 flows are calculated using the elia graph for this reason two sets of variables are considered for these flows namely e j 1 for the so called primary flows and e k 2 for secondary flows with j 1 13 and k 1 10 it could be confusing to see that j is ranging from 1 to 13 instead of 12 the reason is that in the data there are two variables considered for livestock biomass reused lbr1 and lbr2 the former is the biomass that farmland subsystem makes available to be used in the livestock subsystem seen from the farmland standpoint as the share of npph devoted to livestock while the latter is the biomass that is required for the livestock subsystem seen from the livestock standpoint as the share of total requirements coming from the agroecosystem in this sense it is useful to consider them separately and as one of the possible constraints make them have equal values so that the amount of biomass reused br requirements of livestock match with the production of farmland for this purpose from this socio metabolic pattern we calculate the metabolic flows j for each land use i this parameter is called d i j using this parameter the variables e j 1 can be obtained as e j 1 i 1 15 x i d i j also e k 2 can be obtained using the relations seen in the elia graph fig 1 from e j 1 the summary of

the last set of variables we consider in our modelling are the constant values that measure the system or subsystems in one way or another and in the end they all contribute to one of our main indicators these variables include the coefficients βl l 1 2 13 k1 k2 k3 γf γl αf αl the indicators e i l and finally elia 2 2 3 formulation departing from the variables xi land covers i 1 2 13 e j 1

lowerboundi xi upperboundi in principle these bounds can have any value according to the unique situations of land cover i xi and if detailed studies are done in this regard exact values can be used we assume that each xi with the specific characteristics that they have i 1 15 x i i 1 15 c u r r e n t c o v e r i can be changed to a certain range with respect to the currentcoveri thus we have considered these bounds to be of the form lowerboundi 1 landchangei currentcoveri upperboundi 1 landchangei currentcoveri in addition landchangei can be specified according to the properties of xi but with the available data these landchangei values are considered later on a parametric analysis is conducted in which we change landchangei except x 13 urban areas to analyse the way they might affect the optimization solution different objective functions that we consider for non linear models are elia first setting fp second setting and einr third setting then we implement the settings for both conventional and organic agriculture which are characterized by different patterns of energy flows for each land use d i j 2 2 4 implementation different optimization tools are tested to implement the model using data from the sant climent de llobregat case study torabi 2019 we have used the algorithms from the general algebraic modelling system gams https www gams com constrained optimization by linear approximation cobyla powell 2007 and improved stochastic ranking evolution strategy isres runarsson and yao 2005 the last two through its implementation in the open source c library of nonlinear programming algorithms nlopt https nlopt readthedocs io the conopt procedure in gams is essentially based in the generalized reduced gradient method abadie and carpentier 1969 fletcher 1987 with some pre processing that helps reducing the dimension of the model cobyla relies on linear approximations of objective function and constrains combined with a trust region kind of step choice finally isres is an evolutionary population based heuristic algorithm we consider three different settings for objective functions and constraints each one following a specific goal while trying to consider other restrictions in order to keep the balance between variables to compare the results obtained from the different optimization tools we observe the following for each setting first setting maximize elia while maintaining at least a certain percentage of the current final produce e 10 2 fpchange e 10 c u r r e n t 2 cobyla algorithm results in a solution with the highest value for the objective function as well as being feasible however the values for all the related variables in the best solution obtained by cobyla are very close to the solution obtained by gams considering the fact that gams is faster than running the c program using cobyla we can say the results obtained by gams are acceptable second setting maximize final produce e 10 2 while the indicators e and i do not decrease more than a certain percentage of the current amount e echange ecurrent and i ichange icurrent contrary to the previous case none of the methods have resulted in a superior solution in all aspects on one side in the sense of obtaining the most significant value for the objective function it seems that isres produces best results however first and second constraints are not met in this solution making it infeasible on the contrary the results obtained from cobyla and gams are very close and are feasible third setting minimize non renewable external inputs e 6 1 e 8 1 while the indicator l is maintained at least to a certain percentage of the current value l lchange lcurrent the best solutions are given by cobyla algorithm with the least value for objective function as well as being a feasible solution the explanations given for the previous case about the differences between cobyla and gams results hold here too considering this preliminary analysis the conopt algorithm implemented in gams is used in the research torabi 2019 because it was found that the supplying different initial point to cobyla may lead to different final points the difference between cobyla and gams in the optimal values found is very small and the execution of gams is faster than the c program using the cobyla implementation of the nlopt library in this paper we aim at analysing the effects that changing the parameters specifically landchangei may have on the results of each setting the values of landchangei were considered to be 10 20 30 40 and 50 of land cover change for both conventional and organic agriculture typologies in annex c we present an example of the model syntax table 4c 3 results and discussion in order to see the effect of landchangei on the optimization scenarios fig 3 a and fig 4 a can be used as a reference for conventional and organic agriculture respectively showing how land covers have changed with respect to the currentcoveri in both agricultural typologies these land cover changes and l can be seen in tables a3 and b3 cs is the current scenario conventional agriculture s0 considers the same land cover structure than the current scenario but supposing a full organic agriculture transition according to the ccpae recommendations table 1 s1 corresponds to the first setting maximizing elia while maintaining at least 90 of fp s2 is the second setting maximizing fp while e and i do not decrease more than 10 of the current amount s3 is the third setting minimizing einr while l is maintained at least to a 90 of the current value for all settings e lo applies to 10 20 30 40 and 50 of land cover change for both agricultural typologies fig 3b and fig 4b show the results of s1 s2 and s3 in terms of elia fp and einr in conventional and organic agriculture tables a1 and b1 show the energy flows and e and tables a2 and b2 show the energy coefficients and i 3 1 optimizing biodiversity conservation the first setting s1 is designed to maximize the energy landscape integration elia variable that has been related recently with biodiversity birds and butterflies and associated ecosystem services in mediterranean bio cultural landscapes marull et al 2019 in conventional agriculture s1 shows a slight increase on elia values fig 3b passing from 1 0 to 2 7 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table a3 except coniferous forests from 39 67 in cs to 23 35 and in less proportion greenhouses from 0 03 in cs to 0 01 and irrigated herbaceous crops from 0 51 in cs to 0 35 the moderate increase in elia values first produces an increase and then a gradual reduction in fp and a constant increase in einr when the model passes from 10 to 50 of land cover change fig 3b this increase in elia values is higher in organic agriculture fig 4b passing from 2 4 to 5 3 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 again all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table a3 except coniferous forests from 39 67 in cs to 20 58 and in less proportion greenhouses from 0 03 in cs to 0 01 the increase in elia values produces an increase in fp and einr when the model passes from 10 to 50 of land cover change fig 3b the reason for the slight increase of elia values in s1 is because the sant climent de llobregat municipality represents a mediterranean well structured land cover mosaic fig 2 and then there is a limited potential to improve landscape complexity compared to the average value for the whole bma st climent de llobregat doubles the elia value marull et al forthcoming however the model prioritizes the balancing of land covers mainly reducing the more abundant coniferous forests category in order to increase l fig 3b and 4b rather than reducing e and i see tables a1 b1 a2 and b2 and this is the reason that explains the increase of non renewable external inputs einr this agroecosystem dysfunction could be corrected including some constrains in the model i e limiting the dependence on einr in this sense it is interesting to note that organic agriculture practically doubles the increase of elia values of conventional agriculture in the different land cover change scenarios fig 5 and therefore it underlines the importance of an agro ecological transition for biodiversity conservation 3 2 optimizing agrarian productivity the second setting s2 is designed to maximize the agrarian productivity fp parameter that could attain higher values in organic than in conventional agriculture in europe even in economic terms van der ploeg et al 2019 in conventional agriculture s2 shows an important increase on fp fig 3b passing from 7 6 to 37 8 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table a3 except scrubs from 17 42 in cs to 8 70 grazing areas from 2 03 in cs to 1 01 and flat leaved forests from 16 52 in cs to 8 25 that are those more extensive areas the major increase in area is produced in dry fruit trees from 16 88 in cs to 25 31 and coniferous forests from 39 67 in cs to 48 03 the latter being just the opposite trend than in s1 table a3 the increase in fp values is much higher in organic agriculture fig 4b passing from 95 1 to 157 0 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table b3 except scrubs from 17 42 in cs to 8 70 grazing areas from 2 03 in cs to 1 01 and flat leaved forests from 16 52 in cs to 8 25 therefore behaving similarly to conventional agriculture it is important to take into account that this increase in fp values is associated to the disappearing of waste fw in fruit trees associated to the burning of pruning therefore the greatest part of this change when it is compared to conventional scenarios is due to these woody by products probably the notable increase in dry fruit trees guarantees the maximum fp in both conventional and organic agriculture while coniferous forests contributes to maintain certain levels of energy reinvestment e and redistribution i tables a1 b1 a2 and b2 however the fp increase in s2 is supported through an increase in non renewable external inputs einr which is not good news in terms of agrarian sustainability 3 3 optimizing climate change mitigation the third setting s3 is designed to minimize the dependence of non renewable external inputs einr parameter that is directly related with agrarian greenhouse gas emissions and then with climate change mitigation aguilera et al 2015 in conventional agriculture e1 shows an important decrease on einr fig 3b passing from 9 9 to 49 3 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories decrease their area in percentage table a3 except scrubs from 17 42 in cs to 26 15 and flat leaved forests from 16 52 in cs to 24 80 for organic agriculture the initial value for the current scenario s0 is already 20 being lower than for conventional then the decrease in einr values is higher in organic agriculture fig 4b passing from 26 9 to 58 8 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table b3 except scrubs and grazing areas in the same proportion than conventional agriculture the important decrease in einr observed in s3 for conventional agriculture is comparable with the fall on fp which means a non desirable solution in socioeconomic terms and the claim for another model of agriculture the good news is that for organic agriculture the decrease in einr is much more higher than in conventional agriculture but with an interesting difference while in conventional agriculture fp passes from a decrease of 7 4 to 37 2 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 in organic agriculture fp passes from an increase of 64 3 to 2 6 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 consequently there is room for an agro ecological transition and climate change mitigation and adaptation without compromising the socio economic viability of farm systems in metropolitan areas 3 4 limitation of the model the main purpose of the e lo model is to assess how the capacity of the agricultural landscapes to provide regulatory and cultural ecosystem services can be improved while at the same time maintaining o increasing local agri food production a provisioning ecosystem service and reducing agricultural dependence on non renewable external inputs this is a very useful assessment for land use planners to make decisions however in its current version the model has certain limitations that should be taken into account in future research if changes in land use were not only incremental but more substantial giving rise to a completely different agroecosystem the assumption made about maintaining the same set of energy flows per land cover that in the current situation would no longer be acceptable the e lo optimization is not taking into account whether the land use changes arising from its optimization are feasible or adequate considering other constrains e g slopes soil textures and capacities or being placed in flood zones for the same reason e lo modelling is not fit to explore the synergies and trade offs involved in changing the pattern of energy and material flows interlinking the agroecosystem funds involved accounting them in the appropriate different units it does not allow to connect land and livestock uses with dietary changes in the consumers food baskets all these limitations means that while being a useful tool to help land use planes to make better decisions aimed at improving the landscape capacity to provide ecosystem services to metropolitan areas e lo cannot deliver yet scenarios of systemic changes such as scaling up organic farming into agroecological territories 4 conclusions the energy landscape optimization e lo nonlinear model for land use planning developed in this paper can be of great importance for an agro ecological transition in the barcelona metropolitan area and by extension to other metropolis of the world the application of e lo in specific land use policies combined with an agroecological transition can contribute to reduce the dependence on non renewable resources and therefore to climate change mitigation as well as promoting the conservation of complex landscapes maintained through a more circular economy which can promote the preservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services the results of the e lo modelling presented in this paper allow us to propose different land use configurations taking into account the associated socio metabolic balances and the related landscape functional structures with the aim of accomplishing different societal objectives we have tested fruitfully three different objectives i to increase biodiversity and ecosystem services s1 ii to increase agricultural production s2 and iii to minimize dependence in non renewable external inputs s3 according to these objectives and introducing several constrains in the settings we have obtained the best land use metabolism combinations which is a useful method for calculating sustainable lucc scenarios this integrated analysis is appropriate for assessing complex socioecological systems to advance towards the new green infrastructure paradigm promoting alternative agroecosystem management and a systemic landscape planning in metropolitan areas the results of the e lo modelling show i in s1 organic agriculture practically doubles the increase of energy landscape integration elia as a proxy of biodiversity compared with conventional agriculture in different land cover change scenarios and therefore underlines the importance of an agro ecological transition for biodiversity conservation however it results as well in an increase of non renewable external inputs einr ii in s2 the increase in agrarian production fp is also supported by an equivalent increase in einr which is not good news in terms of agrarian sustainability iii in s3 while the decrease in einr for conventional agriculture is related with the fall on fp in organic agriculture the decrease in einr is much higher but with certain increase in fp consequently there is room for an agro ecological transition and climate change mitigation without compromising the socio economic viability the proposed methodology should be validated in the field and incorporate other constrains into the model to be more site specific and improve the model results depending on the scope of study where it is intended to be applied e g including slope fertile areas for agriculture protected natural spaces or sectors with approved urban planning in the parametric analysis the scenarios could be considered in a more refined grid of values of land cover and metabolic changes in order to see for instance in which point the direction of changes of some variables are altered taking into account the others the transition costs of increasing land cover and metabolic changes should be considered to make more informative decisions about these parameters finally further research will improve the optimization model in a more geographical way by means of the spatially implicit or explicit models e g using cellular automata in order to specify the best locations for land use change to maximize the closure of metabolic flows circular economy this research proposal would become a very important

24804,rapid population growth and urban expansion in metropolitan areas have led to a dramatic increase in food demand in most cases urban sprawl occurs in unplanned ways forcing peri urban agriculture to adopt detrimental practices for biodiversity conservation and metabolic efficiency i e landscape homogenization and dependence on non renewable external inputs facing the food biodiversity dilemma in order to ameliorate these negative effects over the metropolitan socioecological system researchers have focused on developing comprehensive indicators to support sustainable urban expansion in metropolitan areas in this paper we use these indicators to develop an energy landscape optimization e lo a nonlinear model designed for land use planning by means of considering biophysical constraints then we test the model in a representative mediterranean bio cultural landscape in the barcelona metropolitan area spain the e lo results allow us to propose different land use configurations for both conventional and organic agriculture taking into account the associated socio metabolic balances and the related landscape functional structures with the aim to meet different societal objectives we have fruitfully tested three settings i to increase conditions to host farm associated biodiversity ii to increase agricultural production and iii to minimize dependence on non renewable external inputs according to these socioecological objectives we have obtained the best landscape metabolism integration which is a useful methodology for sustainable land use policy this socioecological perspective is necessary for the new paradigm on agroecosystem management and landscape planning and can help advancing towards functional green infrastructures in metropolitan areas especially in the climate change and agroecological transition global context keywords energy landscape integrated analysis landscape agro ecology land use policy agro ecological transition optimisation modelling 1 introduction global human driven land use and cover change lucc have spread the so called anthropogenic habitats in many regions of the world thus determining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in human transformed landscapes for centuries as in the mediterranean grove and rackham 2001 however increasing landscape transformation linked to fuel energy consumption giampietro et al 2013 have driven to unprecedented levels of affectation of ecosystem functioning at landscape and regional scales sterling and ducharne 2008 ellis et al 2008 the past century was witness to particularly severe lucc which affected habitat and biodiversity conservation newbold et al 2015 un ipbes 2019 these effects lead to biotic homogenization in most human transformed regions like metropolitan areas mckinney 2006 in any case human transformed landscapes are the outcome of a shifting interplay between spatial patterns of land use types their associated ecological processes and their socio metabolic energy flows driven by human activity haberl 2001 wrbka et al 2004 the human population has continued growing in the last decades and the huge increase in global food production through increasingly industrialized and globalized production systems has provoked many serious socio ecological impacts and conflicts tilman et al 2002 mayer et al 2015 the dilemma that land use planners and agroecosystem managers are facing today is between increasing the efficiency of land trying to provide the demanded food and products at the cost of losing important features of landscape and trying to keep the sustainability of the agroecosystem which means limiting the production per unit area of land nair 2014 the main strategies to respond to the growing food demand are i to increase production per unit area of land ii to increase the land used for food production one of the most common ways used in industrialized agriculture to increase the production per unit area of land or increasing the efficiency of the land is using fertilizers pesticides and other non renewable inputs although in the short run these options seem desirable the long term effects are disastrous due to the loss in biodiversity soil nutrition and other reproductive characteristics of agroecosystems that we call funds giampietro 1997 hence there is an urgent need for tools that support the designing of sustainable agroecosystems where socioecological goals i e food production biodiversity conservation ecosystem service provisioning are optimized while they operate within a framework of constrained reproductive imperatives padró et al 2019a to solve this food biodiversity dilemma cardinale et al 2012 a deeper research on how landscape ecological functionality is kept in different land use patterns is required according to the quantity and quality of the human disturbance that farmers carry out across the landscape marull et al 2018 the aim of this research is to find optimal scenarios for land use management in the barcelona metropolitan area bma that maximize key reproductive characteristics of agroecosystems padró et al 2019 such are metabolic efficiency landscape ecological functionality biodiversity and associated ecosystem services and also climate change mitigation and adaptation marull et al 2020 padró et al forthcoming to that aim the objective of this paper is to develop an energy landscape optimization e lo nonlinear modelling based on the energy landscape integrated analysis elia marull et al 2016 to find the optimal land uses that lead to a sustainable agroecosystem then we test the e lo model by applying three optimization scenarios in a mediterranean bio cultural landscape of the bma considering different lucc under both conventional and organic agricultural practices the e lo is designed to help land use policy makers and agroecosystem managers to advance towards a socioecological transition taking into account societal priorities and environmental constrains in a human transformed landscape 2 material and methods the methodology considered for the e lo model is based on applying an optimization procedure to the elia marull et al 2016 the latter is a socio metabolic and landscape ecology methodology that brings together landscape patterns and processes and describes how agrarian flows such as energy fertilizers or production are distributed amongst the landscape this tool is particularly useful to represent complex performances of cultural landscapes as human nature co evolutionary systems 2 1 energy landscape integrated analysis elia 2 1 1 agroecosystem energy flows from a landscape ecology standpoint elia summarizes human coproduction with nature marull et al 2016 through the connection between energy flows fig 1 coming from solar radiation through the photosynthesis vertical axis and coming from outside the landscape left side of the horizontal axis both energy flows interact across a landscape functional structure to give rise to a final product extracted from it right side of the horizontal axis the elia graph expresses this network of energy flows across the agroecosystem which are partially recirculating internally to keep its own reproduction and partially open externally to sustain the agri food chains of human society β i s are the incoming outgoing energy flows coefficients the phytomass obtained from solar radiation through autotrophic production by plants is the actual net primary production nppact vitousek et al 1986 the biomass included in nppact that becomes available for heterotrophic species splits into unharvested biomass ub and the share of net primary production harvested by farmers npph ub generally remains in the same place where it has been originally growing and can feed farm associated biodiversity it becomes a source of agroecosystem total turnover att which closes the cycle of the natural subsystem fig 1 this natural subsystem allows maintaining the farm associated biodiversity and in turn the nppact again through the trophic net of non domesticated species either aboveground or in the soil such as decomposer organisms npph splits into biomass reused br inside the agroecosystem and farmland final produce ffp that goes outside br is an important flow that remains within the agroecosystem as the farmers investment directly or indirectly addressed to maintain two basic fund elements livestock and soil fertility hence br closes the farmland subsystem fig 1 then br splits into the livestock subsystem fig 1 that goes to feed and bed the domesticated animals as livestock biomass reused lbr which is added to the livestock total inputs lti and farmland biomass reused fbr in turn these flows add up to farmland total inputs fti as seeds green manure and other vegetal fertilizers these energy linkages in the elia graph enable us to see to what extent the land use management is integrated or not within the surrounding agroecosystem afterwards domestic animals perform bioconversions and then the lti is converted into livestock final produce lfp and internal livestock services ls lfp includes a wide range of food and fibre products and ls services include manure together they make up livestock produce and services lps the farmland and livestock subsystems are partially closed within the agroecosystem since they offer a final produce fp to be consumed outside as well as receive external inputs ei therefore ub br and ls regulate the internal flows that lead to a higher or lower internal circularity in the pattern of energy networks of the agroecosystem fig 1 they constitute important flows of recirculating biomass that contribute to the maintenance of the agroecosystem funds landscape processes and associated biodiversity soil fertility and livestock marull et al 2016 the internal circularity of energy flows is kept within the agroecosystem because the outputs of one subsystem serve as inputs for the next subsystem allowing the storage of energy carriers and information within its dissipative structure ho and ulanowicz 2005 there is an exception to this rule though when some energy carriers circulating inside the agroecosystem imply losses as opportunity costs because of farmers mismanagement into what odum 1993 named a resource out of place i e a waste we consider wastes as energy flows that cannot be integrated by farm systems either because they exceed the carrying capacity or they are not correctly disposed for the agroecosystem funds according to societal goals douglas 1966 sometimes a fraction of nppact can be wasted such as crop stubble or tree pruning that are burnt on the field instead of being used as it often was in the past for bedding straw home heating branches or animal feed leaves the same may happen with a fraction of the lps such as dung slurry coming from agro industrial feedlots that is spread out in excess of cropland carrying capacity and finally contaminates the water table if they exist farmland waste fw and livestock waste lw do not contribute to the renewal of the agroecosystem s funds they neither enhance its reproduction nor meet human needs 2 1 2 agroecosystem energy flows and landscape ecology integration elia combines three indicators the energy storage performed through the internal cycles of agroecosystems energy reinvestment e the information embedded in the energy network of flows energy redistribution i and the landscape functional structure energy imprint l the circularity of energy carriers driven by farmers through ub br and ls flows fig 1 is a metric of e and i which contributes to the energy potentially available for trophic chains existing in agroecosystems 2 1 2 1 measuring energy storage as reinvestment of energy cycles e we understand agroecosystem complexity as the differentiation of dissipative structures metabolic cycles allowing for diverse potential ranges in their behaviour tainter 1990 the more complex the space time differentiation of these structures the more energy is stored within a living system ho and ulanowicz 2005 hence higher mean values of even βi s fig 1 entail that agroecosystems are increasing in complexity because the different cycles are coupled to each other and the residence time of the stored energy increases thanks to a greater number of interlinked energy transformations circulating inside accordingly our way of calculating the energy stored e to keep the agroecosystem s funds functioning goes as follows eq 1 1 e β 2 β 4 2 k 1 β 6 β 8 2 k 2 β 10 β 12 2 k 3 k 1 u b u b b r l s k 2 b r u b b r l s k 3 l s u b b r l s where the coefficients k 1 k 2 k 3 account for the share of reusing energy flows that are circulating through each of the three subsystems fig 1 which allows differentiating the agroecosystems fund composition and making their energy patterns comparable e remains within the range 0 1 e close to 0 implies low reuse of energy flows usually associated with industrial farm systems which are highly dissipative and dependant on external inputs e close to 1 implies the existence of internal cycles only usually translating into land abandonment i e loss of cultural landscapes or to a simple extractive use of the land i e foraging or hunting e assesses the amount of all the energy flows that go back inside the agroecosystem when we account for the three subsystems altogether natural farmland and livestock we are adopting a landscape agroecology standpoint this allows linking farming energy analysis with landscape ecology assessment 2 1 2 2 measuring information as complexity of energy flow patterns i agroecosystems have a quantity of information embedded in the network structure through which their reproduction takes place over time this way of information accounting can be seen as a measure of uncertainty or the degree of freedom for the system to behave and evolve prigogine 1996 it is called information message and registers the likelihood of the occurrence of a pair of events passet 1996 ulanowicz 2001 the energy information i is always site specific which becomes an important trait from a cultural standpoint barthel et al 2013 font et al 2020 in general when a balanced agroecosystem registers a decrease of i some important parts of the agroecosystem functioning are then no longer controlled at the landscape level but linked to increasingly globalised agri food chains mcmichael 2011 tello and gonzález de molina 2017 this work used a shannon wiener index adaptation over each pair of βi s fig 1 so that this indicator shows whether the βi s pairs are evenly distributed or not this measure of i accounts for the equi proportionality of pairwise energy flows that exit from each node in every sub process eq 2 2 i 1 6 i 1 12 β i log 2 β i γ f γ l α f α l γ f u b n p p h 2 u b n p p h f w γ l l s l f p 2 l s l f p l w α f f e i r 2 f e i r f e i n r α l l e i r 2 l e i r l e i n r base 2 logarithms are applied as the probability is dichotomous the introduction of the information loss coefficients γf γl ensures that i remains lower than 1 when the agroecosystem presents farm and or livestock waste the coefficients αf αl act as a penalization for the use of non renewable external inputs which entail an internal information loss given that the agroecosystem functioning is no longer self reproductive i values close to 1 are those with an equi distribution of incoming and outgoing energy flows where the information message embedded in the agroecosystem structure is high whereas i values close to 0 mean patterns of probability far from equi distribution which endow less information these lower i values correspond to an industrialised farm system or by contrast to an almost natural turnover with no external inputs and no harvests conversely agroecosystems with i equal to 1 are the ones with equi distributed incoming and outgoing energy flows in each sub process that probably correspond to a mixed farming in which external inputs play a balanced role integrated with local energy recirculation tello et al 2016 therefore e measures the energy reinvested and temporarily stored in the agroecosystem and i assesses how the farmers redistribute this energy in the landscape needless to say the more complex i e internally differentiated and interlinked an agroecosystem is the greater the farming information required to manage it 2 1 2 3 measuring energy imprint as landscape structure l in order to measure the energy imprinted l in the landscape we introduce a land metric we use l to account for landscape heterogeneity which reveals the capacity of differentiated land cover mosaics to circulate the energy flows and offer a range of habitats that sustain biodiversity harper et al 2005 the underlying assumption is that species richness associated with agricultural landscapes depends on both energy availability and landscape heterogeneity measured at scales larger than the farm level loreau et al 2003 eq 3 3 l i 1 k p i log k 1 p i where k is the number of different land covers potential habitats and there are k 1 possible land covers in each unit of analysis we consider that the existence of urban land cover results in a loss of potential habitats thus pi is the proportion of land covers i into every unit of analysis these l values can be seen as a proxy for the spatial insurance of farm associated biodiversity so that species whose populations are disturbed by agriculture can find safe haunts nearby by activating their own dispersal abilities tscharntke et al 2012 2 1 2 4 measuring the energy landscape integrated analysis elia after having defined the three elia indicators e i and l we are going to analyse their relationship we surmise that the interplay between e and i jointly leads to complexity understood as a balanced level of intermediate self organisation gershenson and fernández 2012 we assume that the agroecosystems complexity of energy flows e i are related to more heterogeneous landscapes where the ecological patterns and processes that sustain farm associated biodiversity become stronger marull et al 2016 therefore elia combines the agro ecological landscape functional structure with the complexity of the interlinking pattern of energy flows as a proxy for the agroecosystem s biodiversity marull et al 2019 eq 4 4 e l i a e i l m a x e i a 1 3 where e is the energy storage i is the information carried by the network structure of energy flows and l is the heterogeneity of land covers seen as the energy imprint in the landscape structure the equilibrated m a x e i e 0 6169 k i 1 3 implies subsystems equilibrium and no waste when there is no such equilibrium the absolute m a x e i a 0 7420 k i 1 even though this last combination is unlikely in an agroecosystem it is possible in a theoretical mathematic case hence elia theoretically ranges from 0 to 1 for any value of the parameters considered in order to understand the relationship between the stored energy e the information it contains i and its imprint on the landscape l we have to consider a three dimensional model elia can be interpreted in the sense that it is culture which allows farmers to manage the energy entering the system to meet their needs and goals while taking care of the agroecosystem funds reproduction and biodiversity conservation marull et al 2019 this calls for an integrated research of coupled human natural systems aimed at revealing the functioning of complex structures and processes liu et al 2007 2 2 energy landscape optimization e lo 2 2 1 case study databases this work uses data of land covers and the associated energy flows of sant climent de llobregat fig 2 a rural municipality of the bma this municipality has been chosen because it consists of a complex land matrix land use mosaic that can be a good representative of the mediterranean bio cultural landscapes land covers are classified into 13 categories namely orchards greenhouses dry herbaceous crops irrigated herbaceous crops dry fruit trees irrigated fruit trees dry olive trees vineyards scrubs grazing areas flat leaved forests coniferous forests and urban areas the land cover thematic map 2015 used in this study have been provided by creaf https www creaf uab es mcsc for each current land cover the surface in hectares covered by each category is given we call this parameter xi currentcover which is an array of size i 13 and defines the input land use pattern to be modified for each land cover there is a set of energy flows coming from the socio metabolic pattern of the municipality marull et al 2020 metabolic flows are calculated from land cover and farming databases on agriculture

idescat https www idescat cat lang es data on agricultural machinery according to their ownership have been used to simulate organic agriculture scenarios we have followed the ccpae recommendations http www ccpae org index php option com frontpage itemid 1 lang en see table 1 2 2 2 energy flows definition the energy flows are essentially the nodes of the elia graph previously seen in fig 1 in fact we have the values for 12 of the primary flows while the values of the other 10 flows are calculated using the elia graph for this reason two sets of variables are considered for these flows namely e j 1 for the so called primary flows and e k 2 for secondary flows with j 1 13 and k 1 10 it could be confusing to see that j is ranging from 1 to 13 instead of 12 the reason is that in the data there are two variables considered for livestock biomass reused lbr1 and lbr2 the former is the biomass that farmland subsystem makes available to be used in the livestock subsystem seen from the farmland standpoint as the share of npph devoted to livestock while the latter is the biomass that is required for the livestock subsystem seen from the livestock standpoint as the share of total requirements coming from the agroecosystem in this sense it is useful to consider them separately and as one of the possible constraints make them have equal values so that the amount of biomass reused br requirements of livestock match with the production of farmland for this purpose from this socio metabolic pattern we calculate the metabolic flows j for each land use i this parameter is called d i j using this parameter the variables e j 1 can be obtained as e j 1 i 1 15 x i d i j also e k 2 can be obtained using the relations seen in the elia graph fig 1 from e j 1 the summary of

the last set of variables we consider in our modelling are the constant values that measure the system or subsystems in one way or another and in the end they all contribute to one of our main indicators these variables include the coefficients βl l 1 2 13 k1 k2 k3 γf γl αf αl the indicators e i l and finally elia 2 2 3 formulation departing from the variables xi land covers i 1 2 13 e j 1

lowerboundi xi upperboundi in principle these bounds can have any value according to the unique situations of land cover i xi and if detailed studies are done in this regard exact values can be used we assume that each xi with the specific characteristics that they have i 1 15 x i i 1 15 c u r r e n t c o v e r i can be changed to a certain range with respect to the currentcoveri thus we have considered these bounds to be of the form lowerboundi 1 landchangei currentcoveri upperboundi 1 landchangei currentcoveri in addition landchangei can be specified according to the properties of xi but with the available data these landchangei values are considered later on a parametric analysis is conducted in which we change landchangei except x 13 urban areas to analyse the way they might affect the optimization solution different objective functions that we consider for non linear models are elia first setting fp second setting and einr third setting then we implement the settings for both conventional and organic agriculture which are characterized by different patterns of energy flows for each land use d i j 2 2 4 implementation different optimization tools are tested to implement the model using data from the sant climent de llobregat case study torabi 2019 we have used the algorithms from the general algebraic modelling system gams https www gams com constrained optimization by linear approximation cobyla powell 2007 and improved stochastic ranking evolution strategy isres runarsson and yao 2005 the last two through its implementation in the open source c library of nonlinear programming algorithms nlopt https nlopt readthedocs io the conopt procedure in gams is essentially based in the generalized reduced gradient method abadie and carpentier 1969 fletcher 1987 with some pre processing that helps reducing the dimension of the model cobyla relies on linear approximations of objective function and constrains combined with a trust region kind of step choice finally isres is an evolutionary population based heuristic algorithm we consider three different settings for objective functions and constraints each one following a specific goal while trying to consider other restrictions in order to keep the balance between variables to compare the results obtained from the different optimization tools we observe the following for each setting first setting maximize elia while maintaining at least a certain percentage of the current final produce e 10 2 fpchange e 10 c u r r e n t 2 cobyla algorithm results in a solution with the highest value for the objective function as well as being feasible however the values for all the related variables in the best solution obtained by cobyla are very close to the solution obtained by gams considering the fact that gams is faster than running the c program using cobyla we can say the results obtained by gams are acceptable second setting maximize final produce e 10 2 while the indicators e and i do not decrease more than a certain percentage of the current amount e echange ecurrent and i ichange icurrent contrary to the previous case none of the methods have resulted in a superior solution in all aspects on one side in the sense of obtaining the most significant value for the objective function it seems that isres produces best results however first and second constraints are not met in this solution making it infeasible on the contrary the results obtained from cobyla and gams are very close and are feasible third setting minimize non renewable external inputs e 6 1 e 8 1 while the indicator l is maintained at least to a certain percentage of the current value l lchange lcurrent the best solutions are given by cobyla algorithm with the least value for objective function as well as being a feasible solution the explanations given for the previous case about the differences between cobyla and gams results hold here too considering this preliminary analysis the conopt algorithm implemented in gams is used in the research torabi 2019 because it was found that the supplying different initial point to cobyla may lead to different final points the difference between cobyla and gams in the optimal values found is very small and the execution of gams is faster than the c program using the cobyla implementation of the nlopt library in this paper we aim at analysing the effects that changing the parameters specifically landchangei may have on the results of each setting the values of landchangei were considered to be 10 20 30 40 and 50 of land cover change for both conventional and organic agriculture typologies in annex c we present an example of the model syntax table 4c 3 results and discussion in order to see the effect of landchangei on the optimization scenarios fig 3 a and fig 4 a can be used as a reference for conventional and organic agriculture respectively showing how land covers have changed with respect to the currentcoveri in both agricultural typologies these land cover changes and l can be seen in tables a3 and b3 cs is the current scenario conventional agriculture s0 considers the same land cover structure than the current scenario but supposing a full organic agriculture transition according to the ccpae recommendations table 1 s1 corresponds to the first setting maximizing elia while maintaining at least 90 of fp s2 is the second setting maximizing fp while e and i do not decrease more than 10 of the current amount s3 is the third setting minimizing einr while l is maintained at least to a 90 of the current value for all settings e lo applies to 10 20 30 40 and 50 of land cover change for both agricultural typologies fig 3b and fig 4b show the results of s1 s2 and s3 in terms of elia fp and einr in conventional and organic agriculture tables a1 and b1 show the energy flows and e and tables a2 and b2 show the energy coefficients and i 3 1 optimizing biodiversity conservation the first setting s1 is designed to maximize the energy landscape integration elia variable that has been related recently with biodiversity birds and butterflies and associated ecosystem services in mediterranean bio cultural landscapes marull et al 2019 in conventional agriculture s1 shows a slight increase on elia values fig 3b passing from 1 0 to 2 7 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table a3 except coniferous forests from 39 67 in cs to 23 35 and in less proportion greenhouses from 0 03 in cs to 0 01 and irrigated herbaceous crops from 0 51 in cs to 0 35 the moderate increase in elia values first produces an increase and then a gradual reduction in fp and a constant increase in einr when the model passes from 10 to 50 of land cover change fig 3b this increase in elia values is higher in organic agriculture fig 4b passing from 2 4 to 5 3 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 again all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table a3 except coniferous forests from 39 67 in cs to 20 58 and in less proportion greenhouses from 0 03 in cs to 0 01 the increase in elia values produces an increase in fp and einr when the model passes from 10 to 50 of land cover change fig 3b the reason for the slight increase of elia values in s1 is because the sant climent de llobregat municipality represents a mediterranean well structured land cover mosaic fig 2 and then there is a limited potential to improve landscape complexity compared to the average value for the whole bma st climent de llobregat doubles the elia value marull et al forthcoming however the model prioritizes the balancing of land covers mainly reducing the more abundant coniferous forests category in order to increase l fig 3b and 4b rather than reducing e and i see tables a1 b1 a2 and b2 and this is the reason that explains the increase of non renewable external inputs einr this agroecosystem dysfunction could be corrected including some constrains in the model i e limiting the dependence on einr in this sense it is interesting to note that organic agriculture practically doubles the increase of elia values of conventional agriculture in the different land cover change scenarios fig 5 and therefore it underlines the importance of an agro ecological transition for biodiversity conservation 3 2 optimizing agrarian productivity the second setting s2 is designed to maximize the agrarian productivity fp parameter that could attain higher values in organic than in conventional agriculture in europe even in economic terms van der ploeg et al 2019 in conventional agriculture s2 shows an important increase on fp fig 3b passing from 7 6 to 37 8 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table a3 except scrubs from 17 42 in cs to 8 70 grazing areas from 2 03 in cs to 1 01 and flat leaved forests from 16 52 in cs to 8 25 that are those more extensive areas the major increase in area is produced in dry fruit trees from 16 88 in cs to 25 31 and coniferous forests from 39 67 in cs to 48 03 the latter being just the opposite trend than in s1 table a3 the increase in fp values is much higher in organic agriculture fig 4b passing from 95 1 to 157 0 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table b3 except scrubs from 17 42 in cs to 8 70 grazing areas from 2 03 in cs to 1 01 and flat leaved forests from 16 52 in cs to 8 25 therefore behaving similarly to conventional agriculture it is important to take into account that this increase in fp values is associated to the disappearing of waste fw in fruit trees associated to the burning of pruning therefore the greatest part of this change when it is compared to conventional scenarios is due to these woody by products probably the notable increase in dry fruit trees guarantees the maximum fp in both conventional and organic agriculture while coniferous forests contributes to maintain certain levels of energy reinvestment e and redistribution i tables a1 b1 a2 and b2 however the fp increase in s2 is supported through an increase in non renewable external inputs einr which is not good news in terms of agrarian sustainability 3 3 optimizing climate change mitigation the third setting s3 is designed to minimize the dependence of non renewable external inputs einr parameter that is directly related with agrarian greenhouse gas emissions and then with climate change mitigation aguilera et al 2015 in conventional agriculture e1 shows an important decrease on einr fig 3b passing from 9 9 to 49 3 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories decrease their area in percentage table a3 except scrubs from 17 42 in cs to 26 15 and flat leaved forests from 16 52 in cs to 24 80 for organic agriculture the initial value for the current scenario s0 is already 20 being lower than for conventional then the decrease in einr values is higher in organic agriculture fig 4b passing from 26 9 to 58 8 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 all land cover categories increase their area in percentage table b3 except scrubs and grazing areas in the same proportion than conventional agriculture the important decrease in einr observed in s3 for conventional agriculture is comparable with the fall on fp which means a non desirable solution in socioeconomic terms and the claim for another model of agriculture the good news is that for organic agriculture the decrease in einr is much more higher than in conventional agriculture but with an interesting difference while in conventional agriculture fp passes from a decrease of 7 4 to 37 2 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 in organic agriculture fp passes from an increase of 64 3 to 2 6 for a land cover change of 10 and 50 respectively fig 5 consequently there is room for an agro ecological transition and climate change mitigation and adaptation without compromising the socio economic viability of farm systems in metropolitan areas 3 4 limitation of the model the main purpose of the e lo model is to assess how the capacity of the agricultural landscapes to provide regulatory and cultural ecosystem services can be improved while at the same time maintaining o increasing local agri food production a provisioning ecosystem service and reducing agricultural dependence on non renewable external inputs this is a very useful assessment for land use planners to make decisions however in its current version the model has certain limitations that should be taken into account in future research if changes in land use were not only incremental but more substantial giving rise to a completely different agroecosystem the assumption made about maintaining the same set of energy flows per land cover that in the current situation would no longer be acceptable the e lo optimization is not taking into account whether the land use changes arising from its optimization are feasible or adequate considering other constrains e g slopes soil textures and capacities or being placed in flood zones for the same reason e lo modelling is not fit to explore the synergies and trade offs involved in changing the pattern of energy and material flows interlinking the agroecosystem funds involved accounting them in the appropriate different units it does not allow to connect land and livestock uses with dietary changes in the consumers food baskets all these limitations means that while being a useful tool to help land use planes to make better decisions aimed at improving the landscape capacity to provide ecosystem services to metropolitan areas e lo cannot deliver yet scenarios of systemic changes such as scaling up organic farming into agroecological territories 4 conclusions the energy landscape optimization e lo nonlinear model for land use planning developed in this paper can be of great importance for an agro ecological transition in the barcelona metropolitan area and by extension to other metropolis of the world the application of e lo in specific land use policies combined with an agroecological transition can contribute to reduce the dependence on non renewable resources and therefore to climate change mitigation as well as promoting the conservation of complex landscapes maintained through a more circular economy which can promote the preservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services the results of the e lo modelling presented in this paper allow us to propose different land use configurations taking into account the associated socio metabolic balances and the related landscape functional structures with the aim of accomplishing different societal objectives we have tested fruitfully three different objectives i to increase biodiversity and ecosystem services s1 ii to increase agricultural production s2 and iii to minimize dependence in non renewable external inputs s3 according to these objectives and introducing several constrains in the settings we have obtained the best land use metabolism combinations which is a useful method for calculating sustainable lucc scenarios this integrated analysis is appropriate for assessing complex socioecological systems to advance towards the new green infrastructure paradigm promoting alternative agroecosystem management and a systemic landscape planning in metropolitan areas the results of the e lo modelling show i in s1 organic agriculture practically doubles the increase of energy landscape integration elia as a proxy of biodiversity compared with conventional agriculture in different land cover change scenarios and therefore underlines the importance of an agro ecological transition for biodiversity conservation however it results as well in an increase of non renewable external inputs einr ii in s2 the increase in agrarian production fp is also supported by an equivalent increase in einr which is not good news in terms of agrarian sustainability iii in s3 while the decrease in einr for conventional agriculture is related with the fall on fp in organic agriculture the decrease in einr is much higher but with certain increase in fp consequently there is room for an agro ecological transition and climate change mitigation without compromising the socio economic viability the proposed methodology should be validated in the field and incorporate other constrains into the model to be more site specific and improve the model results depending on the scope of study where it is intended to be applied e g including slope fertile areas for agriculture protected natural spaces or sectors with approved urban planning in the parametric analysis the scenarios could be considered in a more refined grid of values of land cover and metabolic changes in order to see for instance in which point the direction of changes of some variables are altered taking into account the others the transition costs of increasing land cover and metabolic changes should be considered to make more informative decisions about these parameters finally further research will improve the optimization model in a more geographical way by means of the spatially implicit or explicit models e g using cellular automata in order to specify the best locations for land use change to maximize the closure of metabolic flows circular economy this research proposal would become a very important analytical advance linking ecological economics biophysical accounting with landscape ecology land use patterns and processes in the design of metropolitan green infrastructures able to maintain
