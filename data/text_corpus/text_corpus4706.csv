particular as for the cooperation operations by multiple floating vessels not only the hydrodynamic interactions but also mechanical interactions from various mooring lines and fenders should be taken

developed a time domain analysis program for floating crane vessel systems they investigated the effect of heave compensator during lowering operation of subsea equipment in this study a series of model tests were carried out to study the mating operations of a topside module onto a flng by using a floating crane the model tests were performed in ocean engineering basin at kriso with a model set up of 1 45 scale ratio the floating crane vessel was equipped with a crane system and dynamic positioning system the topside module was simplified as a rectangular box of about 2000 tonf four leg mating units lmus were introduced to model the interface units between the flng and the topside module while the interaction forces between the crane vessel and the topside module are transferred via the crane wires the topside module interacts with the flng through the lmus experimental conditions include four mating stages i e 0 20 50 and 93 load transfers in regular and irregular waves to validate the experimental results a time domain numerical simulation is applied to solve the coupled dynamics of three bodies the discussions were made on three main points first the motion

experimental models in this study a series of model tests were carried out to study the mating operations of a topside module by a floating crane three experimental models i e a floating crane vessel a flng and a topside module were used together fig 1 shows the experimental models the floating crane vessel shown in fig 1 a is 110 m in length and 48 m in breadth it is equipped with crane and dynamic positioning system a winch system is installed on the deck for the hoisting operation during the tests crane boom angles were fixed as 57deg the flng shown in fig 1 c is 170 m in length 65 m in breadth and 11 m in depth the weight of the flng is about 50 000 ton in the model test the flng was positioned with soft spring mooring system in which four soft springs were attached to the vessel to prevent the excessive drift motion the connection points of the soft springs are both ends of the vessel centerline and the spring mooring length is about 2 2 times of the vessel length shown in fig 7 the spring constant was selected so that the sway natural period of the flng becomes about 100 s the topside module is modelled as a rectangular box with 24 m in length 15 m in breadth and 5 m in depth shown in fig 1 b the weight of the topside module is about 10 of weight of the floating crane vessel table 1 summarizes the principal dimensions of the experimental models in the model test the test models are scaled down with the ratio of 1 45 the experimental models are made of wood the model tests were performed in ocean engineering basin at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso fig 2 shows the experimental arrangement of the models 2 2 interface units and measurement the interaction forces between the crane vessel and the topside module are transferred via the crane wires during the mating stages the topside module interacts with the flng through four lmus in order to measure the wire tensions directly in the model test the load cells were attached to the pulley system on the crane frame shown in fig 3 a the installation location of the topside module is assumed at the center of the flng four leg mating units lmus shown in fig 3 b were introduced to model the interface units between the flng and the topside module lmu has the stabbing cone of concave shape that prevents the horizontal motion of the topside module after the load transfer in this study a linear compressive spring is used to model the dynamic characteristics of the lmus however it is noteworthy that lmu generally has nonlinear stiffness characteristics thus nonlinear or bi linear modeling can be used in the numerical analysis for the accurate mating operation in the test the motions of the vessels and the module are measured by non contact optical motion measurement system fig 3 shows the interface items and measurement equipment 2 3 experimental conditions the model tests were carried out at four different mating stages as summarized in table 2 in this study the mating stages are defined by the load transfer delivered to the lmus for example load transfer 20 means that the four lmus support 20 of total module weight while the crane wires are lifting 80 of the module weight the load transfer 0 indicates that the whole weight of the lifted module is lifted via the crane wires only which means the module is lifted above the lmus without contact fig 4 shows the snapshots for the experimental setting of 0 and 50 mating stages during the test the weight distributions between the wires and the lmus are adjusted by the crane winch system in this study the model tests were performed both in regular and irregular waves in case of the regular waves the wave heights are fixed as 1 5 m and the wave periods range from 5 0 s to 16 0 s as for the irregular waves ittc spectrum is used and the significant wave height is fixed as 1 0 m wave peak periods range from 5 50 s to 12 12 s the wave spectra are shown in fig 5 it should be noted that the wave heading angles are defined with respect to the flng shown in fig 6 this study focuses on the test results of 180 wave heading in this case the flng is located in head sea and the crane vessel in beam sea 3 numerical analysis 3 1 equation of motion in this study a time domain numerical simulation method is applied to solve the mating operations involved with two floating bodies and a lifted object as shown in eq 1 the time domain coupled motion equation has been derived to describe complicated motion responses of the crane vessel flng and the heavy topside module 1 m 1 a 11 a 12 0 a 21 m

current forces should be included in the equation of motions 3 2 hydrodynamic forces the retardation function physically corresponds to the response of a floating body under unit impulsive velocity the formulas for the retardation function and infinite added mass are given by 2 r i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 ω a i j ω a i j sin ω t d ω 3 a i j ω a i j 1 ω 0 r i j t sin ω t d t where r i

the retardation function and infinite frequency added mass can be computed using damping coefficient and added mass in the present study the added mass and damping coefficients are obtained from frequency domain hydrodynamic analysis in which the wave green function and higher order boundary element method hobem are adopted to solve the boundary value problem of multiple floating bodies choi

forces are obtained from frequency domain diffraction analysis using higher order boundary element method choi et al 2000 show that the second order forces acting on the floating bodies converges well by using the higher order boundary element method in this study newman s approximation is adopted to compute the wave drift forces efficiently 3 3 crane wire and lmu the crane wire is modelled as an elongation linear spring tether in the numerical simulations the tether is a simple elastic line which only has axial stiffness with its unstretched length the tension of the crane wire can be calculated from the linear relation between wire elongation and axial stiffness see eq 6 6 t e a l l 0 l 0 i f l l 0 0 i f l l 0 where t is the wire tension and e a is the axial stiffness of the crane wire in this study e a is set as about 3 10 6 k n l and l 0 are the instantaneous and unstretched length of the crane wire respectively similarly the lmu force can be modelled as a linear compressive spring the vertical and horizontal components of the reaction force of the lmus can be computed by following relation see eq 7 7 f v k v r r 0 n z i f r r 0 n z 0 0 o t h e r w i s e f h k h l h where f v and f h are the vertical and horizontal components of the reaction force of the lmu respectively k v and k h are the vertical and horizontal stiffness of the lmu respectively in this study k v and k h are 1 10 4 k n and 5 10 3 k n respectively 4 results discussions 4 1 motion responses in regular waves the motion raos of the floating crane vessel and the flng at 0 load transfer are shown in fig 8 in this study the motion raos are evaluated from regular wave and white noise tests what is noticeable here is that the floating crane vessel shows two peak responses in roll motion shown in fig 8 a the higher peak at around 0 55 rad s indicates the roll resonance of the floating crane vessel itself at that point maximum roll motion of the floating crane vessel is about 8 per unit wave amplitude fig 9 shows the photos at the roll resonance of the crane vessel it can be seen that the crane vessel experiences relatively large roll motion compared to the flng the other peak at around 0 3 rad s is caused by the pendulum resonance of the lifted topside module which is a function of the module weight and the crane wire length the roll and pitch raos of the flng are shown in fig 8 b although the flng meets the waves in head sea it can be clearly seen that roll motions are induced by the hydrodynamic interaction between the floating crane vessel and the flng the roll resonance of the flng is located around 0 8 rad s the pitch motion of the flng is slightly bigger than that of the crane vessel the agreement between experiments and numerical simulations is fairly good in particular the numerical simulations also clearly show two peak responses of the roll motion rao of the crane vessel it is well known that the motions of the lifted object are dominantly affected by the motion of the crane tip fig 10 shows the motion raos of the module at the load transfer of 0 the numerical simulation results are plotted together the motion raos from the numerical simulations agree well with the experimental results again it can be observed that two peak responses occur in sway and roll motions of the module due to the interaction effect between the lifted module and the crane vessel the higher peak happens at the roll resonant period of the floating crane vessel where the sway motion amplitude of the module is bigger than ten times of the incident wave amplitude at that time roll motion of the module is about 10 per unit wave amplitude the other peak is caused by the pendulum resonance which is also confirmed from the numerical simulations fig 11 shows the snapshots of the numerical simulations at the pendulum resonance of the module in this figure while the crane vessel seems to be motionless the lifted topside module moves right and left these pendulum resonances can be changed by the crane wire length fig 12 shows the effect of the crane wire length on the module motion from the numerical simulations it can be observed that as the wire length is getting shorter the resonance shifts to the high frequency range interestingly it can be seen that the roll resonance of the crane vessel is also significantly changed due to the crane wire length it means that the overall roll moment of inertia of the crane vessel is greatly affected by the crane wire length fig 13 shows the snapshots of the lifted topside module at 50 load transfer stage in this case due to the module rotational motion it can be expected that the lmu reaction forces on left lmus are bigger than those of right lmus numerical simulations show similar configuration of the topside module fig 14 compares the module motion raos at three different load transfer stages it can be observed that as the load transfer increases the heave and roll motions of the module is getting smaller this is because as the load transfer operation proceeds the constraint forces due to the lmus greatly reduce the motion of the module when the load transfer is 20 the maximum roll amplitude is about 5 5 per unit wave amplitude at the load transfer of 93 the roll motion of the module is less than 2 per unit wave amplitude 4 2 motion responses in irregular waves in order to evaluate the installation performance in irregular waves a series of model tests were carried out with four different wave periods fig 15 shows heave and roll time series of the crane vessel under four irregular wave conditions in this case the load transfer is 50 and the significant wave height is fixed as 1 0 m it can be clearly seen that the heave and roll motions of the crane vessel increase as the wave period increases in particular the roll motion is abruptly increase if the peak wave period is bigger than 9 53 s since the numerical simulations directly make use of the measured incident wave signals the trends of the experiments and calculation results are quite similar both in amplitudes and phases however the simulation results give slight bigger heave and smaller roll motions typical motion response spectra of the crane vessel are suggested in fig 16 small discrepancy are found at peak frequency but the agreements between the experiments and simulations are fairly good again the simulation results give slight bigger heave and smaller roll motion responses fig 17 shows heave time series of the topside module at three load transfer stages numerical simulation results are directly compared with the experiments the agreement between the experiments and numerical simulations is quite reasonable it can be seen that as the load transfer increases the heave motion of the module slightly decrease due to the reaction forces of the lmus the overall statistical values of the module motion responses are compared in fig 18 for all conditions the sway rms values are less than 0 5 m it can be observed that sway motions are maximized at the wave period of 6 93 s and the heave motion increases with the increase of the wave periods when the wave period is 12 12 s and load transfer is 20 the maximum heave rms value is about 0 13 m as the load transfer increases the heave motion of the module slightly decreases at load transfer of 93 the maximum heave rms is about 0 11 m due to the reaction force of lmus the heave motion of the module is reduced in half roll motion also decrease as the load transfer increases when the load transfer is 20 the roll rms value is bigger than 0 9 however at the load transfer of 93 the roll rms is less than 0 4 some discrepancies in roll responses can be found between the numerical simulations and experiments it can be understood that smaller roll motion of the crane vessel results in the smaller roll motion of the topside module as well 4 3 dynamic tension of hoisting wire the transfer functions of the wire tensions are shown in fig 19 it should be noted that only dynamic tension results are presented here and the static wire tensions are subtracted in the statistical analysis what is noticeable here is that the maximum wire tension occurs at the load transfer of 50 where the weight of the topside module is equally distributed to the crane wires and lmus it can be understood that the interactions due to the crane wires and lmus increase the dynamic load of the crane wires the transfer function of the wire tension is maximized up to about 200 tonf per unit wave amplitude the maximum wire tension occurs at the wave frequency of 0 55 rad s when the crane roll resonance happens this means that the large crane roll motion brings about high wire tensions when the load transfer is 0 or 93 the maximum wire dynamic tension is less than 100 tonf per unit wave amplitude the numerical simulations also predict the overall trends of the wire tension similar to the experiments according to the load transfer stages since the wire tensions are dominantly affected by the crane tip motions the transfer functions of wire 1 and wire 3 show similar trends similarly the transfer functions of wire 2 and wire 4 show similar trends as well the dynamic tensions of wire 1 and wire 3 are slightly bigger than those of wire 2 and wire 4 because the wire 2 and wire 4 are located closer to the crane vessel fig 20 shows typical time histories of the wire tensions in irregular waves at two load transfer stages again the transfer functions of wire 1 and wire 3 show similar tendency it can be seen that the tensions of wire 1 and wire 3 are bigger than those of wire 2 and wire 4 because of the location of the crane wires the agreement between the experiments and the numerical simulations is fairly good for the quantitative evaluations of the wire tensions all of the results by the model tests and the numerical simulations in irregular waves were statically summarized in fig 21 based on significant positive amplitudes when the load transfer is 20 and wave period is 12 12 s the topside module sometimes escaped outside lmu due to excessive horizontal motions so the statistical values at that time are not included in the figure regardless of the load transfer stages the wire tensions increase with the increase of the wave periods similar to the regular wave results the wire tensions are maximized at 50 load transfer stage the maximum dynamic tensions are about 200 tonf which is about 10 of the module weight in air in case of the crane wire 1 the agreement between the experiments and the numerical simulations is quite good however the dynamic tensions of the crane wire 2 from the model tests are slightly less than the corresponding numerical simulations in principle the dynamic tension responses of the crane wires are significantly influenced by the crane wire length sling points and the weight distribution of the lifted object in particular small length variation in crane wire can be caused by the experimental error or operational tolerance fig 22 shows the effect of the length variations on the crane wire tensions by using the numerical simulations one of the crane wires is slightly changed in length by 2 and then the tension responses are observed it can be seen that small discrepancy in the wire lengths can cause the significant variations of the wire tensions 4 4 reaction force of lmus transfer functions of the lmu reaction forces are suggested in fig 23 at three load transfer stages the model test results are compared with the numerical simulations in the figure all of the results of the lmu reaction forces are normalized by the maximum static load on the lmu dynamic amplification factor daf is defined like followings 8 d a f 1 f d y n a m i c f s t a t i c the daf value means the ratio between the dynamic load and the static load on the lmu the trends of the dafs of the lmu reaction forces according to the wave periods show similar tendency with the wire tension as shown in fig 19 it can be observed that the lmu reaction forces are maximized at the roll resonant frequencies of the lifted module similar to the wire tension responses the dafs of the lmu reaction forces have largest values at the load transfer of 50 after the module weight is mostly transferred on the lmus the dafs of the lmu reaction forces decrease owing to the relatively small roll motions of the lifted module statistical values of the lmu reaction forces are also summarized based on significant positive amplitudes as shown in fig 24 the lmu reaction forces increase with the increase of the wave peak periods in particular the lmu reactions at the load transfer 20 and 50 stages largely increase when the wave peak period is larger than 9 63 s and at the load transfer 93 stage gradual increases are found as the wave peak period increases likewise the values at the load transfer 50 stage are larger than the values at the other load transfer stages 5 conclusions an experimental and numerical study was conducted for investigating the mating operation of a topside module by a floating crane vessel in waves from a series of model tests and numerical calculations the following conclusions are drawn the lifted topside module shows two peak responses in sway and roll motions due to the interaction effect with the crane vessel the higher peak happens at the roll resonant period of the floating crane vessel while the other peak is caused by the pendulum resonance of the lifted topside module from the numerical simulations it can be shown that as the wire length is getting shorter the pendulum resonance shifts to the high frequency range and the roll resonance of the crane vessel is also significantly changed as the load transfer increases the motion responses of the module are getting smaller because the reaction forces due to the lmus greatly reduce the motion of the module in irregular waves it can be observed that the heave and roll motions of the lifted module as well as the crane vessel increase when the wave period increases the transfer functions of the dynamic wire tension are maximized when the crane roll resonance happens which indicates that the large crane roll motion brings about high wire tensions in addition the maximum dynamic tensions of the crane wires occur at the load transfer of 50 due to the interactions of the lifted module via the hoisting wires and lmus in the irregular waves the maximum dynamic tensions are about 200 tonf based on significant which is about 10 of the module weight in air in addition it can be seen that the dynamic tension responses of the crane wires can be grouped according to the crane tip locations similar to the wire tension responses the lmu reaction forces are maximized when the wave frequency is close to the roll resonant frequencies of the lifted module and the load transfer is 50 acknowledgements this study was partly funded by shi kriso cooperative research

fig 7 the spring constant was selected so that the sway natural period of the flng becomes about 100 s the topside module is modelled as a rectangular box with 24 m in length 15 m in breadth and 5 m in depth shown in fig 1 b the weight of the topside module is about 10 of weight of the floating crane vessel table 1 summarizes the principal dimensions of the experimental models in the model test the test models are scaled down with the ratio of 1 45 the experimental models are made of wood the model tests were performed in ocean engineering basin at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso fig 2 shows the experimental arrangement of the models 2 2 interface units and measurement the interaction forces between the crane vessel and the topside module are transferred via the crane wires during the mating stages the topside module interacts with the flng through four lmus in order to measure the wire tensions directly in the model test the load cells were attached to the pulley system on the crane frame shown in fig 3 a the installation location of the topside module is assumed at the center of the flng four leg mating units lmus shown in fig 3 b were introduced to model the interface units between the flng and the topside module lmu has the stabbing cone of concave shape that prevents the horizontal motion of the topside module after the load transfer in this study a linear compressive spring is used to model the dynamic characteristics of the lmus however it is noteworthy that lmu generally has nonlinear stiffness characteristics thus nonlinear or bi linear modeling can be used in the numerical analysis for the accurate mating operation in the test the motions of the vessels and the module are measured by non contact optical motion measurement system fig 3 shows the interface items and measurement equipment 2 3 experimental conditions the model tests were carried out at four different mating stages as summarized in table 2 in this study the mating stages are defined by the load transfer delivered to the lmus for example load transfer 20 means that the four lmus support 20 of total module weight while the crane wires are lifting 80 of the module weight the load transfer 0 indicates that the whole weight of the lifted module is lifted via the crane wires only which means the module is lifted above the lmus without contact fig 4 shows the snapshots for the experimental setting of 0 and 50 mating stages during the test the weight distributions between the wires and the lmus are adjusted by the crane winch system in this study the model tests were performed both in regular and irregular waves in case of the regular waves the wave heights are fixed as 1 5 m and the wave periods range from 5 0 s to 16 0 s as for the irregular waves ittc spectrum is used and the significant wave height is fixed as 1 0 m wave peak periods range from 5 50 s to 12 12 s the wave spectra are shown in fig 5 it should be noted that the wave heading angles are defined with respect to the flng shown in fig 6 this study focuses on the test results of 180 wave heading in this case the flng is located in head sea and the crane vessel in beam sea 3 numerical analysis 3 1 equation of motion in this study a time domain numerical simulation method is applied to solve the mating operations involved with two floating bodies and a lifted object as shown in eq 1 the time domain coupled motion equation has been derived to describe complicated motion responses of the crane vessel flng and the heavy topside module 1 m 1 a 11 a 12 0 a 21 m

current forces should be included in the equation of motions 3 2 hydrodynamic forces the retardation function physically corresponds to the response of a floating body under unit impulsive velocity the formulas for the retardation function and infinite added mass are given by 2 r i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 ω a i j ω a i j sin ω t d ω 3 a i j ω a i j 1 ω 0 r i j t sin ω t d t where r i

frequency domain hydrodynamic analysis in which the wave green function and higher order boundary element method hobem are adopted to solve the boundary value problem of multiple floating bodies choi

forces are obtained from frequency domain diffraction analysis using higher order boundary element method choi et al 2000 show that the second order forces acting on the floating bodies converges well by using the higher order boundary element method in this study newman s approximation is adopted to compute the wave drift forces efficiently 3 3 crane wire and lmu the crane wire is modelled as an elongation linear spring tether in the numerical simulations the tether is a simple elastic line which only has axial stiffness with its unstretched length the tension of the crane wire can be calculated from the linear relation between wire elongation and axial stiffness see eq 6 6 t e a l l 0 l 0 i f l l 0 0 i f l l 0 where t is the wire tension and e a is the axial stiffness of the crane wire in this study e a is set as about 3 10 6 k n l and l 0 are the instantaneous and unstretched length of the crane wire respectively similarly the lmu force can be modelled as a linear compressive spring the vertical and horizontal components of the reaction force of the lmus can be computed by following relation see eq 7 7 f v k v r r 0 n z i f r r 0 n z 0 0 o t h e r w i s e f h k h l h where f v and f h are the vertical and horizontal components of the reaction force of the lmu respectively k v and k h are the vertical and horizontal stiffness of the lmu respectively in this study k v and k h are 1 10 4 k n and 5 10 3 k n respectively 4 results discussions 4 1 motion responses in regular waves the motion raos of the floating crane vessel and the flng at 0 load transfer are shown in fig 8 in this study the motion raos are evaluated from regular wave and white noise tests what is noticeable here is that the floating crane vessel shows two peak responses in roll motion shown in fig 8 a the higher peak at around 0 55 rad s indicates the roll resonance of the floating crane vessel itself at that point maximum roll motion of the floating crane vessel is about 8 per unit wave amplitude fig 9 shows the photos at the roll resonance of the crane vessel it can be seen that the crane vessel experiences relatively large roll motion compared to the flng the other peak at around 0 3 rad s is caused by the pendulum resonance of the lifted topside module which is a function of the module weight and the crane wire length the roll and pitch raos of the flng are shown in fig 8 b although the flng meets the waves in head sea it can be clearly seen that roll motions are induced by the hydrodynamic interaction between the floating crane vessel and the flng the roll resonance of the flng is located around 0 8 rad s the pitch motion of the flng is slightly bigger than that of the crane vessel the agreement between experiments and numerical simulations is fairly good in particular the numerical simulations also clearly show two peak responses of the roll motion rao of the crane vessel it is well known that the motions of the lifted object are dominantly affected by the motion of the crane tip fig 10 shows the motion raos of the module at the load transfer of 0 the numerical simulation results are plotted together the motion raos from the numerical simulations agree well with the experimental results again it can be observed that two peak responses occur in sway and roll motions of the module due to the interaction effect between the lifted module and the crane vessel the higher peak happens at the roll resonant period of the floating crane vessel where the sway motion amplitude of the module is bigger than ten times of the incident wave amplitude at that time roll motion of the module is about 10 per unit wave amplitude the other peak is caused by the pendulum resonance which is also confirmed from the numerical simulations fig 11 shows the snapshots of the numerical simulations at the pendulum resonance of the module in this figure while the crane vessel seems to be motionless the lifted topside module moves right and left these pendulum resonances can be changed by the crane wire length fig 12 shows the effect of the crane wire length on the module motion from the numerical simulations it can be observed that as the wire length is getting shorter the resonance shifts to the high frequency range interestingly it can be seen that the roll resonance of the crane vessel is also significantly changed due to the crane wire length it means that the overall roll moment of inertia of the crane vessel is greatly affected by the crane wire length fig 13 shows the snapshots of the lifted topside module at 50 load transfer stage in this case due to the module rotational motion it can be expected that the lmu reaction forces on left lmus are bigger than those of right lmus numerical simulations show similar configuration of the topside module fig 14 compares the module motion raos at three different load transfer stages it can be observed that as the load transfer increases the heave and roll motions of the module is getting smaller this is because as the load transfer operation proceeds the constraint forces due to the lmus greatly reduce the motion of the module when the load transfer is 20 the maximum roll amplitude is about 5 5 per unit wave amplitude at the load transfer of 93 the roll motion of the module is less than 2 per unit wave amplitude 4 2 motion responses in irregular waves in order to evaluate the installation performance in irregular waves a series of model tests were carried out with four different wave periods fig 15 shows heave and roll time series of the crane vessel under four irregular wave conditions in this case the load transfer is 50 and the significant wave height is fixed as 1 0 m it can be clearly seen that the heave and roll motions of the crane vessel increase as the wave period increases in particular the roll motion is abruptly increase if the peak wave period is bigger than 9 53 s since the numerical simulations directly make use of the measured incident wave signals the trends of the experiments and calculation results are quite similar both in amplitudes and phases however the simulation results give slight bigger heave and smaller roll motions typical motion response spectra of the crane vessel are suggested in fig 16 small discrepancy are found at peak frequency but the agreements between the experiments and simulations are fairly good again the simulation results give slight bigger heave and smaller roll motion responses fig 17 shows heave time series of the topside module at three load transfer stages numerical simulation results are directly compared with the experiments the agreement between the experiments and numerical simulations is quite reasonable it can be seen that as the load transfer increases the heave motion of the module slightly decrease due to the reaction forces of the lmus the overall statistical values of the module motion responses are compared in fig 18 for all conditions the sway rms values are less than 0 5 m it can be observed that sway motions are maximized at the wave period of 6 93 s and the heave motion increases with the increase of the wave periods when the wave period is 12 12 s and load transfer is 20 the maximum heave rms value is about 0 13 m as the load transfer increases the heave motion of the module slightly decreases at load transfer of 93 the maximum heave rms is about 0 11 m due to the reaction force of lmus the heave motion of the module is reduced in half roll motion also decrease as the load transfer increases when the load transfer is 20 the roll rms value is bigger than 0 9 however at the load transfer of 93 the roll rms is less than 0 4 some discrepancies in roll responses can be found between the numerical simulations and experiments it can be understood that smaller roll motion of the crane vessel results in the smaller roll motion of the topside module as well 4 3 dynamic tension of hoisting wire the transfer functions of the wire tensions are shown in fig 19 it should be noted that only dynamic tension results are presented here and the static wire tensions are subtracted in the statistical analysis what is noticeable here is that the maximum wire tension occurs at the load transfer of 50 where the weight of the topside module is equally distributed to the crane wires and lmus it can be understood that the interactions due to the crane wires and lmus increase the dynamic load of the crane wires the transfer function of the wire tension is maximized up to about 200 tonf per unit wave amplitude the maximum wire tension occurs at the wave frequency of 0 55 rad s when the crane roll resonance happens this means that the large crane roll motion brings about high wire tensions when the load transfer is 0 or 93 the maximum wire dynamic tension is less than 100 tonf per unit wave amplitude the numerical simulations also predict the overall trends of the wire tension similar to the experiments according to the load transfer stages since the wire tensions are dominantly affected by the crane tip motions the transfer functions of wire 1 and wire 3 show similar trends similarly the transfer functions of wire 2 and wire 4 show similar trends as well the dynamic tensions of wire 1 and wire 3 are slightly bigger than those of wire 2 and wire 4 because the wire 2 and wire 4 are located closer to the crane vessel fig 20 shows typical time histories of the wire tensions in irregular waves at two load transfer stages again the transfer functions of wire 1 and wire 3 show similar tendency it can be seen that the tensions of wire 1 and wire 3 are bigger than those of wire 2 and wire 4 because of the location of the crane wires the agreement between the experiments and the numerical simulations is fairly good for the quantitative evaluations of the wire tensions all of the results by the model tests and the numerical simulations in irregular waves were statically summarized in fig 21 based on significant positive amplitudes when the load transfer is 20 and wave period is 12 12 s the topside module sometimes escaped outside lmu due to excessive horizontal motions so the statistical values at that time are not included in the figure regardless of the load transfer stages the wire tensions increase with the increase of the wave periods similar to the regular wave results the wire tensions are maximized at 50 load transfer stage the maximum dynamic tensions are about 200 tonf which is about 10 of the module weight in air in case of the crane wire 1 the agreement between the experiments and the numerical simulations is quite good however the dynamic tensions of the crane wire 2 from the model tests are slightly less than the corresponding numerical simulations in principle the dynamic tension responses of the crane wires are significantly influenced by the crane wire length sling points and the weight distribution of the lifted object in particular small length variation in crane wire can be caused by the experimental error or operational tolerance fig 22 shows the effect of the length variations on the crane wire tensions by using the numerical simulations one of the crane wires is slightly changed in length by 2 and then the tension responses are observed it can be seen that small discrepancy in the wire lengths can cause the significant variations of the wire tensions 4 4 reaction force of lmus transfer functions of the lmu reaction forces are suggested in fig 23 at three load transfer stages the model test results are compared with the numerical simulations in the figure all of the results of the lmu reaction forces are normalized by the maximum static load on the lmu dynamic amplification factor daf is defined like followings 8 d a f 1 f d y n a m i c f s t a t i c the daf value means the ratio between the dynamic load and the static load on the lmu the trends of the dafs of the lmu reaction forces according to the wave periods show similar tendency with the wire tension as shown in fig 19 it can be observed that the lmu reaction forces are maximized at the roll resonant frequencies of the lifted module similar to the wire tension responses the dafs of the lmu reaction forces have largest values at the load transfer of 50 after the module weight is mostly transferred on the lmus the dafs of the lmu reaction forces decrease owing to the relatively small roll motions of the lifted module statistical values of the lmu reaction forces are also summarized based on significant positive amplitudes as shown in fig 24 the lmu reaction forces increase with the increase of the wave peak periods in particular the lmu reactions at the load transfer 20 and 50 stages largely increase when the wave peak period is larger than 9 63 s and at the load transfer 93 stage gradual increases are found as the wave peak period increases likewise the values at the load transfer 50 stage are larger than the values at the other load transfer stages 5 conclusions an experimental and numerical study was conducted for investigating the mating operation of a topside module by a floating crane vessel in waves from a series of model tests and numerical calculations the following conclusions are drawn the lifted topside module shows two peak responses in sway and roll motions due to the interaction effect with the crane vessel the higher peak happens at the roll resonant period of the floating crane vessel while the other peak is caused by the pendulum resonance of the lifted topside module from the numerical simulations it can be shown that as the wire length is getting shorter the pendulum resonance shifts to the high frequency range and the roll resonance of the crane vessel is also significantly changed as the load transfer increases the motion responses of the module are getting smaller because the reaction forces due to the lmus greatly reduce the motion of the module in irregular waves it can be observed that the heave and roll motions of the lifted module as well as the crane vessel increase when the wave period increases the transfer functions of the dynamic wire tension are maximized when the crane roll resonance happens which indicates that the large crane roll motion brings about high wire tensions in addition the maximum dynamic tensions of the crane wires occur at the load transfer of 50 due to the interactions of the lifted module via the hoisting wires and lmus in the irregular waves the maximum dynamic tensions are about 200 tonf based on significant which is about 10 of the module weight in air in addition it can be seen that the dynamic tension responses of the crane wires can be grouped according to the crane tip locations similar to the wire tension responses the lmu reaction forces are maximized when the wave frequency is close to the roll resonant frequencies of the lifted module and the load transfer is 50 acknowledgements this study was partly funded by shi kriso cooperative research

23531,a novel method of pipeline pigging is that coiled tubing ct connected with a pig and then ct is injected into the scr to clean up pipelines the ct needs enough axial force so that it would not be stuck in the scr during the pipeline pigging operation to analyze the axial load transfer characteristic paper built the force analysis of the micro element on the straight and curved section amended effective axial force and the friction between the ct and scr and built the mathematical model of scr pipe in pipe system considering impacts of the coiled tubing s buckling the axial force of the random micro section can be calculated through iterative method in order to verify the correctness of the theory the scr pipe in pipe system s indoor platform was built the experimental platform can study different effects which affect the ct s load transfer behavior within the unfixed scr the experimental results of two different phases which inclined angles were 2 0 and 30 0 show that ct s transfer efficiency of axial load is less than 85 0 in scr pipe in pipe system and it will increase with the inclined angle increasing through comparing experimental and theoretical calculation results the mathematical model of scr pipe in pipe system is validated paper calculated the axial force results on the inclined angle 2 0 10 0 18 0 26 0 and 30 0 by the theoretical mechanical model the theoretical calculation results show that the transfer efficiency would increase with the increasing of the inclined angles to ensure more axial force to be transferred to the ct s bottom end the inclined angle should be as big as possible the above research can provide theoretical support to the scr s pigging operation keywords coiled tubing steel catenary riser transfer efficiency of axial load inclined angle 1 introduction the steel catenary riser scr is now the first choice for development of deep water oil huang and li 2006 yang and li 2010 but it is commonly prone to scaling inside the riser which includes silt paraffin asphalt etc tan et al 2015 pipeline pigging which can remove the scaling is the regular operational approach to insure the high transportation efficiency of the scr the pig which is used for pipeline traditional pigging might stick in the scr thus a better way is that a pig can be connected to the coiled tubing ct by a ct injector and then the pig is injected down the scr this system that a ct is in a scr is referred to the scr pipe in pipe system chen et al 2015 fig 1 shows the scheme of the scr pipe in pipe system during pipeline pigging based on ct technology the subsea wellhead and ocean platform are connected by the scr the pig is installed on the ct s bottom end the ct is injected into the scr by the ct injector during scr pigging operation due to the existence of scaling complex marine environment and riser s catenary shape the ct needs to be provided enough axial force so that it would not be stuck in the scr there are lots of effects that might affect the axial force and load transfer characteristics within the scr pipe in pipe system chen et al 2015 researching on the axial load transfer characteristic for the scr pipe in pipe system is important for the pipeline pigging operation during the past several decades lubinski 1950 mitchell 1998 gao and gao 1995 newman 2007 have published lots of papers on the axial load characteristic and buckling behavior of an inner pipe in an onshore wellbore all of above researches are that the inner pipe is in a fixed outer pipe thus these results would be difficult to apply into scr pipe in pipe system because the outer pipe in scr pipe in pipe system is unfixed and might move because the drift of the platform and scr to solve this problem the analysis on marine drilling riser can be referenced r c s bueno and morooka 1994 proposed an analysis method for contact force between drill string and the marine drilling riser morooka and bueno 1997 presented the calculation method of contact forces using finite elements for modeling the drill column chen et al 2015 2016 proceeded experimental and computational study on how to reduce friction between ct and riser and how to affect ct s axial load under different riser boundary yanbin wang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 presents a coupled dynamic analysis of deep water drilling riser under combined forcing excitation and parametric excitation liangjie mao et al 2016 mao et al 2016 established a dynamic analysis model considering the actual riser string configuration and the model has been proved by a similar experiment conducted in a deep water basin the above theory has a good explanation of the mechanical mechanism of the marine drilling riser which its shape is almost straight because the geometric shape of scr is more complex the mechanical mechanism cannot be applied directly with scr pipe in pipe system recently there are a small number of papers on the mechanical mechanism of pipe in pipe system which has similar scr shape kuroiwa et al 2002 found that compliant vertical access riser s tension would be decreased affected by the contact with the tubing simon falser et al 2010 found that the diameter ratio between a coiled tubing and a compliant outer pipes has little effect on riser s axial force transfer chen et al 2017 analyzed the experimental study on axial load transfer behavior of a ct stuck in a scr the mechanical models and experiments in these papers can be referenced because the platform might drift from position i to position ii under marine load or operational needs santillan and virgin 2011 the inclined angle θ between vertical direction and scr which is showed in fig 1 would change the above researches are no concern about the effect of inclined angle causing by the platform s drift in the scr pipe in pipe system in this paper the mechanical model based on the iterative method was established and the theory was verified by experimental results through the mechanical model the effect of inclined angle in the scr pipe in pipe system was focused on the research will be helpful for the pipeline pigging and the ct s engineering applications 2 mechanical model the mechanical model of the ct is a very complex condition in pipe in pipe system therefore the system is simplified and the following assumptions are below chen and xu 2008 chen and lin 2003 1 the inner wall of the riser is rigid and no deformation occurs 2 the ct is homogeneous elastic soft rod and the gravity pressure friction force of column elements are equally distributed 3 the friction is regarded as sliding friction 4 the impact of dynamic marine loads and the unfixed boundary do not been considered fig 2 shows the force models of the ct which are undeformed and deformed in the scr we build a cartesian coordinate system oned chen et al 2016 the origin o is selected at the top of the riser the n axis points north the e axis points east and the d axis is vertical down the scr is divided into straight section u 0 u 2 and curved section u 1 force in t i is the top axial force force out t e is the end axial force μ is friction coefficient of the coiled tubing and riser w is the float of coiled tubing unit h is the water depth because the buckling effect of coiled tubing is mainly reflected by the additional contact force so it supposes that the ct is undeformed firstly and considers the impact of buckling finally 2 1 force analysis of the micro element select the random micro element for analysis fig 3 shows the force analysis on the straight and curved section of the down process 1 force analysis of the straight section based on the static equilibrium equation of the straight section there are equations chen and xu 2008 1 d t 0 l d l w cos θ

effective axial force s correction when there is internal and external fluid pressure the effective axial force should be correct where the internal fluid pressure p i can be equated to a pair of compressive axial loads the external fluid pressure p o can be equated to a pair of tensile axial loads so the effective axial force t e t can be expressed as 8 t e t t p i ρ i v i 2 a i p o ρ o v o 2 a o where ρ i ρ o are the internal and external fluid density of coiled tubing kg m3 a i a o are the internal and external cross sectional area of coiled tubing m2 v i v o are the average velocity of the fluid inside and outside the coiled tube m s in internal and external fluid the floating weight of the string w can be derived from 9 w w s g a i ρ i a o ρ o where w s is the length of coiled tubing in air weight g is the acceleration of gravity 2 2 friction calculation the friction between the coiled tubing and scr is mainly produced by the following two aspects which are the contact force and fluid friction 1 contact friction the contact pressure of the pipe in pipe in straight section is 10 f n 0 w sin θ simultaneous formula 4 and 6 as d l r d θ the contact pressure curved section is 11 f n 1 d 2 m r 2 d θ 2 w sin θ 2 fluid friction the viscous friction is calculated by the fluid in the riser 12 f f l 2 π v 1 u l m 2 1 m 2 1 ln m m 2 1 where v 1 is the relative velocity of the coiled tubing and fluid m s u is the fluid viscosity pa s m is the ratio of the outer diameter of the coiled tubing to the inner diameter of the riser in summary the column friction formula 13 f f μ f n 0 f f l straight section μ f n 1 f f l curved section 2 3 impact of the coiled tubing s buckling in the practical work of coiled tubing the buckling of the pipe has great influence on the axial force transmission so it is necessary to modify the formula of the axial force the influence of buckling on the column is mainly due to the increase of the contact force between the column and the inner wall of the riser for the additional contact force f n a a unified formula is 14 f n a c r c t 2 e i where c is the contact pressure coefficient chen et al 2015 c 0 125 for sinusoidal buckling and c 0 25 for helical buckling considering the effect of buckling the axial force formula of the column is modified to be 15 d t 0 l d l w cos θ μ w sin θ f n a f f l d t 1 l r d θ w cos θ μ

micro section can be calculated by the iterative method base on formula 15 3 experiments fig 4 shows the schematic and physical picture of pipe in pipe system s indoor platform the experimental platform can study different effects which affect the ct s load transfer behavior within the unfixed scr we don t take the ocean loads into account in this study the indoor experimental model e and the actual full scale system f needs to meet the principle of similarity chen et al 2016 the scaling involves the bending rigidity ei their weight per unit length w and the geometry the annular clearance between the ct and scr r b d i d o 2 the length of scr l u 0 u 1 u 2 and water depth h are ensured to be the same in different conditions experimental equipment mainly include chen et al

both ends we could simulate different position of the platform due to its movement during this paper only inclined angle θ 2 0 and θ 30 0 were taken into consideration the inner pipe was injected down into the outer pipe and it would be driven by a hydraulic piston further into the outer pipe the force in data would be measured by the force sensor i which its top end was connected to the piston by a connector the force out would be measured by the force sensor ii which was connected to inner pipe s bottom end zhu et al 2015 these force sensors passed a 0 0 5 0 volt signal analog output and they were sampled greater than 500 0hz measurement error was less than 3 0 n and national instruments data acquisition system ni usb 621x was used to accommodate these precise digital signals which were

of platform movement θ we conducted two different phases of experiments the inclined angles were 2 0 and 30 0 and details of each phase can be seen in table 2 fig 5 shows the trend of the inner pipe s force out with the inner pipe s force in fig 5 a is the experimental results for phase i fig 5 b is the experimental results for phase ii the force in is the injecting force of top end and the force out is the terminal force of bottom end according to fig 5 we can see that force out will increase with the increase of force in even under different experimental condition and the overall increasing trend of inner pipe s force out with force in is similar but there are differences among different experimental conditions which would arouse our interests when the force in is 225 0n the force out of phase i is 152 0n and the force out of phase ii is 160 0n we summarized the data for two phases fig 6 shows experimental results of phase no 1 and phase no 2 the experimental results show the increasing trend of force out within different inclined angles the force out is almost same between phase i and phase ii in the 0 150 0n area but the force out of phase ii is bigger than phase i after 150 0n in order to study the effect of include angle we had detailed discussion on experimental results of phase i and phase ii we define that the inner pipe s axial load transfer efficiency is ε f o f i fig 7 shows the experimental results of transfer efficiency within different inclined angles fig 7 shows that force out will always small than force in no matter what the inclined angles are which means the axial load transfer efficiencies for both conditions are less than 85 0 reason for this phenomenon is there exists friction between the two pipes thus force in will be eliminated a little when it transfers to its bottom end in that case force out of inner pipe will always smaller than its force in meanwhile transfer efficiency within inclined angle θ 30 0 is bigger than inclined angle θ 2 0 in order to ensure this phenomenon we take advantage of the method of the theoretical simulation to help to explain this difference 5 discussion 5 1 comparison results between calculation and experiment we can get the axial force in different conditions based on equation 15 by the calculation of matlab software since in the whole experiment system there is no liquid environment and some parameters can be eliminated to match the experiment system such as the inner pipe fluid pressure p i and outer pipe fluid pressure p o fluid density ρ i and ρ o fig 8 shows the results of the force out increasing within two inclined angles through theoretical calculation according to fig 8 we can see that force out of both two results will increase with the increase of the inclined angles which perfectly corresponds with the results of the experiments above however due to difference in inclined angles growth pattern of force out in these two calculations are not the same this can be explained by the mechanical model in the condition of inclined angles 2 0 the force out is 152 0n when the force in is 225 0n in the experimental data but it is 147 5n in the theoretical calculation because the pipe in pipe system is the unfixed boundary the experiment difference between calculation and experiment is 4 5n it is similar in the condition of inclined angles 30 0 and difference between calculation and experiment is 9 0n but error which is below 6 0 is within the allowable range in maximum value 225 0n 5 2 effects of inclined angle we calculated the results on the inclined angle 2 0 10 0 18 0 26 0 and 30 0 fig 9 shows the calculation results with different inclined angles according to fig 9 we can see that overall increasing trend of inner pipe s force out with force in are almost the same with each other under different experimental condition it indicates that is increasing trend of the force out with the increasing of the inclined angle the force out is almost same between phase i and phase ii in the 0 175 0n area but the force out of phase ii is bigger than phase i after 175 0n it is similar with the experimental results the force out of 30 0 condition is the maximum in each force in the maximum values of different inclined angles in the 225 0n are selected and these data are drawn in fig 10 according to fig 10 it is easy to figure out that the force out increases with the increasing of the inclined angle the curve satisfies the linear increase and the slope is about 0 17 it is from 161 2n to 165 9n and the maximum is 165 9n in 30 0 6 conclusions in this paper the force analysis of the micro element on the straight and curved section of the ct was analyzed and the axial force of the random micro section considering the effect of ct s buckling based on iterative method was presented through the mechanical model the mechanical characteristic such as axial force bending moment and shear force etc of the random micro section can be calculated the indoor platform of scr pipe in pipe system was set up the experimental results of phase i and phase ii which the inclined angles were 2 0 and 30 0 were obtain by experimental study on scr pipe in pipe system the effect of inclined angles is found inner pipe s transfer efficiency in outer pipe will be less than 85 0 and inner pipe s transfer efficiency will increase with the inclined angle s increasing through comparing the experimental and theoretical calculation results the mechanical model is validated according to experimental results the results of axial force which inclined angle were 2 0 10 0 18 0 26 0 and 30 0 were calculated by the theoretical model the calculation results show that the transfer efficiency would increase with the increasing of the inclined angles thus in order to make the inner pipe transfer more axial force to its bottom end ct operations within scr should be taken when inclined angle between the vertical direction and the scr is relatively big the

23531,a novel method of pipeline pigging is that coiled tubing ct connected with a pig and then ct is injected into the scr to clean up pipelines the ct needs enough axial force so that it would not be stuck in the scr during the pipeline pigging operation to analyze the axial load transfer characteristic paper built the force analysis of the micro element on the straight and curved section amended effective axial force and the friction between the ct and scr and built the mathematical model of scr pipe in pipe system considering impacts of the coiled tubing s buckling the axial force of the random micro section can be calculated through iterative method in order to verify the correctness of the theory the scr pipe in pipe system s indoor platform was built the experimental platform can study different effects which affect the ct s load transfer behavior within the unfixed scr the experimental results of two different phases which inclined angles were 2 0 and 30 0 show that ct s transfer efficiency of axial load is less than 85 0 in scr pipe in pipe system and it will increase with the inclined angle increasing through comparing experimental and theoretical calculation results the mathematical model of scr pipe in pipe system is validated paper calculated the axial force results on the inclined angle 2 0 10 0 18 0 26 0 and 30 0 by the theoretical mechanical model the theoretical calculation results show that the transfer efficiency would increase with the increasing of the inclined angles to ensure more axial force to be transferred to the ct s bottom end the inclined angle should be as big as possible the above research can provide theoretical support to the scr s pigging operation keywords coiled tubing steel catenary riser transfer efficiency of axial load inclined angle 1 introduction the steel catenary riser scr is now the first choice for development of deep water oil huang and li 2006 yang and li 2010 but it is commonly prone to scaling inside the riser which includes silt paraffin asphalt etc tan et al 2015 pipeline pigging which can remove the scaling is the regular operational approach to insure the high transportation efficiency of the scr the pig which is used for pipeline traditional pigging might stick in the scr thus a better way is that a pig can be connected to the coiled tubing ct by a ct injector and then the pig is injected down the scr this system that a ct is in a scr is referred to the scr pipe in pipe system chen et al 2015 fig 1 shows the scheme of the scr pipe in pipe system during pipeline pigging based on ct technology the subsea wellhead and ocean platform are connected by the scr the pig is installed on the ct s bottom end the ct is injected into the scr by the ct injector during scr pigging operation due to the existence of scaling complex marine environment and riser s catenary shape the ct needs to be provided enough axial force so that it would not be stuck in the scr there are lots of effects that might affect the axial force and load transfer characteristics within the scr pipe in pipe system chen et al 2015 researching on the axial load transfer characteristic for the scr pipe in pipe system is important for the pipeline pigging operation during the past several decades lubinski 1950 mitchell 1998 gao and gao 1995 newman 2007 have published lots of papers on the axial load characteristic and buckling behavior of an inner pipe in an onshore wellbore all of above researches are that the inner pipe is in a fixed outer pipe thus these results would be difficult to apply into scr pipe in pipe system because the outer pipe in scr pipe in pipe system is unfixed and might move because the drift of the platform and scr to solve this problem the analysis on marine drilling riser can be referenced r c s bueno and morooka 1994 proposed an analysis method for contact force between drill string and the marine drilling riser morooka and bueno 1997 presented the calculation method of contact forces using finite elements for modeling the drill column chen et al 2015 2016 proceeded experimental and computational study on how to reduce friction between ct and riser and how to affect ct s axial load under different riser boundary yanbin wang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 presents a coupled dynamic analysis of deep water drilling riser under combined forcing excitation and parametric excitation liangjie mao et al 2016 mao et al 2016 established a dynamic analysis model considering the actual riser string configuration and the model has been proved by a similar experiment conducted in a deep water basin the above theory has a good explanation of the mechanical mechanism of the marine drilling riser which its shape is almost straight because the geometric shape of scr is more complex the mechanical mechanism cannot be applied directly with scr pipe in pipe system recently there are a small number of papers on the mechanical mechanism of pipe in pipe system which has similar scr shape kuroiwa et al 2002 found that compliant vertical access riser s tension would be decreased affected by the contact with the tubing simon falser et al 2010 found that the diameter ratio between a coiled tubing and a compliant outer pipes has little effect on riser s axial force transfer chen et al 2017 analyzed the experimental study on axial load transfer behavior of a ct stuck in a scr the mechanical models and experiments in these papers can be referenced because the platform might drift from position i to position ii under marine load or operational needs santillan and virgin 2011 the inclined angle θ between vertical direction and scr which is showed in fig 1 would change the above researches are no concern about the effect of inclined angle causing by the platform s drift in the scr pipe in pipe system in this paper the mechanical model based on the iterative method was established and the theory was verified by experimental results through the mechanical model the effect of inclined angle in the scr pipe in pipe system was focused on the research will be helpful for the pipeline pigging and the ct s engineering applications 2 mechanical model the mechanical model of the ct is a very complex condition in pipe in pipe system therefore the system is simplified and the following assumptions are below chen and xu 2008 chen and lin 2003 1 the inner wall of the riser is rigid and no deformation occurs 2 the ct is homogeneous elastic soft rod and the gravity pressure friction force of column elements are equally distributed 3 the friction is regarded as sliding friction 4 the impact of dynamic marine loads and the unfixed boundary do not been considered fig 2 shows the force models of the ct which are undeformed and deformed in the scr we build a cartesian coordinate system oned chen et al 2016 the origin o is selected at the top of the riser the n axis points north the e axis points east and the d axis is vertical down the scr is divided into straight section u 0 u 2 and curved section u 1 force in t i is the top axial force force out t e is the end axial force μ is friction coefficient of the coiled tubing and riser w is the float of coiled tubing unit h is the water depth because the buckling effect of coiled tubing is mainly reflected by the additional contact force so it supposes that the ct is undeformed firstly and considers the impact of buckling finally 2 1 force analysis of the micro element select the random micro element for analysis fig 3 shows the force analysis on the straight and curved section of the down process 1 force analysis of the straight section based on the static equilibrium equation of the straight section there are equations chen and xu 2008 1 d t 0 l d l w cos θ f f 2 f n 0 w sin θ where θ is the inclined angle f f is the friction force t 0 l is the tension force 2 force analysis of the curved section similarly the static equilibrium equation of the curved section which bending moment and shear force is considered is built 3 d t 1 l d l w cos θ f f 4 d q l d l f n 1 w sin θ 5 d m q l d l f n 1 w sin θ d l 2 2 0 where m is the bending moment mpa q l is the shear force of the curved section n t 1 l is the tension force we omit the small amount d l 2 then 6 d m q l d l 0 from the geometric relations d l r d θ there is 7 d t 1 l r d θ w cos θ f f 3 effective axial force s correction when there is internal and external fluid pressure the effective axial force should be correct where the internal fluid pressure p i can be equated to a pair of compressive axial loads the external fluid pressure p o can be equated to a pair of tensile axial loads so the effective axial force t e t can be expressed as 8 t e t t p i ρ i v i 2 a i p o ρ o v o 2 a o where ρ i ρ o are the internal and external fluid density of coiled tubing kg m3 a i a o are the internal and external cross sectional area of coiled tubing m2 v i v o are the average velocity of the fluid inside and outside the coiled tube m s in internal and external fluid the floating weight of the string w can be derived from 9 w w s g a i ρ i a o ρ o where w s is the length of coiled tubing in air weight g is the acceleration of gravity 2 2 friction calculation the friction between the coiled tubing and scr is mainly produced by the following two aspects which are the contact force and fluid friction 1 contact friction the contact pressure of the pipe in pipe in straight section is 10 f n 0 w sin θ simultaneous formula 4 and 6 as d l r d θ the contact pressure curved section is 11 f n 1 d 2 m r 2 d θ 2 w sin θ 2 fluid friction the viscous friction is calculated by the fluid in the riser 12 f f l 2 π v 1 u l m 2 1 m 2 1 ln m m 2 1 where v 1 is the relative velocity of the coiled tubing and fluid m s u is the fluid viscosity pa s m is the ratio of the outer diameter of the coiled tubing to the inner diameter of the riser in summary the column friction formula 13 f f μ f n 0 f f l straight section μ f n 1 f f l curved section 2 3 impact of the coiled tubing s buckling in the practical work of coiled tubing the buckling of the pipe has great influence on the axial force transmission so it is necessary to modify the formula of the axial force the influence of buckling on the column is mainly due to the increase of the contact force between the column and the inner wall of the riser for the additional contact force f n a a unified formula is 14 f n a c r c t 2 e i where c is the contact pressure coefficient chen et al 2015 c 0 125 for sinusoidal buckling and c 0 25 for helical buckling considering the effect of buckling the axial force formula of the column is modified to be 15 d t 0 l d l w cos θ μ w sin θ f n a f f l d t 1 l r d θ w cos θ μ d 2 m r 2 d θ 2 w sin θ f n a f f l w w s g a i ρ i a o ρ o f f l 2 π v 1 u l m 2 1 m 2 1 ln m m 2 1 t e t t p i ρ i v i 2 a i p o ρ o v o 2 a o f n a c r c t 2 e i so the axial force of the random micro section can be calculated by the iterative method base on formula 15 3 experiments fig 4 shows the schematic and physical picture of pipe in pipe system s indoor platform the experimental platform can study different effects which affect the ct s load transfer behavior within the unfixed scr we don t take the ocean loads into account in this study the indoor experimental model e and the actual full scale system f needs to meet the principle of similarity chen et al 2016 the scaling involves the bending rigidity ei their weight per unit length w and the geometry the annular clearance between the ct and scr r b d i d o 2 the length of scr l u 0 u 1 u 2 and water depth h are ensured to be the same in different conditions experimental equipment mainly include chen et al

end and the range is 3 0 kn 7 ni usb 621x national instruments data acquisition system 8 hydraulic circuit the outer pipe is used as a simulated scr which is held in place by two fixed support at its both ends we could simulate different position of the platform due to its movement during this paper only inclined angle θ 2 0 and θ 30 0 were taken into consideration the inner pipe was injected down into the outer pipe and it would be driven by a hydraulic piston further into the outer pipe the force in data would be measured by the force sensor i which its top end was connected to the piston by a connector the force out would be measured by the force sensor ii which was connected to inner pipe s bottom end zhu et al 2015 these force sensors passed a 0 0 5 0 volt signal analog output and they were sampled greater than 500 0hz measurement error was less than 3 0 n and national instruments data acquisition system ni usb 621x was used to accommodate these precise digital signals which were

between phase i and phase ii in the 0 175 0n area but the force out of phase ii is bigger than phase i after 175 0n it is similar with the experimental results the force out of 30 0 condition is the maximum in each force in the maximum values of different inclined angles in the 225 0n are selected and these data are drawn in fig 10 according to fig 10 it is easy to figure out that the force out increases with the increasing of the inclined angle the curve satisfies the linear increase and the slope is about 0 17 it is from 161 2n to 165 9n and the maximum is 165 9n in 30 0 6 conclusions in

23532,the performance of oscillating hydrofoils in the presence of waves and currents is studied for the exploitation of combined renewable marine energy sources in nearshore and coastal regions the system operates as a semi activated biomimetic energy device with imposed pitching motion and induced heaving motion in harmonic incident waves and flow except of uniform currents also vertically sheared currents are considered the analysis is based on a coupled mode system in conjunction with a time domain bem taking into account the effect of the wavy free surface the velocity due to waves and currents on the formation of the incident flow and the effects of variable bathymetry results are presented concerning the performance of the system for a wide range of parameters including cases where the wave frequency is different from the pitching frequency of the hydrofoil it is indicated that significant energy can be extracted and that the power gain from the waves increases well above the maximum values predicted for the system in uniform flow the present method can be applied to the design and optimum control of such biomimetic systems operating in the nearshore coastal region and extracting energy from waves in the presence of ambient currents keywords biomimetic system marine energy coastal environment waves and sheared currents variable bathymetry 1 introduction interaction of water waves with varying currents in variable bathymetry regions is important for a variety of engineering applications including effects of waves on structures coastal management and harbor maintenance as well as design and development of systems for exploitation of marine renewable energy resources extensive analysis concerning wave current interaction in the nearshore and coastal regions have been presented by peregrine 1976 jonsson 1990 soulsby 1990 thomas and klopman 1997 recent information can also be found in the corresponding sections of reviewing articles battjes 2006 cavaleri et al 2007 for the prediction of wave seabed current interaction coupled mode models have been recently developed with application to the propagation scattering of water waves over variable bathymetry regions in the presence of spatially varying currents extending previous simplified mild slope mild shear models that are applicable to cases of slowly varying bathymetry and current see belibassakis et al 2011 also the problem of transformation of the directional spectrum of an incident wave system over a region of strongly varying three dimensional bottom topography is further studied in belibassakis et al 2014 where also the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled mode method is tested comparing numerical predictions against experimental data and calculations by phase averaged model swan booij et al 1999 in the case of slowly varying environmental currents where the vertical structure of the boundary layer in the nearshore and coastal region could occupy the entire depth as in the case of tidal currents the wave vorticity interaction is known to have a significant influence on wave dynamics in this direction various models for surface waves interacting with vertically sheared current have been developed see e g kirby 1984 nwogu 2009 touboul et al 2016 and the references cited there the mutual existence of waves with currents in nearshore regions offers a motivation for comprehensive investigation of such resources and the development of hybrid technological devices based on biomimetic systems see e g http www biopowersystems com biostream html the latter could be found useful for the efficient exploitation of this type of combined marine renewables enhancing the power extraction which is important especially in areas characterized by low wave potential recent research and development results concerning flapping wing systems supported also by extensive experimental evidence and theoretical analysis have shown that such systems operating under conditions of optimal wake formation could achieve high levels of efficiency see e g triantafyllou et al 2000 read et al 2003 triantafyllou et al 2004 schouveiler et al 2005 and rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 for extensive review however the complexity of kinematics of flapping wings necessitates the development of sophisticated power transmission mechanisms and control devices as compared to the standard hydrodynamic systems such as water turbines and marine propellers in the last decade biomimetic flapping foil devices have been extensively studied as flow energy converters for a detailed review see xiao and zhu 2014 in the majority of these works the foil is considered in infinite domain and the current flow as the only source of environmental energy ignoring the effects of free surface and incident waves xiao and zhu 2014 classified those studies into three categories with respect to the activation mechanism of the flapping foil the first category includes systems with prescribed rotational pitching and translatory heaving oscillatory motions of the foil the second category includes semi activated systems with forced pitching motion and induced heaving oscillations and the last one includes self sustained systems with induced motions at both degrees of freedom the majority of the studies belong to the first group while semi activated and self sustained systems have not been explored extensively and moreover the semi activated systems seem to be a more feasible approach in practice concerning semi activated systems shimizu et al 2008 and zhu and peng 2009 using navier stokes solvers studied the performance of a flapping foil as current energy converter moreover the system was studied in the potential flow framework by zhu et al 2009 using 2 d thin foil theory and 3 d bem demonstrated that 3 d effects would decrease the absorbed power while ground effect could minimize that loss also experimental studies were conducted by huxham et al 2012 at small scale in a water tunnel with promising results in a recent work wu et al 2015 two auxiliary smaller hydrofoils were employed to enhance the performance of the main flapping foil energy converter by employing mechanisms of induced vortex interaction although a few works concerning semi activated systems have been published there exists an important limitation the assumption that the incident current flow is uniform and steady which is an oversimplification as also reported by xiao and zhu 2014 because tidal currents occurs with nonuniform vertical structure and also interact with free surface gravity waves and varying bathymetry the effects of incoming waves have been considered in studies of flapping foil propulsion and thrust augmentation it has been demonstrated that flapping foil thrusters operating in waves while travelling at constant forward speed are very efficient and could be exploited for augmenting the overall ship propulsion in waves by directly converting kinetic energy from ship motions to thrust see e g belibassakis and politis 2013 politis and politis 2014 belibassakis and filippas 2015 bøckmann and steen 2016 in previous works potential based panel methods and cfd tools have been developed for the hydrodynamic analysis of these systems including the effects of the free surface predictions are found to be in agreement with other methods and experimental data filippas and belibassakis 2014 de silva and yamaguchi 2012 also it has been demonstrated that significant energy can be extracted by the system and industrial initiatives have appeared for developing the flapping foil system for wave energy extraction and thrust production see e g http www seaspeed co uk news wave foil developments the present work is focused on the investigation of oscillating hydrofoils in the presence of waves and sheared currents examined as biomimetic systems for extraction and exploitation of this kind of marine renewables in nearshore regions operating as semi activated wave and flow energy device the pitching motion of the foil is appropriately tuned in order to develop heaving forces due to alternating lift and drive the hydraulic generator the hydrodynamic analysis is based on the coupled mode model presented by belibassakis et al 2017 for the propagation of waves in the presence of sheared currents in conjunction with time domain boundary element methods bem for the disturbance lifting flow developed by the hydrofoil in variable bathymetry the effect of the wavy free surface and variable bottom topography are taken into account through the satisfaction of the corresponding boundary conditions the present work is structured as follows in sec 2 the calculation of the incident wave current field in frequency domain by means of a coupled mode model is presented subsequently in sec 3 the lifting flow problem associated with the flapping foil is solved along with the dynamical heaving response of the foil where the mechanical system including the energy generator is modeled as an one degree of freedom oscillator the biomimetic system then is analyzed by means of a 2d time domain bem finally in sec 4 numerical results concerning the extracted power and the operability characteristics of the system in variable bathymetry are presented indicating that significant output can be obtained under general operating conditions the present method after further enhancements and verification can be applied to the design and optimum control of such biomimetic systems operating in the nearshore coastal region and extracting energy from waves in the presence of ambient currents 2 wave propagation in variable bathymetry in the presence of sheared currents we consider wave propagation in the presence of horizontal non homogeneous vertically sheared current in a variable bathymetry region for simplicity only the two dimensional problem corresponding to normally incident waves and current is considered in this work see fig 1 the current profile is linear in depth and the flow is assumed to vary slowly with respect to the horizontal direction and with the wave period as in the case of tidal and low frequency environmental flows and thus it may be considered steady at the scale of wave evolution moreover the current velocity is assumed to be small and thus the associated mean free surface elevation set down set up is also small the above constitutes the background flow component on the other hand the wave flow perturbing the background current flow is generated by an incident wave system coming from the far up wave region see fig 1 and is assumed to be irrotational a cartesian coordinate system is used having its origin at some point on the unperturbed free surface z 0 see fig 1 the current flow q u w satisfies the continuity equation x u z w 0 and the following boundary conditions 1 w u x h f 0 z h f x 2 w u x h 0 z h x where h x is the local depth and h f x denotes the free surface elevation associated with the background current flow using the fact that the current velocity has been assumed to be small h f x is a higher order quantity and the kinematic free surface boundary condition eq 1 can be linearized on the mean level z 0 also the current is assumed to be nearly horizontal and linearly varying in depth and thus it is represented as follows 3 u x z u x z s x w 0 where the first term u x corresponds to the value of the current on the surface that could be horizontally varying and the second term zs x corresponds to the component associated with the shear in the linear vertical profile it must be noted that in flow fields on the vertical plane with linearly sheared currents the vorticity production terms reduce to zero and the wave motion remains irrotational see e g nwogu 2009 using this fact the total velocity field in the presence of waves is decomposed as follows 4 v x z t u x z x φ p w x z t z φ p w x z t where φ p w x z t is the propagating wave potential in the presence of the vertically sheared current as shown by various authors see e g touboul et al 2016 sec 2 2 in this case the following approximate version of bernoulli

φ x z exp i ω t the following local mode series expansion is used for the representation of the complex wave potential φ x z see also belibassakis et al 2011 2017 9 φ x z n 1 φ n x z n z x the vertical modes z n z x n 0 1 2 involved in the above expansion are obtained as the eigenfunctions of vertical eigenvalue problems formulated with respect to the local depth h x and the local frequency parameter μ σ 2 g where σ is a mean intrinsic frequency defined by 10 σ ω u x χ where χ x denotes the phase of the waves the latter is calculated by using information concerning the values of the current on the surface u x u x z 0 and at a characteristic depth 2 d e u 2 x u x z 2 d e as explained in detail in touboul et al 2016 sec 2 3 the functions z n z x are parametrically dependent on the

z n 0 z h x where the local frequency parameter μ x is as follows 14 μ σ 0 σ 2 g ω u x χ ω u 2 x χ g thus both σ σ 0 x σ 2 x and μ x are dependent on the solution φ x z of the problem which introduces implicit nonlinearity to the wave current problem and iterations are necessary for their determination the local vertical eigenfunctions z n z x n 0 1 2 are given by 15 z 0 z x cosh k 0 x z h x cosh k

relation formulated with respect to the mean intrinsic frequency 16 σ 2 σ 0 σ 2 k 0 g tanh k h k n g tan k n h the first term n 0 corresponds to the propagating mode and the rest terms n 0 to the evanescent modes as concerns the n 1 mode φ 1 z 1 this is an additional term introduced in order to consistently satisfy the bottom boundary condition and significantly accelerates the convergence of the local mode series see athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 a specific form of the function z 1 z x is 17 z 1 z x h x z h x 3 z h x 2 having the properties z z 1 z h 1 z 1 z h 0 and z z 1 z 0 z 1 z 0 0 see also the discussion in belibassakis et al 2001 in the case of vertically sheared current with linear profile it is shown by touboul et al 2016 sec 2 3 that the appropriate value for the characteristic depth involved in the definition of the frequency parameter μ x in eq 14 is 18 2 d e tanh k 0 h k 0 using the representation eq 9 in conjunction with the properties of z n z x we obtain 19 z φ μ φ σ 0 x σ 2 x g φ on z 0 in order to proceed further we use now eqs 6 and 7 for the definition of the stream function in conjunction with the present local mode expansion of the wave potential and we obtain the following expression for the stream function in terms of corresponding modal amplitudes 20 ψ p w x z z h z x φ x z d z n 1 x φ n z n z x φ n w n z x where the new vertical functions are defined by 21 z n z x z h z z n z x d z w n z x z h z x z n z x d z where 22 z 0 z s i n h k 0 x z h x k 0 x cosh k 0 x h x z n z s i n k n x z h x k n x c o s k n x h x n 1 2 and 23 z 1 z x z 4 4 h x 2 z 3 3 h x the corresponding w n z x functions are easily derived from the above as follows 24 w n z x z h z x z n z d z x z n x h z n z h x z n f n x h where 25 f 1 0 f 0 cosh 1 k 0 h

expressing the variation δ φ of the wave potential in terms of the variations of the modal amplitudes δ φ n we finally obtain the following coupled mode system cms of equations with respect to the unknown modal amplitudes φ n x n 1 0 1 2 providing the solution to the present linearised wave current problem 26 n 1 a m n x 2 φ n b m n x φ n c m n φ n z m z 0 g x u 2 x 2 φ n u g x s ψ 0 iω x u s ψ

29 c m n ω 2 σ 2 g i ω g x u x x z n z z z n z n z z n z h x z n x h z n z h where the brackets denote the inner product f g z h z 0 f z g z d z in the vertical interval h z 0 the above system of equations is essentially linear with respect to the unknown mode amplitudes φ n x t n 1 0 1 2 still however the intrinsic frequency σ depends on the phase gradient x χ of the wave which is also dependent on the solution φ x z as follows 30 χ x arg φ x z 0 arg n 0 φ n x where arg denotes the argument of a complex number thus iterations are necessary for the determination of the horizontal distribution of the phase χ x the corresponding intrinsic frequencies σ and the frequency parameter μ which are involved in the calculation of the vertical eigenfunctions z n z n 0 1 2 and the coefficients of the cms eq 26 it is clear from eq 30 that all modes φ n x contribute to the phase χ x moreover the complex amplitude of the free surface elevation is obtained as follows 31 η 1 g i ω u x φ x 1 x 2 z 0 ψ 0 s we remark here that in the case of no current the above cms reduces exactly to the corresponding one presented by athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 for studying linearized wave propagation over variable bathymetry regions also in the case of zero shear the present system reduces to the form derived by belibassakis et al 2011 and further exploited by belibassakis et al 2014 for the transformation of directional spectra over variable bathymetry regions in the presence of homogeneous in depth currents details concerning the fast convergence of the local mode series can be found in the above works additional information concerning the above model and its application to wave propagation in inhomogeneous environments in the presence of vertically sheared currents can be found in belibassakis et al 2017 2 2 waves propagating over a smooth shoal in the presence of sheared current as an example we consider a variable bathymetry region of the form of smooth shoal characterized by continuously decreasing depth from h 1 15 m to h 3 3 m see fig 2 the depth function presenting monotonic variation is defined by 32 h x h m 0 5 h 1 h 3 tanh α h x where the mean depth is h m 0 5 h 1 h 3 and the coefficient α h is selected so that the mean bottom slope is 6 and the max bottom slope 12 normally incident waves of nondimensional frequency s t ω h 1 g 0 4 are propagating in the variable bathymetry in the presence of sheared current the current speed at the entrance of the domain u corresponds to bathymetric froude number f d u g h 1 0 05 and the current distribution in the domain is calculated so that the mass flow rate is constant 33 u x u h 1 h x s x h x 2 where u x is also the surface current speed in this example the shear s x is selected to be distributed following a gaussian shape function becoming maximum s max 0 05 s 1 at the centre of the domain x 0 and zero at the ends of the variable bathymetry region x 1 2 250 m and together with the horizontal distribution of the current speed at the free surface are shown in fig 2 a by using dashed and solid lines respectively in the middle of the domain x x m 0 the current speed ranges from about 1 2 m s near the free surface and drops linearly to 0 8 m s at the bottom in this area the depth is h m 9 m and the corresponding mean froude number is significantly increased u m g h m 0 08 where u m u x m s x m h m 2 results concerning the calculated wave field in the presence of the above sheared current and bottom topography as obtained by the present cms eq 26 are shown in figs 3 and 4 calculations are based on a second order finite differences to discretize the equations in a uniform grid of 301 equidistant points on the horizontal axis and n m 5 modes for the wave expansion eq 9 which were enough for numerical convergence in particular the wave field is illustrated in fig 4 by using contour lines in the same plots the values of the normalized free surface elevation η h 2 where h denotes the incident wave height are also shown by using red lines a detail of the wave field is shown in fig 5 in the central subregion over the sloping seabed where the biomimetic energy device will be considered to operate we clearly observe in figs 4 and 5 that the wave field is very accurately resolved from the top to the bottom of the water column everywhere in the domain and the satisfaction of the bottom boundary condition illustrated by the fact that the equipotential lines intersect the bottom profile perpendicularly it must be also noted that the current significantly changes the wave characteristics and thus the consideration of shear in the current further modifies the wave field especially in the vicinity of the sloping bottom subregion see e g touboul et al 2016 in the examined case the wave conditions correspond to intermediate water depth in the domain due to very mild variation of parameters the calculated reflection coefficient in the case considered is quite small of the order 1 8 in the sequel we shall use the above example in order to study in detail and illustrate the performance of a biomimetic system consisted of a semi activated oscillating hydrofoil extracting energy simultaneously from waves and currents in the shoaling region of figs 3 and 4 in order to provide reference values for the combined potential in the middle of the domain see fig 3 where the biomimetic system will be considered to operate we mention here that in the case of the above wave and current conditions the total available power of the current flow per unit width in the transverse direction is of the order 2 kw m and the corresponding wave power per meter of wave height is 8 7 kw m in such cases the combined available potential is considered enough for one flapping foil of chord length of the order 1 2 m moderate span and good efficiency to reach output power values of the order of 50 kw moreover multicomponent systems with many horizontal foils in parallel arrangement rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 fig 2 wu et al 2015 increases the output power to levels comparable to tidal turbines of corresponding size 3 flapping hydrofoil as a biomimetic energy device in waves and currents we now consider the biomimetic system bs in fig 1 operating as a combined wave and current energy device in the variable bathymetry region the system is modeled as an oscillating semi activated hydrofoil of chord c with controlled rotational pitching oscillations and induced vertical heaving motion which is elastically connected to the energy generator subsystem see fig 6 under the assumption of small wave amplitude the disturbance flow due to oscillating foil is formulated as a time dependent problem characterized by a moving foil boundary d b t with respect to the earth fixed frame of reference the configuration does not operate very close to the free surface and thus the linearized free surface boundary conditions are considered a good approximation however the motion of the foil and the pressure type kutta condition are not linearized the total velocity field v t x z t consists of the incident wave and current flow v x z t and the disturbance flow due to the oscillating hydrofoil φ x z t we recall here that the incident flow velocity contains the sheared current velocity q u w u x s x z 0 and the propagating wave component φ p w x z t where the wave potential is given by eq 8 the disturbance potential φ x z t corresponds to a lifting flow and satisfies the 2d laplace equation 34 2 φ x z t 0 x z d supplemented by the body boundary condition 35 n φ x z t v n b v b n b b x z d b where n φ φ n v q φ p w and the right hand side of the neumann boundary condition is denoted by b the second term in eq 35 is a coupling term between the present boundary value problem and the dynamics of the oscillating hydrofoil described in more detail in sec 3 1 in the present case the location of the body boundary d b t as well as the velocity on the boundary v b is part of the solution introducing additional nonlinearity to the problem the bottom no entrance boundary condition is also imposed expressed in terms of the normal derivative of the disturbance field on the seabed 36 n φ 0 z h x or z φ x z t x h x x φ x z t 0 z h x moreover the linearized dynamic and kinematic free surface boundary conditions are satisfied on the mean free surface level 37 t φ x z t u x x φ x z t g η x t s x ψ x z t z 0 38 t η x t n φ x z t u x x η x t z 0 where φ n x z t φ z x z t where ψ is the stream function of the disturbance field in lifting flows around bodies the problem is supplemented by the kutta condition necessitating zero pressure jump at the trailing edge that condition is used in conjunction with the dynamic and kinematic conditions on the trailing vortex sheet stating that the pressure and the normal velocity are continuous through the trailing vortex wake 39 p u x z t p l x z t x z d w 40 n φ u x z t n φ l x z t x z d w we treat the above problem as an initial boundary value problem and we assume that the disturbance field due to the presence of the body vanishes at large distances in the above equations η x t denotes the free surface elevation associated with the disturbance field d is the mean submergence of the hydrofoil and n is the unit normal vector pointing into the interior of d the unsteady pressure field including the wave component and the disturbance due to the oscillating hydrofoil is calculated by the following approximate bernoulli type equation see eq 5 41 p p a ρ t φ u q φ u 1 2 φ u 2 s ψ u g z where φ u φ p w φ and ψ u ψ p w ψ is the corresponding stream function for more details concerning the derivation of the above equation see touboul et al 2016 belibassakis et al 2017 using eqs 39 and 40 in conjunction with the above form of approximate bernoulli type equation eq 41 we obtain the following formula 42 d μ w x z t d t 0 x z d w where μ w φ u φ l denotes the potential jump the dipole intensity on the free wake and d d t t v m is the material derivative based on the mean velocity v m on the trailing vortex sheet the above relation states that d w evolves in time as a material surface moving with the mean velocity the vortex sheet can be approximated by a simplified wake model which is derived by setting v m q resulting in a sinusoidal shape emanating at the trailing edge of the oscillating hydrofoil see also politis 2016 the above formulation provides satisfying predictions in the case of low and moderate unsteadiness and has been used in previous works for the study of flapping foil propulsion systems operating beneath the free surface in harmonic and multichromatic waves as well as for the study of energy extraction from the wave induced ship motions in real sea states and direct conversion to thrust more details concerning the present formulation as well as validation of the boundary element method bem and numerical performance can be found in our previous works see e g filippas and belibassakis 2014 and belibassakis and filippas 2015 3 1 motion of the semi activated hydrofoil the motion of the hydrofoil consists of a harmonic pitching oscillation 43 θ t θ ο cos ω θ t ψ with angular frequency ω θ possibly different than the wave frequency and amplitude θ ο and the induced vertical oscillatory motion z t the angular pitching motion is defined with respect to a pivot point selected near the pressure centre of the hydrofoil usually on the chord and at a distance x r c 3 from the leading edge in the present case the pitching motion and thus the angle of attack is controlled and the response of the examined system is the power extracted by the vertical oscillations 44 p b b t z t 2 the induced vertical oscillations are obtained as the response of a complex structural mechanism including the generator driven by the hydrodynamic lift in the present work it is modeled as a single degree of freedom hydroelastic system assuming that the system has an equivalent mass m and stiffness k while the generator is modeled by an equivalent damping coefficient b as follows 45 t t z 2 ζ ω 0 t z ω 0 2 z l z m with ω 0 k m ζ b 2 m k in the above equation ω 0 is the natural frequency and ζ the non dimensional damping ratio the vertical lift force l z is obtained through hydrodynamic pressure integration on the hydrofoil which depends on the response and it will be calculated along with the solution of the boundary value problem introducing an additional implicit nonlinearity due to the coupling moreover the following nondimensional mass damping and stiffness coefficients has been used by wu et al 2015 m m 0 5 ρ c 2 b b 0 5 ρ u c k k 0 5 ρ u 2 c c l l z 0 5 ρ u 2 c where in the present study u is the velocity of the current at the entrance of the domain other important non dimensional quantities are the pressure coefficient defined as c p p p a 0 5 ρ u 2 the moment coefficient about the pivot axis c m m 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 and the net power extraction coefficient η p p b p θ ρ u 3 z 0 where p θ m t θ is the input is the power required for the enforced pitching motion for the calculation of the output power coefficient the average value of the input and output power is needed obtained by averaging in one characteristic period moreover the amplitudes of heaving motion is approximated by the half of the maximum deviation during a characteristic periods i e z 0 max z min z 2 as concerns the hydrodynamics important parameters are the reduced frequency k r ω θ c 2 u and the effective angle of attack on the foil that includes the effects of the incident wave current field 46 α tan 1 t z z φ p w x φ p w u 1 θ and provides us with an approximation of the instantaneous angle of attack which is important to identify unsteady flow separation and dynamic stall effects see e g hover et al 2004 the amplitude of the angle of attack is also calculated as α 0 max α min α 2 in cases where the two input frequencies are different ω θ ω 1 we need to predict the characteristic period t of the phenomenon required to perform the above calculations from the systematic analysis of the output of the simulations it is seen that 5 principal harmonics are involved in the lift time signal ω max ω min ω max ω min ω max ω min 2 ω max where ω min min ω ω θ ω max max ω ω θ sorting the harmonics in ascending order ω i i 1 5 and denoting with δ ω i ω i 1 ω i i 1 4 the steps between successive frequencies the characteristic period of lift is estimated to be t 2 π δ ω where δ ω is the greatest common divisor of all δ ω i for all the cases studied in the present work we have chosen ω max ω min 1 m 1 n n m 1 2 3 ensuring that δ ω ω min n and values of the results at intermediate values ω max ω min are approximated by interpolation ensuring that the interpolated results belong to the convex hull of the calculated data 3 2 boundary integral formulation using the green s representation theorem filippas and belibassakis 2014 for points on the free surface the body and the bottom surface we obtain the following expressions of the potential φ f b h x 0 z 0 t and its normal derivative on the boundary written compactly as follows 47 1 2 φ f b h x 0 z 0 t d b t b x z t g x 0 z 0 x z φ b x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z d f n φ f x z t g x 0 z 0 x z φ f x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z d h n φ h g x 0 z 0 x z φ h n g x 0 z 0 x z d s d w μ w x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z where g x 0 z 0 x z 2 π 1 ln r x 0 z 0 x z is the fundamental solution of 2d laplace equation with x 0 z 0 denoting the field point and x z is the integration point the normal derivative on the boundary is defined by n g x 0 z 0 x z n g x 0 z 0 x z a similar representation theorem can also be derived for the stream function associated with the disturbance field ψ which is also a harmonic function the field values of the stream function can be expressed in terms of the boundary values of ψ and its normal derivative n ψ as follows 48 p ψ f b h x 0 z 0 t d b t n ψ b g x 0 z 0 x z ψ b n g x 0 z 0 x z d s d f n ψ f x z t g x 0 z 0 x z ψ f x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z d h n ψ h x z t g x 0 z 0 x z ψ h x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z

connected through the cauchy riemann relations we are able to derive expressions on the boundary as follows 50 s ψ n φ n ψ s φ where s denotes the tangential coordinate and the boundary values of ψ can be calculated by integration 51 ψ ψ 0 d s ψ d s ψ 0 d n φ d s where ψ 0 is a known value at a specific point on the boundary which can be set equal to zero using eqs 49 and 50 in eq 48 we finally obtain a formula for the representation of the stream function in terms of the boundary values of the potential and its normal derivative in the sequel eq 47 is used in conjunction with a boundary element method filippas and belibassakis 2014 to derive a discrete version of the dirichlet to neumann map dtn for the hydrodynamic problem then using eqs 47 and 48 in the free surface boundary conditions and the pressure type kutta condition see appendix a set of odes is derived governing the dynamics of the system along with eq 45 3 3 boundary element method using a low order panel method the body boundary is replaced with a closed polygonal line with n b denoting the number of panels also the free surface and the bottom and the wake are approximated by n f n b and n w t straight line segments respectively the potential its normal derivative and the potential jump on the wake at each time step are approximated by piecewise constant distributions applying a collocation scheme and using the centre of each panel as collocation point where eq 47 are satisfied the following discrete system is obtained in matrix form see also filippas and belibassakis 2014 for a more detailed derivation of a similar set of equations 52 φ β n φ f φ h d b φ f n φ h p μ w z μ w 1 with 53 d d 11 d 12 d 13 d 21 d 22 d 23 d 31 d 32 d 33 p μ w p 1 μ w p 2 μ w p 3 μ w z z 1 z 2 z 3 in the above equations and in the sequel we will denote with bold quantities containing the values of piecewise constant hydrodynamic functions on the panels at various parts of the boundary also the matrices d p z are defined in terms of the induced factors that represent the potential at the midpoint of a panel due to a unit source or dipole distribution of another panel that are weakly singular boundary integrals and in the case of low order bem can be calculated analytically see e g katz and plotkin 1991 the above eqs 52 53 define a discrete dirichlet to neumann map dtn operator that connects the potential with its normal derivative at each collocation point on the boundaries d b d f and d h and also involves the unknown value of the dipole intensity μ w 1 of the first panel in the trailing vortex sheet d w we observe in the above equations that the influence of the wake associated with memory effects is taken into account through p μ w and the effect of the incident wave and the current through the components n φ p w and v included in b as described by the body boundary condition eq 35 the free surface boundary conditions are written in discrete form as follows 54 t φ f g η d u x φ f s ψ f φ f n φ f μ w φ β 55 t η n φ f d u x η where the vectors φ f η denote the discrete values of the potential and free surface elevation on each panel the values of the vector function s ψ f are expressed in terms of φ f n φ f η μ w and φ β by discretizing eq 48 in conjunction with low order bem the horizontal derivatives appearing in eqs 54 and 55 are approximated by a finite difference scheme on the horizontal plane and the finite difference operator applied on φ f η f is defined as follows 56 d u x 1 2 δ x u 1 0 0 0 u i 0 0 0 u n f 3 4 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 4 3 also the vertical derivative of the potential n φ f in kinematic free surface boundary condition can be expressed in terms of φ f η μ w 1 by using the appropriate part of the dtn map eq 52 as follows 57 t η d 22 φ f d u x η z 2 μ w 1 d 21 b p 2 μ w where the term d 23 n φ h is zero due to the homogenous neumann boundary condition on the impermeable bottom eq 36 moreover the nonlinear pressure type kutta condition is put in discrete form permitting to obtain an extra equation for the dipole distribution μ w 1 on the hydrofoil wake in the vicinity of the trailing edge and details are included in the appendix using the latter in conjunction with the above equations we finally obtain a system of odes in the form of 58 t y f y where y φ f η μ w 1 t where the vector function f is defined by the discretized form of the free surface boundary conditions eqs 54 and 57 and kutta condition see appendix eq a8 finally eq 58 can be numerically integrated in order to predict the evolution of the dynamic variables φ f η and μ w 1 on the basis of information at previous time steps in conjunction with the history of the wake dipole intensity μ w included in p and the data b v n b v b n b calculated at each time step from the incident wave and shear current field eq 4 and the hydrofoil motion from the solution of eq 45 subsequently the present dtn map eq 52 is used to calculate the remaining unknown field values φ β n φ f and φ h after the solution has been obtained at each time step the pressure distribution is calculated through the bernoulli type equation eq 41 furthermore forces and moment are directly calculated through the integration of the instantaneous pressure on the hydrofoil boundary 3 4 time integration of the dynamical system starting from a prescribed initial condition a time stepping method is used to obtain the numerical solution of the problem concerning the disturbance potential φ x z t due to hydrofoil oscillation obtained by the solution of eq 45 and the incoming wave and current field v x z t the latter is defined each time step from the solution of cms eq 26 in conjunction with a ramp filter function which is used in order to smoothly start the numerical procedure for the time integration of the dynamical system described in sec 3 3 eq 58 after evaluation of different methods we found that the higher order adams bashford moulton predictor corrector method provides the required accuracy and efficiency the used scheme requires calculation of only two derivatives at each time and the error is of order δt5 where δt is the time step ensuring that good convergence is achieved an important task concerning the present time domain scheme for the foil hydrodynamics deals with the treatment of the horizontally infinite domain and the implementation of appropriate radiation type conditions at infinity the present work is based on the truncation of the domain and on the implementation of a perfectly matched layer pml model facilitating the numerical absorption of the waves reaching the left and right termination ends of the truncated domain with minimum reflection details about the time integration method stability and convergence of the present scheme as well as the pml absorbing model can be found in filippas and belibassakis 2014 3 5 solution of the coupled problem in the present section details are given concerning the iterative procedure developed for the hydroelastic coupling a similar iterative algorithm has been developed by manolas et al 2015 for the aeroelastic analysis of wind turbine blades with known the geometry and the parameters of operation of the biomimetic energy device we proceed to the solution for the foil vertical motion and providing the coupling with the boundary value problem governing the hydrodynamics as described in previous sections in particular eq 45 is approximated by using a 2nd order crank nicholson scheme as follows 59 z n 1 z n δ t 2 g n z n g n 1 z n 1 with 60 z n z n t z n t and 61 g n z n 1 0 ω 0 2 2 ς ω 0 z n 0 l z z n m the above scheme has been selected for the integration of eq 45 because it is found that it offers stability in all cases considered which is especially important for lifting bodies of small mass the calculation of lift l z requires information from the solution of the boundary value problem described at previous sections in order to proceed to the next time step we define 62 g z n 1 z n 1 z n δ t 2 g n z n g n 1 z n 1 and the implicit nonlinear system g z n 1 0 that is iteratively solved using a newton raphson numerical scheme as follows 63 z n 1 m 1 z n 1 m j g 1 g z n 1 m m 0 1 where j g is the jacobian matrix of g approximated by using second order central differences in this way we assure that dynamic equilibrium of the oscillator is satisfied at each time step with prescribed accuracy at a given time step the position of the foil is determined and the boundary velocities the dtn operator and the coefficients of the dynamical system are calculated then by integration of system as described in sec 3 3 3 4 the various hydrodynamic quantities are calculated including the lift force by integration of pressure on the solid boundary thus the right hand side of eq 62 is obtained more specifically at each time step newton raphson iterations start by using an explicit time integrator scheme for the initial prediction of the foil position and the boundary velocities involved in the body boundary condition b eq 35 then the dtn operator is calculated as well as the coefficients of the dynamical system and a prediction for the lift coefficient c l z n 1 is obtained next the terms g n 1 g z n 1 m and j g 1 are calculated and newton raphson iterations continue until convergence 4

subsequently simulations of the biomimetic system in waves and currents and results from systematic analysis are presented aiming at the investigation of the operational parameters more specifically in sec 4 1 present method results for oscillating hydrofoil in infinite domain are compared against results from the literature with both inviscid and viscous solvers in sec 4 2 the operation of the system in waves and currents in nearshore environment is illustrated and various distributed and integrated quantities of interest for a selected combination of the environmental and operational parameter are presented finally we examine the effect of operational parameters sec 4 3 and of the environmental parameters sec 4 4 to the performance of the biomimetic flapping foil energy device 4 1 validation of the method in the case of a thin naca0005 oscillating hydrofoil in infinite domain in fig 7 we compare present method calculations against results obtained by zhu et al 2009 where a a 3d bem using a foil with aspect ratio 10 and b linear 2d thin hydrofoil theory are applied under the assumption that the mass of the foil is small in comparison with the added mass and using zero stiffness for the elastic connector the foil is rotating about its pivot axis located at a distance x r c 0 5 from the leading edge with pitching amplitude θ 0 10 and the damping coefficient is b 2 π present method results are shown for three values of nondimensional mass parameter m 0 001 0 5 1 in particular in fig 7 a the heaving amplitude z 0 of the system is plotted showing quite good agreement with both methods of zhu et al 2009 for a wide range of reduced frequency also concerning the mass parameter m it is observed that its effect to heaving response is negligible on the other hand in fig 7 b in the case of net power extraction coefficient η p which is influenced from the pitching moment that is a more sensitive quantity good agreement is obtained for low and moderate reduced frequencies at large values of frequency where inertial effects become more important we observe that the overestimation of added mass as provided by the linearized theory used by zhu et al 2009 leads to overestimation of net power extraction next in fig 8 a comparison is shown between present method and recent computations by wu et al 2015 based on an immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm in this case a semi activated naca0015 hydrofoil is examined operating in a very low reynolds number re 1100 performing enforced pitching motion with large amplitude θ 0 30 about a rotation axis located at distance x r c 0 33 from the leading edge at reduced frequency k r 0 5655 and the characteristics of the oscillator are m 1 b π k 1 the present inviscid method overestimates the lift and moment coefficients due to the fact that viscous phenomena like leading edge separation and dynamic stall are neglected however the differences are reasonable taking into account the fact that in the examined case the reynolds number is very low and the instantaneous angle of attack becomes large the maximum value of the effective angle of attack is a 17 19 finally concerning free surface incident wave and finite depth effects the validation of the present method has been presented in filippas and belibassakis 2014 for the case of a flapping foil propulsor where comparisons are presented in cases of uniform current and flat bottom against linear theory by grue et al 1988 and cfd predictions by de silva and yamaguchi 2012 with very good results 4 2 numerical simulation of the biomimetic energy system in waves and currents in the sequel we apply the proposed method to study the performance of a naca0012 hydrofoil as flow and wave energy converter operating in nearshore regions we consider here a hydrofoil of chord c operating in a coastal region in the presence of propagating waves and vertically sheared currents over the shoaling environment that is presented in sec 2 2 in the simulations it is assumed that the component of the stream function associated with the disturbance potential is small and it is approximately set ψ u ψ p w in the examined case the strouhal number of the incident waves is s t ω h 1 g 0 4 and the wave amplitude is h 2 c 0 3 we recall that the current speed at the entrance of the domain corresponds to bathymetric froude number f d u g h 1 0 05 and the maximum shear in the middle of the domain where the hydrofoil is located is s max 0 05 s 1 the hydrofoil operates around a mean submergence depth d c 2 and performs enforced pitching and induced heaving oscillations τhe pitching motion is about a rotation axis at distance x r c 0 33 from the leading edge with amplitude θ 0 15 in general the oscillation frequency ω θ can be different from the incident wave frequency ω in the present section we consider one case where ω θ ω 1 with corresponding reduced frequency k r 0 267 and phase difference between pitch and the incoming wave equal to ψ 40 and another case with ω θ ω 2 k r ω θ c 2 u 0 533 and ψ 90 in the examined cases the following oscillator parameters are used m 4 ζ 0 5 ω 0 ω 2 first in fig 9 we consider an example of equal wave and pitching frequency ω θ ω 1 and ψ 40 results are presented at various instances in a period t concerning the position of the foil together with dipole intensities in the vortex wake denoted with red arrows as well as the calculated instantaneous pressure coefficient c p on the flapping foil and the free surface elevation η with red stars we denote the absorbing layer zone integrating the pressure distribution on the hydrofoil boundary we obtain the force and the moment and subsequently exploiting information about the enforced pitching and induced heaving velocities the input and output power of the system is calculated in the case ω θ ω 1 and ψ 40 in fig 10 a the foil s rotational motion θ against the resulting effective angle of attack α is shown and in fig 10 b the time history of the developed lift coefficient c l is plotted together with the moment coefficient c m required for the enforced pitching motion and the normalized heaving response ζ c in fig 10 b the non linear character of the responses are clearly observed in the shape of the time signals with the maximum values of heaving oscillation being comparable to the chord length z max c 0 95 the input power coefficient c p θ and the output power coefficient c p b of the considered system operating in the above conditions are presented in fig 10 c we observe that the extracted energy with mean value c p b 0 281 denoted with continuous thick line is significant especially as compared to the power needed for controlling the pitching foil motion with corresponding average pitching power coefficient c p θ 0 013 denoted with dashed thick line resulting in the examined case to a net power extraction coefficient η p 20 the corresponding time signals in the case of different pitching and wave frequency ω θ ω 2 and ψ 90 are presented in fig 11 in this case the foil performs two cycles of motion in one wave period with larger power extraction during the second cycle when the crest of the wave occurs over the foil although the mean output power coefficient compared to the previous case is slightly smaller c p b 0 237 and the corresponding input power coefficient is larger c p θ 0 021 the performance of the system is better η p 33 due to the smaller induced heav ing motion z max c 0 33 in the sequel we will demonstrate that even larger amounts of energy can be extracted from waves and sheared currents with proper selection and control of the operational parameters without reaching large angles of attack avoiding thus excessive flow separation and unfavorable dynamic stall effects 4 3 investigation of the operational parameters in this section we investigate the effects of the operational parameters of the present energy converter using the same environmental parameters sheared current and wave as in sec 4 2 for a specific value of incident wave frequency ω the average net power coefficient η p and the maximum amplitudes of the effective angle of attack α 0 and the heaving motion z 0 are shown in fig 12 using contour plots in that figure the effect of the frequency of pitching oscillation ω θ and the phase difference ψ between the free surface elevation and the foil pitch are examined for specific pitch amplitude θ 0 15 0 and oscillator parameters m 4 ζ 0 5 ω 0 ω 2 concerning the net power coefficient fig 12 a in the examined range of parameters it varies from η p 7 5 to η p 33 3 with greater values at larger frequencies of the foil s pitch obtaining its maximum value at ω θ ω 2 on the other hand the angle of attack fig 12 b and the heaving amplitude fig 12 c follow in general the opposite trend the reduction of heaving amplitude response at large frequencies is common even in purely linear oscillators and can be predicted also by linear theory in infinite domain as shown by zhu et al 2009 fig 4 a the increase in the power extraction coefficient at large frequencies is also reasonable and have been noticed by zhu et al 2009 fig 4 c this can be explained by the fact that when the pitching frequency raises the system operates in much smaller vertical regions due to the smaller induced heave amplitude while the absorbing power increases and in the same time the pitching power cost is still not large enough see e g zhu et al 2009 fig 5 moreover in fig 12 we observe that there are two maximum values of the efficiency located at regions where pitching frequency is integer multiple of the wave frequency as expected because the system is excited by two different frequencies the global maximum of the power extraction coefficient η p 33 fig 12 a is obtained at the vicinity of ω θ ω 2 ψ 90 0 where the maximum angle of attack equals α 0 7 5 attaining reasonable values fig 12 b and the heaving amplitude is rather small z 0 c 0 32 fig 12 c another local peak is noticed for ω θ ω 1 ψ 40 0 however the value of the net power extraction is less η p 20 corresponding to larger still reasonable angle of attack α 0 9 6 and much larger heaving amplitude z 0 c 0 67 for both the above cases ω θ ω 1 2 the phase difference ψ between pitching motion and the waves adjusts the angle of attack α 0 eq 46 and larger power extraction is obtained when ψ maximizes the angle of attack α 0 fig 12 a c in the sequel we will focus on cases corresponding to the region of the global maximum of η p where larger amounts of energy can be extracted by the examined system with reasonable values of the angle of attack in fig 13 we demonstrate the effect of the amplitude of pitching motion θ 0 for ω θ ω 2 and the phase difference between foil s pitch and the waves selected in the region where the global maximum appears ψ 90 40 in the region of the parameters studied here we observe a monotonic increase in η p α 0 z 0 see fig 13 a b c respectively as θ 0 increases for the whole interval of ψ with the maximum of the net power extraction reaching the level of η p 53 5 for θ 0 25 and ψ around 100 0 that monotonic behavior is expected and has been noticed by other researchers using either linear theory or bem in infinite domain see e g zhu et al 2009 fig 6 in this case the max angle of attack attains moderate value α 0 11 4 and the heaving amplitude is z 0 c 0 59 indicating that the biomimetic wave current energy device would lead to significant power output with proper selection of the control parameters although in a realistic setup a pitching amplitude of θ 0 25 corresponding to a moderate amplitude of the angle of attack α 0 11 4 seems a reasonable choice in the present study a more consevartive selection is used θ 0 15 resulting in lower maximum angle of attack α 0 7 5 and preventing flow separation and dynamic stall effects 4 4 investigation of the environmental parameters in the final section we examine the effects of the incident wave current field and the mean vertical position of the foil on the performance of the system in the shoaling environment of sec 2 2 as before the strouhal number of the incident wave is s t 0 4 the foil s pitching motion parameters are ω θ ω 2 θ 0 15 and the sheared current characteristics are f d u g h 1 0 05 s max 0 05 s 1 also the oscillator parameters are m 4 ζ 0 5 ω 0 ω 2 in fig 14 the effect of the wave amplitude h 2 c on the operation of the system is shown for a range of foil wave phase difference ψ in fig 14 a we observe that the net power coefficient varies from η p 27 to η p 38 with the global maximum at a region where the angle of attack becomes α 0 15 it is seen that with proper selection of the phase difference between the waves and foil s pitch with optimum value around ψ 90 0 the power extraction coefficient remains above η p 33 for any wave amplitude h 2 c in the studied interval in the previous optimum region smaller angle of attack and heaving response are obtained see fig 14 b c respectively when wave amplitude decreases without loss in power extraction efficiency concerning the induced heave amplitude ζ 0 and the resulting angle of attack α 0 in general they increase along with the wave amplitude and this is reasonable because greater amounts of environmental energy is transformed to heaving motion resulting also greater angles of attack in an amount that depends on the adjustment of the foil wave phase difference ψ see also the relevant discussion in the previous paragraph and the definition of the effective angle of attack eq 46 searching deeper the effect of the phase difference ψ in the region about ψ 90 0 pitching excitation leads to a heaving response at a phase difference of 180 with the wave i e foil s vertical velocity is in opposite direction to the corresponding wave velocity resulting to greater angles of attack and smaller heaving amplitudes due the waves again in the aforementioned case ψ 90 0 the system operates in a smaller vertical region and with significant power extraction due to the adequate values of the angle of attack and concurrently the pitching power cost is still not large enough explaining the maximum values of the net power coefficient in that region see fig 14 a a significant benefit of flapping foil energy devices arises from their ability to operate in relatively small vertical region in comparison with conventional flow turbines in this way they support the design of multicomponent systems with many horizontal foils in parallel arrangement rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 fig 2 wu et al 2015 increasing in this way the performance of such enhanced biomimetic systems next in fig 15 for the same set up and ψ 90 0 the effect of incident wave ω and pitching frequency ω θ is examined it is illustrated that for waves with frequencies less than ω ω 0 0 95 the local maxima of the net power extraction are located around ω θ ω 2 indicated by the dashed line in fig 15 a for comparison the cases studied so far sec 4 1 4 3 correspond to ω ω 0 0 5 and ω θ ω 0 1 an interesting result is that there exists a region for ω ω 0 0 95 close to ω θ ω 1 shown by a dashed circle in fig 15 a where high levels of power extraction η p 40 are achieved with very small angles of attack α 0 6 5 and moderate heaving amplitude ζ 0 c 0 45 see fig 15 b c respectively the peaks in the responses heaving response z 0 resulting angle of attack α 0 power extraction coefficient η p appearing at ω θ ω 1 and ω θ ω 2 can be physically interpreted using the basic principles of the theory of dynamic systems and linear hydrofoil theory first of all the lift actuating the heaving oscillator right hand side of eq 46 can be decomposed in the context of linear theory into i terms that oscillate with pitching frequency ω θ see e g zhu et al 2009 eq 5 and ii other terms oscillating with the wave frequency ω therefore the present system response peaks are expected for pitching frequency near an integer multiple of the wave frequency which is reasonable for dynamical systems under bichromatic excitation moreover the oscillatory behavior of the responses in the vicinity of ω θ ω ℓ ℓ i n as e g for the case of ω θ ω 2 which is also clearly illustrated in fig 16 is justified by the appearance of parametric resonance in fact analyzing again the developed lift force on the foil by means of linear hydrofoil theory see e g zhu et al 2009 eq 5 terms proportional to heaving acceleration are observed oscillating with pitching frequency ω θ which are clearly added mass terms the rest excitation forces contain the lift induced by the waves which is therefore at frequency ω thus the added mass of the system and consequently its natural frequency oscillates at ω θ which is responsible for the manifestation of parametric resonance phenomena see e g fossen nijmeijer 2012 a more detailed investigation of the above linear and non linear aspects concerning the dynamic behavior of the present system will be subject of future work finally in fig 16 the effects of shear on η p α 0 and z 0 are presented for three values of the hydrofoil mean submergence depth d we observe in fig 16 a c that the performance η p and the amplitude of heaving motion z 0 present a linear increase with maximum shear coefficient s max due to the increase of the local current velocity near the foil with s max as noted in fig 16 a for d c 2 when s max increases from 0 05 s 1 to 0 1 s 1 the froude number near the foil f f o i l takes values from 0 12 to 0 134 with the present selection of the parameters and especially the phase difference ψ incident waves have positive effect on total power extraction however as also demonstrated in fig 16 as the foil submergence depth increases the power output of the present system decreases due to the decay in depth of water waves to summarize in the present feasibility study it is demonstrated that using biomimetic systems in the examined arrangement significant energy can be extracted from sea currents and the efficiency of the device can be further enhanced by exploiting wave energy in particular for moderate values of the wave frequency parameter st 0 4 significant efficiency can be achieved for both equal wave and pitching frequencies ω θ ω 1 and in the case where the two input frequencies are different ω θ ω 1 depending on the environmental conditions an evidence is given that the local maxima of the efficiency are obtained when pitching frequency is an integer multiple of the wave frequency also optimal values of the phase difference between pitching motion and waves for the studied setup with ω θ ω 1 2 are identified near ψ 40 0 90 0 respectively moreover in the region of the studied parameters an increase in pitching amplitude θ 0 results in monotonic increase of efficiency and the net power extraction may reach the level of η p 53 5 for θ 0 25 and ψ around 100 0 even for smaller pitching amplitude θ 0 15 preventing large angles of attack and avoiding flow separation and dynamic stall effects it is demonstrated that the performance remains good of the order 35 furthemore examining the effect of the wave amplitude together with the wave foil phase difference it is observed that with proper selection of ψ e g ψ 100 0 for ω θ ω 2 the power extraction coefficient remains significant η p 33 for any wave amplitude providing robust operation of the system for higher values of the wave frequency 0 4 st 0 9 a very important observation is that a region exists close to ω θ ω 1 where high level of power extraction η p 40 is achieved with very small angles of attack α 0 6 5 and moderate heaving amplitude ζ 0 c 0 45 the identification of such regions of optimum operation is important for the design of the studied biomimetic energy device 5 conclusions oscillating hydrofoils in waves and currents are investigated as novel biomimetic systems for extraction and exploitation of this kind of marine renewable energy the present method takes into account the effect of the wavy free surface and the variable bathymetry through the satisfaction of the corresponding boundary conditions as well as the velocity component due to waves and sheared currents with linear vertical profile on the formation of the incident flow an example of the system operating over a variable bathymetry region of the form of smooth shoal is considered and a wide range of parameters is studied including the velocity of the current and the shear the frequency and the amplitude of the incident waves the mean submergence of the foil the pitching amplitude phase difference with respect to the waves and corresponding frequency that can be different from wave frequency numerical results concerning the extracted power and the operability characteristics of the system are presented indicating that significant output can be obtained and the improvement due to wave energy extraction is significant the present method could be found useful for the design and control of such biomimetic systems operating in the nearshore coastal region and extracting energy from waves and ambient sheared currents future work includes the examination of non harmonic pitching motion and irregular waves very important is also the investigation of the performance of enhanced biomimetic energy systems such as multicomponent flapping foil arrangements also the extension of the method to three dimensions will support study of the system in realistic topographies and

around a hydrofoil the problem is supplemented by the kutta condition necessitating zero pressure jump at the trailing edge that condition can be expressed by applying bernoulli s equation eq 41 on both sides of the foil while approximating the trailing edge next applying first order differences we can approximate the gradient of the potential on the body boundary fig 17 using the values of the

23532,the performance of oscillating hydrofoils in the presence of waves and currents is studied for the exploitation of combined renewable marine energy sources in nearshore and coastal regions the system operates as a semi activated biomimetic energy device with imposed pitching motion and induced heaving motion in harmonic incident waves and flow except of uniform currents also vertically sheared currents are considered the analysis is based on a coupled mode system in conjunction with a time domain bem taking into account the effect of the wavy free surface the velocity due to waves and currents on the formation of the incident flow and the effects of variable bathymetry results are presented concerning the performance of the system for a wide range of parameters including cases where the wave frequency is different from the pitching frequency of the hydrofoil it is indicated that significant energy can be extracted and that the power gain from the waves increases well above the maximum values predicted for the system in uniform flow the present method can be applied to the design and optimum control of such biomimetic systems operating in the nearshore coastal region and extracting energy from waves in the presence of ambient currents keywords biomimetic system marine energy coastal environment waves and sheared currents variable bathymetry 1 introduction interaction of water waves with varying currents in variable bathymetry regions is important for a variety of engineering applications including effects of waves on structures coastal management and harbor maintenance as well as design and development of systems for exploitation of marine renewable energy resources extensive analysis concerning wave current interaction in the nearshore and coastal regions have been presented by peregrine 1976 jonsson 1990 soulsby 1990 thomas and klopman 1997 recent information can also be found in the corresponding sections of reviewing articles battjes 2006 cavaleri et al 2007 for the prediction of wave seabed current interaction coupled mode models have been recently developed with application to the propagation scattering of water waves over variable bathymetry regions in the presence of spatially varying currents extending previous simplified mild slope mild shear models that are applicable to cases of slowly varying bathymetry and current see belibassakis et al 2011 also the problem of transformation of the directional spectrum of an incident wave system over a region of strongly varying three dimensional bottom topography is further studied in belibassakis et al 2014 where also the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled mode method is tested comparing numerical predictions against experimental data and calculations by phase averaged model swan booij et al 1999 in the case of slowly varying environmental currents where the vertical structure of the boundary layer in the nearshore and coastal region could occupy the entire depth as in the case of tidal currents the wave vorticity interaction is known to have a significant influence on wave dynamics in this direction various models for surface waves interacting with vertically sheared current have been developed see e g kirby 1984 nwogu 2009 touboul et al 2016 and the references cited there the mutual existence of waves with currents in nearshore regions offers a motivation for comprehensive investigation of such resources and the development of hybrid technological devices based on biomimetic systems see e g http www biopowersystems com biostream html the latter could be found useful for the efficient exploitation of this type of combined marine renewables enhancing the power extraction which is important especially in areas characterized by low wave potential recent research and development results concerning flapping wing systems supported also by extensive experimental evidence and theoretical analysis have shown that such systems operating under conditions of optimal wake formation could achieve high levels of efficiency see e g triantafyllou et al 2000 read et al 2003 triantafyllou et al 2004 schouveiler et al 2005 and rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 for extensive review however the complexity of kinematics of flapping wings necessitates the development of sophisticated power transmission mechanisms and control devices as compared to the standard hydrodynamic systems such as water turbines and marine propellers in the last decade biomimetic flapping foil devices have been extensively studied as flow energy converters for a detailed review see xiao and zhu 2014 in the majority of these works the foil is considered in infinite domain and the current flow as the only source of environmental energy ignoring the effects of free surface and incident waves xiao and zhu 2014 classified those studies into three categories with respect to the activation mechanism of the flapping foil the first category includes systems with prescribed rotational pitching and translatory heaving oscillatory motions of the foil the second category includes semi activated systems with forced pitching motion and induced heaving oscillations and the last one includes self sustained systems with induced motions at both degrees of freedom the majority of the studies belong to the first group while semi activated and self sustained systems have not been explored extensively and moreover the semi activated systems seem to be a more feasible approach in practice concerning semi activated systems shimizu et al 2008 and zhu and peng 2009 using navier stokes solvers studied the performance of a flapping foil as current energy converter moreover the system was studied in the potential flow framework by zhu et al 2009 using 2 d thin foil theory and 3 d bem demonstrated that 3 d effects would decrease the absorbed power while ground effect could minimize that loss also experimental studies were conducted by huxham et al 2012 at small scale in a water tunnel with promising results in a recent work wu et al 2015 two auxiliary smaller hydrofoils were employed to enhance the performance of the main flapping foil energy converter by employing mechanisms of induced vortex interaction although a few works concerning semi activated systems have been published there exists an important limitation the assumption that the incident current flow is uniform and steady which is an oversimplification as also reported by xiao and zhu 2014 because tidal currents occurs with nonuniform vertical structure and also interact with free surface gravity waves and varying bathymetry the effects of incoming waves have been considered in studies of flapping foil propulsion and thrust augmentation it has been demonstrated that flapping foil thrusters operating in waves while travelling at constant forward speed are very efficient and could be exploited for augmenting the overall ship propulsion in waves by directly converting kinetic energy from ship motions to thrust see e g belibassakis and politis 2013 politis and politis 2014 belibassakis and filippas 2015 bøckmann and steen 2016 in previous works potential based panel methods and cfd tools have been developed for the hydrodynamic analysis of these systems including the effects of the free surface predictions are found to be in agreement with other methods and experimental data filippas and belibassakis 2014 de silva and yamaguchi 2012 also it has been demonstrated that significant energy can be extracted by the system and industrial initiatives have appeared for developing the flapping foil system for wave energy extraction and thrust production see e g http www seaspeed co uk news wave foil developments the present work is focused on the investigation of oscillating hydrofoils in the presence of waves and sheared currents examined as biomimetic systems for extraction and exploitation of this kind of marine renewables in nearshore regions operating as semi activated wave and flow energy device the pitching motion of the foil is appropriately tuned in order to develop heaving forces due to alternating lift and drive the hydraulic generator the hydrodynamic analysis is based on the coupled mode model presented by belibassakis et al 2017 for the propagation of waves in the presence of sheared currents in conjunction with time domain boundary element methods bem for the disturbance lifting flow developed by the hydrofoil in variable bathymetry the effect of the wavy free surface and variable bottom topography are taken into account through the satisfaction of the corresponding boundary conditions the present work is structured as follows in sec 2 the calculation of the incident wave current field in frequency domain by means of a coupled mode model is presented subsequently in sec 3 the lifting flow problem associated with the flapping foil is solved along with the dynamical heaving response of the foil where the mechanical system including the energy generator is modeled as an one degree of freedom oscillator the biomimetic system then is analyzed by means of a 2d time domain bem finally in sec 4 numerical results concerning the extracted power and the operability characteristics of the system in variable bathymetry are presented indicating that significant output can be obtained under general operating conditions the present method after further enhancements and verification can be applied to the design and optimum control of such biomimetic systems operating in the nearshore coastal region and extracting energy from waves in the presence of ambient currents 2 wave propagation in variable bathymetry in the presence of sheared currents we consider wave propagation in the presence of horizontal non homogeneous vertically sheared current in a variable bathymetry region for simplicity only the two dimensional problem corresponding to normally incident waves and current is considered in this work see fig 1 the current profile is linear in depth and the flow is assumed to vary slowly with respect to the horizontal direction and with the wave period as in the case of tidal and low frequency environmental flows and thus it may be considered steady at the scale of wave evolution moreover the current velocity is assumed to be small and thus the associated mean free surface elevation set down set up is also small the above constitutes the background flow component on the other hand the wave flow perturbing the background current flow is generated by an incident wave system coming from the far up wave region see fig 1 and is assumed to be irrotational a cartesian coordinate system is used having its origin at some point on the unperturbed free surface z 0 see fig 1 the current flow q u w satisfies the continuity equation x u z w 0 and the following boundary conditions 1 w u x h f 0 z h f x 2 w u x h 0 z h x where h x is the local depth and h f x denotes the free surface elevation associated with the background current flow using the fact that the current velocity has been assumed to be small h f x is a higher order quantity and the kinematic free surface boundary condition eq 1 can be linearized on the mean level z 0 also the current is assumed to be nearly horizontal and linearly varying in depth and thus it is represented as follows 3 u x z u x z s x w 0 where the first term u x corresponds to the value of the current on the surface that could be horizontally varying and the second term zs x corresponds to the component associated with the shear in the linear vertical profile it must be noted that in flow fields on the vertical plane with linearly sheared currents the vorticity production terms reduce to zero and the wave motion remains irrotational see e g nwogu 2009 using this fact the total velocity field in the presence of waves is decomposed as follows 4 v x z t u x z x φ p w x z t z φ p w x z t where φ p w x z t is the propagating wave potential in the presence of the vertically sheared current as shown by various authors see e g touboul et al 2016 sec 2 2 in this case the following approximate version of bernoulli

implicit nonlinearity to the wave current problem and iterations are necessary for their determination the local vertical eigenfunctions z n z x n 0 1 2 are given by 15 z 0 z x cosh k 0 x z h x cosh k

characteristic depth involved in the definition of the frequency parameter μ x in eq 14 is 18 2 d e tanh k 0 h k 0 using the representation eq 9 in conjunction with the properties of z n z x we obtain 19 z φ μ φ σ 0 x σ 2 x g φ on z 0 in order to proceed further we use now eqs 6 and 7 for the definition of the stream function in conjunction with the present local mode expansion of the wave

expressing the variation δ φ of the wave potential in terms of the variations of the modal amplitudes δ φ n we finally obtain the following coupled mode system cms of equations with respect to the unknown modal amplitudes φ n x n 1 0 1 2 providing the solution to the present linearised wave current problem 26 n 1 a m n x 2 φ n b m n x φ n c m n φ n z m z 0 g x u 2 x 2 φ n u g x s ψ 0 iω x u s ψ

dependent on the solution φ x z as follows 30 χ x arg φ x z 0 arg n 0 φ n x where arg denotes the argument of a complex number thus iterations are necessary for the determination of the horizontal distribution of the phase χ x the corresponding intrinsic frequencies σ and the frequency parameter μ which are involved in the calculation of the vertical eigenfunctions z n z n 0 1 2 and the coefficients of the cms eq 26 it is clear from eq 30 that all modes φ n x contribute to the phase χ x moreover the complex amplitude of the free surface elevation is obtained as follows 31 η 1 g i ω u x φ x 1 x 2 z 0 ψ 0 s we remark here that in the case of no current the above cms reduces exactly to the corresponding one presented by athanassoulis and belibassakis 1999 for studying linearized wave propagation over variable bathymetry regions also in the case of zero shear the present system reduces to the form derived by belibassakis et al 2011 and further exploited by belibassakis et al 2014 for the transformation of directional spectra over variable bathymetry regions in the presence of homogeneous in depth currents details concerning the fast convergence of the local mode series can be found in the above works additional information concerning the above model and its application to wave propagation in inhomogeneous environments in the presence of vertically sheared currents can be found in belibassakis et al 2017 2 2 waves propagating over a smooth shoal in the presence of sheared current as an example we consider a variable bathymetry region of the form of smooth shoal characterized by continuously decreasing depth from h 1 15 m to h 3 3 m see fig 2 the depth function presenting monotonic variation is defined by 32 h x h m 0 5 h 1 h 3 tanh α h x where the mean depth is h m 0 5 h 1 h 3 and the coefficient α h is selected so that the mean bottom slope is 6 and the max bottom slope 12 normally incident waves of nondimensional frequency s t ω h 1 g 0 4 are propagating in the variable bathymetry in the presence of sheared current the current speed at the entrance of the domain u corresponds to bathymetric froude number f d u g h 1 0 05 and the current distribution in the domain is calculated so that the mass flow rate is constant 33 u x u h 1 h x s x h x 2 where u x is also the surface current speed in this example the shear s x is selected to be distributed following a gaussian shape function becoming maximum s max 0 05 s 1 at the centre of the domain x 0 and zero at the ends of the variable bathymetry region x 1 2 250 m and together with the horizontal distribution of the current speed at the free surface are shown in fig 2 a by using dashed and solid lines respectively in the middle of the domain x x m 0 the current speed ranges from about 1 2 m s near the free surface and drops linearly to 0 8 m s at the bottom in this area the depth is h m 9 m and the corresponding mean froude number is significantly increased u m g h m 0 08 where u m u x m s x m h m 2 results concerning the calculated wave field in the presence of the above sheared current and bottom topography as obtained by the present cms eq 26 are shown in figs 3 and 4 calculations are based on a second order finite differences to discretize the equations in a uniform grid of 301 equidistant points on the horizontal axis and n m 5 modes for the wave expansion eq 9 which were enough for numerical convergence in particular the wave field is illustrated in fig 4 by using contour lines in the same plots the values of the normalized free surface elevation η h 2 where h denotes the incident wave height are also shown by using red lines a detail of the wave field is shown in fig 5 in the central subregion over the sloping seabed where the biomimetic energy device will be considered to operate we clearly observe in figs 4 and 5 that the wave field is very accurately resolved from the top to the bottom of the water column everywhere in the domain and the satisfaction of the bottom boundary condition illustrated by the fact that the equipotential lines intersect the bottom profile perpendicularly it must be also noted that the current significantly changes the wave characteristics and thus the consideration of shear in the current further modifies the wave field especially in the vicinity of the sloping bottom subregion see e g touboul et al 2016 in the examined case the wave conditions correspond to intermediate water depth in the domain due to very mild variation of parameters the calculated reflection coefficient in the case considered is quite small of the order 1 8 in the sequel we shall use the above example in order to study in detail and illustrate the performance of a biomimetic system consisted of a semi activated oscillating hydrofoil extracting energy simultaneously from waves and currents in the shoaling region of figs 3 and 4 in order to provide reference values for the combined potential in the middle of the domain see fig 3 where the biomimetic system will be considered to operate we mention here that in the case of the above wave and current conditions the total available power of the current flow per unit width in the transverse direction is of the order 2 kw m and the corresponding wave power per meter of wave height is 8 7 kw m in such cases the combined available potential is considered enough for one flapping foil of chord length of the order 1 2 m moderate span and good efficiency to reach output power values of the order of 50 kw moreover multicomponent systems with many horizontal foils in parallel arrangement rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 fig 2 wu et al 2015 increases the output power to levels comparable to tidal turbines of corresponding size 3 flapping hydrofoil as a biomimetic energy device in waves and currents we now consider the biomimetic system bs in fig 1 operating as a combined wave and current energy device in the variable bathymetry region the system is modeled as an oscillating semi activated hydrofoil of chord c with controlled rotational pitching oscillations and induced vertical heaving motion which is elastically connected to the energy generator subsystem see fig 6 under the assumption of small wave amplitude the disturbance flow due to oscillating foil is formulated as a time dependent problem characterized by a moving foil boundary d b t with respect to the earth fixed frame of reference the configuration does not operate very close to the free surface and thus the linearized free surface boundary conditions are considered a good approximation however the motion of the foil and the pressure type kutta condition are not linearized the total velocity field v t x z t consists of the incident wave and current flow v x z t and the disturbance flow due to the oscillating hydrofoil φ x z t we recall here that the incident flow velocity contains the sheared current velocity q u w u x s x z 0 and the propagating wave component φ p w x z t where the wave potential is given by eq 8 the disturbance potential φ x z t corresponds to a lifting flow and satisfies the 2d laplace equation 34 2 φ x z t 0 x z d supplemented by the body boundary condition 35 n φ x z t v n b v b n b b x z d b where n φ φ n v q φ p w and the right hand side of the neumann boundary condition is denoted by b the second term in eq 35 is a coupling term between the present boundary value problem and the dynamics of the oscillating hydrofoil described in more detail in sec 3 1 in the present case the location of the body boundary d b t as well as the velocity on the boundary v b is part of the solution introducing additional nonlinearity to the problem the bottom no entrance boundary condition is also imposed expressed in terms of the normal derivative of the disturbance field on the seabed 36 n φ 0 z h x or z φ x z t x h x x φ x z t 0 z h x moreover the linearized dynamic and kinematic free surface boundary conditions are satisfied on the mean free surface level 37 t φ x z t u x x φ x z t g η x t s x ψ x z t z 0 38 t η x t n φ x z t u x x η x t z 0 where φ n x z t φ z x z t where ψ is the stream function of the disturbance field in lifting flows around bodies the problem is supplemented by the kutta condition necessitating zero pressure jump at the trailing edge that condition is used in conjunction with the dynamic and kinematic conditions on the trailing vortex sheet stating that the pressure and the normal velocity are continuous through the trailing vortex wake 39 p u x z t p l x z t x z d w 40 n φ u x z t n φ l x z t x z d w we treat the above problem as an initial boundary value problem and we assume that the disturbance field due to the presence of the body vanishes at large distances in the above equations η x t denotes the free surface elevation associated with the disturbance field d is the mean submergence of the hydrofoil and n is the unit normal vector pointing into the interior of d the unsteady pressure field including the wave component and the disturbance due to the oscillating hydrofoil is calculated by the following approximate bernoulli type equation see eq 5 41 p p a ρ t φ u q φ u 1 2 φ u 2 s ψ u g z where φ u φ p w φ and ψ u ψ p w ψ is the corresponding stream function for more details concerning the derivation of the above equation see touboul et al 2016 belibassakis et al 2017 using eqs 39 and 40 in conjunction with the above form of approximate bernoulli type equation eq 41 we obtain the following formula 42 d μ w x z t d t 0 x z d w where μ w φ u φ l denotes the potential jump the dipole intensity on the free wake and d d t t v m is the material derivative based on the mean velocity v m on the trailing vortex sheet the above relation states that d w evolves in time as a material surface moving with the mean velocity the vortex sheet can be approximated by a simplified wake model which is derived by setting v m q resulting in a sinusoidal shape emanating at the trailing edge of the oscillating hydrofoil see also politis 2016 the above formulation provides satisfying predictions in the case of low and moderate unsteadiness and has been used in previous works for the study of flapping foil propulsion systems operating beneath the free surface in harmonic and multichromatic waves as well as for the study of energy extraction from the wave induced ship motions in real sea states and direct conversion to thrust more details concerning the present formulation as well as validation of the boundary element method bem and numerical performance can be found in our previous works see e g filippas and belibassakis 2014 and belibassakis and filippas 2015 3 1 motion of the semi activated hydrofoil the motion of the hydrofoil consists of a harmonic pitching oscillation 43 θ t θ ο cos ω θ t ψ with angular frequency ω θ possibly different than the wave frequency and amplitude θ ο and the induced vertical oscillatory motion z t the angular pitching motion is defined with respect to a pivot point selected near the pressure centre of the hydrofoil usually on the chord and at a distance x r c 3 from the leading edge in the present case the pitching motion and thus the angle of attack is controlled and the response of the examined system is the power extracted by the vertical oscillations 44 p b b t z t 2 the induced vertical oscillations are obtained as the response of a complex structural mechanism including the generator driven by the hydrodynamic lift in the present work it is modeled as a single degree of freedom hydroelastic system assuming that the system has an equivalent mass m and stiffness k while the generator is modeled by an equivalent damping coefficient b as follows 45 t t z 2 ζ ω 0 t z ω 0 2 z l z m with ω 0 k m ζ b 2 m k in the above equation ω 0 is the natural frequency and ζ the non dimensional damping ratio the vertical lift force l z is obtained through hydrodynamic pressure integration on the hydrofoil which depends on the response and it will be calculated along with the solution of the boundary value problem introducing an additional implicit nonlinearity due to the coupling moreover the following nondimensional mass damping and stiffness coefficients has been used by wu et al 2015 m m 0 5 ρ c 2 b b 0 5 ρ u c k k 0 5 ρ u 2 c c l l z 0 5 ρ u 2 c where in the present study u is the velocity of the current at the entrance of the domain other important non dimensional quantities are the pressure coefficient defined as c p p p a 0 5 ρ u 2 the moment coefficient about the pivot axis c m m 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 and the net power extraction coefficient η p p b p θ ρ u 3 z 0 where p θ m t θ is the input is the power required for the enforced pitching motion for the calculation of the output power coefficient the average value of the input and output power is needed obtained by averaging in one characteristic period moreover the amplitudes of heaving motion is approximated by the half of the maximum deviation during a characteristic periods i e z 0 max z min z 2 as concerns the hydrodynamics important parameters are the reduced frequency k r ω θ c 2 u and the effective angle of attack on the foil that includes the effects of the incident wave current field 46 α tan 1 t z z φ p w x φ p w u 1 θ and provides us with an approximation of the instantaneous angle of attack which is important to identify unsteady flow separation and dynamic stall effects see e g hover et al 2004 the amplitude of the angle of attack is also calculated as α 0 max α min α 2 in cases where the two input frequencies are different ω θ ω 1 we need to predict the characteristic period t of the phenomenon required to perform the above calculations from the systematic analysis of the output of the simulations it is seen that 5 principal harmonics are involved in the lift time signal ω max ω min ω max ω min ω max ω min 2 ω max where ω min min ω ω θ ω max max ω ω θ sorting the harmonics in ascending order ω i i 1 5 and denoting with δ ω i ω i 1 ω i i 1 4 the steps between successive frequencies the characteristic period of lift is estimated to be t 2 π δ ω where δ ω is the greatest common divisor of all δ ω i for all the cases studied in the present work we have chosen ω max ω min 1 m 1 n n m 1 2 3 ensuring that δ ω ω min n and values of the results at intermediate values ω max ω min are approximated by interpolation ensuring that the interpolated results belong to the convex hull of the calculated data 3 2 boundary integral formulation using the green s representation theorem filippas and belibassakis 2014 for points on the free surface the body and the bottom surface we obtain the following expressions of the potential φ f b h x 0 z 0 t and its normal derivative on the boundary written compactly as follows 47 1 2 φ f b h x 0 z 0 t d b t b x z t g x 0 z 0 x z φ b x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z d f n φ f x z t g x 0 z 0 x z φ f x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z d h n φ h g x 0 z 0 x z φ h n g x 0 z 0 x z d s d w μ w x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z where g x 0 z 0 x z 2 π 1 ln r x 0 z 0 x z is the fundamental solution of 2d laplace equation with x 0 z 0 denoting the field point and x z is the integration point the normal derivative on the boundary is defined by n g x 0 z 0 x z n g x 0 z 0 x z a similar representation theorem can also be derived for the stream function associated with the disturbance field ψ which is also a harmonic function the field values of the stream function can be expressed in terms of the boundary values of ψ and its normal derivative n ψ as follows 48 p ψ f b h x 0 z 0 t d b t n ψ b g x 0 z 0 x z ψ b n g x 0 z 0 x z d s d f n ψ f x z t g x 0 z 0 x z ψ f x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z d s x z d h n ψ h x z t g x 0 z 0 x z ψ h x z t n g x 0 z 0 x z

connected through the cauchy riemann relations we are able to derive expressions on the boundary as follows 50 s ψ n φ n ψ s φ where s denotes the tangential coordinate and the boundary values of ψ can be calculated by integration 51 ψ ψ 0 d s ψ d s ψ 0 d n φ d s where ψ 0 is a known value at a specific point on the boundary which can be set equal to zero using eqs 49 and 50 in eq 48 we finally obtain a formula for the representation of the stream function in terms of the boundary values of the potential and its normal derivative in the sequel eq 47 is used in conjunction with a boundary element method filippas and belibassakis 2014 to derive a discrete version of the dirichlet to neumann map dtn for the hydrodynamic problem then using eqs 47 and 48 in the free surface boundary conditions and the pressure type kutta condition see appendix a set of odes is derived governing the dynamics of the system along with eq 45 3 3 boundary element method using a low order panel method the body boundary is replaced with a closed polygonal line with n b denoting the number of panels also the free surface and the bottom and the wake are approximated by n f n b and n w t straight line segments respectively the potential its normal derivative and the potential jump on the wake at each time step are approximated by piecewise constant distributions applying a collocation scheme and using the centre of each panel as collocation point where eq 47 are satisfied the following discrete system is obtained in matrix form see also filippas and belibassakis 2014 for a more detailed derivation of a similar set of equations 52 φ β n φ f φ h d b φ f n φ h p μ w z μ w 1 with 53 d d 11 d 12 d 13 d 21 d 22 d 23 d 31 d 32 d 33 p μ w p 1 μ w p 2 μ w p 3 μ w z z 1 z 2 z 3 in the above equations and in the sequel we will denote with bold quantities containing the values of piecewise constant hydrodynamic functions on the panels at various parts of the boundary also the matrices d p z are defined in terms of the induced factors that represent the potential at the midpoint of a panel due to a unit source or dipole distribution of another panel that are weakly singular boundary integrals and in the case of low order bem can be calculated analytically see e g katz and plotkin 1991 the above eqs 52 53 define a discrete dirichlet to neumann map dtn operator that connects the potential with its normal derivative at each collocation point on the boundaries d b d f and d h and also involves the unknown value of the dipole intensity μ w 1 of the first panel in the trailing vortex sheet d w we observe in the above equations that the influence of the wake associated with memory effects is taken into account through p μ w and the effect of the incident wave and the current through the components n φ p w and v included in b as described by the body boundary condition eq 35 the free surface boundary conditions are written in discrete form as follows 54 t φ f g η d u x φ f s ψ f φ f n φ f μ w φ β 55 t η n φ f d u x η where the vectors φ f η denote the discrete values of the potential and free surface elevation on each panel the values of the vector function s ψ f are expressed in terms of φ f n φ f η μ w and φ β by discretizing eq 48 in conjunction with low order bem the horizontal derivatives appearing in eqs 54 and 55 are approximated by a finite difference scheme on the horizontal plane and the finite difference operator applied on φ f η f is defined as follows 56 d u x 1 2 δ x u 1 0 0 0 u i 0 0 0 u n f 3 4 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 4 3 also the vertical derivative of the potential n φ f in kinematic free surface boundary condition can be expressed in terms of φ f η μ w 1 by using the appropriate part of the dtn map eq 52 as follows 57 t η d 22 φ f d u x η z 2 μ w 1 d 21 b p 2 μ w where the term d 23 n φ h is zero due to the homogenous neumann boundary condition on the impermeable bottom eq 36 moreover the nonlinear pressure type kutta condition is put in discrete form permitting to obtain an extra equation for the dipole distribution μ w 1 on the hydrofoil wake in the vicinity of the trailing edge and details are included in the appendix using the latter in conjunction with the above equations we finally obtain a system of odes in the form of 58 t y f y where y φ f η μ w 1 t where the vector function f is defined by the discretized form of the free surface boundary conditions eqs 54 and 57 and kutta condition see appendix eq a8 finally eq 58 can be numerically integrated in order to predict the evolution of the dynamic variables φ f η and μ w 1 on the basis of information at previous time steps in conjunction with the history of the wake dipole intensity μ w included in p and the data b v n b v b n b calculated at each time step from the incident wave and shear current field eq 4 and the hydrofoil motion from the solution of eq 45 subsequently the present dtn map eq 52 is used to calculate the remaining unknown field values φ β n φ f and φ h after the solution has been obtained at each time step the pressure distribution is calculated through the bernoulli type equation eq 41 furthermore forces and moment are directly calculated through the integration of the instantaneous pressure on the hydrofoil boundary 3 4 time integration of the dynamical system starting from a prescribed initial condition a time stepping method is used to obtain the numerical solution of the problem concerning the disturbance potential φ x z t due to hydrofoil oscillation obtained by the solution of eq 45 and the incoming wave and current field v x z t the latter is defined each time step from the solution of cms eq 26 in conjunction with a ramp filter function which is used in order to smoothly start the numerical procedure for the time integration of the dynamical system described in sec 3 3 eq 58 after evaluation of different methods we found that the higher order adams bashford moulton predictor corrector method provides the required accuracy and efficiency the used scheme requires calculation of only two derivatives at each time and the error is of order δt5 where δt is the time step ensuring that good convergence is achieved an important task concerning the present time domain scheme for the foil hydrodynamics deals with the treatment of the horizontally infinite domain and the implementation of appropriate radiation type conditions at infinity the present work is based on the truncation of the domain and on the implementation of a perfectly matched layer pml model facilitating the numerical absorption of the waves reaching the left and right termination ends of the truncated domain with minimum reflection details about the time integration method stability and convergence of the present scheme as well as the pml absorbing model can be found in filippas and belibassakis 2014 3 5 solution of the coupled problem in the present section details are given concerning the iterative procedure developed for the hydroelastic coupling a similar iterative algorithm has been developed by manolas et al 2015 for the aeroelastic analysis of wind turbine blades with known the geometry and the parameters of operation of the biomimetic energy device we proceed to the solution for the foil vertical motion and providing the coupling with the boundary value problem governing the hydrodynamics as described in previous sections in particular eq 45 is approximated by using a 2nd order crank nicholson scheme as follows 59 z n 1 z n δ t 2 g n z n g n 1 z n 1 with 60 z n z n t z n t and 61 g n z n 1 0 ω 0 2 2 ς ω 0 z n 0 l z z n m the above scheme has been selected for the integration of eq 45 because it is found that it offers stability in all cases considered which is especially important for lifting bodies of small mass the calculation of lift l z requires information from the solution of the boundary value problem described at previous sections in order to proceed to the next time step we define 62 g z n 1 z n 1 z n δ t 2 g n z n g n 1 z n 1 and the implicit nonlinear system g z n 1 0 that is iteratively solved using a newton raphson numerical scheme as follows 63 z n 1 m 1 z n 1 m j g 1 g z n 1 m m 0 1 where j g is the jacobian matrix of g approximated by using second order central differences in this way we assure that dynamic equilibrium of the oscillator is satisfied at each time step with prescribed accuracy at a given time step the position of the foil is determined and the boundary velocities the dtn operator and the coefficients of the dynamical system are calculated then by integration of system as described in sec 3 3 3 4 the various hydrodynamic quantities are calculated including the lift force by integration of pressure on the solid boundary thus the right hand side of eq 62 is obtained more specifically at each time step newton raphson iterations start by using an explicit time integrator scheme for the initial prediction of the foil position and the boundary velocities involved in the body boundary condition b eq 35 then the dtn operator is calculated as well as the coefficients of the dynamical system and a prediction for the lift coefficient c l z n 1 is obtained next the terms g n 1 g z n 1 m and j g 1 are calculated and newton raphson iterations continue until convergence 4 numerical results and discussion in this section results are compared against other methods for the validation of the numerical scheme used for the hydrodynamic analysis of the examined system subsequently simulations of the biomimetic system in waves and currents and results from systematic analysis are presented aiming at the investigation of the operational parameters more specifically in sec 4 1 present method results for oscillating hydrofoil in infinite domain are compared against results from the literature with both inviscid and viscous solvers in sec 4 2 the operation of the system in waves and currents in nearshore environment is illustrated and various distributed and integrated quantities of interest for a selected combination of the environmental and operational parameter are presented finally we examine the effect of operational parameters sec 4 3 and of the environmental parameters sec 4 4 to the performance of the biomimetic flapping foil energy device 4 1 validation of the method in the case of a thin naca0005 oscillating hydrofoil in infinite domain in fig 7 we compare present method calculations against results obtained by zhu et al 2009 where a a 3d bem using a foil with aspect ratio 10 and b linear 2d thin hydrofoil theory are applied under the assumption that the mass of the foil is small in comparison with the added mass and using zero stiffness for the elastic connector the foil is rotating about its pivot axis located at a distance x r c 0 5 from the leading edge with pitching amplitude θ 0 10 and the damping coefficient is b 2 π present method results are shown for three values of nondimensional mass parameter m 0 001 0 5 1 in particular in fig 7 a the heaving amplitude z 0 of the system is plotted showing quite good agreement with both methods of zhu et al 2009 for a wide range of reduced frequency also concerning the mass parameter m it is observed that its effect to heaving response is negligible on the other hand in fig 7 b in the case of net power extraction coefficient η p which is influenced from the pitching moment that is a more sensitive quantity good agreement is obtained for low and moderate reduced frequencies at large values of frequency where inertial effects become more important we observe that the overestimation of added mass as provided by the linearized theory used by zhu et al 2009 leads to overestimation of net power extraction next in fig 8 a comparison is shown between present method and recent computations by wu et al 2015 based on an immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm in this case a semi activated naca0015 hydrofoil is examined operating in a very low reynolds number re 1100 performing enforced pitching motion with large amplitude θ 0 30 about a rotation axis located at distance x r c 0 33 from the leading edge at reduced frequency k r 0 5655 and the characteristics of the oscillator are m 1 b π k 1 the present inviscid method overestimates the lift and moment coefficients due to the fact that viscous phenomena like leading edge separation and dynamic stall are neglected however the differences are reasonable taking into account the fact that in the examined case the reynolds number is very low and the instantaneous angle of attack becomes large the maximum value of the effective angle of attack is a 17 19 finally concerning free surface incident wave and finite depth effects the validation of the present method has been presented in filippas and belibassakis 2014 for the case of a flapping foil propulsor where comparisons are presented in cases of uniform current and flat bottom against linear theory by grue et al 1988 and cfd predictions by de silva and yamaguchi 2012 with very good results 4 2 numerical simulation of the biomimetic energy system in waves and currents in the sequel we apply the proposed method to study the performance of a naca0012 hydrofoil as flow and wave energy converter operating in nearshore regions we consider here a hydrofoil of chord c operating in a coastal region in the presence of propagating waves and vertically sheared currents over the shoaling environment that is presented in sec 2 2 in the simulations it is assumed that the component of the stream function associated with the disturbance potential is small and it is approximately set ψ u ψ p w in the examined case the strouhal number of the incident waves is s t ω h 1 g 0 4 and the wave amplitude is h 2 c 0 3 we recall that the current speed at the entrance of the domain corresponds to bathymetric froude number f d u g h 1 0 05 and the maximum shear in the middle of the domain where the hydrofoil is located is s max 0 05 s 1 the hydrofoil operates around a mean submergence depth d c 2 and performs enforced pitching and induced heaving oscillations τhe pitching motion is about a rotation axis at distance x r c 0 33 from the leading edge with amplitude θ 0 15 in general the oscillation frequency ω θ can be different from the incident wave frequency ω in the present section we consider one case where ω θ ω 1 with corresponding reduced frequency k r 0 267 and phase difference between pitch and the incoming wave equal to ψ 40 and another case with ω θ ω 2 k r ω θ c 2 u 0 533 and ψ 90 in the examined cases the following oscillator parameters are used m 4 ζ 0 5 ω 0 ω 2 first in fig 9 we consider an example of equal wave and pitching frequency ω θ ω 1 and ψ 40 results are presented at various instances in a period t concerning the position of the foil together with dipole intensities in the vortex wake denoted with red arrows as well as the calculated instantaneous pressure coefficient c p on the flapping foil and the free surface elevation η with red stars we denote the absorbing layer zone integrating the pressure distribution on the hydrofoil boundary we obtain the force and the moment and subsequently exploiting information about the enforced pitching and induced heaving velocities the input and output power of the system is calculated in the case ω θ ω 1 and ψ 40 in fig 10 a the foil s rotational motion θ against the resulting effective angle of attack α is shown and in fig 10 b the time history of the developed lift coefficient c l is plotted together with the moment coefficient c m required for the enforced pitching motion and the normalized heaving response ζ c in fig 10 b the non linear character of the responses are clearly observed in the shape of the time signals with the maximum values of heaving oscillation being comparable to the chord length z max c 0 95 the input power coefficient c p θ and the output power coefficient c p b of the considered system operating in the above conditions are presented in fig 10 c we observe that the extracted energy with mean value c p b 0 281 denoted with continuous thick line is significant especially as compared to the power needed for controlling the pitching foil motion with corresponding average pitching power coefficient c p θ 0 013 denoted with dashed thick line resulting in the examined case to a net power extraction coefficient η p 20 the corresponding time signals in the case of different pitching and wave frequency ω θ ω 2 and ψ 90 are presented in fig 11 in this case the foil performs two cycles of motion in one wave period with larger power extraction during the second cycle when the crest of the wave occurs over the foil although the mean output power coefficient compared to the previous case is slightly smaller c p b 0 237 and the corresponding input power coefficient is larger c p θ 0 021 the performance of the system is better η p 33 due to the smaller induced heav ing motion z max c 0 33 in the sequel we will demonstrate that even larger amounts of energy can be extracted from waves and sheared currents with proper selection and control of the operational parameters without reaching large angles of attack avoiding thus excessive flow separation and unfavorable dynamic stall effects 4 3 investigation of the operational parameters in this section we investigate the effects of the operational parameters of the present energy converter using the same environmental parameters sheared current and wave as in sec 4 2 for a specific value of incident wave frequency ω the average net power coefficient η p and the maximum amplitudes of the effective angle of attack α 0 and the heaving motion z 0 are shown in fig 12 using contour plots in that figure the effect of the frequency of pitching oscillation ω θ and the phase difference ψ between the free surface elevation and the foil pitch are examined for specific pitch amplitude θ 0 15 0 and oscillator parameters m 4 ζ 0 5 ω 0 ω 2 concerning the net power coefficient fig 12 a in the examined range of parameters it varies from η p 7 5 to η p 33 3 with greater values at larger frequencies of the foil s pitch obtaining its maximum value at ω θ ω 2 on the other hand the angle of attack fig 12 b and the heaving amplitude fig 12 c follow in general the opposite trend the reduction of heaving amplitude response at large frequencies is common even in purely linear oscillators and can be predicted also by linear theory in infinite domain as shown by zhu et al 2009 fig 4 a the increase in the power extraction coefficient at large frequencies is also reasonable and have been noticed by zhu et al 2009 fig 4 c this can be explained by the fact that when the pitching frequency raises the system operates in much smaller vertical regions due to the smaller induced heave amplitude while the absorbing power increases and in the same time the pitching power cost is still not large enough see e g zhu et al 2009 fig 5 moreover in fig 12 we observe that there are two maximum values of the efficiency located at regions where pitching frequency is integer multiple of the wave frequency as expected because the system is excited by two different frequencies the global maximum of the power extraction coefficient η p 33 fig 12 a is obtained at the vicinity of ω θ ω 2 ψ 90 0 where the maximum angle of attack equals α 0 7 5 attaining reasonable values fig 12 b and the heaving amplitude is rather small z 0 c 0 32 fig 12 c another local peak is noticed for ω θ ω 1 ψ 40 0 however the value of the net power extraction is less η p 20 corresponding to larger still reasonable angle of attack α 0 9 6 and much larger heaving amplitude z 0 c 0 67 for both the above cases ω θ ω 1 2 the phase difference ψ between pitching motion and the waves adjusts the angle of attack α 0 eq 46 and larger power extraction is obtained when ψ maximizes the angle of attack α 0 fig 12 a c in the sequel we will focus on cases corresponding to the region of the global maximum of η p where larger amounts of energy can be extracted by the examined system with reasonable values of the angle of attack in fig 13 we demonstrate the effect of the amplitude of pitching motion θ 0 for ω θ ω 2 and the phase difference between foil s pitch and the waves selected in the region where the global maximum appears ψ 90 40 in the region of the parameters studied here we observe a monotonic increase in η p α 0 z 0 see fig 13 a b c respectively as θ 0 increases for the whole interval of ψ with the maximum of the net power extraction reaching the level of η p 53 5 for θ 0 25 and ψ around 100 0 that monotonic behavior is expected and has been noticed by other researchers using either linear theory or bem in infinite domain see e g zhu et al 2009 fig 6 in this case the max angle of attack attains moderate value α 0 11 4 and the heaving amplitude is z 0 c 0 59 indicating that the biomimetic wave current energy device would lead to significant power output with proper selection of the control parameters although in a realistic setup a pitching amplitude of θ 0 25 corresponding to a moderate amplitude of the angle of attack α 0 11 4 seems a reasonable choice in the present study a more consevartive selection is used θ 0 15 resulting in lower maximum angle of attack α 0 7 5 and preventing flow separation and dynamic stall effects 4 4 investigation of the environmental parameters in the final section we examine the effects of the incident wave current field and the mean vertical position of the foil on the performance of the system in the shoaling environment of sec 2 2 as before the strouhal number of the incident wave is s t 0 4 the foil s pitching motion parameters are ω θ ω 2 θ 0 15 and the sheared current characteristics are f d u g h 1 0 05 s max 0 05 s 1 also the oscillator parameters are m 4 ζ 0 5 ω 0 ω 2 in fig 14 the effect of the wave amplitude h 2 c on the operation of the system is shown for a range of foil wave phase difference ψ in fig 14 a we observe that the net power coefficient varies from η p 27 to η p 38 with the global maximum at a region where the angle of attack becomes α 0 15 it is seen that with proper selection of the phase difference between the waves and foil s pitch with optimum value around ψ 90 0 the power extraction coefficient remains above η p 33 for any wave amplitude h 2 c in the studied interval in the previous optimum region smaller angle of attack and heaving response are obtained see fig 14 b c respectively when wave amplitude decreases without loss in power extraction efficiency concerning the induced heave amplitude ζ 0 and the resulting angle of attack α 0 in general they increase along with the wave amplitude and this is reasonable because greater amounts of environmental energy is transformed to heaving motion resulting also greater angles of attack in an amount that depends on the adjustment of the foil wave phase difference ψ see also the relevant discussion in the previous paragraph and the definition of the effective angle of attack eq 46 searching deeper the effect of the phase difference ψ in the region about ψ 90 0 pitching excitation leads to a heaving response at a phase difference of 180 with the wave i e foil s vertical velocity is in opposite direction to the corresponding wave velocity resulting to greater angles of attack and smaller heaving amplitudes due the waves again in the aforementioned case ψ 90 0 the system operates in a smaller vertical region and with significant power extraction due to the adequate values of the angle of attack and concurrently the pitching power cost is still not large enough explaining the maximum values of the net power coefficient in that region see fig 14 a a significant benefit of flapping foil energy devices arises from their ability to operate in relatively small vertical region in comparison with conventional flow turbines in this way they support the design of multicomponent systems with many horizontal foils in parallel arrangement rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 fig 2 wu et al 2015 increasing in this way the performance of such enhanced biomimetic systems next in fig 15 for the same set up and ψ 90 0 the effect of incident wave ω and pitching frequency ω θ is examined it is illustrated that for waves with frequencies less than ω ω 0 0 95 the local maxima of the net power extraction are located around ω θ ω 2 indicated by the dashed line in fig 15 a for comparison the cases studied so far sec 4 1 4 3 correspond to ω ω 0 0 5 and ω θ ω 0 1 an interesting result is that there exists a region for ω ω 0 0 95 close to ω θ ω 1 shown by a dashed circle in fig 15 a where high levels of power extraction η p 40 are achieved with very small angles of attack α 0 6 5 and moderate heaving amplitude ζ 0 c 0 45 see fig 15 b c respectively the peaks in the responses heaving response z 0 resulting angle of attack α 0 power extraction coefficient η p appearing at ω θ ω 1 and ω θ ω 2 can be physically interpreted using the basic principles of the theory of dynamic systems and linear hydrofoil theory first of all the lift actuating the heaving oscillator right hand side of eq 46 can be decomposed in the context of linear theory into i terms that oscillate with pitching frequency ω θ see e g zhu et al 2009 eq 5 and ii other terms oscillating with the wave frequency ω therefore the present system response peaks are expected for pitching frequency near an integer multiple of the wave frequency which is reasonable for dynamical systems under bichromatic excitation moreover the oscillatory behavior of the responses in the vicinity of ω θ ω ℓ ℓ i n as e g for the case of ω θ ω 2 which is also clearly illustrated in fig 16 is justified by the appearance of parametric resonance in fact analyzing again the developed lift force on the foil by means of linear hydrofoil theory see e g zhu et al 2009 eq 5 terms proportional to heaving acceleration are observed oscillating with pitching frequency ω θ which are clearly added mass terms the rest excitation forces contain the lift induced by the waves which is therefore at frequency ω thus the added mass of the system and consequently its natural frequency oscillates at ω θ which is responsible for the manifestation of parametric resonance phenomena see e g fossen nijmeijer 2012 a more detailed investigation of the above linear and non linear aspects concerning the dynamic behavior of the present system will be subject of future work finally in fig 16 the effects of shear on η p α 0 and z 0 are presented for three values of the hydrofoil mean submergence depth d we observe in fig 16 a c that the performance η p and the amplitude of heaving motion z 0 present a linear increase with maximum shear coefficient s max due to the increase of the local current velocity near the foil with s max as noted in fig 16 a for d c 2 when s max increases from 0 05 s 1 to 0 1 s 1 the froude number near the foil f f o i l takes values from 0 12 to 0 134 with the present selection of the parameters and especially the phase difference ψ incident waves have positive effect on total power extraction however as also demonstrated in fig 16 as the foil submergence depth increases the power output of the present system decreases due to the decay in depth of water waves to summarize in the present feasibility study it is demonstrated that using biomimetic systems in the examined arrangement significant energy can be extracted from sea currents and the efficiency of the device can be further enhanced by exploiting wave energy in particular for moderate values of the wave frequency parameter st 0 4 significant efficiency can be achieved for both equal wave and pitching frequencies ω θ ω 1 and in the case where the two input frequencies are different ω θ ω 1 depending on the environmental conditions an evidence is given that the local maxima of the efficiency are obtained when pitching frequency is an integer multiple of the wave frequency also optimal values of the phase difference between pitching motion and waves for the studied setup with ω θ ω 1 2 are identified near ψ 40 0 90 0 respectively moreover in the region of the studied parameters an increase in pitching amplitude θ 0 results in monotonic increase of efficiency and the net power extraction may reach the level of η p 53 5 for θ 0 25 and ψ around 100 0 even for smaller pitching amplitude θ 0 15 preventing large angles of attack and avoiding flow separation and dynamic stall effects it is demonstrated that the performance remains good of the order 35 furthemore examining the effect of the wave amplitude together with the wave foil phase difference it is observed that with proper selection of ψ e g ψ 100 0 for ω θ ω 2 the power extraction coefficient remains significant η p 33 for any wave amplitude providing robust operation of the system for higher values of the wave frequency 0 4 st 0 9 a very important observation is that a region exists close to ω θ ω 1 where high level of power extraction η p 40 is achieved with very small angles of attack α 0 6 5 and moderate heaving amplitude ζ 0 c 0 45 the identification of such regions of optimum operation is important for the design of the studied biomimetic energy device 5 conclusions oscillating hydrofoils in waves and currents are investigated as novel biomimetic systems for extraction and exploitation of this kind of marine renewable energy the present method takes into account the effect of the wavy free surface and the variable bathymetry through the satisfaction of the corresponding boundary conditions as well as the velocity component due to waves and sheared currents with linear vertical profile on the formation of the incident flow an example of the system operating over a variable bathymetry region of the form of smooth shoal is considered and a wide range of parameters is studied including the velocity of the current and the shear the frequency and the amplitude of the incident waves the mean submergence of the foil the pitching amplitude phase difference with respect to the waves and corresponding frequency that can be different from wave frequency numerical results concerning the extracted power and the operability characteristics of the system are presented indicating that significant output can be obtained and the improvement due to wave energy extraction is significant the present method could be found useful for the design and control of such biomimetic systems operating in the nearshore coastal region and extracting energy from waves and ambient sheared currents future work includes the examination of non harmonic pitching motion and irregular waves very important is also the investigation of the performance of enhanced biomimetic energy systems such as multicomponent flapping foil arrangements also the extension of the method to three dimensions will support study of the system in realistic topographies and different hydrofoil designs acknowledgements this research is funded by the special account for research grants of the tei of athens in the framework of the internal programme for the support of the

around a hydrofoil the problem is supplemented by the kutta condition necessitating zero pressure jump at the trailing edge that condition can be expressed by applying bernoulli s equation eq 41 on both sides of the foil while approximating the trailing edge next applying first order differences we can approximate the gradient of the potential on the body boundary fig 17 using the values of the

23533,the estimation of the bearing capacity of driven piles of offshore platform in easily crushable sand is a big issue due to the difficulty of parameter identification the paper proposes an efficient optimization procedure for identifying parameters of easily crushable sand which is then applied to the pile driving simulation the nelder mead simplex genetic algorithm nmga is first proposed and a newly enhanced elasto plastic breakage model is adopted then the performance of nmga is validated by identifying parameters from synthetic tests and further verified by triaxial tests on limestone grains based on which the necessary number of objective tests are also suggested finally the proposed procedure is applied to identify parameters of carbonate marine sand and the coupled eulerian lagrangian based large deformation analysis combined with the breakage model is carried out for pile driving in the same sand the role of grain breakage in bearing capacity of driven pile is also discussed all comparisons demonstrate that the proposed nmga with breakage model based parameter identification procedure is efficient and effective for easily crushable sand and the established large deformation analysis of pile driving using the identified parameters is applicable in estimating the bearing capacity keywords sand parameter identification grain breakage optimization genetic algorithm pile penetration 1 introduction foundations of offshore platforms are in the majority of cases piled based which are the most common foundation system due to their lower cost and simplicity and mainly driven to a certain design depth using hammers randolph et al 2005 the most common problems for driven piles are associated with insufficient capacity as indicated by driving performance or dynamic monitoring at the end of driving the capacity of driven piles in sands was identified by randolph et al 1994 as being the area of greatest uncertainty in foundation design during the process of pile driven grain breakage commonly occurs when sand undergoes compression and shearing especially for sand with low mohr s hardness mineral e g gypsum calcite and fluorite with mohr s hardness less than 4 even under very low confining stress which is defined as easily crushable sand in this paper from a different viewpoint zhang et al 2016 used fracture mechanics and energy arguments to demonstrate the equivalence between measures of crushability based on yielding stress and measures of crushability based on energy input and dissipation in either case it is the fracture properties of the grain forming mineral that controls the macroscopic crushability more recently it was shown that such link between macroscopic crushability and grain scale fracture can be used to develop constitutive models at continuum scale zhang and buscarnera 2017 the impact of grain breakage on the mechanical behavior of granular materials has been highlighted in the past decades coop 1990 coop et al 2004 lo and roy 1973 miao and airey 2013 in order to describe the effect of grain breakage numerous constitutive methods considering the grain breakage have been developed cecconi et al 2002 chen et al 2015 daouadji et al 2001 einav 2007 hu et al 2011 kong et al 2017 liu and gao 2016 russell and khalili 2004 xiao and liu 2016 yao et al 2008a yin et al 2016 especially in advanced breakage models incorporating the critical state concept additional parameters are introduced which are difficult to be determined by conventional laboratory or field tests especially in advanced breakage models incorporating the critical state concept additional parameters are introduced which are difficult to be determined by conventional laboratory or field tests for instance in critical state based breakage models the critical state line kinematically moves with the amount of grain crushed thus the critical state related parameters the hardening parameters and the dilatancy parameters become much more difficult to be calibrated in breakage model than in conventional critical state based models such as the critical state line related parameters e g υ f and λ f in the model of russell and khalili 2004 the critical state parameters e ref0 and λ in the model of hu et al 2011 the critical state parameters e γi ϕ cr and λ the dilatancy parameters k d and a and the hardening parameters ξ l0 ξ l ξ u and γ in the model of chen et al 2015 the critical state related parameters λ e b0 k e and χ b and two dilatancy constants d 0 and k d in the model of xiao and liu 2016 this difficulty is much more pronounced for very easily crushable sand and poses a challenge in terms of engineering practice as a consequence the breakage models were seldom used in the engineering practice to improve the determination of parameters more laboratory tests are becoming necessary which results in a relatively high experimental cost therefore an efficient approach to identify model parameters by a cost saving way is useful and will be attractive for engineering practice recently the optimization method based on genetic algorithm ga has been applied successfully in the geotechnical engineering since its application can reduce the cost of laboratory testing or in situ monitoring for example the parameter identifications of various constitutive models for different soils have been carried out using optimizations with ga jin et al 2016b 2017a 2017b 2017c levasseur et al 2008 pal et al 1996 papon et al 2012 rokonuzzaman and sakai 2010 samarajiva et al 2005 ye et al 2016 yin et al 2018 2017 along this way it will be attractive if this powerful tool can be applied to identify parameters of breakage models for easily crushable sand therefore this study aims to propose an efficient optimization procedure for identifying parameters of easily crushable sand based on conventional laboratory tests which is then applied to the pile driving simulation for this purpose a recently enhanced elasto plastic breakage model is adopted for simulations a novel nelder mead simplex enhanced genetic algorithm nmga is developed to minimize the error function during the optimization process then the parameter identification using three synthetic drained triaxial tests generated by the adopted model as objective tests is conducted to evaluate the performance of nmga after that the model parameters for limestone grains are identified using the proposed optimization procedure with discussions on the necessary number of objective tests finally the proposed procedure is applied to identify parameters of dog s bay sand using four triaxial tests and validated by three other triaxial tests the coupled eulerian lagrangian based large deformation finite element analysis combined with the breakage model is carried out for pile driving in the same sand for which the finite element implementation of the model is also presented furthermore the role of grain breakage in bearing capacity of driven pile is numerically discussed 2 adopted elasto plastic grain breakage model a novel constitutive model accounting for the effect of grain breakage developed by yin et al 2016 was adopted to simulate the experiment in the optimization process the total strain rate is conventionally composed of the elastic and plastic strain rates 1 ε i j ε i j e ε i j p the elastic behavior is assumed to be isotropic with the bulk modulus k adopting the same form of the shear modulus proposed by richart et al 1970 2 ε i j e 1 υ 3 k 1 2 υ σ i j υ 3 k 1 2 υ σ k k δ i j 3 k k 0 p a t 2 97 e 2 1 e p p a t

adopted model contains two yield surfaces one for shear sliding f 1 and one for compression f 2 the plastic strain increment can be expressed as follows 4 ε i j p ε i j p 1 ε i j p 2 d λ 1 g 1 σ i j d λ 2 g 2 σ i j where the scripts 1 and 2 represent the shear sliding and compression components respectively for one component with f 0 the corresponding dλ is equal to zero the shear sliding yield function noted f 1 has the following expression 5 f 1 q p m p ε d p m p p g p g ε d p 0 where the deviatoric plastic strain ε d p is the hardening variable q is the deviatoric stress q 3 j 2 3 2 s i j

phase transformation friction angle the double indices ij is simplified to be 1 ˆ 11 2 ˆ 22 3 ˆ 33 4 ˆ 12 5 ˆ 23 6 ˆ 31 according to the voigt rule since stress or strain tensors are symmetric the peak friction angle ϕ p and the phase transformation friction angle ϕ pt are associated with the critical friction angle ϕ μ and the critical void ratio e c is as follows 7 tan ϕ p e c e β tan ϕ u tan ϕ p t e c e β tan ϕ μ 8 e c e r e f λ ln p p r e f where β is a material constant commonly equal to 1 according to yin et al 2016 λ is the slope of the critical state line in the e lnp plane the two parameters e ref p ref correspond to a reference point on the critical state line csl the lode angle dependent strength and stress dilatancy were introduced as described in yin et al 2013 which can also be incorporated by using the transformed stress method by yao et al 2004a 2004b 2008b 2009 in order to describe the compression behavior of crushable sand a second yield surface was added 9 f 2 1 2 q p m p 3 p p p m for q p m p where p m is the hardening variable controlling the size of the yield surface an associated flow rule is adopted herein this yield surface expands with the plastic volumetric strain as in the modified cam clay model 10 p m p m 0 exp 1 e 0 λ κ ε v p where κ 1 e 0 p k is used with k by eq 3 λ takes the same value as that of the csl the effects of grain breakage on the mechanical behavior can be expressed in two aspects 1 influence of grain breakage on the critical state line the evolution of the critical state line due to grain breakage is described as following expression 11 p r e f p r e f 0 exp b b r where parameter b controls the rate of the csl shifting due to grain breakage b r is the modified breakage index proposed by einav 2007 which can be considered as a function of the plastic work during loading 12 b r w p a w p where a is a material constant controlling the evolution of the breakage amount grain breakage was classified into three modes according to guyon and troadec 1994 1 fracture which means a grain breaks into smaller grains of similar sizes 2 attrition which means a grain breaks into one grain of a slightly smaller size and several much smaller ones 3 abrasion which means the result is that the grain size distribution remains almost constant but with a production of fine particles these three modes also associate with the applied stress level from low pressure to high pressure the grain breakage from the model 3 to mode 1 dominates the eq 12 follows this phenomenon note that there exists a threshold plastic work or stress level from a physical standpoint for which one more parameter needs to be introduced in fact this threshold value is questionable in terms of parameter calibration since the grain breakage of mode 3 cannot be clearly measured fortunately the eq 12 can capture very slight amount of grain breakage corresponding to mode 3 mainly due to inter particle shear sliding at low stress level 2 influence of grain breakage on compression behavior the evolution of p m due to grain breakage is added in eq 13 as follow 13 p m p m 0 exp 1 e 0 λ κ ε v p exp b b r note that the same constant b is used in eq 13 and eq 11 implying the same amount of shifting for isotropic compression line and critical state line which was previously validated by yin et al 2016 furthermore the eq 13 also assumed that the size of yield surface is controlled by two factors simultaneously the volumetric plastic strain and the modified breakage index overall the parameters of the adopted breakage model can be divided into four groups 1 elastic parameters k 0 n υ 2 critical state related parameters e ref λ ϕ u 3 plastic parameters g p a d and 4 grain breakage related parameters p m0 a b 3 identification methodology in general the mathematical procedure of optimization consists of two parts a the formulation of an error function measuring the difference between the numerical and experimental results and b the selection of an optimization strategy to enable the search for the minimum of this error function 3 1 error function to carry out a parameter identification using optimization method the user must define a function that can evaluate the error between the experimental and numerical results and then minimize this function for the optimization to be successful it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the material parameter sets predictions as accounted for in terms of a fitness function the material parameter sets with higher fitness should survive to produce new parameters sets therefore it is necessary to devise an error function so that the parameter sets with better predictions result in higher fitness values to make the error independent of the type of test and the number of measurement points an advanced error function can be adopted levasseur et al 2008 the average difference between the measured and the simulated results is expressed in the normalized form of the least square method 14 error x 1 n i 1 n u exp i u n u m i u exp i 2 100 where x is an n sized vector of unknown model input parameters n is the number of observation points u i o b s is the value corresponding to the ith point of observed data u i n u m is the value corresponding to the ith point of simulated data the scale effects on the fitness between the experimental and the simulated results can be eliminated by this normalized formula additionally the objective error calculated by this function is a dimensionless variable thus any difference in error can be avoided for different objectives with different variables due to the stability of eq 14 many researchers have adopted it as the error function to conduct the optimizations jin et al 2017a 2016b 2017c yin et al 2018 2017 3 2 enhancement of rcga algorithm after formulating the error function the selection of the search strategy is the key step of whether the optimized solution can be found or not the solution to an optimization problem is a vector x 0 which satisfies the global minimum condition for any x l x x u 15 f x 0 f x for obtaining a more accurate solution a highly efficient optimization method with the ability to search for a global minimum should be adopted since the ga is widely used in the geotechnical field as stated in the introduction the adopted real coded ga rcga algorithm has a similar structure to those developed by jin et al 2016c and yin et al 2017 to further accelerate the convergence speed and enhance the search ability the adopted rcga was enhanced by implementing a local search named nelder mead simplex nms with excellent convergence speed the proposed algorithm was named as nmga for simplicity in the following sections although the hybrid of nelder mead optimization scheme and ga with its efficiency has been well recognized during past decades chelouah and siarry 2003 durand and alliot 1999 on the premise of keeping the intrinsic advantage of hybrid between ga and simplex adopting newly developed optimization schemes is necessary and useful for solving complex geotechnical problems with more parameters in this study the nmga is different from previous works chelouah and siarry 2003 durand and alliot 1999 due to 1 the adoption of the newly developed rcga with outstanding performance in identifying soil parameters and 2 a newly developed nms operator for high dimensional problems fig 1 shows the flow chart which presents the simplest way of the enhancement first n initial individuals were generated by sobol which is a uniform sampling method proposed by sobol 1967 and the generation number was set to zero then all the individuals were sorted based on their fitness values and the best n 1 n is the number of variables individuals were selected to perform the nms for the nms a nelder mead method with adaptive parameters for high dimensional problems suggested by gao and han 2012 was adopted and a brief procedure of this method is presented in appendix i based on the result of the nms the best individual was updated then this best individual was recombined with the n 1 remaining individuals to perform the ga global search more details about the adopted rcga can be found in jin et al 2017c in order to avoid a rapid loss of diversity an elitism strategy was adopted in the rcga in the replacement process 10 of individuals with the highest fitness were selected from the parents and children to survive to the next generation the remainders were chosen by tournament selection from the mating pool composed of parents and children other than the 10 individuals the iteration stopped when the convergence criterion or the maximum generation number was reached for the nms the tolerance for convergence was set to 10 4 as recommended by gao and han 2012 for the adopted rcga the recommended settings can be found in jin et al 2016d during the optimization process the nms could accelerate the convergence speed but could easily get trapped in the local minimum on the other hand the rcga process can overcome the local minimum problem however the convergence speed is always slow and the approach is not applicable for the engineering applications jin et al 2016b 2017b yin et al 2017 therefore this hybrid strategy owns the advantages of both processes and results in better optimization performance 3 3 proposed identification procedure in general deformation and strength are two important indicators of the mechanical behavior of granular materials additionally the grain size distribution gsd is strongly associated with the grain breakage effect during the loading process and hence influence the mechanical behaviors liu et al 2014 especially for the crushable materials therefore the gsd is another indicator for measuring the degree of gain breakage for a laboratory triaxial test the isotropic or anisotropic compression test is normally first conducted followed by the shearing test during the whole testing process the measurements indicating the compression behavior shearing behavior and grain breakage behavior are recorded some model parameters can be directly determined based on the measurements e g the initial void ratio young s modulus jin et al 2016a 2016c while some variables cannot be directly measured e g the parameters related to grain breakage chen et al 2015 hu et al 2011 therefore the parameter identification using optimization method is proposed in this study a mono objective framework with 4 different criteria is considered 16 min error x min mean error com e error tri q error tri e error com tri gsd where errorcom e is the error of void ratio e between simulations and objectives for isotropic compression or anisotropic compression stage errortri q is the error in deviatoric stress q between simulations and objectives for the triaxial shearing stage errortri e is the error in void ratio e between simulation and objectives for triaxial shearing stage and errorcom tri gsd is the error in gsd curve between simulations and objectives for both compression and triaxial shearing stage all the errors mentioned above were calculated according to the eq 14 fig 2 shows the identification procedure which aims to find values for the model parameters and provide the best attainable fit between model predictions and corresponding observations in this study the procedure is based on two different codes the code for the integration of the constitutive model to simulate the objective tests and the code for the optimization process to find the minimum value of error function for each optimization process each individual in the initial population was generated using the sobol method sobol 1967 3 4 performance of nmga on identifying model parameters for evaluating the performance of the proposed nmga a set of synthetic tests including three drained triaxial tests e 0 0 8 with p 0 100 200 and 400 kpa and one isotropic compression test e 0 0 8 was generated by the adopted breakage model yin et al 2016 as the objectives in the optimization in order to simulate the breakage behavior of easily crushable materials a set of typical parameters the elastic parameters k 0 70 n 0 66 υ 0 25 the critical state related parameters e ref 1 0 λ 0 05 ϕ 35 the plastic parameters g p 5 a d 1 and the grain breakage related parameters p m0 500 kpa a 150 kpa b 10 was adopted to generate the synthetic tests and the simulated results are shown in fig 3 totally 10 model parameters were optimized by using the proposed optimization procedure as shown in eq 17 17 min f e x min f e k 0 n e r e f λ ϕ g p a d p m 0 a b where f e is the error function of the model parameters x is the model parameters the initial population size was set to 100 and the maximum number of generations was set to 300 the interval of each parameter is given in table 1 which covers a big range in terms of preset parameters for comparison and verifying the performance of the proposed nmga the original rcga without nelder mead simplex in jin et al 2016d and another outstanding algorithm moga ii used by papon et al 2012 were selected to conduct the same optimization optimal parameters obtained by nmga rcga and moga ii from synthetic data are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the preset parameters can be entirely detected within 300 generations by the proposed nmga however the performance of rcga and moga ii is worse satisfied comparing to that of the nmga fig 4 shows the evolution of minimum objective error in each generation with the increasing number of generations it can be seen that the proposed nmga has the faster convergence speed than the moga ii therefore all the comparisons demonstrate that the proposed nmga has an excellent performance on identifying model parameters for easily crushable sands 4 verification by limestone grains 4 1 brief introduction of laboratory tests on limestone grains in order to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed optimization procedure a series of conventional drained triaxial tests on limestone grains a easily crushable sand the mohr s hardness equals to 3 5 by lo and roy 1973 was selected as objective tests some main physical properties of this limestone grains are as follows specific gravity g s 2 71 initial void ratio e 0 0 81 maximum void ratio e max 1 05 and minimum void ratio e min 0 65 mean particle size d 50 0 215 mm uniformity coefficient c u 2 85 for simplicity all the tests with different confining pressures were marked by the sequence number the sequence number and the information for the corresponding test are summarized in table 3 before conducting the triaxial shear test each sample was compressed from the initial void ratio 0 81 to the corresponding confining pressure after shearing the change of grain size distribution for each sample was measured 4 2 optimization results and discussion following the proposed procedure the model parameters for limestone grains were identified by the proposed nmga in addition the rcga and the moga ii were also adopted to conduct the same identification procedure for comparisons for both adopted algorithms the initial individuals and the maximum number of generations were set to 100 other settings of rcga recommended by jin et al 2016d and moga ii recommended by papon et al 2012 were kept in this case to highlight the performance of the proposed procedure in identifying breakage related parameters the parameters related to compression behavior k 0 24 n 0 5 and p m0 1000 kpa which can be directly measured from isotropic compression curve were not put into the optimization procedure the poisson s ratio υ is assumed to be 0 25 which is a typical value for sand furthermore the remaining parameters e ref λ ϕ g p a d a b can also be determined in a direct way according to yin et al 2016 for sand that has a high yielding stress however for easily crushable sand the direct way to determine these parameters e ref λ ϕ g p a d a b based on laboratory tests is difficult due to the grain breakage occurring even in a very low stress level therefore apart from the parameters related to compression behavior k 0 24 n 0 5 and p m0 1000 kpa the remaining parameters e ref λ ϕ g p a d a b were optimized using the proposed procedure first for obtaining a set of most accurate parameters all the experimental data in total nine tests was used as the objective in the optimization process the objective error is defined as the average of error com e error tri q error tri e and error com tri gsd the interval of each parameter is also given in table 1 table 4 shows the comparison of optimal parameters and the corresponding objective error obtained by nmga rcga and moga ii it can be seen that the nmga gives a set of optimal parameters with smallest objective error among them using the optimal parameters the objective tests were simulated using the adopted breakage model fig 5 shows the comparisons of q ε a deviatoric stress versus axial strain isotropic compression curve and gsd curves between simulated and experimental results a good agreement between the simulations and observations indicates that the optimal parameters are reasonable and reliable which also indicates that nmga performs well in identifying breakage model parameters for easily crushable sand the convergence rates of nmga rcga and moga ii are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the convergence speed of nmga is much faster than that of rcga and moga ii which indicates a higher efficiency of nmga in the parameter identification this should be attractive for engineering application furthermore for investigating the influence of the weight of gsd in the error function on optimized parameters a scheme for evaluating the influence of the weight of gsd is presented in table 5 based on the error function in eq 18 18 min error x min mean a error com e error tri q error tri e 1 a error com tri gsd where the a is weight factor varying between 0 and 1 following the same optimization procedure the optimal parameters and objective errors corresponding to different weights of gsd are finally summarized in table 5 it can be seen that the weight of gsd ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 gives a good performance in identifying the parameters of the adopted breakage model therefore for obtaining an equal contribution of each term in the error function to the optimal parameters the weight of gsd is set to 0 5 the following optimizations are then conducted based on the error function in eq 18 with a value of 0 5 for the weight of gsd 4 3 estimation of minimum number of tests for identifying parameters traditionally three triaxial tests are needed for determining mechanical parameters of soils according to standard criterion of laboratory test however for determining parameters of critical state based models more laboratory tests including isotropic compression and shearing stages are appreciated jin et al 2016c for easily crushable sand it is questionable that how many tests are needed to determine the model parameters associated with grain breakage it is clear that the process of parameter identification based on large number of tests is time consuming and cost consuming which may not be preferred by the engineers in order to reduce the test cost in parameter identification the minimum number of tests involved in the objective to obtain a set of accurate parameters needs to be estimated since the amount of grain breakage significantly associates with the applied stress level two necessary tests i e one test performed under a lower confining stress and one test performed under a higher confining stress should be involved in the objective due to this the tests ➀ and➇ see table 3 were first selected as a basic component in all combinations one combination is one objective for optimization considering that the stress level of the test ➇ is high enough then combinations with three tests or four tests or five tests were constructed by adding one or two or three additional tests from database of tests 2 to 7 based on which a total of 41 combinations were formed as seen in table 6 all combinations were successively used for optimization to identify model parameters the examined combinations with the test number the obtained optimal parameters the objective error and the total average error are summarized in table 6 based on the total number of tests in the objective all the combinations were divided into four groups and marked as 3 tests 4 tests 5 tests and 8 tests fig 7 shows the minimum error and the average error in each group it can be seen that both the average error and the minimum error generally decrease with the increasing number of tests in the objective for some scatter points with big errors as combinations 1 2 3 and 12 a possible reason is the inaccuracy of critical state related parameters caused by the unreasonable selection of objective tests jin et al 2016c it can be seen that the minimum error and average error of the group containing four tests with more possible high stress tests or five tests is close to that obtained from 8 tests in terms of the obtained optimal parameters the average value of each optimal parameter for each group has been calculated and is summarized in table 7 it can be found that with increasing the quantity of tests in the objective the obtained optimal parameters gradually approach to the most accurate set of parameters from all eight tests the difference of the obtained optimal parameters the objective error and the total average error between the group with five tests and the group with all eight tests is very small which can be ignored in the engineering practice therefore it can be concluded that a total of four tests including two basic tests and two additional high stress tests or a total of five tests including two basic tests and three additional tests are sufficient for the parameter identification 5 application to pile driving in carbonate sand the pile driven in sand especially in easily crushable sand involves great amount of grain breakage thus the numerical analysis of this kind of problem needs to consider the grain breakage effect in the mechanical behavior of sand to date various numerical studies on pile penetration in sand considering the grain breakage have been conducted zhang et al 2013 2014 however apart from grain breakage nonlinear elasticity dilatancy and contraction with the soil density effect were not properly considered in those works and the parameters were not fully calibrated against a series of laboratory tests on the same sand before the simulation accordingly a case of pile driving in carbonate sand was selected as an illustrative example to highlight the proposed procedure in identifying parameters while the adopted model in simulating pile driven to exhibit the predictive ability of the adopted breakage model with validating the optimized parameters a series of centrifuge tests by klotz and coop 2001 which is more realistic than the case of zhang et al 2013 in terms of field condition were selected these tests were conducted directly for the practical use on investigating the bearing capacity of offshore driven pile in very easily crushable sand furthermore the choice of centrifuge tests using dog s bay sand is also because that more laboratory tests on this sand with measurements of gsd before and after testing were provided than the case of zhang et al 2013 this section presents the application of the proposed identification procedure to identify parameters of dog s bay sand which was finally applied to the large deformation analysis of the pile driving in the same sand 5 1 parameter identification of dog s bay sand four drained constant p triaxial tests with different initial confining pressures by bandini and coop 2011 and one isotropic compression tests by coop 1990 performed on dog s bay sand were selected as the objective in the optimization due to the limited test data only two gsd curves were used in the optimization procedure for the simplicity all the selected constant p tests were marked as d 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 table 8 shows the initial void ratio and confining pressure for each selected test based on the necessary number of tests suggested previously the tests of d 1 2 3 4 and 5 were used as the objectives in the optimization and the tests of d 6 and 7 were used for validation following the proposed procedure the parameters of the adopted breakage model for dog s bay sand were identified by using nmga table 9 summarizes the optimal parameters using the optimal parameters the objective tests were first simulated fig 8 a d shows the comparison of isotropic compression test constant p tests and gsd curves between the optimal simulations and experiments then three additional drained constant p triaxial tests were used for validation as shown in fig 8 e f it can be seen that the simulations generally well agree with the measurements which demonstrates that the identified parameters of the adopted breakage model by the proposed procedure are reliable 5 2 modelling of pile driving tests 5 2 1 description of pile driving tests a series of centrifuge pile penetration tests on dog s bay sand under an acceleration of 100 g performed by klotz and coop 2001 were simulated by using the adopted breakage model with the optimal parameters the pile is closed ended and the diameter is 16 mm the maximum penetration into the sand is about 375 mm which equals to 1 6 m in diameter and 37 5 m in height for the real case the cylindrical container has an internal diameter of d 40 cm and a height of 63 cm with rigid walls to avoid lateral displacements of soil which equals to 32 m and 54 m for the real case respectively two different initial void ratios e 0 1 53 and e 0 1 39 of dog s bay sand were used in the centrifuge test the pile was pushed into the sand at a speed of 0 02 m s for both tests in real case klotz and coop 2001 5 2 2 model implementation into finite element code the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method in the abaqus hibbitt et al 2001 that captures the advantages of both the lagrangian and the eulerian method which is effective on solving the large deformation problems in numerical analyses using this cel method the eulerian material is tracked as it flows through the mesh by computing its eulerian volume fraction evf each eulerian element is designated by a percentage which represents the portion of that element filled with a eulerian material for simulating pile penetration tests the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method in abaqus was adopted to deal with the analysis of large deformation at the edge of pile penetration hamann et al 2015 qiu et al 2011 the adopted breakage model was implemented into abaqus as a user defined material model via vumat user defined material model for abaqus explicit to simulate dog s bay sand the explicit time integration scheme was used in the implementation in abaqus explicit hibbitt et al 2001 the central difference rule is employed for the solution of the non linear system of differential equations the unknown solution for the next time step can be found directly from the solution of the previous time step such that no iteration is needed the model implementation was examined by simulating above triaxial tests on limestone grains and carbonate sand all simulation results were the same as those obtained by the single integration point program which validated the model implementation 5 2 3 finite element model due to the axial symmetry of the problem a three dimensional finite element fe model for 1 quarter of the model test was established as illustrated in fig 9 the dimension of fe model was same as the equivalent real case of model tests the bottom of fe model was fixed in three directions the lateral of fe model was fixed in horizontal directions and the vertical direction was free the pile was modeled as a rigid body the dog s bay sand was modeled by using 62000 eulerian elements the upper 2 m were modeled by void to allow the eulerian material to flow into during the pile penetration the contact between the pile and dog s bay sand was described by the classical coulomb friction law with a friction coefficient μ tan ϕ μ 2 0 40 according to klotz and coop 2001 the initial stress state before loading was generated by self weight with k 0 0 305 according to jacky s formula the parameters of dog s bay sand optimized previously in table 9 were used for the simulation the total penetration displacement is 37 5 m and the penetration speed was 0 02 m s 5 2 4 results and comparisons fig 10 shows the comparisons of q b z curves between the measurements and the simulations for two centrifuge pile penetration tests where q b represents the base resistance and z is the penetration displacement of the pile a general good agreement between the predictions and observations demonstrates that the adopted model has an outstanding ability in capturing the pile penetration behavior accounting for the effect of grain breakage and the identified model parameters are reliable due to the instability and the numerical oscillation of explicit calculations the obtained curves are not always smooth taking the simulation with e 0 1 53 as example the information of void ratio deviatoric plastic strain modified breakage index b r and mean effective stress during the process of pile driven is presented fig 11 shows the distribution of these information at a penetration depth of 5 m 10 m and 37 m it can be seen that the mean effective stress around the pile head is increased with increasing the pile penetration depth the increased mean effective stress and deviatoric plastic strain result in globally decreasing the void ratio so that make the sand denser and simultaneously causes more breakage of sand grains due to increasing plastic work the maximum value of void ratio reached to 1 639 due to the dilatancy effect during the pile penetration especially in the area close to the top surface in sand surrounding the pile fig 12 presents the distribution of breakage index with different profiles in surrounding soil at the distance of 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 m from pile at the penetration depth of 37 m fig 13 shows the distributions of breakage index along the radius distance from the pile at penetration depths of 5 m 10 m and 37 m it seems that the crushing influenced zone predicted by the breakage model is within approximately a radius of pile from the shaft however it is a pity that the breakage growth cannot be compared against the experimental data since it is not available 6 conclusions an efficient optimization procedure to identify the breakage model s parameters for easily crushable sand has been proposed using which the capacity of offshore pile driving was numerically estimated in the optimization procedure a newly developed elasto plastic constitutive model accounting for grain breakage was adopted to simulate the objective tests for measuring the error between the simulations and objective tests to improve the performance of identification a new optimization algorithm nmga was proposed by implementing the nelder mead simplex into a recently developed real coded genetic algorithm first the computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed nmga were evaluated by comparing with the rcga and the moga ii algorithms all the three optimization methods were applied to conduct the same parameter identification in the optimization the objective was three synthetic drained triaxial tests generated by the adopted breakage model with a set of parameters representing an easily crushable sand the results show that the performance of proposed nmga on search ability and convergence speed is better than the rcga and moga ii then the proposed optimization procedure was examined by identifying the model parameters of limestone grains adopting all the experimental tests as the objective the results show that the obtained optimal parameters are accurate and reasonable to reduce the cost of parameters determination the minimum number of tests involved in the objective was investigated the results indicate that five tests including one test at low confining pressure and one test at high confining pressure are sufficient for the parameter identification which can be adopted in testing code for practice finally the adopted breakage model s parameters of a typically carbonate sand dog s bay sand were optimized using the proposed procedure the coupled eulerian lagrangian based large deformation finite element analysis combined with the breakage model was carried out for pile driving in the same sand for which the finite element implementation of the model was also conducted good agreement was achieved between the simulations and measurements furthermore the role of grain breakage in bearing capacity of driven pile was numerically discussed overall it can be concluded that the proposed optimization procedure is efficient and reliable on identifying the model parameters for easily crushable sand and the developed numerical platform is applicable for estimating the capacity

23533,the estimation of the bearing capacity of driven piles of offshore platform in easily crushable sand is a big issue due to the difficulty of parameter identification the paper proposes an efficient optimization procedure for identifying parameters of easily crushable sand which is then applied to the pile driving simulation the nelder mead simplex genetic algorithm nmga is first proposed and a newly enhanced elasto plastic breakage model is adopted then the performance of nmga is validated by identifying parameters from synthetic tests and further verified by triaxial tests on limestone grains based on which the necessary number of objective tests are also suggested finally the proposed procedure is applied to identify parameters of carbonate marine sand and the coupled eulerian lagrangian based large deformation analysis combined with the breakage model is carried out for pile driving in the same sand the role of grain breakage in bearing capacity of driven pile is also discussed all comparisons demonstrate that the proposed nmga with breakage model based parameter identification procedure is efficient and effective for easily crushable sand and the established large deformation analysis of pile driving using the identified parameters is applicable in estimating the bearing capacity keywords sand parameter identification grain breakage optimization genetic algorithm pile penetration 1 introduction foundations of offshore platforms are in the majority of cases piled based which are the most common foundation system due to their lower cost and simplicity and mainly driven to a certain design depth using hammers randolph et al 2005 the most common problems for driven piles are associated with insufficient capacity as indicated by driving performance or dynamic monitoring at the end of driving the capacity of driven piles in sands was identified by randolph et al 1994 as being the area of greatest uncertainty in foundation design during the process of pile driven grain breakage commonly occurs when sand undergoes compression and shearing especially for sand with low mohr s hardness mineral e g gypsum calcite and fluorite with mohr s hardness less than 4 even under very low confining stress which is defined as easily crushable sand in this paper from a different viewpoint zhang et al 2016 used fracture mechanics and energy arguments to demonstrate the equivalence between measures of crushability based on yielding stress and measures of crushability based on energy input and dissipation in either case it is the fracture properties of the grain forming mineral that controls the macroscopic crushability more recently it was shown that such link between macroscopic crushability and grain scale fracture can be used to develop constitutive models at continuum scale zhang and buscarnera 2017 the impact of grain breakage on the mechanical behavior of granular materials has been highlighted in the past decades coop 1990 coop et al 2004 lo and roy 1973 miao and airey 2013 in order to describe the effect of grain breakage numerous constitutive methods considering the grain breakage have been developed cecconi et al 2002 chen et al 2015 daouadji et al 2001 einav 2007 hu et al 2011 kong et al 2017 liu and gao 2016 russell and khalili 2004 xiao and liu 2016 yao et al 2008a yin et al 2016 especially in advanced breakage models incorporating the critical state concept additional parameters are introduced which are difficult to be determined by conventional laboratory or field tests especially in advanced breakage models incorporating the critical state concept additional parameters are introduced which are difficult to be determined by conventional laboratory or field tests for instance in critical state based breakage models the critical state line kinematically moves with the amount of grain crushed thus the critical state related parameters the hardening parameters and the dilatancy parameters become much more difficult to be calibrated in breakage model than in conventional critical state based models such as the critical state line related parameters e g υ f and λ f in the model of russell and khalili 2004 the critical state parameters e ref0 and λ in the model of hu et al 2011 the critical state parameters e γi ϕ cr and λ the dilatancy parameters k d and a and the hardening parameters ξ l0 ξ l ξ u and γ in the model of chen et al 2015 the critical state related parameters λ e b0 k e and χ b and two dilatancy constants d 0 and k d in the model of xiao and liu 2016 this difficulty is much more pronounced for very easily crushable sand and poses a challenge in terms of engineering practice as a consequence the breakage models were seldom used in the engineering practice to improve the determination of parameters more laboratory tests are becoming necessary which results in a relatively high experimental cost therefore an efficient approach to identify model parameters by a cost saving way is useful and will be attractive for engineering practice recently the optimization method based on genetic algorithm ga has been applied successfully in the geotechnical engineering since its application can reduce the cost of laboratory testing or in situ monitoring for example the parameter identifications of various constitutive models for different soils have been carried out using optimizations with ga jin et al 2016b 2017a 2017b 2017c levasseur et al 2008 pal et al 1996 papon et al 2012 rokonuzzaman and sakai 2010 samarajiva et al 2005 ye et al 2016 yin et al 2018 2017 along this way it will be attractive if this powerful tool can be applied to identify parameters of breakage models for easily crushable sand therefore this study aims to propose an efficient optimization procedure for identifying parameters of easily crushable sand based on conventional laboratory tests which is then applied to the pile driving simulation for this purpose a recently enhanced elasto plastic breakage model is adopted for simulations a novel nelder mead simplex enhanced genetic algorithm nmga is developed to minimize the error function during the optimization process then the parameter identification using three synthetic drained triaxial tests generated by the adopted model as objective tests is conducted to evaluate the performance of nmga after that the model parameters for limestone grains are identified using the proposed optimization procedure with discussions on the necessary number of objective tests finally the proposed procedure is applied to identify parameters of dog s bay sand using four triaxial tests and validated by three other triaxial tests the coupled eulerian lagrangian based large deformation finite element analysis combined with the breakage model is carried out for pile driving in the same sand for which the finite element implementation of the model is also presented furthermore the role of grain breakage in bearing capacity of driven pile is numerically discussed 2 adopted elasto plastic grain breakage model a novel constitutive model accounting for the effect of grain breakage developed by yin et al 2016 was adopted to simulate the experiment in the optimization process the total strain rate is conventionally composed of the elastic and plastic strain rates 1 ε i j ε i j e ε i j p the elastic behavior is assumed to

λ 2 g 2 σ i j where the scripts 1 and 2 represent the shear sliding and compression components respectively for one component with f 0 the corresponding dλ is equal to zero the shear sliding yield

phase transformation friction angle the double indices ij is simplified to be 1 ˆ 11 2 ˆ 22 3 ˆ 33 4 ˆ 12 5 ˆ 23 6 ˆ 31 according to the voigt rule since stress or strain tensors are symmetric the peak friction angle ϕ p and the phase transformation friction angle ϕ pt are associated with the critical friction angle ϕ μ and the critical void ratio e c is as follows 7 tan ϕ p e c e β tan ϕ u tan

also be incorporated by using the transformed stress method by yao et al 2004a 2004b 2008b 2009 in order to describe the compression behavior of crushable sand a second yield surface was added 9 f 2 1 2 q p m p 3 p p p m for q p m p where p m is the hardening variable controlling the size of the yield surface an associated flow rule is adopted herein this yield surface expands with the plastic volumetric strain as in the modified cam clay model 10 p m p m 0 exp 1 e 0 λ κ ε v p where κ 1 e 0 p k is used with k by eq 3 λ takes the same value as that of the csl the effects of grain breakage on the mechanical behavior can be expressed in two aspects 1 influence of grain breakage on the critical state line the evolution of the critical state line due to grain breakage is described as following expression 11 p r e f p r e f 0 exp b b r where parameter b controls the rate of the csl shifting due to grain breakage b r is the modified breakage index proposed by einav 2007 which can be considered as a function of the plastic work during loading 12 b r w p a w p where a is a material constant controlling the evolution of the breakage amount grain breakage was classified into three modes according to guyon and troadec 1994 1 fracture which means a grain breaks into smaller grains of similar sizes 2 attrition which means a grain breaks into one grain of a slightly smaller size and several much smaller ones 3 abrasion which means the result is that the grain size distribution remains almost constant but with a production of fine particles these three modes also associate with the applied stress level from low pressure to high pressure the grain breakage from the model 3 to mode 1 dominates the eq 12 follows this phenomenon note that there exists a threshold plastic work or stress level from a physical standpoint for which one more parameter needs to be introduced in fact this threshold value is questionable in terms of parameter calibration since the grain breakage of mode 3 cannot be clearly measured fortunately the eq 12 can capture very slight amount of grain breakage corresponding to mode 3 mainly due to inter particle shear sliding at low stress level 2 influence of grain breakage on compression behavior the evolution of p m due to grain breakage is added in eq 13 as follow 13 p m p m 0 exp 1 e 0 λ κ ε v p exp b b r note that the same constant b is used in eq 13 and eq 11 implying the same amount of shifting for isotropic compression line and critical state line which was previously validated by yin et al 2016 furthermore the eq 13 also assumed that the size of yield surface is controlled by two factors simultaneously the volumetric plastic strain and the modified breakage index overall the parameters of the adopted breakage model can be divided into four groups 1 elastic parameters k 0 n υ 2 critical state related parameters e ref λ ϕ u 3 plastic parameters g p a d and 4 grain breakage related parameters p m0 a b 3 identification methodology in general the mathematical procedure of optimization consists of two parts a the formulation of an error function measuring the difference between the numerical and experimental results and b the selection of an optimization strategy to enable the search for the minimum of this error function 3 1 error function to carry out a parameter identification using optimization method the user must define a function that can evaluate the error between the experimental and numerical results and then minimize this function for the optimization to be successful it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the material parameter sets predictions as accounted for in terms of a fitness function the material parameter sets with higher fitness should survive to produce new parameters sets therefore it is necessary to devise an error function so that the parameter sets with better predictions result in higher fitness values to make the error independent of the type of test and the number of measurement points an advanced error function can be adopted levasseur et al 2008 the average difference between the measured and the simulated results is expressed in the normalized form of the least square method 14 error x 1 n i 1 n u exp i u n u m i u exp i 2 100 where x is an n sized vector of unknown model input parameters n is the number of observation points u i o b s is the value corresponding to the ith point of observed data u i n u m is the value corresponding to the ith point of simulated data the scale effects on the fitness between the experimental and the simulated results can be eliminated by this normalized formula additionally the objective error calculated by this function is a dimensionless variable thus any difference in error can be avoided for different objectives with different variables due to the stability of eq 14 many researchers have adopted it as the error function to conduct the optimizations jin et al 2017a 2016b 2017c yin et al 2018 2017 3 2 enhancement of rcga algorithm after formulating the error function the selection of the search strategy is the key step of whether the optimized solution can be found or not the solution to an optimization problem is a vector x 0 which satisfies the global minimum condition for any x l x x u 15 f x 0 f x for obtaining a more accurate solution a highly efficient optimization method with the ability to search for a global minimum should be adopted since the ga is widely used in the geotechnical field as stated in the introduction the adopted real coded ga rcga algorithm has a similar structure to those developed by jin et al 2016c and yin et al 2017 to further accelerate the convergence speed and enhance the search ability the adopted rcga was enhanced by implementing a local search named nelder mead simplex nms with excellent convergence speed the proposed algorithm was named as nmga for simplicity in the following sections although the hybrid of nelder mead optimization scheme and ga with its efficiency has been well recognized during past decades chelouah and siarry 2003 durand and alliot 1999 on the premise of keeping the intrinsic advantage of hybrid between ga and simplex adopting newly developed optimization schemes is necessary and useful for solving complex geotechnical problems with more parameters in this study the nmga is different from previous works chelouah and siarry 2003 durand and alliot 1999 due to 1 the adoption of the newly developed rcga with outstanding performance in identifying soil parameters and 2 a newly developed nms operator for high dimensional problems fig 1 shows the flow chart which presents the simplest way of the enhancement first n initial individuals were generated by sobol which is a uniform sampling method proposed by sobol 1967 and the generation number was set to zero then all the individuals were sorted based on their fitness values and the best n 1 n is the number of variables individuals were selected to perform the nms for the nms a nelder mead method with adaptive parameters for high dimensional problems suggested by gao and han 2012 was adopted and a brief procedure of this method is presented in appendix i based on the result of the nms the best individual was updated then this best individual was recombined with the n 1 remaining individuals to perform the ga global search more details about the adopted rcga can be found in jin et al 2017c in order to avoid a rapid loss of diversity an elitism strategy was adopted in the rcga in the replacement process 10 of individuals with the highest fitness were selected from the parents and children to survive to the next generation the remainders were chosen by tournament selection from the mating pool composed of parents and children other than the 10 individuals the iteration stopped when the convergence criterion or the maximum generation number was reached for the nms the tolerance for convergence was set to 10 4 as recommended by gao and han 2012 for the adopted rcga the recommended settings can be found in jin et al 2016d during the optimization process the nms could accelerate the convergence speed but could easily get trapped in the local minimum on the other hand the rcga process can overcome the local minimum problem however the convergence speed is always slow and the approach is not applicable for the engineering applications jin et al 2016b 2017b yin et al 2017 therefore this hybrid strategy owns the advantages of both processes and results in better optimization performance 3 3 proposed identification procedure in general deformation and strength are two important indicators of the mechanical behavior of granular materials additionally the grain size distribution gsd is strongly associated with the grain breakage effect during the loading process and hence influence the mechanical behaviors liu et al 2014 especially for the crushable materials therefore the gsd is another indicator for measuring the degree of gain breakage for a laboratory triaxial test the isotropic or anisotropic compression test is normally first conducted followed by the shearing test during the whole testing process the measurements indicating the compression behavior shearing behavior and grain breakage behavior are recorded some model parameters can be directly determined based on the measurements e g the initial void ratio young s modulus jin et al 2016a 2016c while some variables cannot be directly measured e g the parameters related to grain breakage chen et al 2015 hu et al 2011 therefore the parameter identification using optimization method is proposed in this study a mono objective framework with 4 different criteria is considered 16 min error x min mean error com e error tri q error tri e error com tri gsd where errorcom e is the error of void ratio e between simulations and objectives for isotropic compression or anisotropic compression stage errortri q is the error in deviatoric stress q between simulations and objectives for the triaxial shearing stage errortri e is the error in void ratio e between simulation and objectives for triaxial shearing stage and errorcom tri gsd is the error in gsd curve between simulations and objectives for both compression and triaxial shearing stage all the errors mentioned above were calculated according to the eq 14 fig 2 shows the identification procedure which aims to find values for the model parameters and provide the best attainable fit between model predictions and corresponding observations in this study the procedure is based on two different codes the code for the integration of the constitutive model to simulate the objective tests and the code for the optimization process to find the minimum value of error function for each optimization process each individual in the initial population was generated using the sobol method sobol 1967 3 4 performance of nmga on identifying model parameters for evaluating the performance of the proposed nmga a set of synthetic tests including three drained triaxial tests e 0 0 8 with p 0 100 200 and 400 kpa and one isotropic compression test e 0 0 8 was generated by the adopted breakage model yin et al 2016 as the objectives in the optimization in order to simulate the breakage behavior of easily crushable materials a set of typical parameters the elastic parameters k 0 70 n 0 66 υ 0 25 the critical state related parameters e ref 1 0 λ 0 05 ϕ 35 the plastic parameters g p 5 a d 1 and the grain breakage related parameters p m0 500 kpa a 150 kpa b 10 was adopted to generate the synthetic tests and the simulated results are shown in fig 3 totally 10 model parameters were optimized by using the proposed optimization procedure as shown in eq 17 17 min f e x min f e k 0 n e r e f λ ϕ g p a d p m 0 a b where f e is the error function of the model parameters x is the model parameters the initial population size was set to 100 and the maximum number of generations was set to 300 the interval of each parameter is given in table 1 which covers a big range in terms of preset parameters for comparison and verifying the performance of the proposed nmga the original rcga without nelder mead simplex in jin et al 2016d and another outstanding algorithm moga ii used by papon et al 2012 were selected to conduct the same optimization optimal parameters obtained by nmga rcga and moga ii from synthetic data are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the preset parameters can be entirely detected within 300 generations by the proposed nmga however the performance of rcga and moga ii is worse satisfied comparing to that of the nmga fig 4 shows the evolution of minimum objective error in each generation with the increasing number of generations it can be seen that the proposed nmga has the faster convergence speed than the moga ii therefore all the comparisons demonstrate that the proposed nmga has an excellent performance on identifying model parameters for easily crushable sands 4 verification by limestone grains 4 1 brief introduction of laboratory tests on limestone grains in order to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed optimization procedure a series of conventional drained triaxial tests on limestone grains a easily crushable sand the mohr s hardness equals to 3 5 by lo and roy 1973 was selected as objective tests some main physical properties of this limestone grains are as follows specific gravity g s 2 71 initial void ratio e 0 0 81 maximum void ratio e max 1 05 and minimum void ratio e min 0 65 mean particle size d 50 0 215 mm uniformity coefficient c u 2 85 for simplicity all the tests with different confining pressures were marked by the sequence number the sequence number and the information for the corresponding test are summarized in table 3 before conducting the triaxial shear test each sample was compressed from the initial void ratio 0 81 to the corresponding confining pressure after shearing the change of grain size distribution for each sample was measured 4 2 optimization results and discussion following the proposed procedure the model parameters for limestone grains were identified by the proposed nmga in addition the rcga and the moga ii were also adopted to conduct the same identification procedure for comparisons for both adopted algorithms the initial individuals and the maximum number of generations were set to 100 other settings of rcga recommended by jin et al 2016d and moga ii recommended by papon et al 2012 were kept in this case to highlight the performance of the proposed procedure in identifying breakage related parameters the parameters related to compression behavior k 0 24 n 0 5 and p m0 1000 kpa which can be directly measured from isotropic compression curve were not put into the optimization procedure the poisson s ratio υ is assumed to be 0 25 which is a typical value for sand furthermore the remaining parameters e ref λ ϕ g p a d a b can also be determined in a direct way according to yin et al 2016 for sand that has a high yielding stress however for easily crushable sand the direct way to determine these parameters e ref λ ϕ g p a d a b based on laboratory tests is difficult due to the grain breakage occurring even in a very low stress level therefore apart from the parameters related to compression behavior k 0 24 n 0 5 and p m0 1000 kpa the remaining parameters e ref λ ϕ g p a d a b were optimized using the proposed procedure first for obtaining a set of most accurate parameters all the experimental data in total nine tests was used as the objective in the optimization process the objective error is defined as the average of error com e error tri q error tri e and error com tri gsd the interval of each parameter is also given in table 1 table 4 shows the comparison of optimal parameters and the corresponding objective error obtained by nmga rcga and moga ii it can be seen that the nmga gives a set of optimal parameters with smallest objective error among them using the optimal parameters the objective tests were simulated using the adopted breakage model fig 5 shows the comparisons of q ε a deviatoric stress versus axial strain isotropic compression curve and gsd curves between simulated and experimental results a good agreement between the simulations and observations indicates that the optimal parameters are reasonable and reliable which also indicates that nmga performs well in identifying breakage model parameters for easily crushable sand the convergence rates of nmga rcga and moga ii are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the convergence speed of nmga is much faster than that of rcga and moga ii which indicates a higher efficiency of nmga in the parameter identification this should be attractive for engineering application furthermore for investigating the influence of the weight of gsd in the error function on optimized parameters a scheme for evaluating the influence of the weight of gsd is presented in table 5 based on the error function in eq 18 18 min error x min mean a error com e error tri q error tri e 1 a error com tri gsd where the a is weight factor varying between 0 and 1 following the same optimization procedure the optimal parameters and objective errors corresponding to different weights of gsd are finally summarized in table 5 it can be seen that the weight of gsd ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 gives a good performance in identifying the parameters of the adopted breakage model therefore for obtaining an equal contribution of each term in the error function to the optimal parameters the weight of gsd is set to 0 5 the following optimizations are then conducted based on the error function in eq 18 with a value of 0 5 for the weight of gsd 4 3 estimation of minimum number of tests for identifying parameters traditionally three triaxial tests are needed for determining mechanical parameters of soils according to standard criterion of laboratory test however for determining parameters of critical state based models more laboratory tests including isotropic compression and shearing stages are appreciated jin et al 2016c for easily crushable sand it is questionable that how many tests are needed to determine the model parameters associated with grain breakage it is clear that the process of parameter identification based on large number of tests is time consuming and cost consuming which may not be preferred by the engineers in order to reduce the test cost in parameter identification the minimum number of tests involved in the objective to obtain a set of accurate parameters needs to be estimated since the amount of grain breakage significantly associates with the applied stress level two necessary tests i e one test performed under a lower confining stress and one test performed under a higher confining stress should be involved in the objective due to this the tests ➀ and➇ see table 3 were first selected as a basic component in all combinations one combination is one objective for optimization considering that the stress level of the test ➇ is high enough then combinations with three tests or four tests or five tests were constructed by adding one or two or three additional tests from database of tests 2 to 7 based on which a total of 41 combinations were formed as seen in table 6 all combinations were successively used for optimization to identify model parameters the examined combinations with the test number the obtained optimal parameters the objective error and the total average error are summarized in table 6 based on the total number of tests in the objective all the combinations were divided into four groups and marked as 3 tests 4 tests 5 tests and 8 tests fig 7 shows the minimum error and the average error in each group it can be seen that both the average error and the minimum error generally decrease with the increasing number of tests in the objective for some scatter points with big errors as combinations 1 2 3 and 12 a possible reason is the inaccuracy of critical state related parameters caused by the unreasonable selection of objective tests jin et al 2016c it can be seen that the minimum error and average error of the group containing four tests with more possible high stress tests or five tests is close to that obtained from 8 tests in terms of the obtained optimal parameters the average value of each optimal parameter for each group has been calculated and is summarized in table 7 it can be found that with increasing the quantity of tests in the objective the obtained optimal parameters gradually approach to the most accurate set of parameters from all eight tests the difference of the obtained optimal parameters the objective error and the total average error between the group with five tests and the group with all eight tests is very small which can be ignored in the engineering practice therefore it can be concluded that a total of four tests including two basic tests and two additional high stress tests or a total of five tests including two basic tests and three additional tests are sufficient for the parameter identification 5 application to pile driving in carbonate sand the pile driven in sand especially in easily crushable sand involves great amount of grain breakage thus the numerical analysis of this kind of problem needs to consider the grain breakage effect in the mechanical behavior of sand to date various numerical studies on pile penetration in sand considering the grain breakage have been conducted zhang et al 2013 2014 however apart from grain breakage nonlinear elasticity dilatancy and contraction with the soil density effect were not properly considered in those works and the parameters were not fully calibrated against a series of laboratory tests on the same sand before the simulation accordingly a case of pile driving in carbonate sand was selected as an illustrative example to highlight the proposed procedure in identifying parameters while the adopted model in simulating pile driven to exhibit the predictive ability of the adopted breakage model with validating the optimized parameters a series of centrifuge tests by klotz and coop 2001 which is more realistic than the case of zhang et al 2013 in terms of field condition were selected these tests were conducted directly for the practical use on investigating the bearing capacity of offshore driven pile in very easily crushable sand furthermore the choice of centrifuge tests using dog s bay sand is also because that more laboratory tests on this sand with measurements of gsd before and after testing were provided than the case of zhang et al 2013 this section presents the application of the proposed identification procedure to identify parameters of dog s bay sand which was finally applied to the large deformation analysis of the pile driving in the same sand 5 1 parameter identification of dog s bay sand four drained constant p triaxial tests with different initial confining pressures by bandini and coop 2011 and one isotropic compression tests by coop 1990 performed on dog s bay sand were selected as the objective in the optimization due to the limited test data only two gsd curves were used in the optimization procedure for the simplicity all the selected constant p tests were marked as d 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 table 8 shows the initial void ratio and confining pressure for each selected test based on the necessary number of tests suggested previously the tests of d 1 2 3 4 and 5 were used as the objectives in the optimization and the tests of d 6 and 7 were used for validation following the proposed procedure the parameters of the adopted breakage model for dog s bay sand were identified by using nmga table 9 summarizes the optimal parameters using the optimal parameters the objective tests were first simulated fig 8 a d shows the comparison of isotropic compression test constant p tests and gsd curves between the optimal simulations and experiments then three additional drained constant p triaxial tests were used for validation as shown in fig 8 e f it can be seen that the simulations generally well agree with the measurements which demonstrates that the identified parameters of the adopted breakage model by the proposed procedure are reliable 5 2 modelling of pile driving tests 5 2 1 description of pile driving tests a series of centrifuge pile penetration tests on dog s bay sand under an acceleration of 100 g performed by klotz and coop 2001 were simulated by using the adopted breakage model with the optimal parameters the pile is closed ended and the diameter is 16 mm the maximum penetration into the sand is about 375 mm which equals to 1 6 m in diameter and 37 5 m in height for the real case the cylindrical container has an internal diameter of d 40 cm and a height of 63 cm with rigid walls to avoid lateral displacements of soil which equals to 32 m and 54 m for the real case respectively two different initial void ratios e 0 1 53 and e 0 1 39 of dog s bay sand were used in the centrifuge test the pile was pushed into the sand at a speed of 0 02 m s for both tests in real case klotz and coop 2001 5 2 2 model implementation into finite element code the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method in the abaqus hibbitt et al 2001 that captures the advantages of both the lagrangian and the eulerian method which is effective on solving the large deformation problems in numerical analyses using this cel method the eulerian material is tracked as it flows through the mesh by computing its eulerian volume fraction evf each eulerian element is designated by a percentage which represents the portion of that element filled with a eulerian material for simulating pile penetration tests the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method in abaqus was adopted to deal with the analysis of large deformation at the edge of pile penetration hamann et al 2015 qiu et al 2011 the adopted breakage model was implemented into abaqus as a user defined material model via vumat user defined material model for abaqus explicit to simulate dog s bay sand the explicit time integration scheme was used in the implementation in abaqus explicit hibbitt et al 2001 the central difference rule is employed for the solution of the non linear system of differential equations the unknown solution for the next time step can be found directly from the solution of the previous time step such that no iteration is needed the model implementation was examined by simulating above triaxial tests on limestone grains and carbonate sand all simulation results were the same as those obtained by the single integration point program which validated the model implementation 5 2 3 finite element model due to the axial symmetry of the problem a three dimensional finite element fe model for 1 quarter of the model test was established as illustrated in fig 9 the dimension of fe model was same as the equivalent real case of model tests the bottom of fe model was fixed in three directions the lateral of fe model was fixed in horizontal directions and the vertical direction was free the pile was modeled as a rigid body the dog s bay sand was modeled by using 62000 eulerian elements the upper 2 m were modeled by void to allow the eulerian material to flow into during the pile penetration the contact between the pile and dog s bay sand was described by the classical coulomb friction law with a friction coefficient μ tan ϕ μ 2 0 40 according to klotz and coop 2001 the initial stress state before loading was generated by self weight with k 0 0 305 according to jacky s formula the parameters of dog s bay sand optimized previously in table 9 were used for the simulation the total penetration displacement is 37 5 m and the penetration speed was 0 02 m s 5 2 4 results and comparisons fig 10 shows the comparisons of q b z curves between the measurements and the simulations for two centrifuge pile penetration tests where q b represents the base resistance and z is the penetration displacement of the pile a general good agreement between the predictions and observations demonstrates that the adopted model has an outstanding ability in capturing the pile penetration behavior accounting for the effect of grain breakage and the identified model parameters are reliable due to the instability and the numerical oscillation of explicit calculations the obtained curves are not always smooth taking the simulation with e 0 1 53 as example the information of void ratio deviatoric plastic strain modified breakage index b r and mean effective stress during the process of pile driven is presented fig 11 shows the distribution of these information at a penetration depth of 5 m 10 m and 37 m it can be seen that the mean effective stress around the pile head is increased with increasing the pile penetration depth the increased mean effective stress and deviatoric plastic strain result in globally decreasing the void ratio so that make the sand denser and simultaneously causes more breakage of sand grains due to increasing plastic work the maximum value of void ratio reached to 1 639 due to the dilatancy effect during the pile penetration especially in the area close to the top surface in sand surrounding the pile fig 12 presents the distribution of breakage index with different profiles in surrounding soil at the distance of 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 m from pile at the penetration depth of 37 m fig 13 shows the distributions of breakage index along the radius distance from the pile at penetration depths of 5 m 10 m and 37 m it seems that the crushing influenced zone predicted by the breakage model is within approximately a radius of pile from the shaft however it is a pity that the breakage growth cannot be compared against the experimental data since it is not available 6 conclusions an efficient optimization procedure to identify the breakage model s parameters for easily crushable sand has been proposed using which the capacity of offshore pile driving was numerically estimated in the optimization procedure a newly developed elasto plastic constitutive model accounting for grain breakage was adopted to simulate the objective tests for measuring the error between the simulations and objective tests to improve the performance of identification a new optimization algorithm nmga was proposed by implementing the nelder mead simplex into a recently developed real coded genetic algorithm first the computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed nmga were evaluated by comparing with the rcga and the moga ii algorithms all the three optimization methods were applied to conduct the same parameter identification in the optimization the objective was three synthetic drained triaxial tests generated by the adopted breakage model with a set of parameters representing an easily crushable sand the results show that the performance of proposed nmga on search ability and convergence speed is better than the rcga and moga ii then the proposed optimization procedure was examined by identifying the model parameters of limestone grains adopting all the experimental tests as the objective the results show that the obtained optimal parameters are accurate and reasonable to reduce the cost of parameters determination the minimum number of tests involved in the objective was investigated the results indicate that five tests including one test at low confining pressure and one test at high confining pressure are sufficient for the parameter identification which can be adopted in testing code for practice finally the adopted breakage model s parameters of a typically carbonate sand dog s bay sand were optimized using the proposed procedure the coupled eulerian lagrangian based large deformation finite element analysis combined with the breakage model was carried out for pile driving in the same sand for which the finite element implementation of the model was also conducted good agreement was achieved between the simulations and measurements furthermore the role of grain breakage in bearing capacity of driven pile was numerically discussed overall it can be concluded that the proposed optimization procedure is efficient and reliable on identifying the model parameters for easily crushable sand and the developed numerical platform is applicable for estimating the capacity

23534,characterising storm surge in extreme sea states is important in offshore design here we estimate key surge design characteristics such as the maximum surge observed during a storm event of given extreme storm severity and covariates such as storm direction inferences are made using a simple non stationary implementation of the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 comprising a set of coupled piecewise stationary marginal and dependence models defined on a partition of the covariate domain the approach uses samples consisting of pairs of values for peaks over threshold of a conditioning variate namely storm peak significant wave height and the corresponding peaks over threshold of an associated value of a key surge characteristic each pair is allocated to a particular storm direction covariate interval and all pairs within the same interval are assumed to exhibit common stationary marginal and conditional extreme value behaviour non stationary marginal extreme value characteristics for each variate are estimated using maximum roughness penalised generalised pareto likelihood estimation over covariate intervals extremal dependence between variates on a transformed standard gumbel scale is then estimated using maximum roughness penalised likelihood estimation for a conditional extremes model also piecewise stationary with respect to covariates sample and threshold uncertainties are quantified using a bootstrapping scheme marginal and conditional return value distributions estimated using numerical integration incorporate these uncertainties from offshore radar based measurements at locations in the northern central and southern north sea we observe that characteristics of surge and significant wave height vary with wave direction at all locations surge is a larger contributor to extreme seas in the southern north sea than in the northern north sea in particular there is evidence that extremal dependence between surge characteristics and significant wave height also varies with storm direction hence the size of surge contribution to return values of total water level also varies with storm direction and location keywords surge significant wave height conditional extremes non stationary return value 1 introduction the total extreme water level tewl at a location during a storm event determines whether waves will impact topsides and supporting beams of an offshore structure at that location causing large structural loads of considerable concern since tewl is the sum of mean sea level tide storm surge and wave crest elevation a joint model for extremes of all of these components is required in order to predict its extremal characteristics well the physics of mean sea level tide and surge has been studied for decades e g pugh 1987 as has that of wind waves e g kinsman 2012 considerable attention has also been devoted to estimation of storm surge during tropical storms e g needham et al 2015 and extra tropical storms e g bernier and thompson 2006 and the interaction between surge and tide e g horsburgh and wilson 2007 olbert et al 2013 williams et al 2016 physically storm surge is a large scale increase in sea level due to a storm lasting from hours to days over areas of hundreds of km2 the magnitude of storm surge is influenced by many physical processes and those same processes control surge in both extra tropical and tropical cyclones atmospheric pressure differences in ocean storms cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of relatively low atmospheric pressure harris 1963 estimated an increase in sea level of the order of 1 cm for every hpa reduction in atmospheric pressure high wind stress at the sea surface and the horizontal gradient of atmospheric pressure are other important contributors as is storm intensity and trajectory in shallow and coastal waters bathymetry and topography become important in regions of high tidal range the joint occurrence of storm and tidal high water is sometimes referred to as storm tide the slosh model of hurricane surge jelesnianski et al 1992 predicts the maximum envelope of water at a location given hurricane characteristics such as central pressure storm size forward motion track and maximum sustained winds however the slosh model does not explicitly model the aggregate impact of surge and crest bernier and thompson 2006 seeks to predict the frequency of storm surges and extreme sea levels in the north west atlantic using a 2 d non linear barotropic ocean model to construct a 40 year hindcast for the region where tide surge interactions exist they lead to lower total water levels than in the case of independence the degree of decrease varies with extent of dependence magnitude of surge peak at a particular phase of tide and the distribution of peaks over a tidal cycle coles and tawn 2005a identify strong seasonal effects in measurements of extreme surges at locations on the eastern coastline of the united kingdom subsequently coles and tawn 2005b propose a bayesian model for extreme surge and outline a procedure to estimate the distribution of the sum of surge and tide the effect of future climate on north sea storm surge is also of considerable interest e g gaslikova et al 2013 vousdoukas et al 2017 butler et al 2007a conduct trend estimation in synthetic storm surges butler et al 2007b reports extreme value analysis of decadal variation in storm surges including a discussion of the effect of north atlantic oscillation and tide surge interaction the joint statistics of extreme storm surge and sea state severity at an arbitrary location in the ocean has also received some attention e g hawkes et al 2002 rueda et al 2016 mazas and hamm 2017 the objective of the current work is to establish a statistical model for surge characteristics conditional on the occurrence of extreme values of significant wave height h s methods of multivariate extreme value analysis are required to describe the joint characteristics of extremes of multiple variables the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 provides a flexible estimation framework given that the characteristics of extreme h s at a location vary systematically with covariates such as storm direction it is likely that the joint statistics of surge and h s are non stationary with respect to covariates extensions to the conditional extremes model such as jonathan et al 2014 allow estimation of multivariate extremal dependence in the presence of covariates and hence estimation of tails of distributions of structure variables and design contours of interest the conditional extremes model is motivated by an asymptotic form for the limiting conditional distribution of one or more conditioned random variables given a large value of a conditioning variable an outline of the approach is given by jonathan et al 2010 in application to wave spectral characteristics conditions for the asymptotic argument to hold have been explored by heffernan and resnick 2007 an alternative to the conditional extremes model is a suitable extreme value copula e g gudendorf and segers 2010 bender et al 2014 and serafin and ruggiero 2014 propose bivariate extreme value models incorporating non stationary marginal and dependence inference the main advantage of the conditional extremes model compared with models such as those of bender et al 2014 and serafin and ruggiero 2014 is that the former incorporates a full class of asymptotic extremal dependence and also allows relatively straightforward extension to higher dimensions the layout of the article is as follows section 2 introduces the north sea application and illustrates the data used in this work section 3 describes the piecewise stationary extreme value model mathematical detail corresponding to the model are given in the appendix a conditional model for surge characteristics given extreme storm peak h s is established in section 4 section 5 provides discussion and conclusions 2 motivating application data for the current work comes from two sources the first is measurements of sea surface elevation at four offshore platforms in the north sea using saab rex wave radars measurements were taken at one location in the northern and central north sea and two locations in the southern north sea henceforth referred to as nns cns sns1 and sns2 for brevity at each location harmonic analysis of surface elevation time series identified mean sea level tidal variation and a non tidal residual component interpreted as surge in the current work see e g pugh 1987 significant wave height h s for sea states of 30 min duration was also estimated from the surface elevation time series between 12 and 16 years of measurements were available each of the nns cns sns1 and sns2 locations the second data source is the wam north sea hindcast reistad et al 2009 from which time series of wave direction corresponding to the surface elevation time series at the four locations were extracted knowledge of wave direction is essential for reasonable characterisation of extreme storms in the north sea wave direction is used as a covariate in the analysis below time series of sea state h s was then used to identify storm events following the approach described in ewans and jonathan 2008 a total of between 1000 and 1100 storms were isolated at each of the nns cns sns1 and sns2 locations for each storm event a storm peak h s b wave direction at the time of storm peak referred to as storm peak direction θ and c time series of surge for the duration of the storm referred to the surge trajectory were isolated fig 1 shows typical surge trajectories for each of the four locations the relative importance of surge effects is known to vary between the four locations in the northern north sea surge generally makes a small contribution to severe seas whereas the surge contribution is generally larger in the southern north sea fig 1 suggests that the magnitude of surge increases with decreasing latitude in the north sea the relative importance of surge in the estimation of tewl is therefore clearly greater for locations sns1 and sns2 fig 1 also shows that the lengths of storms and hence of surge trajectories varies considerably within and between locations moreover it is clear that the time of maximum surge does not typically coincide with the time of peak storm severity corresponding to zero on the x axis in fig 1 for simplicity each surge trajectory was next summarised in terms of four statistics for subsequent extreme value analysis namely the maximum value srgmxm the negative of the minimum value srgngtmnm the median value srgmdn and the range srgrng of values per surge trajectory we chose to model the negative of minimum surge since this shows non negative dependence with increasing storm severity storm peak h s is known to vary with storm peak direction θ and the importance of accommodating this non stationary in extreme value models has been established for this reason each bivariate sample of storm peak h s and surge characteristic was partitioned by inspection of plots and consideration of likely fetch effects into covariate intervals or directional sector for the current covariate within which distributions of storm peak h s and surge characteristic were found to be approximately stationary fig 2 shows scatter plots of the maximum surge srgmxm observed per storm event against storm peak h s per covariate interval for each of the four locations four covariate intervals were used for the nns location and three elsewhere there are noteworthy differences between the characteristics of the various scatter plots for sns2 srgmxm increases with storm peak h s for directional sector 240 0 to values above 1 m however for the other two directional sectors the mean value of srgmxm corresponding to large h s appears to be around zero fig 3 shows scatter plots of srgrng on storm peak h s per directional sector per location again there are differences between scatter plots due to location and storm direction extreme value analysis of the samples of srgmxm srgngtmnm srgmdn srgrng storm peak h s and direction θ per location is discussed in section 4 3 the piecewise stationary extreme value model overview consider a sample d y i 1 y i 2 i 1 n of n pairs of values of peaks over threshold for a conditioning variate y 1 0 and an associated conditioned variate y 2 0 further let x i i 1 n be the corresponding values of a covariate x on some domain x in this work we assume a single directional covariate with x 0 360 extension to more complex covariate domains is straightforward compared to other approaches as discussed in section 5 our objective using the sample is to make inferences about joint structure of y 1 and y 2 for large values of y 1 and likely non stationarity with respect to x x the modelling procedure presented here is a refinement of the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 and proceeds in four steps a marginal extreme value modelling of y 1 and y 2 given x followed by b transformation to y 1 and y 2 given x with standard marginal distributions c dependence modelling of y 2 y 1 x for large y 1 and d estimation of return values of y 2 y 1 x for large y 1 the procedure is outlined here first for the general non stationary case then for the particular form of non stationarity assumed in the piecewise stationary model we then elaborate on the four stages individually for the piecewise stationary model in sections 3 1 3 3 mathematical details are provided in the appendix 3 1 general non stationary case we estimate a marginal generalised pareto model non stationary with respect to x for threshold exceedances for each of y 1 and y 2 for general variable y and threshold ψ 0 the generalised pareto cumulative distribution function is f g p y ξ σ ψ ℙ y y y ψ x x 1 1 ξ σ y ψ 1 ξ with ξ ℝ σ 0 a n d y ψ y where y ψ σ ξ when ξ 0 and otherwise in practice threshold ψ might correspond to a local quantile of the sample given covariate with specified non exceedance probability τ 0 1 estimated using non stationary quantile regression in practice plots of parameter estimates from models corresponding to different thresholds aid the selection of τ per variable showing appropriate behaviour including approximate stability of the estimate of ξ for thresholds larger than the chosen τ parameter estimates for ξ σ and ψ per variable are all in general functions of covariate x fitted marginal models are used to transform the variables y 1 and y 2 to y 1 and y 2 on standard gumbel scale and hence sample d to d using the probability integral transform then we fit a conditional extremes model for y 2 y 1 x for various choices of high threshold ϕ ℝ for the conditioning variate y 1 retaining the estimated model parameters and residuals ϕ is typically a quantile of the standard gumbel distribution with non exceedance probability κ 0 1 plots of model parameter estimates and residual distributions for different threshold choices aid selection of κ consistent with modelling assumptions the conditional extremes model form is y 2 y 1 y x x α y y β w for y ϕ where α 0 1 and β 1 w is a random variable with unknown distribution the density of which we estimate using residuals from the fitted model for fitting purposes only we assume that w n μ ζ 2 with μ ℝ and ζ 2 0 the model fitting procedure corresponds to estimating α β μ ζ given a sample of values for y 1 y 2 x and threshold ϕ all of ϕ α β μ and ζ are in general functions of covariate x using the marginal and conditional extremes models for the distribution of threshold exceedances and empirical sample based distributions for non exceedances numerical integration is used to estimate the distribution of y 2 y 1 x for large y 1 and hence that of y 2 y 1 x for large values of y 1 this permits estimation of the conditional return value distribution namely the distribution of y 2 given occurrences of the t year return values of y 1 3 2 piecewise stationary case the piecewise stationary model uses this approach for a particularly simple description of non stationarity with respect to covariates in marginal and dependence models for each observation in the sample the value of covariate x i is used to allocate the observation to one and only one of m covariate intervals c k k 1 m by means of an allocation vector a such that k a i and x c k for each k all observations in the set y 1 i y 2 i a i k with the same covariate interval c k are assumed to have common joint extreme value characteristics 3 3 marginal extremes and transformation to gumbel scale non stationary marginal extreme value characteristics of each variate are estimated in turn using a generalised pareto model and cross validated roughness penalised maximum likelihood estimation as outlined below and in the appendix for variable j 1 2 and covariate interval c k the extreme value threshold ψ j k 0 is assumed to be a quantile of the empirical distribution of the variate in that interval with specified non exceedance probability τ j 0 1 with τ j constant across intervals and estimated by counting threshold exceedances are assumed to follow the generalised pareto distribution with shape ξ j ℝ and scale σ j k 0 with cumulative distribution function f g p y ξ j σ j k ψ j k 1 1 ξ j σ j k y ψ j k 1 ξ j where y ψ j k y j k with y j k ψ j k σ j k ξ j when ξ j 0 and otherwise since estimation of shape parameter is particularly problematic ξ j is assumed constant but unknown across covariate intervals and the reasonableness of the assumption assessed by inspection of diagnostic plots parameters ξ j σ j k are estimated by maximising the predictive performance of a roughness penalised model optimally regulating the extent to which σ j k varies across interval using a cross validation procedure equations for marginal model estimation are given in the appendix the standard gumbel distribution has cumulative distribution function f g y exp exp y for y ℝ we transform the non stationary sample d y i 1 y i 2 on generalised pareto scale to the corresponding stationary standard gumbel sample d y i 1 y i 2 using the probability integral transform by defining y i 1 y i 2 such that f g y i j f g p y i j ξ j σ j a i ψ j a i per covariate interval the transformed sample is then assumed to be a stationary sample from a standard gumbel distribution estimation of marginal extreme value models for the north sea application is discussed in section 4 1 we note that transformation to laplace scale provides a useful alternative to gumbel transformation especially when considering negative tail dependence e g keef et al 2013 3 4 conditional extremes the gumbel scale sample d y i 1 y i 2 above some threshold of the conditioning variate y 1 is used to estimate a conditional extremes model with parameters α k 0 1 and β 1 given by y 2 y 1 y i 1 α a i y i 1 y i 1 β w for y ϕ where w n μ ζ 2 with μ ℝ and ζ 2 0 is assumed for model estimation only threshold ϕ ℝ is defined as the quantile of the standard gumbel distribution with non exceedance probability κ 0 1 note that since identifying β is particularly problematic it is assumed constant but unknown across covariate intervals similarly since they are intended to describe a generic residual structure both μ and ζ 2 are also assumed to be stationary with respect to covariate once more the reasonableness of these modelling assumptions is assessed by inspection of diagnostic plots estimation of the conditional extremes model for the north sea application is discussed in section 4 2 3 5 marginal and conditional return values from an engineering perspective the main inferences from the current analysis are estimates for marginal and conditional return values corresponding to some long return period t typically these are obtained by monte carlo simulation under the models outlined in sections 3 1 and 3 2 specifying a monte carlo scheme even for relatively complex simulations is generally straightforward when t is small of the order of 100 years say simulation is also computationally easy monte carlo estimation might therefore be preferred when t is large however with t 10 7 years of interest for some analysis monte carlo simulation becomes computationally tedious and demanding in these circumstances numerical integration schemes yield dramatic reductions in the computational complexity of return value estimation as outlined in ross et al 2017 specification of the numerical integration scheme usually requires some effort as illustrated in the appendix for the current work but computationally this effort pays dividends we use numerical integration to estimate cumulative distribution functions for marginal and conditional return values as follows we estimate a the marginal return value distributions f m 1 k and f m 2 k for a t year return period of y 1 and y 2 per covariate interval c k b the corresponding omni directional return value distributions f m 1 and f m 2 over all covariate intervals c the conditional return value distribution f 2 m 1 k of y 2 given the occurrence of a t year event of y 1 in covariate interval c k and d the conditional return value distribution f 2 m 1 of y 2 given the occurrence of an omni directional t year event of y 1 regardless of the covariate interval in which the t year event of y 1 occurs details of the numerical integration schemes used to estimate a d are given in the appendix estimates of the different return value distributions for the north sea application are illustrated in section 4 3 3 6 uncertainty quantification in practice the complete modelling procedure is repeated for n b s bootstrap resamples d b of the original sample d to capture sampling uncertainty for each sample d b to capture marginal threshold specification uncertainty marginal models for y 1 y 2 are evaluated for marginal thresholds ψ 1 ψ 2 with non exceedance probabilities τ 1 τ 2 drawn at random from the intervals i τ 1 i τ 2 both 0 1 on which model performance is deemed reasonable from inspection of diagnostics following transformation to standard gumbel scale sample d b to capture conditional threshold uncertainty a conditional extremes model is then evaluated for dependence threshold ϕ with non exceedance probabilities κ drawn at random from interval i κ 0 1 on which the conditional model fit is deemed adequate computationally thus the estimate for each marginal and dependence parameter corresponds to a n b s array of values capturing sampling and threshold specification uncertainty used for uncertainty quantification in parameter and return value inference as described in the appendix 4 application to north sea locations the characteristics of srgmxm srgngtmnm srgmdn and srgrng given large values of storm peak h s and direction θ per location are estimated using the piecewise stationary model for brevity the analysis procedure from section 3 is described in sections 4 1 and 4 2 and illustrated in figs 4 10 and fig 12 for the case of srgmxm at the cns location only estimates for marginal and conditional return value distributions are discussed in section 4 3 and illustrated in fig 11 for all surge characteristics at all locations further since the analysis involves storm peak significant wave height as opposed to significant wave height for individual sea states we use h s to indicate storm peak significant wave height unless clearly indicated to the contrary 4 1 marginal extremes we conduct conditional extreme value analysis of srgmxm and storm peak h s non stationary with respect to storm peak direction θ as outlined in section 3 the first stage of analysis involves marginal extreme value modelling for h s and srgmxm illustrated in fig 4 to facilitate this covariate intervals were selected within which the joint characteristics of srgmxm and h s were observed from inspection of diagnostic plots to be approximately stationary in this case the three covariate intervals selected correspond approximately to the land shadow of the united kingdom θ 160 270 open water to the atlantic and norwegian seas θ 270 40 and the land shadow of the european mainland from norway to france θ 40 160 the piecewise stationary generalised pareto model is applied independently to threshold exceedances for each variable with thresholds per variable specified as quantiles of the marginal distribution per directional interval of θ with non exceedance probabilities τ 1 i τ 1 and τ 2 i τ 2 intervals i τ 1 i τ 2 were specified by inspection of diagnostic plots for model adequacy over a wide range of values of τ e g fig 7 as discussed below fig 4 a d show estimated thresholds for h s and srgmxm in terms of bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty bands over n b s 500 bootstrap resamples of the original sample with i τ 1 0 7 0 8 and i τ 2 0 65 0 75 the original sample is shown in terms of threshold exceedances black and non exceedances grey for h s there appears to be little variability in threshold level across covariate intervals the largest two h s events correspond to storms emanating from the east the threshold for srgmxm shows clearer directional variability surge effects are larger when storms emanate from approximately the south and are smaller for storms from the east for each bootstrap resample of each variable generalised pareto models are estimated fig 4 b e give bootstrap distributions for the estimated generalised pareto shape parameter ξ set constant with respect to θ for storm peak h s ξ is centred at approximately 0 15 but for srgmxm the bootstrap distribution is centred at approximately zero indicating that the distribution of srgmxm has a longer tail than that of h s fig 4 c f show the estimate for generalised pareto scale parameter σ in terms of its bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty band per covariate interval for h s the estimate for σ is larger in the covariate interval corresponding to largest values of h s for srgmxm the estimate of σ is lower in the sector corresponding to smaller values of srgmxm to confirm model fit tail diagnostic plots such as those illustrated in figs 5 and 6 for h s and srgmxm are inspected fig 5 shows that the tail of empirical distribution of h s from the sample is in agreement with the estimated generalised pareto tail represented in terms of a bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty band for each covariate interval and omni directionally over all covariate intervals in the bottom right hand plot of fig 5 it is important also to establish that the estimate for generalised pareto shape ξ is approximately constant with threshold for all thresholds corresponding to intervals i τ 1 i τ 2 fig 7 shows this variation for the srgmxm model as a function of threshold non exceedance probability τ 2 for values of τ 2 0 65 0 75 the estimate of ξ appears to be constant for larger values of τ 2 to within bootstrap uncertainty for this reason we set i τ 2 0 65 75 for marginal modelling of srgmxm at the cns location diagnostic plots such as those illustrated in figs 5 7 were inspected to confirm adequacy of marginal fits for h s and all surge characteristics at all locations 4 2 conditional extremes for each bootstrap resample d b of the original sample d and random choices of τ 1 i τ 1 and τ 2 i τ 2 marginal models for srgmxm and h s are estimated and used to transform the resample to standard gumbel scale as explained in section 3 the gumbel scale sample d b is then used to estimate the conditional extremes model for thresholds of the conditioning variate corresponding with non exceedance probabilities κ i κ inspection of fit residuals fig 8 and parameter stability with κ fig 10 suggested setting i κ 0 55 0 65 for srgmxm on h s at the cns location with this choice the characteristics of residuals r h see appendix are illustrated in fig 8 the left hand panel suggests that residuals are centred around zero with a unimodal distribution showing a longer right hand tail the right hand panel suggests that the distribution of residuals is approximately stationary with respect to θ these diagnostic plots suggest that the piecewise stationary model framework with β μ and ζ constant with respect to θ is reasonable parameter estimates for the conditional extremes model are shown in fig 9 only slope parameter α α k varies between intervals in the piecewise stationary model the top left panel summarises α in terms of bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty bands per as a function of θ there is evidence that α is lower for the covariate interval 45 150 corresponding to the land shadow of mainland europe than elsewhere the estimate of α is considerably less than unity everywhere suggesting that srgmxm and h s show asymptotic independence e g eastoe et al 2013 the estimate of scale exponent parameter β is centred around 0 3 suggesting that the width of the distribution of srgmxm given h s increases with increasing h s residual mean μ and scale ζ are centred around 0 2 and 1 1 fig 10 explores the stability of estimates for α k and β as a function of conditional extremes threshold non exceedance probability κ i κ estimates for α k in each covariate interval and β are all stationary to within bootstrap uncertainty suggesting that a reasonable choice of i κ has been made 4 3 marginal and conditional return values using the numerical integration approach outlined in section 3 3 and the appendix marginal and conditional return values were estimated for a t 100 year return period the left hand panel of fig 11 gives estimates for the marginal omni directional 100 year return value distribution f m 1 of storm peak h s at each of the nns red cns green sns1 cyan and sns2 purple locations the median 100 year return value is approximately 15 m for nns 12 m for cns and 4 m for sns1 and sns2 as might be expected the return value distributions are of course rather broad reflecting both inherent aleatory uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty estimated by bootstrapping for example we would not be too surprised to observe 100 year return values of storm peak h s at the nns location in excess of 17 m the centre and right hand panels of the figure give the corresponding omni directional marginal f m 2 solid and conditional f 2 m 1 dashed return value estimates one panel for each of the four surge characteristics of interest for srgmxm top centre of fig 11 marginal surge is greatest in the southern north sea with median 100 year values approaching 2 m compared with approximately 1 m at cns and 0 5 m at nns these observations are consistent with the trends in fig 2 and physical intuition it is noteworthy however that the conditional distribution of srgmxm given the occurrence of omni directional 100 year h s yields considerably lower estimates for nns and cns the median conditional surge is approximately zero however for sns the median conditional surge remains at around 1 5 m approximately 80 of the marginal 100 year maximum surge of 1 8 m this demonstrates that consideration of surge and conditional surge in particular is much more important for design in extreme seas of this region of the north sea characteristics of the corresponding return value distributions for srgmdn srgngtmnm and srgrng are generally rather similar of particular interest is the fact that the conditional distributions of srgngtmnm at sns1 and sns2 are considerably to the left of corresponding marginal distributions this is not the case for other surge characteristics fig 11 shows that differences exist between omni directional marginal and corresponding conditional return value distributions fig 12 illustrates at the cns location that directional marginal and conditional return value distributions have interesting differences also the top panel for the figure gives directional marginal return value distributions f m 1 k for storm peak h s for t 100 years together with the omni directional distribution f m 1 black the omni directional return value almost coincides with the directional distribution for the θ 45 150 covariate interval return values for the two remaining covariate intervals are smaller the second panel shows that the omni directional return value distribution for srgmxm has large contributions from all covariate intervals except for θ 45 150 this has an interesting effect on the location of the omni directional conditional return value distribution dashed black because the most severe storms correspond to θ 45 150 for which srgmxm is relatively small the omni directional conditional return value distribution is itself similar to that for the 45 150 covariate interval with median value around 0 1 m however the conditional return value distributions of srgmxm for covariate intervals 270 45 and 150 270 are considerably to the right of the omni directional conditional distribution informally we might interpret this information for design in the following manner for estimation of tewl ignoring mean sea level and tide omni directionally h s has a 100 year median of around 11 3 m to which a median associated srgmxm contribution of 0 1 m is added yielding tewl of 11 4 m however for the 270 45 covariate interval h s has a median return value of approximately 10 0 m to which a median associated srgmxm contribution of 0 5 m is added yielding tewl of 10 5 m that is srgmxm makes a greater associated contribution to tewl in covariate interval 270 45 than it does omni directionally we also see informally that naive addition of median omni directional marginal h s of around 11 3 m to median omni directional marginal srgmxm of around 1 1 m yields tewl of 12 4 m this estimate is 1 0 m larger that the more realistic estimate based on median marginal h s and median associated srgmxm 5 discussion and conclusions in this work we examine the statistical properties of storm surge in extreme north sea storms using a non stationary conditional extreme value model consisting of a set of coupled piecewise stationary models on a partition of the domain of a storm direction covariate we find evidence for variation of marginal and conditional extreme surge characteristics with storm direction and location in particular we provide an efficient numerical integration algorithm to estimate marginal and conditional return value distributions of surge characteristics sampling and threshold selection uncertainties are incorporated within inferences using a bootstrapping scheme the piecewise stationary model appears to be adequate in terms of its complexity for the samples examined here the whole modelling procedure can be completed for one surge characteristic at one location in approximately 5 min the approach requires specification of covariate partition c k prior to analysis in the current work choice of covariate partition boundaries was informed by inspection of data and elementary physical understanding of likely directional effects on significant wave height and surge at each location sensitivity of inferences to small changes in locations of partition boundaries was investigated empirically and found generally to be small an improved procedure for specification of the covariate partition could be considered including estimation of the partition boundaries and in principle the number of boundaries as part of the extreme value inference this was not attempted here to avoid introducing undue complexity in model estimation extension of the piecewise stationary model to higher p dimensional covariates p 1 is relatively straightforward simply define c k as a partition of the covariate domain in p dimensions for the typical size n and quality of samples available for analysis identification of models with p 2 is likely to be problematic we anticipate that inclusion of season at covariate may be of benefit currently the marginal directional threshold for h s effectively eliminates all but winter storms adopting a directional seasonal threshold and piecewise stationary model might provide the opportunity to examine seasonality in more detail inferences concerning key surge characteristics such as srgmxm srgmdn and srgngtmnm can be used to forecast a complete surge trajectory s t for some interval of time t corresponding to an extreme storm with specified storm peak h s and direction θ we might choose to do this by adjusting a historical surge trajectory s t for a storm with similar h s and θ linearly using s t s o s t s o s s o s s o s t s o s o s t s o s o s s s o s t s o where s s o and s are negative srgngtmnm srgmdn and srgmxm for the selected historical surge trajectory and s s o and s are the corresponding quantities for the forecast surge trajectory estimated jointly using the piecewise stationary model an alternative strategy would be to estimate a model similar to that of winter and tawn 2016 and winter and tawn 2017 for the growth and decay of surge in time with respect to its maximum value in an extreme storm in this case the piecewise stationary model would be used to estimate the surge maximum relative to which surge decays forwards and backwards in time and the surge minimum necessary for estimating a threshold below which the surge trajectory should not extend the method introduced here is applicable to estimation of conditional characteristics of in principle arbitrary numbers of environmental variables it can be used for specification of associated design conditions for e g wind speed or peak wave period given extreme h s and in the construction of design contours e g huseby et al 2015 vanem 2017 the method is currently being used to estimate

23534,characterising storm surge in extreme sea states is important in offshore design here we estimate key surge design characteristics such as the maximum surge observed during a storm event of given extreme storm severity and covariates such as storm direction inferences are made using a simple non stationary implementation of the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 comprising a set of coupled piecewise stationary marginal and dependence models defined on a partition of the covariate domain the approach uses samples consisting of pairs of values for peaks over threshold of a conditioning variate namely storm peak significant wave height and the corresponding peaks over threshold of an associated value of a key surge characteristic each pair is allocated to a particular storm direction covariate interval and all pairs within the same interval are assumed to exhibit common stationary marginal and conditional extreme value behaviour non stationary marginal extreme value characteristics for each variate are estimated using maximum roughness penalised generalised pareto likelihood estimation over covariate intervals extremal dependence between variates on a transformed standard gumbel scale is then estimated using maximum roughness penalised likelihood estimation for a conditional extremes model also piecewise stationary with respect to covariates sample and threshold uncertainties are quantified using a bootstrapping scheme marginal and conditional return value distributions estimated using numerical integration incorporate these uncertainties from offshore radar based measurements at locations in the northern central and southern north sea we observe that characteristics of surge and significant wave height vary with wave direction at all locations surge is a larger contributor to extreme seas in the southern north sea than in the northern north sea in particular there is evidence that extremal dependence between surge characteristics and significant wave height also varies with storm direction hence the size of surge contribution to return values of total water level also varies with storm direction and location keywords surge significant wave height conditional extremes non stationary return value 1 introduction the total extreme water level tewl at a location during a storm event determines whether waves will impact topsides and supporting beams of an offshore structure at that location causing large structural loads of considerable concern since tewl is the sum of mean sea level tide storm surge and wave crest elevation a joint model for extremes of all of these components is required in order to predict its extremal characteristics well the physics of mean sea level tide and surge has been studied for decades e g pugh 1987 as has that of wind waves e g kinsman 2012 considerable attention has also been devoted to estimation of storm surge during tropical storms e g needham et al 2015 and extra tropical storms e g bernier and thompson 2006 and the interaction between surge and tide e g horsburgh and wilson 2007 olbert et al 2013 williams et al 2016 physically storm surge is a large scale increase in sea level due to a storm lasting from hours to days over areas of hundreds of km2 the magnitude of storm surge is influenced by many physical processes and those same processes control surge in both extra tropical and tropical cyclones atmospheric pressure differences in ocean storms cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of relatively low atmospheric pressure harris 1963 estimated an increase in sea level of the order of 1 cm for every hpa reduction in atmospheric pressure high wind stress at the sea surface and the horizontal gradient of atmospheric pressure are other important contributors as is storm intensity and trajectory in shallow and coastal waters bathymetry and topography become important in regions of high tidal range the joint occurrence of storm and tidal high water is sometimes referred to as storm tide the slosh model of hurricane surge jelesnianski et al 1992 predicts the maximum envelope of water at a location given hurricane characteristics such as central pressure storm size forward motion track and maximum sustained winds however the slosh model does not explicitly model the aggregate impact of surge and crest bernier and thompson 2006 seeks to predict the frequency of storm surges and extreme sea levels in the north west atlantic using a 2 d non linear barotropic ocean model to construct a 40 year hindcast for the region where tide surge interactions exist they lead to lower total water levels than in the case of independence the degree of decrease varies with extent of dependence magnitude of surge peak at a particular phase of tide and the distribution of peaks over a tidal cycle coles and tawn 2005a identify strong seasonal effects in measurements of extreme surges at locations on the eastern coastline of the united kingdom subsequently coles and tawn 2005b propose a bayesian model for extreme surge and outline a procedure to estimate the distribution of the sum of surge and tide the effect of future climate on north sea storm surge is also of considerable interest e g gaslikova et al 2013 vousdoukas et al 2017 butler et al 2007a conduct trend estimation in synthetic storm surges butler et al 2007b reports extreme value analysis of decadal variation in storm surges including a discussion of the effect of north atlantic oscillation and tide surge interaction the joint statistics of extreme storm surge and sea state severity at an arbitrary location in the ocean has also received some attention e g hawkes et al 2002 rueda et al 2016 mazas and hamm 2017 the objective of the current work is to establish a statistical model for surge characteristics conditional on the occurrence of extreme values of significant wave height h s methods of multivariate extreme value analysis are required to describe the joint characteristics of extremes of multiple variables the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 provides a flexible estimation framework given that the characteristics of extreme h s at a location vary systematically with covariates such as storm direction it is likely that the joint statistics of surge and h s are non stationary with respect to covariates extensions to the conditional extremes model such as jonathan et al 2014 allow estimation of multivariate extremal dependence in the presence of covariates and hence estimation of tails of distributions of structure variables and design contours of interest the conditional extremes model is motivated by an asymptotic form for the limiting conditional distribution of one or more conditioned random variables given a large value of a conditioning variable an outline of the approach is given by jonathan et al 2010 in application to wave spectral characteristics conditions for the asymptotic argument to hold have been explored by heffernan and resnick 2007 an alternative to the conditional extremes model is a suitable extreme value copula e g gudendorf and segers 2010 bender et al 2014 and serafin and ruggiero 2014 propose bivariate extreme value models incorporating non stationary marginal and dependence inference the main advantage of the conditional extremes model compared with models such as those of bender et al 2014 and serafin and ruggiero 2014 is that the former incorporates a full class of asymptotic extremal dependence and also allows relatively straightforward extension to higher dimensions the layout of the article is as follows section 2 introduces the north sea application and illustrates the data used in this work section 3 describes the piecewise stationary extreme value model mathematical detail corresponding to the model are given in the appendix a conditional model for surge characteristics given extreme storm peak h s is established in section 4 section 5 provides discussion and conclusions 2 motivating application data for the current work comes from two sources the first is measurements of sea surface elevation at four offshore platforms in the north sea using saab rex wave radars measurements were taken at one location in the northern and central north sea and two locations in the southern north sea henceforth referred to as nns cns sns1 and sns2 for brevity at each location harmonic analysis of surface elevation time series identified mean sea level tidal variation and a non tidal residual component interpreted as surge in the current work see e g pugh 1987 significant wave height h s for sea states of 30 min duration was also estimated from the surface elevation time series between 12 and 16 years of measurements were available each of the nns cns sns1 and sns2 locations the second data source is the wam north sea hindcast reistad et al 2009 from which time series of wave direction corresponding to the surface elevation time series at the four locations were extracted knowledge of wave direction is essential for reasonable characterisation of extreme storms in the north sea wave direction is used as a covariate in the analysis below time series of sea state h s was then used to identify storm events following the approach described in ewans and jonathan 2008 a total of between 1000 and 1100 storms were isolated at each of the nns cns sns1 and sns2 locations for each storm event a storm peak h s b wave direction at the time of storm peak referred to as storm peak direction θ and c time series of surge for the duration of the storm referred to the surge trajectory were isolated fig 1 shows typical surge trajectories for each of the four locations the relative importance of surge effects is known to vary between the four locations in the northern north sea surge generally makes a small contribution to severe seas whereas the surge contribution is generally larger in the southern north sea fig 1 suggests that the magnitude of surge increases with decreasing latitude in the north sea the relative importance of surge in the estimation of tewl is therefore clearly greater for locations sns1 and sns2 fig 1 also shows that the lengths of storms and hence of surge trajectories varies considerably within and between locations moreover it is clear that the time of maximum surge does not typically coincide with the time of peak storm severity corresponding to zero on the x axis in fig 1 for simplicity each surge trajectory was next summarised in terms of four statistics for subsequent extreme value analysis namely the maximum value srgmxm the negative of the minimum value srgngtmnm the median value srgmdn and the range srgrng of values per surge trajectory we chose to model the negative of minimum surge since this shows non negative dependence with increasing storm severity storm peak h s is known to vary with storm peak direction θ and the importance of accommodating this non stationary in extreme value models has been established for this reason each bivariate sample of storm peak h s and surge characteristic was partitioned by inspection of plots and consideration of likely fetch effects into covariate intervals or directional sector for the current covariate within which distributions of storm peak h s and surge characteristic were found to be approximately stationary fig 2 shows scatter plots of the maximum surge srgmxm observed per storm event against storm peak h s per covariate interval for each of the four locations four covariate intervals were used for the nns location and three elsewhere there are noteworthy differences between the characteristics of the various scatter plots for sns2 srgmxm increases with storm peak h s for directional sector 240 0 to values above 1 m however for the other two directional sectors the mean value of srgmxm corresponding to large h s appears to be around zero fig 3 shows scatter plots of srgrng on storm peak h s per directional sector per location again there are differences between scatter plots due to location and storm direction extreme value analysis of the samples of srgmxm srgngtmnm srgmdn srgrng storm peak h s and direction θ per location is discussed in section 4 3 the piecewise stationary extreme value model overview consider a sample d y i 1 y i 2 i 1 n of n pairs of values of peaks over threshold for a conditioning variate y 1 0 and an associated conditioned variate y 2 0 further let x i i 1 n be the corresponding values of a covariate x on some domain x in this work we assume a single directional covariate with x 0 360 extension to more complex covariate domains is straightforward compared to other approaches as discussed in section 5 our objective using the sample is to make inferences about joint structure of y 1 and y 2 for large values of y 1 and likely non stationarity with respect to x x the modelling procedure presented here is a refinement of the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 and proceeds in four steps a marginal extreme value modelling of y 1 and y 2 given x followed by b transformation to y 1 and y 2 given x with standard marginal distributions c dependence modelling of y 2 y 1 x for large y 1 and d estimation of return values of y 2 y 1 x for large y 1 the procedure is outlined here first for the general non stationary case then for the particular form of non stationarity assumed in the piecewise stationary model we then elaborate on the four stages individually for the piecewise stationary model in sections 3 1 3 3 mathematical details are provided in the appendix 3 1 general non stationary case we estimate a marginal generalised pareto model non stationary with respect to x for threshold exceedances for each of y 1 and y 2 for general variable y and threshold ψ 0 the generalised pareto cumulative distribution function is f g p y ξ σ ψ ℙ y y y ψ x x 1 1 ξ σ y ψ 1 ξ with ξ ℝ σ 0 a n d y ψ y where y ψ σ ξ when ξ 0 and otherwise in practice threshold ψ might correspond to a local quantile of the sample given covariate with specified non exceedance probability τ 0 1 estimated using non stationary quantile regression in practice plots of parameter estimates from models corresponding to different thresholds aid the selection of τ per variable showing appropriate behaviour including approximate stability of the estimate of ξ for thresholds larger than the chosen τ parameter estimates for ξ σ and ψ per variable are all in general functions of covariate x fitted marginal models are used to transform the variables y 1 and y 2 to y 1 and y 2 on standard gumbel scale and hence sample d to d using the probability integral transform then we fit a conditional extremes model for y 2 y 1 x for various choices of high threshold ϕ ℝ for the conditioning variate y 1 retaining the estimated model parameters and residuals ϕ is typically a quantile of the standard gumbel distribution with non exceedance probability κ 0 1 plots of model parameter estimates and residual distributions for different threshold choices aid selection of κ consistent with modelling assumptions the conditional extremes model form is y 2 y 1 y x x α y y β w for y ϕ where α 0 1 and β 1 w is a random variable with unknown distribution the density of which we estimate using residuals from the fitted model for fitting purposes only we assume that w n μ ζ 2 with μ ℝ and ζ 2 0 the model fitting procedure corresponds to estimating α β μ ζ given a sample of values for y 1 y 2 x and threshold ϕ all of ϕ α β μ and ζ are in general functions of covariate x using the marginal and conditional extremes models for the distribution of threshold exceedances and empirical sample based distributions for non exceedances numerical integration is used to estimate the distribution of y 2 y 1 x for large y 1 and hence that of y 2 y 1 x for large values of y 1 this permits estimation of the conditional return value distribution namely the distribution of y 2 given occurrences of the t year return values of y 1 3 2 piecewise stationary case the piecewise stationary model uses this approach for a particularly simple description of non stationarity with respect to covariates in marginal and dependence models for each observation in the sample the value of covariate x i is used to allocate the observation to one and only one of m covariate intervals c k k 1 m by means of an allocation vector a such that k a i and x c k for each k all observations in the set y 1 i y 2 i a i k with the same covariate interval c k are assumed to have common joint extreme value characteristics 3 3 marginal extremes and transformation to gumbel scale non stationary marginal extreme value characteristics of each variate are estimated in turn using a generalised pareto model and cross validated roughness penalised maximum likelihood estimation as outlined below and in the appendix for variable j 1 2 and covariate interval c k the extreme value threshold ψ j k 0 is assumed to be a quantile of the empirical distribution of the variate in that interval with specified non exceedance probability τ j 0 1 with τ j constant across intervals and estimated by counting threshold exceedances are assumed to follow the generalised pareto distribution with shape ξ j ℝ and scale σ j k 0 with cumulative distribution function f g p y ξ j σ j k ψ j k 1 1 ξ j σ j k y ψ j k 1 ξ j where y ψ j k y j k with y j k ψ j k σ j k ξ j when ξ j 0 and otherwise since estimation of shape parameter is particularly problematic ξ j is assumed constant but unknown across covariate intervals and the reasonableness of the assumption assessed by inspection of diagnostic plots parameters ξ j σ j k are estimated by maximising the predictive performance of a roughness penalised model optimally regulating the extent to which σ j k varies across interval using a cross validation procedure equations for marginal model estimation are given in the appendix the standard gumbel distribution has cumulative distribution function f g y exp exp y for y ℝ we transform the non stationary sample d y i 1 y i 2 on generalised pareto scale to the corresponding stationary standard gumbel sample d y i 1 y i 2 using the probability integral transform by defining y i 1 y i 2 such that f g y i j f g p y i j ξ j σ j a i ψ j a i per covariate interval the transformed sample is then assumed to be a stationary sample from a standard gumbel distribution estimation of marginal extreme value models for the north sea application is discussed in section 4 1 we note that transformation to laplace scale provides a useful alternative to gumbel transformation especially when considering negative tail dependence e g keef et al 2013 3 4 conditional extremes the gumbel scale sample d y i 1 y i 2 above some threshold of the conditioning variate y 1 is used to estimate a conditional extremes model with parameters α k 0 1 and β 1 given by y 2 y 1 y i 1 α a i y i 1 y i 1 β w for y ϕ where w n μ ζ 2 with μ ℝ and ζ 2 0 is assumed for model estimation only threshold ϕ ℝ is defined as the quantile of the standard gumbel distribution with non exceedance probability κ 0 1 note that since identifying β is particularly problematic it is assumed constant but unknown across covariate intervals similarly since they are intended to describe a generic residual structure both μ and ζ 2 are also assumed to be stationary with respect to covariate once more the reasonableness of these modelling assumptions is assessed by inspection of diagnostic plots estimation of the conditional extremes model for the north sea application is discussed in section 4 2 3 5 marginal and conditional return values from an engineering perspective the main inferences from the current analysis are estimates for marginal and conditional return values corresponding to some long return period t typically these are obtained by monte carlo simulation under the models outlined in sections 3 1 and 3 2 specifying a monte carlo scheme even for relatively complex simulations is generally straightforward when t is small of the order of 100 years say simulation is also computationally easy monte carlo estimation might therefore be preferred when t is large however with t 10 7 years of interest for some analysis monte carlo simulation becomes computationally tedious and demanding in these circumstances numerical integration schemes yield dramatic reductions in the computational complexity of return value estimation as outlined in ross et al 2017 specification of the numerical integration scheme usually requires some effort as illustrated in the appendix for the current work but computationally this effort pays dividends we use numerical integration to estimate cumulative distribution functions for marginal and conditional return values as follows we estimate a the marginal return value distributions f m 1 k and f m 2 k for a t year return period of y 1 and y 2 per covariate interval c k b the corresponding omni directional return value distributions f m 1 and f m 2 over all covariate intervals c the conditional return value distribution f 2 m 1 k of y 2 given the occurrence of a t year event of y 1 in covariate interval c k and d the conditional return value distribution f 2 m 1 of y 2 given the occurrence of an omni directional t year event of y 1 regardless of the covariate interval in which the t year event of y 1 occurs details of the numerical integration schemes used to estimate a d are given in the appendix estimates of the different return value distributions for the north sea application are illustrated in section 4 3 3 6 uncertainty quantification in practice the complete modelling procedure is repeated for n b s bootstrap resamples d b of the original sample d to capture sampling uncertainty for each sample d b to capture marginal threshold specification uncertainty marginal models for y 1 y 2 are evaluated for marginal thresholds ψ 1 ψ 2 with non exceedance probabilities τ 1 τ 2 drawn at random from the intervals i τ 1 i τ 2 both 0 1 on which model performance is deemed reasonable from inspection of diagnostics following transformation to standard gumbel scale sample d b to capture conditional threshold uncertainty a conditional extremes model is then evaluated for dependence threshold ϕ with non exceedance probabilities κ drawn at random from interval i κ 0 1 on which the conditional model fit is deemed adequate computationally thus the estimate for each marginal and dependence parameter corresponds to a n b s array of values capturing sampling and threshold specification uncertainty used for uncertainty quantification in parameter and return value inference as described in the appendix 4 application to north sea locations the characteristics of srgmxm srgngtmnm srgmdn and srgrng given large values of storm peak h s and direction θ per location are estimated using the piecewise stationary model for brevity the analysis procedure from section 3 is described in sections 4 1 and 4 2 and illustrated in figs 4 10 and fig 12 for the case of srgmxm at the cns location only estimates for marginal and conditional return value distributions are discussed in section 4 3 and illustrated in fig 11 for all surge characteristics at all locations further since the analysis involves storm peak significant wave height as opposed to significant wave height for individual sea states we use h s to indicate storm peak significant wave height unless clearly indicated to the contrary 4 1 marginal extremes we conduct conditional extreme value analysis of srgmxm and storm peak h s non stationary with respect to storm peak direction θ as outlined in section 3 the first stage of analysis involves marginal extreme value modelling for h s and srgmxm illustrated in fig 4 to facilitate this covariate intervals were selected within which the joint characteristics of srgmxm and h s were observed from inspection of diagnostic plots to be approximately stationary in this case the three covariate intervals selected correspond approximately to the land shadow of the united kingdom θ 160 270 open water to the atlantic and norwegian seas θ 270 40 and the land shadow of the european mainland from norway to france θ 40 160 the piecewise stationary generalised pareto model is applied independently to threshold exceedances for each variable with thresholds per variable specified as quantiles of the marginal distribution per directional interval of θ with non exceedance probabilities τ 1 i τ 1 and τ 2 i τ 2 intervals i τ 1 i τ 2 were specified by inspection of diagnostic plots for model adequacy over a wide range of values of τ e g fig 7 as discussed below fig 4 a d show estimated thresholds for h s and srgmxm in terms of bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty bands over n b s 500 bootstrap resamples of the original sample with i τ 1 0 7 0 8 and i τ 2 0 65 0 75 the original sample is shown in terms of threshold exceedances black and non exceedances grey for h s there appears to be little variability in threshold level across covariate intervals the largest two h s events correspond to storms emanating from the east the threshold for srgmxm shows clearer directional variability surge effects are larger when storms emanate from approximately the south and are smaller for storms from the east for each bootstrap resample of each variable generalised pareto models are estimated fig 4 b e give bootstrap distributions for the estimated generalised pareto shape parameter ξ set constant with respect to θ for storm peak h s ξ is centred at approximately 0 15 but for srgmxm the bootstrap distribution is centred at approximately zero indicating that the distribution of srgmxm has a longer tail than that of h s fig 4 c f show the estimate for generalised pareto scale parameter σ in terms of its bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty band per covariate interval for h s the estimate for σ is larger in the covariate interval corresponding to largest values of h s for srgmxm the estimate of σ is lower in the sector corresponding to smaller values of srgmxm to confirm model fit tail diagnostic plots such as those illustrated in figs 5 and 6 for h s and srgmxm are inspected fig 5 shows that the tail of empirical distribution of h s from the sample is in agreement with the estimated generalised pareto tail represented in terms of a bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty band for each covariate interval and omni directionally over all covariate intervals in the bottom right hand plot of fig 5 it is important also to establish that the estimate for generalised pareto shape ξ is approximately constant with threshold for all thresholds corresponding to intervals i τ 1 i τ 2 fig 7 shows this variation for the srgmxm model as a function of threshold non exceedance probability τ 2 for values of τ 2 0 65 0 75 the estimate of ξ appears to be constant for larger values of τ 2 to within bootstrap uncertainty for this reason we set i τ 2 0 65 75 for marginal modelling of srgmxm at the cns location diagnostic plots such as those illustrated in figs 5 7 were inspected to confirm adequacy of marginal fits for h s and all surge characteristics at all locations 4 2 conditional extremes for each bootstrap resample d b of the original sample d and random choices of τ 1 i τ 1 and τ 2 i τ 2 marginal models for srgmxm and h s are estimated and used to transform the resample to standard gumbel scale as explained in section 3 the gumbel scale sample d b is then used to estimate the conditional extremes model for thresholds of the conditioning variate corresponding with non exceedance probabilities κ i κ inspection of fit residuals fig 8 and parameter stability with κ fig 10 suggested setting i κ 0 55 0 65 for srgmxm on h s at the cns location with this choice the characteristics of residuals r h see appendix are illustrated in fig 8 the left hand panel suggests that residuals are centred around zero with a unimodal distribution showing a longer right hand tail the right hand panel suggests that the distribution of residuals is approximately stationary with respect to θ these diagnostic plots suggest that the piecewise stationary model framework with β μ and ζ constant with respect to θ is reasonable parameter estimates for the conditional extremes model are shown in fig 9 only slope parameter α α k varies between intervals in the piecewise stationary model the top left panel summarises α in terms of bootstrap median and 95 uncertainty bands per as a function of θ there is evidence that α is lower for the covariate interval 45 150 corresponding to the land shadow of mainland europe than elsewhere the estimate of α is considerably less than unity everywhere suggesting that srgmxm and h s show asymptotic independence e g eastoe et al 2013 the estimate of scale exponent parameter β is centred around 0 3 suggesting that the width of the distribution of srgmxm given h s increases with increasing h s residual mean μ and scale ζ are centred around 0 2 and 1 1 fig 10 explores the stability of estimates for α k and β as a function of conditional extremes threshold non exceedance probability κ i κ estimates for α k in each covariate interval and β are all stationary to within bootstrap uncertainty suggesting that a reasonable choice of i κ has been made 4 3 marginal and conditional return values using the numerical integration approach outlined in section 3 3 and the appendix marginal and conditional return values were estimated for a t 100 year return period the left hand panel of fig 11 gives estimates for the marginal omni directional 100 year return value distribution f m 1 of storm peak h s at each of the nns red cns green sns1 cyan and sns2 purple locations the median 100 year return value is approximately 15 m for nns 12 m for cns and 4 m for sns1 and sns2 as might be expected the return value distributions are of course rather broad reflecting both inherent aleatory uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty estimated by bootstrapping for example we would not be too surprised to observe 100 year return values of storm peak h s at the nns location in excess of 17 m the centre and right hand panels of the figure give the corresponding omni directional marginal f m 2 solid and conditional f 2 m 1 dashed return value estimates one panel for each of the four surge characteristics of interest for srgmxm top centre of fig 11 marginal surge is greatest in the southern north sea with median 100 year values approaching 2 m compared with approximately 1 m at cns and 0 5 m at nns these observations are consistent with the trends in fig 2 and physical intuition it is noteworthy however that the conditional distribution of srgmxm given the occurrence of omni directional 100 year h s yields considerably lower estimates for nns and cns the median conditional surge is approximately zero however for sns the median conditional surge remains at around 1 5 m approximately 80 of the marginal 100 year maximum surge of 1 8 m this demonstrates that consideration of surge and conditional surge in particular is much more important for design in extreme seas of this region of the north sea characteristics of the corresponding return value distributions for srgmdn srgngtmnm and srgrng are generally rather similar of particular interest is the fact that the conditional distributions of srgngtmnm at sns1 and sns2 are considerably to the left of corresponding marginal distributions this is not the case for other surge characteristics fig 11 shows that differences exist between omni directional marginal and corresponding conditional return value distributions fig 12 illustrates at the cns location that directional marginal and conditional return value distributions have interesting differences also the top panel for the figure gives directional marginal return value distributions f m 1 k for storm peak h s for t 100 years together with the omni directional distribution f m 1 black the omni directional return value almost coincides with the directional distribution for the θ 45 150 covariate interval return values for the two remaining covariate intervals are smaller the second panel shows that the omni directional return value distribution for srgmxm has large contributions from all covariate intervals except for θ 45 150 this has an interesting effect on the location of the omni directional conditional return value distribution dashed black because the most severe storms correspond to θ 45 150 for which srgmxm is relatively small the omni directional conditional return value distribution is itself similar to that for the 45 150 covariate interval with median value around 0 1 m however the conditional return value distributions of srgmxm for covariate intervals 270 45 and 150 270 are considerably to the right of the omni directional conditional distribution informally we might interpret this information for design in the following manner for estimation of tewl ignoring mean sea level and tide omni directionally h s has a 100 year median of around 11 3 m to which a median associated srgmxm contribution of 0 1 m is added yielding tewl of 11 4 m however for the 270 45 covariate interval h s has a median return value of approximately 10 0 m to which a median associated srgmxm contribution of 0 5 m is added yielding tewl of 10 5 m that is srgmxm makes a greater associated contribution to tewl in covariate interval 270 45 than it does omni directionally we also see informally that naive addition of median omni directional marginal h s of around 11 3 m to median omni directional marginal srgmxm of around 1 1 m yields tewl of 12 4 m this estimate is 1 0 m larger that the more realistic estimate based on median marginal h s and median associated srgmxm 5 discussion and conclusions in this work we examine the statistical properties of storm surge in extreme north sea storms using a non stationary conditional extreme value model consisting of a set of coupled piecewise stationary models on a partition of the domain of a storm direction covariate we find evidence for variation of marginal and conditional extreme surge characteristics with storm direction and location in particular we provide an efficient numerical integration algorithm to estimate marginal and conditional return value distributions of surge characteristics sampling and threshold selection uncertainties are incorporated within inferences using a bootstrapping scheme the piecewise stationary model appears to be adequate in terms of its complexity for the samples examined here the whole modelling procedure can be completed for one surge characteristic at one location in approximately 5 min the approach requires specification of covariate partition c k prior to analysis in the current work choice of covariate partition boundaries was informed by inspection of data and elementary physical understanding of likely directional effects on significant wave height and surge at each location sensitivity of inferences to small changes in locations of partition boundaries was investigated empirically and found generally to be small an improved procedure for specification of the covariate partition could be considered including estimation of the partition boundaries and in principle the number of boundaries as part of the extreme value inference this was not attempted here to avoid introducing undue complexity in model estimation extension of the piecewise stationary model to higher p dimensional covariates p 1 is relatively straightforward simply define c k as a partition of the covariate domain in p dimensions for the typical size n and quality of samples available for analysis identification of models with p 2 is likely to be problematic we anticipate that inclusion of season at covariate may be of benefit currently the marginal directional threshold for h s effectively eliminates all but winter storms adopting a directional seasonal threshold and piecewise stationary model might provide the opportunity to examine seasonality in more detail inferences concerning key surge characteristics such as srgmxm srgmdn and srgngtmnm can be used to forecast a complete surge trajectory s t for some interval of time t corresponding to an extreme storm with specified storm peak h s and direction θ we might choose to do this by adjusting a historical surge trajectory s t for a storm with similar h s and θ linearly using s t s o s t s o s s o s s o s t s o s o s t s o s o s s s o s t s o where s s o and s are negative srgngtmnm srgmdn and srgmxm for the selected historical surge trajectory and s s o and s are the corresponding quantities for the forecast surge trajectory estimated jointly using the piecewise stationary model an alternative strategy would be to estimate a model similar to that of winter and tawn 2016 and winter and tawn 2017 for the growth and decay of surge in time with respect to its maximum value in an extreme storm in this case the piecewise stationary model would be used to estimate the surge maximum relative to which surge decays forwards and backwards in time and the surge minimum necessary for estimating a threshold below which the surge trajectory should not extend the method introduced here is applicable to estimation of conditional characteristics of in principle arbitrary numbers of environmental variables it can be used for specification of associated design conditions for e g wind speed or peak wave period given extreme h s and in the construction of design contours e g huseby et al 2015 vanem 2017 the method is currently being used to estimate

likelihood penalised for the roughness of σ j k across intervals is then ℓ j log e ℓ j λ σ j 1 m k 1 m σ j k 1 m k 1 m σ j k 2 where ℓ j is a function of both τ and roughness coefficient λ σ j for given τ and λ σ j estimates for marginal model parameters ξ j and σ j k are found by minimising ℓ j a random 10 fold cross validation is then used to select the value λ ˆ σ j of λ σ j and corresponding ξ ˆ j σ ˆ j k which for each τ j maximise predictive performance these parameter estimates are used for subsequent inference note that the hat notation is suppressed below in reference to the use of estimates of marginal parameters for subsequent inference conditional extreme value model continuing from section 3 2 since w is assumed to be gaussian distributed for fitting the

represented empirically by the sample r h of n r residuals from the fit r h y h 1 β ˆ y h 2 α ˆ a h y h 1 for all h such that y h 1 ϕ in particular the cumulative distribution function of w is assumed to be f w w 1 n r h i r h w where i is an indicator function returning unity when its argument is true and zero otherwise marginal return value estimation continuing from section 3 3 let f j k y be the cumulative distribution function of a storm peak event y j in covariate interval c k for response indexed by j 1 2 for threshold non exceedance probability τ j this is estimated as f j k y τ j f e

is the probability density function of m 1 which can be seen by differentiation of the cumulative distribution function f m j y given in the previous section to be f m 1 y 1 k f m 1 k y 1 k k f m 1 k y 1 the k th term in the square brackets above corresponds to the occurrence of m 1 y 1 in the k th covariate interval c k to see this informally note that this event requires m 1 k y 1 and m 1 k y 1 for k k the corresponding probability is f m 1 k y 1 d y 1 k k f m 1 k y 1 the expression for f 2 m 1 y 2 now becomes f 2 m 1 y 2 y 1 k ℙ y 2 y 2 m 1 y 1 f m 1 k y 1 k k f m 1 k y 1 d y 1 y 1 k ℙ y 2
